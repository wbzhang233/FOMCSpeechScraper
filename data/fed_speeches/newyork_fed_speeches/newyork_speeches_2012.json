        "content": "Good morning, I am pleased to be at Pace University to address the university community of students, alumni, faculty and university supporters.  It is always a pleasure to speak with academic audiences who I find to be particularly well-informed and attentive. I thank you for inviting me here today.  In a timely note, I also want to commend Pace University for fielding an excellent Fed Challenge team this year.  As many of you know, Pace won the Second District College Fed Challenge this year and has just returned with an honorable mention from competing in the nationals at the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C.  \n\nToday, I want to talk a bit about the Fed—what we do and why we do it. Then I’ll provide some thoughts about the national and local economic outlook and monetary policy. \n\n In covering the region and the nation, I will discuss the terrible impact of Sandy on the region and the implications for the national economy. I know I will fall short in fully acknowledging all the hardship that our fellow citizens have endured—including devastating losses of loved ones, homes, communities and livelihoods—as well as widespread misery caused by flooding and disruptions to power, fuel, food, transportation and other services across the region.  Nor will I be able to fully commend the ways in which family members, neighbors, co-workers and strangers have helped those in need. I am deeply moved by the evidence of people reaching out and pulling together across the region.  \n\nAt the New York Fed we are committed to supporting the recovery process. In addition to our economic analysis, we are convening our advisory groups and other regional contacts to receive first-hand accounts of the impact on communities, families and businesses and to assess other ways in which we may help. For example, we are holding a clinic in Staten Island to help people obtain information about different types of financial support that is available. We’re also encouraging banks to show appropriate flexibility when dealing with small business and other borrowers impacted by the storm. \n\nAfter my remarks, I’ll be happy to answer any questions you have about what the Fed does and why, and about the economic outlook. But I won’t comment specifically on the upcoming FOMC meeting next month. \n\nAs always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee, also known as the FOMC.\n\n What the New York Fed Does\nBy way of introduction, I will briefly review what my colleagues and I do at the New York Fed. The New York Fed is one of 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks that, together with the Board of Governors in Washington D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System, our nation’s central bank. \n\nThe Federal Reserve is independent within our government. By law, we are charged with managing the nation’s monetary policy—taking actions that raise or lower interest rates to promote full employment and price stability. The Federal Reserve is also charged with promoting financial stability, without which we cannot achieve our economic objectives. We play an important role in the nation’s payments and settlements system, which some people call the financial system’s “plumbing.”  For example, we help ensure that banks’ ATMs have cash and that the checks you write move the money to the recipient. In addition, we have a specific mandate to promote economic development in each of our regions. \n\nAs president of the New York Fed, I serve as the vice chair of the FOMC, the Federal Reserve committee that meets eight times a year in Washington to set interest rates and make decisions about monetary policy.  The members of this committee all strive to achieve our statutory mandate of full employment and price stability.  Sometimes we have different views on the specific policy choices at hand, and our policy decisions reflect a full discussion of these differences. This diversity of viewpoints is a key strength of the FOMC. \n\nIn fact, I believe we make better decisions as a committee because we don't all think alike. But we are united in our commitment to our dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment and price stability and in our belief that preserving the independence of the Federal Reserve in making monetary policy decisions is very much in the public interest. That independence allows us to make tough decisions based on data and analysis—insulated from short-term political considerations.\n\nAt FOMC meetings, each Committee member presents a current outlook for his or her District and for the nation. In formulating these assessments, we consult with many sources—our boards of directors, regional advisory councils, community leaders and other key stakeholders.  My meeting with you today is part of this systematic effort to understand what is going on at the grassroots level of our economy.\n\nTo add to what I learn from my conversations, my colleagues and I at the New York Fed continually track conditions in our District, and we have created special tools for that purpose. For example, my staff tracks local household credit conditions, including the amount and type of personal debt and whether repayments are timely. \n\nWe also conduct a periodic poll about the credit needs of small businesses, which are an important source of new jobs in the District. If you represent a small business and would like to participate in our next poll, please pass your card to my colleagues, who are in the audience, or see me after the speech. \n\nTo promote growth in our local communities, we publish extensive data and analysis on the local economy. We provide outreach initiatives, including workshops on access to global markets and to help small businesses learn about loan programs and sources of credit enhancements. We also run an annual video festival for local college and university students. In this program student teams produce videos that aim to help young adults make sound personal financial decisions. A panel of advertising and video professionals selects winning video productions for screening in local movie theaters. \n\nAs you know, even regions as wealthy as ours have large pockets of poverty. So, we target some of our work specifically to low- and moderate-income groups. \n\nWe have worked hard to help neighborhoods that face high foreclosure rates. This fall we hosted a conference on distressed residential real estate to share new expert analysis with senior policymakers and practitioners from across the nation. Later today, colleagues from our Research department will provide a press briefing on the housing outlook in our region as a whole. Next week, we will be holding a workshop so we can better understand the factors that are limiting the pass-through of lower yields on agency mortgage bonds into primary mortgage rates offered to borrowers.  We will then be in a better position to evaluate what steps if any might be taken by the relevant authorities to contribute to greater pass-through.  \n\nRegional Economic Conditions\nOur region's economy was on a moderate upward trajectory before Sandy struck, and while the storm had many severe effects—more on that in a few minutes—I do not expect it to derail the region’s ongoing economic expansion.  \n\nNew York City's economy has been performing quite well.  Employment in the city reached an all-time high at the beginning of this year and it has continued to grow briskly since then, even without help from its key finance sector.  While job growth has been considerably more subdued in the surrounding areas, such as Long Island, northern New Jersey, Fairfield County and the lower Hudson Valley, many workers in these areas commute to New York City for their jobs, so the strength here in the city is helpful to the region as a whole. Still, the unemployment rate in the city remains high, above 9 percent, and this is something that needs to improve.  Upstate New York's economy is also on a generally positive trajectory, although some areas have fared better than others.  Albany, Buffalo, and especially, Rochester and Ithaca have recouped many of the jobs lost during the recession, whereas Syracuse and Binghamton have lagged.  \n\nLooking beyond the employment statistics, I see other encouraging signs across the region.  Housing markets here have improved.  There has also been a noticeable pickup in multi-family construction in both New York and New Jersey this year. \n\nHowever, the New York Fed's measures of regional credit conditions suggest continued financial challenges for families here.  Data that we just released for the third quarter of 2012 show that for those individuals with a credit report, average debt per person in New Jersey was about $61,000, and about $49,000 in the state of New York. Overall debt per person peaked in 2008.  Although balances nationally have fallen by over 11 percent, consumers in New York and New Jersey have brought down their indebtedness more moderately, by 5 percent and 6 percent respectively. \n\nWhile the overall delinquency rates are decreasing nationally, delinquent balances in our region have remained stable or even increased a bit. In both New York and New Jersey, nearly 9 percent of balances are 90 or more days delinquent, higher than the 6.5 percent national rate.\n\nAlthough there are some recent signs that home prices are starting to firm, the housing crisis continues to take a toll on our homeowners. Delinquency rates on mortgages, at 9.4 percent and 9.7 percent in New York and New Jersey, respectively, remain considerably higher than the 5.9 percent national rate.  \n\nBefore discussing the national outlook let me talk briefly about the possible effects of “Superstorm Sandy” on the U.S. and regional economy.  The damage and disruptions from the storm appear more extensive and longer-lasting than first anticipated. \n\nOf course, there is the physical damage, which was geographically widespread, but particularly devastating in some communities right here in New York City, including Breezy Point, the Rockaways, and portions of Staten Island, and in so many cities and towns along the Long Island, New Jersey and Connecticut waterfronts, such as Long Beach, Seaside Heights, Spring Lake and Hoboken.    \n\nEstimates of the costs of disruption to economic activity—that is, services that couldn't be rendered and goods that couldn't be produced because of protracted transit shutdowns, power outages and other such damage produced by the storm—are particularly difficult to pin down.  Thus, it will be some time before concrete figures are available.  However, the early read from recently-released data confirm these disruptions have been widespread.  Every one of the New York City area firms that responded to our recent Empire State Manufacturing Survey—fielded one to two weeks after the storm—indicated that the storm disrupted activity at their firm, and 40 percent of them indicated that they were completely shut down or severely crippled for at least five days. Furthermore, the number of workers filing initial claims for unemployment insurance in both New York and New Jersey surged to more than triple their pre-storm levels in the week after Sandy hit, suggesting at least 70,000 storm-related job losses in these two states thus far.\n\nThese data suggest that the disruptions that we have seen, and continue to see, could be substantial.  We can quantify the losses in terms of days of lost output.  Given the regional GDP of $1.4 trillion, a rough calculation yields a loss of $3.8 billion for each full-day equivalent of lost output in the region.  \n\nA considerable part of this lost activity will be offset over time or be replaced by a temporary shift of activity from hard-hit areas to less-affected places. But, in a services-based economy, much activity cannot be shifted in time: restaurants, for instance, can’t serve six meals a day to make up for lost business. The fact that many people who would have dined in lower Manhattan in the weeks following Sandy are instead patronizing restaurants near their homes or near temporary work sites represents an offset for the regional economy as a whole.  But that’s little consolation for the original restaurant, which may in turn need to lay off some of its people or could even possibly go out of business. And, of course, this applies even more dramatically to businesses in hard-hit places along the regional shoreline. \n\nAgainst this, reconstruction began soon after the storm was over and has likely intensified since then.  The repair and replacement of damaged or destroyed infrastructure, homes, and businesses is likely to continue for some time. Programs will need to be well designed in order to achieve maximum beneficial impact. For instance, on the housing front, it will be important to ensure that program design and funding recognize that our region has a wide variety of housing types—including multifamily and public housing—that are in need of repair post-Sandy.  In other words, one-size-fits-all solutions may not work well here. \n\nPast studies suggest that reconstruction spending provides a powerful stimulus to local economies, both in its direct effects and its associated multiplier effects.  Thus, I expect that reconstruction will provide a similar sizeable boost to our regional economic activity, and one that is likely to continue well into 2013. \n\nAll this analysis must be viewed as early and provisional.  Putting all the factors together, at present I expect that economic activity in our region was adversely affected in October and November, but will show a noticeable rebound starting in December. \n\nIn addition to the economic costs in terms of lost activity there are, of course, the costs in terms of human suffering to the millions of people who were adversely affected—above all those who lost homes and loved ones, but also the many others who were cold and without power for days on end, spent hours getting to and from work, waited on long gas lines, and experienced the stress of not knowing what lies ahead.  \n\nWe are also tracking the impact of Sandy on schools and students. In New Jersey, 60 percent of schools were closed more than one and a half weeks. The storm shut down all New York City schools for a full week, and many schools across the region remained closed the following week. Hardships borne by students and families are also reflected in record low post-storm attendance rates. The New York City Department of Education moved quickly to relocate schools from damaged buildings to temporary premises, enabling children to resume their studies.  But even two weeks after the storm, schools that had to be relocated had attendance rates below 70 percent, a huge drop from their regular rates of over 90 percent. Research shows that lost school days and relocations can significantly impair student learning.  \n\nThe good news is that the situation is getting closer to normal every day. Today, only 9 out of a total of 1,750 New York City schools remain relocated. Also of particular importance is that their leaders—administrators, teachers, principals and others—have agreed to make up three and a half days of the lost time.  It is impressive that so many districts across the region are working hard to make up for much of the lost time. \n\nOur region must learn the right lessons from this experience. The storm revealed significant shortcomings in the resilience of our public and private infrastructures in three critical areas: power, transport and communications.  This vulnerability must be addressed. \n\nNational Economic Conditions\nTurning to the storm’s effects on the national economy, I expect a modest negative effect on the annualized growth rate of real GDP for the fourth quarter of 2012. It is impossible to calibrate this precisely at this juncture, but I would guess this would be in the region of 0.25 to 0.50 of a percentage point. It is important to note that the storm affected much of the Northeast Corridor, a densely populated area responsible for about 15 percent of GDP. Normal economic activity in the final days of October and the first few days of November was severely disrupted. The disruption then began to subside, but only recently has life begun to feel normal again. The negative effects of this disruption have already been noted in economic indicators such as industrial production for the month of October and initial claims for unemployment insurance during the second and third weeks of November.  \n\nYet, some of the economic disruption experienced here was offset to some extent by stronger than normal activity elsewhere.  For example, plants in Ohio or South Carolina making portable generators may have worked overtime to fill the increased demand.  Second, some types of disrupted activity, such as the purchase of a car or a housing start, can be made up before the fourth quarter is over. Lastly, as I mentioned before, repair and replacement of damaged property is already underway, offsetting some of the earlier disruption. This rebuilding will continue well into 2013, likely providing for somewhat stronger growth than otherwise would have been the case. Indeed, economic studies of disasters in the U.S. and other advanced economies find that the longer-term effects on national economies have typically been negligible.  Given the resilience of the U.S. economy, I expect the long-run effects of Sandy to be similarly small.   \n\nEven before the storm, though, the pace of U.S. economic growth was disappointing—averaging only slightly above a 2 percent annualized growth since the recovery began in mid-2009.  As a consequence, the national unemployment rate remains unacceptably high, and its decline during the recovery has been grudging. In addition, too many people are discouraged from looking for work. This has depressed the participation rate and held down the official unemployment rate. Moreover, 5 million workers have been unemployed for six months or more. While job growth has picked up some recently, its pace has been insufficient to materially change the labor market picture. \n\nIn terms of activity, there are a few bright spots.  For example, the growth rate of consumer spending was a bit firmer in the third quarter.  Another area showing improvement is the housing market.  Housing starts and sales of new and existing single-family homes are trending up gradually. Nationally, home prices have finally begun to rise. \n\nHowever, on a more negative note, business fixed investment spending fell some in the third quarter and new orders for nondefense capital goods suggest continued softness.  Overall, manufacturing activity remains weak. This manufacturing slump stems from slower growth abroad and uncertainties about how the fiscal cliff in Washington will be resolved. \n\nOn the inflation side of ledger, despite sharp rises in energy prices in recent months, overall inflation, as measured by year-over-year changes of the consumer price index, is still around 2 percent—significantly lower than last year. The signals from underlying inflation pressures, compensation trends, and longer-term inflation expectations are all fully consistent with our longer-run inflation objective of 2 percent. \n\nAs you all know, in September, the FOMC took additional action to promote a more robust recovery in a context of price stability—a decision that was reaffirmed in October. In addition to the $45 billion monthly purchases of longer term Treasury securities already scheduled to run through year end, the FOMC commenced buying additional mortgage-backed securities at a rate of $40 billion a month. The Committee said: “If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities, undertake additional asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability.1\n\nIn terms of rate guidance, the Committee said it anticipated that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate would likely be warranted “at least through mid-2015\"—emphasizing that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy would remain appropriate for a considerable time after the pace of the economic recovery strengthens. \n\nSo, what does “substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market” mean to me?  A key point is that I will focus on the labor market outlook, not just its current state.  Therefore, I will be looking at the growth momentum within the overall economy and a range of labor indicators, including the unemployment rate, payrolls, the participation rate, the employment to population ratio and job finding rates.  Following the framework we set out in September, I will be assessing the employment and inflation outlook in order to determine whether we should continue Treasury purchases into 2013. \n\nWe will continue to do our part to push the economy towards maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability.  Yet, it is important to recognize that our tools are not all-powerful—monetary policy is not a panacea for all that ails our economy. \n\nIn particular, Congress and the administration must address the “fiscal cliff” in a manner that creates a credible framework for long- term fiscal sustainability.  It is widely acknowledged that the large fiscal contraction associated with going “off the cliff” would drive the U.S. economy into recession.  The contractionary impact is likely to be larger than normal when monetary policy is operating at the zero lower bound for interest rates, as is the case today.  Thus, fiscal consolidation must be accomplished in a way that avoids derailing the economic recovery. The best way to do this is to craft a plan that starts small in terms of its near-term impact, then grows very substantially over time as the economy grows healthier. Of course this requires that the longer-term consolidation is truly credible. It is also important that any plan have broad bipartisan support so that that households and businesses understand that it will in fact be carried out. \n\nWe saw in the summer of 2011 when the debt ceiling limit was in play that a failure to come to grips with our nation’s economic challenges and responsibilities can have a large effect on U.S. household and business confidence. We do not want to repeat this experience at the start of 2013. \n\nMoreover, what happens will influence how we are perceived abroad.  When I meet with economic leaders across the globe they do not doubt the underlying strength and dynamism of the U.S. economy, or the entrepreneurialism and inventiveness of our people. Nor do they doubt that we have the resources and capability to overcome the challenges we face. But they do wonder whether our political system is capable of putting the national interest above partisan interests and making the tough choices needed to address these challenges. \n\nIf a credible bipartisan agreement is reached, it will strengthen global confidence in the U.S. and underscore to the world that our country remains a great place to do business and invest in. Failure would suggest a degree of political dysfunction that could undermine U.S. economic leadership and could encourage global corporations and investors to invest elsewhere. \n\nMake no mistake: Credible fiscal consolidation will not be painless, no matter what form it takes.  The burden will be felt across many sectors of the economy and we must expect that the resulting fiscal drag will exert some restraint on economic growth.   \n\nNevertheless, there is no reason why a carefully crafted plan would need to put the economic recovery at risk.  A credible plan, after all, would likely have very positive effects on confidence.  In particular, I believe that business investment would respond positively to a credible plan.  More generally, reducing uncertainty over future tax rates, entitlements and other spending programs has to be a positive development in terms of reducing uncertainty that can constrain economic activity.  By clarifying the rules of the road, a credible fiscal plan is likely to reduce the incentive of households and businesses to delay spending and investment. This would likely offset fiscal drag to a meaningful degree.  \n\nConclusion\nTo sum up, while it is still too early for a precise estimate of the economic impact of Sandy, I expect a negative impact on fourth quarter national and regional economic growth, but a minimal long run effect nationally and regionally.  This has happened during a period where too many people remain without the jobs that they need to help support their families and themselves. Although the economy continues to expand, we must grow faster if we are to put all of our jobless workers and idle businesses back to work. Meanwhile, price increases are likely to be at or slightly below our 2 percent longer-run objective over the next few years. \n\nMany parts of our region were showing a stronger pace of growth than the country as a whole before the storms hit—and I am hopeful that Sandy will not have pushed us off this trajectory for long. The recovery of housing markets are important part of this renewed growth, although certain communities are still weighed down by lingering high rates of delinquencies and foreclosures and some others have suffered appalling damage from Sandy.  \n\nGoing forward, let me reiterate that the Fed will promote maximum employment and price stability to the greatest extent our tools permit, and we will stay the course. When we achieve a stronger recovery in the context of price stability, I’ll view it as consistent with our goals and not a reason to pull back on our policies prematurely. If you’re trying to get a car moving that is stuck in the mud, you don’t stop pushing the moment the wheels start turning—you keep pushing until the car is rolling and is clearly free. \n\nThank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n1September 12-13, 2012 Federal Open Market Committee statement."

        "content": "It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak here today. I am glad to see the progress our city and region have made recovering from Sandy, but obviously significant challenges remain.\n\nI am going to focus my remarks today on what is popularly known as the “too big to fail” (TBTF) problem. In particular, should society tolerate a financial system in which certain financial institutions are deemed to be too big to fail? And, if not, then what should we do about it?\n\nThe answer to the first question is clearly “no.” We cannot tolerate a financial system in which some firms are too big to fail—at least not ones that operate in any form other than that of a very tightly regulated utility.\n\nThe second question is the more interesting one. Is the current approach of the official sector to ending TBTF the right one? I’d characterize this approach as reducing the incentives for firms to operate with a large systemic footprint, reducing the likelihood of them failing, and lowering the cost to society when they do fail. Or would it be better to take the more direct, but less nuanced approach advocated by some and simply break up the most systemically important firms into smaller or simpler pieces in the hope that what emerges is no longer systemic and too big to fail?1\n\nAs I will explain tonight, I believe we should continue to press forward on the first path. But, if we fail to reach our destination by this route, then a blunter approach may yet prove necessary. As always, my views may not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhat Is the Too-Big-to-Fail Problem?\nThe root cause of “too big to fail’ is the fact that in our financial system as it exists today, the failure of large complex financial firms generate large, undesirable externalities. These include disruption of the stability of the financial system and its ability to provide credit and other essential financial services to households and businesses. When this happens, not only is the financial sector disrupted, but its troubles cascade over into the real economy.\n\nThere are negative externalities associated with the failure of any financial firm, but these are disproportionately high in the case of large, complex and interconnected firms. Although the moniker is “too big to fail,” the magnitude of these externalities does not depend simply on size. The size of the externalities also depends on the particular mix of business activities and the degree of interconnectedness with the rest of the financial industry. One important element is the importance of the services the firm provides to the broader financial system and the economy and the ease with which customers can move their business to other providers. Another is the extent to which the firm’s structure and activities create the potential for contagion—that is, direct losses for counterparties, fire sales of assets held by other leveraged financial institutions, or loss of confidence that might precipitate runs on other firms with similar business models.\n\nThe presence of large negative externalities creates a dilemma for policymakers when such firms are in danger of failing, particularly if the wider financial system is also under stress at the same moment. At that point in time, the expected costs to society of failure are very large compared to the short-run costs from providing the extraordinary liquidity support, capital or other emergency assistance necessary to prevent catastrophic failure.\n\nThe market's belief that a TBTF firm is more likely to be rescued in the event of distress than other firms weakens the degree of market discipline exerted by capital providers and counterparties. This reduces the firm's cost of funds and incents the firm to take more risk than would be the case if there were no prospect of rescue and funding costs were higher.\n\nThe fact that firms deemed by the market to be TBTF enjoy an artificial subsidy in the form of lower funding costs distorts competition to the detriment of smaller, less complex firms. This advantage, in turn, creates an unfortunate incentive for firms to get even larger and more complex. The funding benefit of being seen to be TBTF causes the financial system to become artificially skewed toward larger and more complex firms—in ways that are unrelated to true economies of scale and scope.\n\nNow to be clear, I don't believe that firms necessarily deliberately set out to become TBTF. Nor do I think that TBTF was the main cause of the breakdown in market discipline that preceded the financial crisis. Many factors were at work, including the failure to grasp the riskiness of new types of credit products and business models, and principal-agent problems such as the “trader’s put.” But I do think TBTF contributed to the underpricing of risk in the system and did create a bad set of incentives, and if not addressed comprehensively, would likely be an even larger problem in the future.\n\nSo How Did the Problem Become So Serious?\nThe TBTF problem is not new. For example, the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) and other federal regulatory agencies intervened to prevent the abrupt failure of Continental Illinois, then the seventh largest bank in the United States, in the 1980s. Had Continental Illinois been allowed to fail without any intervention, the comptroller of the currency later testified, “we could very well have seen a national, if not an international, financial crisis the dimensions of which were difficult to imagine.”2\n\nBut the problem has become more significant since that time for several reasons. First, the biggest financial institutions have become much larger, both in absolute terms and relative to the overall size of the banking system. This reflects many factors including the end of prohibitions on interstate banking, the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act restrictions separating investment from commercial banking, the rapid growth of the capital markets, and the globalization of the economy—all of which created intense competitive pressures to expand in order to gain economies of scale and scope.\n\nIn commercial banking, consolidation occurred at a rapid pace. For example, Bank of America was the outgrowth of over 160 different mergers, which pushed up the size of the original acquirer from $23 billion of assets in 1980 to $2.2 trillion today. In the securities industry, some partnerships became public companies, in part, so that they could more easily obtain the capital needed to expand rapidly. For example, when Goldman Sachs went public in 1999, it had about 15,000 employees and $250 billion of assets. Just eight years later, the firm had expanded to 35,000 employees and $1.1 trillion of assets.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the top five banks in the United States had total assets of $1 trillion or about 14 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). The top securities firms had total assets of $718 billion, or about 9 percent of GDP. By the end of 2007, the top five banks had assets of $6.8 trillion or 49 percent of GDP. Similarly, the top securities firms accounted for $3.8 trillion, or about 27 percent of GDP. In addition, the firms’ off-balance-sheet exposures rose sharply.\n\nSecond, the complexity and interconnectedness of the largest financial firms increased markedly. Factors behind this include the adoption of a universal banking model by some commercial bank holding companies and the rapid growth of trading businesses, especially the over the counter (OTC) derivatives market. In the early 1980s, there were no true U.S. “universal banks” that combined traditional commercial banking with capital markets and underwriting activities. By 2007, there were several operating in the United States, including Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, UBS, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank. Also, the OTC derivatives business in foreign exchange, interest rate swaps and credit default swaps had exploded from its start in the early 1980s. The total notional value of the OTC derivatives outstanding for the five largest banks and securities firms currently totals about $200 trillion.\n\nDuring this period, there was inadequate attention to the risks that were building up in the system. The regulatory and supervisory framework did not keep up with the changes in size, complexity, interconnectedness and globalization that created growing systemic risk externalities and widened the wedge between private and social costs in the event of failure.\n\nLet me mention just a few of the issues:\n\nThe TBTF problem was further aggravated by the financial crisis and the policy response. Faced with systemwide stress, the Federal Reserve, with the support of the U.S. Treasury, intervened to prevent the disorderly failure of Bear Stearns, a firm that would not have been high on the list of TBTF firms a few years earlier.\n\nMeanwhile, the failure of Lehman Brothers demonstrated that the cost to society of the uncontrolled failure of a TBTF firm in a period of generalized stress was considerably greater than anticipated. Following the bankruptcy of Lehman, contagion spread by many channels, including prime brokerage, OTC derivatives positions, money market mutual funds, tri-party repo and wholesale funding markets. The loss in confidence disrupted the flow of credit throughout the global financial system, generating a global economic downturn and the worst contraction in the United States since the Great Depression.\n\nRecognition of the costs generated by the Lehman failure led to extraordinary interventions to prevent further catastrophic failures. These included the rescue of AIG, the FDIC’s TLGP program, the ring-fence of Citigroup’s poorer quality assets, and the TARP injection of capital into the largest U.S. financial institutions. Because this solidified in investors’ minds that TBTF firms—after the Lehman debacle—would be protected, this worsened the TBTF problem.\n\nThe problem was exacerbated during the crisis by the acquisition of weakened firms by stronger firms, a development that was actively promoted by policymakers in a bid to avoid or temper the consequences of their failure. J.P. Morgan absorbed Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual and its assets grew from $1.5 trillion in 2007 to $2.3 trillion today; Wells Fargo purchased Wachovia and its assets increased from $575 billion in 2007 to $1.3 trillion today; and Bank of America purchased Countrywide and Merrill Lynch, increasing its assets from $1.7 trillion in 2007 to $2.2 trillion today. This, of course, made the surviving firms even bigger and more complex.\n\nWhen the smoke had cleared, the situation was clearly untenable. The experience of the crisis increased the advantage from being perceived as TBTF, and, thus, strengthened the incentives to become bigger, more complex, and interconnected.\n\nThe Dodd Frank Act (DFA) set out to end TBTF. One means was by eliminating the Federal Reserve’s discretion to provide emergency financial support through a program open only to a single financial institution, and, in general, raising the bar for broader-based emergency interventions under section 13.3 of the Federal Reserve Act.\n\nBut, as the DFA recognized, simply tying the Fed’s hands on intervention is insufficient. It does not reduce the cost to society from the failure of a large and complex firm. In order for the non-intervention strategy to be both fully credible and consistent with the public interest, we need to tackle the underlying externalities and incentive problems that give rise to TBTF in the first place.\n\nTackling Too Big to Fail\nAs I see it, solving the TBTF problem requires working on a number of different margins. These include measures that are firm-specific and those that address the structure of the financial system more broadly.\n\nOne set of measures works to reduce the incentives for excessive risk-taking and to lower the probability that large financial firms fail or come close to failure. Another set lessens the disruption to the financial system and hence the cost their failure imposes on the broader economy and society as a whole. Along with measures that penalize characteristics associated with the negative externalities from failure, these changes work against the incentive to be too big to fail.\n\nPolicy measures that alter incentives and reduce the probability of distress\n\nA number of steps have already been taken that reduce the probability of failure. For example, there has already been considerable progress in forcing firms to bolster their capital and liquidity resources. On the capital side, consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act, Basel III significantly raises the quantity and quality of capital required of internationally active bank holding companies. This ensures that the firm’s shareholders will bear all the firm’s losses across a much wider range of scenarios than before. This should strengthen market discipline. Meanwhile, to the extent that some of the specific activities that generate significant externalities are now subject to higher capital charges, this should cause banks to alter their business activities in ways that reduce both the likelihood and social cost of their failure.\n\nMoreover, the new Basel regime explicitly adjusts capital requirements upward based on size, complexity, interconnectedness, global exposure and substitutability—attributes that are proxies for the negative externalities generated by failure. If a bank is deemed a global systemic financial institution or G-SIFI, then it will have to hold a greater amount of capital relative to its risk-weighted assets compared to a less systemic institution.4\n\nThe notion behind the SIFI surcharge is a simple one. The cost to society from the failure of a large, complex firm is proportionally considerably higher than the cost to society of the failure of a non-systemic firm. As a result the capital buffer for the more systemic firm should be higher so that its expected probability of failure will be lower than for the less systemic firm.\n\nThe SIFI surcharge acts as a penalty for size and complexity, leaning against the funding cost advantage a firm may have because it is perceived to be TBTF. This helps level the playing field for smaller firms and reduces the incentive to seek to become TBTF in the first place.\n\nDomestically, we have adopted a more forward-looking approach to capital through the use of stress tests, in particular the annual Comprehensive Capital Assessment Review (CCAR) program. By promoting transparency, CCAR also strengthens market discipline.\n\nOn the liquidity front, the largest, most systemically important bank holding companies will be required to hold a 30-day liquidity buffer—the so-called liquidity coverage ratio or LCR. The purpose of the LCR is to ensure that such a bank will have sufficient liquid resources so if it were to encounter business difficulties and temporarily lose access to market funding, it would still have some time to address its underlying problems. With a liquidity buffer, banks will not immediately be forced to sell illiquid assets during times of stress. This should enhance their stability, and provide some protection against the fire sale externalities we saw during the crisis: forced asset sales, falling asset prices, leading to rising capital losses at other firms that led, in turn, to further funding difficulties, asset sales and so on.\n\nOn the supervisory side, firms are now increasingly being evaluated on a cross-industry basis in order to identify best practices and to identify laggards that need to upgrade areas such as MIS, governance, model validation, and risk management practices.\n\nActivity restrictions are another potential means to reduce the risk of failure. The biggest initiative in this area is the Volcker Rule. By limiting proprietary trading activities, the Volcker Rules seeks to reduce trading risk and the likelihood of failure.\n\nIn addition, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) is in the process of identifying those non-bank financial firms that are systemically important. These firms will be subject to tougher prudential standards and supervisory oversight by the Federal Reserve.\n\nSome argue that this designation process merely creates more TBTF firms. I see it differently. The system risk externalities do not depend on whether we label them systemic or not. If these risks are present, then we should face up to the issue with tougher standards and enhanced supervisory oversight rather than leave the issue unaddressed. This has to be a superior approach relative to pretending these firms could not be TBTF and the problem doesn’t exist.\n\nPolicy measures to reduce the adverse systemic consequences from failure\n\nBecause no plausible level of capital and liquidity standards will be sufficient to reduce the probability of failure to zero, it also makes sense to work on the other major margin—to reduce the cost of the failure of a large, complex financial firm. We can do this by making changes so that such failures are less likely to impair the functioning of the broader financial system. In this area, although many initiatives are in train, I would conclude that we are still very far from where we need to be.\n\nOne simple but meaningful step that already has been enacted is to put a brake on the ability of the largest and most complex firms to become even larger and more complex. To this end, the Dodd-Frank Act adds “the risk to stability of the U.S. banking or financial system” as an additional factor to be considered in evaluating a proposed merger or acquisition under the Bank Merger Act and the Bank Holding Company Act. As Governor Daniel Tarullo discussed in a recent speech, there is not a hard and fast rule to be applied here. But his view, which I share, is that there would be a “a strong, though not irrebuttable, presumption of denial [of a merger or acquisition] by any firm that falls in the higher end of the list of global systemically important banks…”5,6\n\nAnother step for dealing with the firms that might be viewed by some as already TBTF is to understand better the interconnections and pathways through which the distress or failure of one firm impairs the larger system and causes harm to society. We have made progress through the supervisory process in mapping out critical activities performed by firms. Also, we have identified a number of areas, such as collateral management, where better practices could both improve the safety and soundness of the individual firm and reduce the negative externalities generated by a firm’s failure.\n\nWork is also underway to evaluate what changes would be required to make the future bankruptcy of large complex firms less disruptive, while also developing an alternative means for the orderly resolution of such firms outside the normal bankruptcy process.\n\nThe costs to society of large complex financial firms failing can be reduced at least to some degree by having firms, working in conjunction with their regulators, “pre-plan” their own failure through the so-called “living will” process. The largest and most systemically important banks submitted their “living wills” to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC this summer. We have reviewed the first iterations of their plans and are currently drafting feedback for the firms to incorporate in their next submissions. Through such “living wills,” regulators are gaining a better understanding of the impediments to an orderly bankruptcy. This is the necessary first phase in the process of determining how to ameliorate these impediments over time and then doing so.\n\nIn my view, this initial exercise has confirmed that we are a long way from the desired situation in which large complex firms could be allowed to go bankrupt without major disruptions to the financial system and large costs to society. Significant changes in structure and organization will ultimately be required for this to be achieved. However, the “living will” exercise is an iterative process, and we have only taken the first step in a long journey.\n\nThe second way to potentially minimize the negative externalities from a firm’s failure would be to avoid a bankruptcy proceeding altogether and instead resolve the firm under the Dodd-Frank Act’s Title II orderly liquidation 7 authority.8\n\nThe “single point of entry” model has much promise, but much remains to be done before it could be implemented with confidence for a globally active firm. Title II authority is U.S. law. Subsidiaries and affiliates chartered in other countries could be wound down under the bankruptcy laws of those countries, if authorities there did not have full confidence that local interests would be protected. Certain Title II measures including the one-day stay provision with respect to OTC derivatives and other qualified financial contracts may not apply through the force of law outside the United States, making orderly resolution difficult.\n\nThe other essential dimension of solving TBTF is to make the financial system more robust—addressing structural vulnerabilities that tend to amplify shocks rather than absorb them. If the financial system can be made more resilient, it will be better positioned to withstand the failure of a large and complex firm and continue to provide essential financial services to the real economy.\n\nI would highlight three areas of work that are critical to solving the TBTF problem. First, regulators and supervisors are pushing for changes in wholesale funding markets, a source of particular vulnerability during the crisis. This includes reforms to tri-party repo, which are underway, and necessary reforms to the money market mutual fund industry, which are being evaluated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council.\n\nSecond, the financial market infrastructures are being strengthened to make them more robust to the failure of individual firms. The Committee on Payments and Settlement Systems and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) have published a set of standards for financial market infrastructures called “Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures” that will serve as minimum standards globally.\n\nFinally, the OTC derivatives market is being reformed with the aim of reducing bilateral exposures between firms and, thus, the systemic impact from any one firm failing. All standardized OTC derivatives in the interest rate, credit default, and equities markets will soon have to be centrally cleared through central counterparties (CCPs). The clearing of standardized derivatives trades through CCPs should reduce risk in the overall financial system by facilitating the netting down of OTC derivative exposures. Such trades will also have to be reported to trade repositories and information about the trades will be made available on a post-trade basis. This should make the OTC derivatives market more transparent and, thus, reduce the risk of contagion.\n\nThe Way Forward\nWe have made some progress on the TBTF problem, particularly in reducing the likelihood that a large complex firm will reach the point of distress at which society faces serious costs. But we have a considerable ways to go to finish the job and reduce to tolerable levels the social costs associated with such failures.\n\nFurther international coordination is almost certainly going to be necessary to ensure that bankruptcy regimes interact in ways that minimize negative externalities. At home we also need to ensure that different authorities and resolution regimes operate in a mutually consistent manner. In particular, we may need to revisit the SIPC regime that governs securities firms in bankruptcy. At present, the bankruptcy of a securities firm is very disruptive because the claims of all counterparties are typically frozen for a considerable period and the value of these claims is not easy to ascertain or monetize quickly.\n\nAs I have argued above, we shouldn’t focus on solving TBTF exclusively at the level of the individual firm. We need significant changes in market structures and practices as well in order to have a financial system in which the key players can fail without big social costs.\n\nWe also must continue to ask ourselves the question of whether the steps in train go far enough. For example, one could make a good case that the capital surcharge for systemically important firms should be higher than that contemplated by the Basel Committee. Of course, such a judgment depends on how much other policies succeed in reducing the negative externalities their failure would generate.\n\nCritics of our approach believe it would be better to just break up firms deemed TBTF now—perhaps through legislation requiring the separation of retail banking and capital markets activities or by imposing size restrictions that require firms to shrink dramatically from their current scale. My own view is that while this could yet prove necessary, it is premature to give up on the current approach: changing the incentives facing large and complex firms, forcing them to become more resilient, and making the financial system more robust to their failure.\n\nIn my opinion, there are shortcomings to reimposing Glass-Steagall-type activity restrictions or strict size limits. With respect to Glass-Steagall, it is not obvious to me that the pairing of securities and banking businesses was an important causal element behind the crisis. In fact, independent investment banks were much more vulnerable during 2008 than the universal banking firms which conducted both banking and securities activities. More important is to address the well-known sources of instability in wholesale funding markets and give careful consideration to whether there should be a more robust lender of last resort regime for securities activities.\n\nWith respect to size limitations, it is important to recognize that a new and much reduced size threshold could sacrifice socially useful economies of scale and scope benefits. And it could do this without actually solving the problem of system risk externalities that aren’t related to balance sheet size.\n\nEvaluating the socially optimal size, scope and organizational structure of financial firms is a complicated business, and so is establishing a viable transition path to a system of much smaller firms. It would be helpful in this regard if advocates of break-up solutions would put a bit more flesh on the bones and develop detailed proposals that address essential questions of how such downsizing or functional separation would be accomplished, and what benefits and costs could be expected.\n\nSuch an analysis should answer several questions: How would you force divestiture (in good times and bad)? Should firms be split up by activity or reduced pro-rata in size? How much would they have to be shrunk in order for the externalities of failure to no longer create TBTF problems? How would global trading and investment banking services and network-type activities be supported? Should some activities be retained in natural monopoly form, but subject to utility type regulation? How costly would it be to replicate support services or to manage liquidity and capital locally? Are there ways of designing size limits that cannot be arbitraged by banks via off-balance-sheet structures and other forms of financial innovation? So far, advocacy for the break-up path has been strong, but without the detail to assess whether this is indeed superior to the course we are currently following. But, I’m open-minded.\n\nIt is important to recognize that any credible approach to addressing the TBTF problem, including the one we are pursuing today, necessarily implies changes to the structure and business mix of financial firms and financial markets. Moreover, it is important to stress that not all of these adjustments will be in the private interests of these firms, and some will result in changes to the price and volume of certain financial services. These are intended consequences, not unintended consequences.\n\nToo big to fail is an unacceptable regime. The good news is there are many efforts underway to address this problem. The bad news is that some of these efforts are just in their nascent stages. It is important that as the crisis recedes in memory, that these efforts not flag—this is a project that needs to be seen to a successful conclusion and then sustained on a permanent basis.\n\nThank you for your attention, I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n1 This would presumably require legislation.\n\n2 Conover, C.T. 1984. “Testimony: Inquiry Into the Continental Illinois Corp. and Continental Illinois National Bank.” Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions Supervision, Regulation, and Insurance of the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs, U.S. House of Representatives, 98th Cong., 2nd Session, September 18, 19 and October 4: 172-391. P. 288\n\n3 Under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, the Federal Reserve is authorized to lend to individuals, corporations and partnerships. But this may occur only if a super majority of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has determined that circumstances are “unusual and exigent.” Subsequently, the Dodd-Frank Act further constrained this authority by prohibiting its use to rescue an individual company from bankruptcy.\n\n4 Earlier this month, the Financial Stability Board published a list of 28 global systemically important banks or G-SIBs that will be subject to capital surcharges. The firms were arrayed in four buckets, with an increasing capital surcharge as a percent of risk-weighted assets imposed as one ascended upward to the higher buckets.\n\n5 See Governor Daniel K. Tarullo, “Financial Stability Regulation,” October 10, 2012. Mr Tarullo added that “I would not apply the presumption in the case of certain de minimis acquisitions or in cases where asset dispositions were judged to offset any increase in systemic risk from the proposed new acquisiton.\"\n\n6 Earlier this year, the Board of Governors issued an order approving Capital One Financial Corporation's acquisition of a federal savings bank, ING Bank. In that order, the Board set forth two principles that are relevant to this particular issue. First, the Board stated that it would generally find a significant adverse effect if the failure of the firm resulting from a merger or acquisition \"would likely impair financial intermediation or financial market functioning so as to inflict material damage on the broader economy.\" Second, the Board observed that there are some small acquisitions or mergers that would not raise a financial stability concern, such as “a proposal that involves an acquisition of less than $2 billion in assets, [or] results in a firm with less than $25 billion in total assets . . . . “\n\n7 The FDIC's \"single point of entry\" framework for implementing this authority envisages establishing a bridge company into which all the operating subsidiaries of the parent company would be transferred. The bridge company would be recapitalized by converting all or some of the parent company’s subordinated and senior unsecured debt into fresh equity in the bridge company. The parent company would be allowed to fail. The transfer of the operating subsidiaries to the bridge company would allow critical operations to continue and provide time for the FDIC to move the systemically important operations back into private hands.\n\n8 The DFA orderly liquidation authority is viewed as to be used only as a last resort under a very well-defined set of circumstances. To resolve a firm under the FDIC’s orderly liquidation authority, a number of determinations must be satisfied. First, the troubled firm must be designated a covered financial company (CFC) and that it is in default or danger of default and a resolution under bankruptcy would result in adverse consequences. The determination to use OLA authority requires the assent of the Treasury Secretary after consultation with the President."

        "content": "As prepared for delivery\n\nGood morning. It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak at this NABE (National Association for Business Economics) conference today. Having spent more than 20 years as a business economist working in the private sector before joining the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 2007, I feel right at home here today.\n\nMy remarks will focus on the economic outlook. I do this with some trepidation, of course. In the private sector there are two adages about forecasting that underscore the need to be humble in this endeavor: First, forecast often. Second, specify a level or a time horizon, but never specify both, together.\n\nBut more seriously, despite the difficulties in making accurate forecasts, we still need to understand as best we can why the economy is performing the way it is, what that implies about the economic outlook, and, how policymakers can respond to generate better outcomes. We live in a highly complex and uncertain world, but we need to make as much sense out of it as possible. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nMy attention today will be on three important questions:\n\nThe disappointing recovery\nTurning to the first question, U.S. economic growth has been quite sluggish in recent years. For example, annualized real GDP (gross domestic product) growth has averaged only about 2.2 percent since the end of the recession in 2009. As a consequence, we have seen only modest improvement in the U.S. labor market.\n\nNot only has growth been slow, it has also been disappointing relative to the forecasters' expectations. For example, the Blue Chip Consensus have been persistently too optimistic in recent years. This is illustrated in Exhibit 1 which shows how private sector forecasts for 2008 through 2013 have evolved over time.\n\nIn contrast, as shown in Exhibit 2, there has been no notable pattern of forecast misses for inflation. Sometimes, inflation has been a bit higher than expected, other times a bit lower. On balance, inflation has been very close to our 2 percent longer-run objective.\n\nAlthough I have focused on the private forecasting record here, the FOMC participants' forecasts show a similar pattern. It is on the growth side where there have been chronic, systematic misses.\n\nIn my view, the primary reason for the poor performance of the U.S. economy over this period has been inadequate aggregate demand. There are several explanations for this. Although some were well-known earlier, others have only become more obvious as the recovery has unfolded.\n\nOne reason is the nature of economic recoveries following financial crises. On that basis, the poor performance of the U.S. economy is not unusual—historical experience shows clearly that recoveries following financial crises typically are very slow and difficult.1\n\nDuring the credit boom, finance is available on easy terms and the economy builds up excesses in terms of leverage and risk-taking. When the bust arrives, credit availability drops sharply and financial deleveraging occurs. Wealth falls sharply, precautionary liquidity demands increase, desired leverage drops further. In the U.S. case, there were some idiosyncratic elements, such as subprime lending and collateralized debt obligations. But, in the end, the U.S. experience included the major elements of most booms: Too much leverage, too little understanding of risk, too easy credit terms, and then a very sharp reversal.\n\nWhen the bust arrives, over-indebted households and businesses want to increase their saving and liquidity buffers, and financial intermediaries want to raise credit standards. Both responses restrain demand and make a cyclical rebound more difficult. In the U.S. case, because the bust was concentrated in housing, the scope for a strong cyclical recovery was particularly constrained because the interest-rate sensitive sector that would typically lead such a rebound could not recover until the overhang of unsold homes and the impairment of housing finances was corrected.\n\nThe U.S. recovery has also been subpar because it has been taking place in the context of a weak global economy. Historically, after a country experienced a financial crisis, growing foreign demand and currency depreciation have often led to a sharp improvement in the trade account that has put a floor under economic activity. In such circumstances, rising exports substitute for domestic consumption in supporting aggregate demand. This demand, in turn, encourages businesses to hire and invest.  In contrast, this time the shock generated by the U.S. housing bust had global consequences, exposing economic vulnerabilities outside of the United States, especially in Europe. Under these circumstances, the scope for trade as a support for U.S. growth, while positive, has been very limited.\n\nThese two factors—the dynamics following financial crises and the weakness of foreign demand—help explain why U.S. growth has been weak, but I don't think these factors explain why it has been consistently weaker than expected.\n\nAfter all, on the other side of the ledger, the policy response following the crisis has been much more aggressive than is typical. On the monetary policy side, the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates close to zero, communicated that short-term rates were likely to stay exceptionally low far into the future, and undertook a series of large-scale asset purchases in order to ease financial conditions further.\n\nOn the fiscal side, in 2009 the Congress and Administration enacted the largest fiscal stimulus program in history and some of these fiscal actions were renewed (e.g., extended unemployment compensation benefits) and new initiatives undertaken (e.g., the payroll tax holiday) once it became clear that the recovery was faltering.  Also, there were significant policy actions taken to strengthen the banking system, including forcing banks to recapitalize so that they would have the capacity to sustain their lending.\n\nSo why has the recovery disappointed?\n\nOne possibility is that the negative dynamics of a post-bubble environment are even more potent than had been appreciated. Feedback loops may be more powerful and frictions may be larger. In the U.S. case, this is particularly germane with respect to housing and mortgage finance. For example, we have found significant shortcomings in those institutional structures available to support the workout of the overhang of mortgage debt in an efficient and timely manner.  \n\nA second reason may be the series of additional negative shocks experienced since the initial phase of the financial crisis. The largest of these relate to the crisis in the eurozone. But one could also add the periodic commodity price shocks, the disruptive impact of the tragic Japanese earthquake and tsunami on global trade and production, and the effect of the uncertainties around the impending fiscal cliff on hiring and investing.\n\nThat said, the shocks since the acute phase of the crisis in the United States were not uniformly negative. Take, for example, the sharp increase in U.S. oil and natural gas production stemming, in part, from the innovations in drilling and extraction technologies. Not only does this rising production directly boost real GDP, but also the large drop in natural gas prices has significantly improved the industrial competitiveness of U.S.-based businesses.\n\nA third reason for the weaker than expected recovery likely lies in the interplay between secular and cyclical factors. In particular, I believe that demographic factors have played a role in restraining the recovery. The developed world's populations are aging rapidly. In the United States, for example, the baby boom generation, which is a particularly large cohort, is now beginning to retire. As the population ages, this has two consequences. First, the spending decisions of the older age cohorts are less likely to be easily stimulated by monetary policy. That is because such age groups tend to spend less of their incomes on consumer durables and housing. Second, as the population ages and the number of retirees climbs, the costs associated with Social Security, government pensions, and healthcare retirement benefits increase. This creates budgetary pressure and leads to a choice of raising revenue to fund these costs, cutting other government programs, or cutting benefits.\n\nNow if this all had been fully anticipated by retirees and near-retirees, then this would already be factored into their spending and saving decisions. But, I doubt that this has been the case. I suspect that many have been surprised by the swift change in economic circumstances as the housing boom went bust. I doubt that many fully anticipated the budget crunch and the prospect that their future retiree and healthcare benefits would likely be curbed or their taxes would have to rise in the future. When households begin to anticipate this, they reduce their assessment of their sustainable living standards. This downward reassessment then feeds back to current spending and saving decisions.\n\nA fourth reason why the recovery has been slower than expected may be that we overestimated the capacity for fiscal policy to continue to provide support to growth until a vigorous recovery was achieved. On the fiscal side, the authorities can cut taxes or increase spending to support income and demand during the deleveraging phase that follows the financial crisis. But the ability of such stimulus to continue to support economic activity ultimately encounters budgetary limits. For example, the need to keep the long-term fiscal trajectory on a sustainable path limits the size and duration of federal fiscal stimulus measures. For state and local governments, the statutory requirements for balanced budgets meant that fiscal policies turned restrictive relatively quickly once budget surpluses and rainy day funds were exhausted, and this was only temporarily mitigated by federal transfers to the states as part of the initial fiscal stimulus program.  Fiscal policy is now a drag rather than a support to growth in the United States, and this will likely continue.  \n\nMonetary policy\nI would give each of these four explanations some weight for why the recovery has been consistently weaker than expected. But I would add a fifth, monetary policy, while highly accommodative by historic standards, may still not have been sufficiently accommodative given the economic circumstances.\n\nNow let me be clear. I believe the evidence overwhelmingly indicates that our monetary policy has been effective in easing financial conditions and supporting economic activity. After reducing the traditional policy tool, the target for the overnight federal funds rate, to close to zero, the Fed has aggressively employed two complementary types of non-traditional tools—asset purchases and forward guidance on the policy rate—to provide additional stimulus through their effects on long term rates and various risk premia.\n\nEffective forward guidance on interest rates causes market participants to lower their expectations and uncertainty about future path of interest rates and to anticipate that easier financial conditions will persist well in to the future. This pushes down the yield curve and leads to easier financial conditions.\n\nFederal Reserve asset purchases also make financial conditions more accommodative. Such purchases, by taking duration out of private hands, push down term premia and lead to lower long-term rates than would otherwise be the case for any given economic outlook. Agency MBS (mortgage-backed securities) purchases absorb prepayment risk and reduce secondary and primary mortgage rates, stimulating demand for housing and increasing purchasing power through refinancing. Lower long-term rates support the prices of equities and housing, boosting wealth and easing balance sheet constraints, while an accommodative monetary policy stance reduces downside risks for the economy and this leads to lower default risk premia on corporate debt.\n\nOur  two tools work in a complementary manner. Asset purchases strengthen the credibility of the forward guidance on interest rates, while forward guidance provides information about how long the FOMC is likely to hold on to the assets it purchases.\n\nMy conclusion is that the easing of financial conditions resulting from non-traditional policy actions has had a material effect on both nominal and real growth and has demonstrably reduced the risk of particularly adverse outcomes.  Nevertheless, I also conclude that, with the benefit of hindsight, monetary policy needed to be still more aggressive. Consequently, it was appropriate to recalibrate our policy stance, which is what happened at the last FOMC meeting.\n\nAs I argued in a recent speech, simple policy rules, including the most popular versions of the Taylor Rule, understate the degree of monetary support that may be required to achieve a given set of economic objectives in a post-financial crisis world. That is because such rules typically do not adjust for factors such as a time-varying neutral real interest rate, elevated risk spreads, or impaired transmission channels that can undercut the power of monetary policy.2\n\nOne reason that monetary policy may have been less powerful than normal is that one of the primary channels through which monetary policy influences the real economy—housing finance—has been partially impaired. This has both quantity and price dimensions. Credit availability to households with lower-rated credit scores remains limited and households with homes that have fallen sharply in value have lost most or all of their home equity and this makes it very difficult for them to refinance these mortgages.\n\nFederal Reserve MBS purchases have succeeded in driving down mortgage rates to historically low levels. But these purchases would have had still more effect on the economy if pass-through rates from the secondary market to the primary market had been higher. As can be seen in Exhibit 3, the Federal Reserve's purchases significantly narrowed the spread between agency MBS and Treasury yields, with the latest round of purchases notably effective in this regard. But, as shown in Exhibit 4 the spread between primary mortgage rates and agency MBS yields3 has widened and this has limited the drop in primary mortgage rates.\n\nThe incomplete pass-through from agency MBS yields into primary mortgage rates is due to several factors—including a concentration of mortgage origination volumes at a few key financial institutions and mortgage rep and warranty requirements that discourage lending for home purchases and make financial institutions reluctant to refinance mortgages that have been originated elsewhere. On a related note, higher guarantee fees charges by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have increased the fixed cost of originating loans and this has also increased the spread between primary and secondary mortgage rates. Factors limiting pass-through warrant ongoing attention from policymakers.\n\nAnother reason why monetary policy has become less effective in stimulating the economy is because the impetus from a given level of monetary accommodation likely has become attenuated—that is, less powerful—over time. Historically, attenuation has not been important because monetary policy typically has not stayed exceptionally easy for long periods of time. But this time is different and that difference may be important.\n\nSo how might the monetary policy impulse on economic activity have become attenuated over time? I would suggest two potential channels.\n\nThe first channel is that monetary policy works, in part, by changing the timing of purchase decisions. If interest rates decline, the drop in financing costs may induce some households to buy a motor vehicle or purchase a home now rather than in the future. Of course, if the car or home is purchased today, this will borrow at least a portion of those sales from the future. There is a limit to how many cars and homes most people will want to buy, given their budget constraints. In this case, as the stimulus from the policy stays in place, the impulse on economic growth will gradually \"wear off\" as there are fewer and fewer households who can be induced to pull their future planned purchases forward to the present. The same argument applies to mortgage refinancing activity. The stimulus comes from the refinancing activity, which increases the amount of income that borrowers have available for other expenditures. The impetus to growth wears off unless mortgage rates keep dropping, stimulating additional rounds of refinancing activity.\n\nThe second channel is that low interest rates will gradually reduce the interest income of savers and this could eventually affect their consumption. Household interest income has fallen considerably over the past few years.\n\nThis effect is likely to work quite slowly. The fact that interest rates are low for six months or a year probably does not have much impact on households' expectations of their long-term interest income and thus, does not have much of an impact on consumer spending. But, as low interest rates are sustained, this could eventually lead to a downward adjustment in households' assessments of their interest income over time and influence their spending.\n\nOne way to look at this is through the prism of forward real interest rates. If interest rate expectations many years forward have fallen, then expectations about the permanent level of interest income should have declined as well. As shown in Exhibit 5, forward real rates five years ahead have declined notably over the past few years. This could be a reasonable proxy for savers' expectations. Note that the decline in Exhibit 5 has not been precipitous, it has occurred very gradually over time.\n\nHowever, policymaking is about making choices between available alternatives.  In the long run, even savers would be better off in a world in which aggressive monetary policy generates a strengthening recovery that eventually permits the normalization of interest rates, than they would be compared to a circumstance in which the United States allowed itself to fall into a Japan-style trap of low growth and low rates for decades. So I do not view the effect of low rates on savers as a reason to be less accommodative.\n\nRather, in my view, the potential for the monetary policy impulse to be attenuated over time, is an additional reason to be aggressive in terms of the policy response. A more front-loaded program would avoid greater attenuation compared with a policy that started out  less aggressive but added stimulus gradually over time. This has two benefits. First, it would likely be more successful in generating the desired recovery more quickly. Second, relative to a more back-loaded program, less would ultimately need to be done to achieve the desired set of outcomes.  \n\nThe fact that there are asymmetric payoffs from an economy that is weaker than expected versus one that is stronger than expected, given that we are at the zero lower bound reinforces this conclusion. In particular, if the economy were to continue to underperform, and experienced a severe shock, there would be some  risk of getting stuck in a deflationary situation in which monetary policy would be even less effective.\n\nAt the present time there is no conflict between our employment objective and our inflation objective, as I expect inflation to be at or below our 2 percent longer-run objective over the coming years. But shouldn't we also consider the costs associated with a more aggressive monetary policy of the kind adopted at the last FOMC meeting, especially when we are using non-traditional monetary policy tools?\n\nAbsolutely. We have carefully evaluated three potential sets of costs and will continue to review them.\n\nThe first set of costs stems from the risk that the current monetary policy regime could distort asset allocations and lead to renewed financial asset bubbles. We look at this issue on an ongoing basis. To date, there is little evidence of problems or excesses, but this could change as the recovery proceeds. If these costs were to rise, we would need to examine what steps could be taken on the macro-prudential front in response. Also, such developments would need to be  incorporated into the monetary policy decision-making process.\n\nThe second set of costs stems from the risk that exit from this regime could prove difficult. In particular, some observers worry that the expansion of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet could ultimately prove inflationary. If that were the case, then I would regard the costs as exceptionally high.\n\nFortunately, I am confident that such fears are misplaced. That is because we now have the ability to pay interest on excess reserves (IOER). This means we can keep inflation in check regardless the size of our balance sheet. If the recovery got underway in earnest and credit demand surged, we could slow down the rate of credit creation by raising the interest rate we pay on excess reserves. Banks wouldn't lend out funds at lower rates than what they can earn from holding reserves with us. As a result, a hike in the IOER would raise the level of interest rates throughout the economy and this would dampen any expansion of credit. Our ability to pay interest on excess reserves is an essential tool that we can use to avoid future inflation problems.4\n\nWe are mindful of the fact that there could still be confusion about how exit will take place. This could increase financial market volatility. To reduce this risk, the FOMC has published a set of exit principles. These principles lay out a roadmap about how exit is likely to occur: First, the end of reinvestment of maturing securities; second, an increase in short-term interest rates, and, third, the gradual sale of mortgage backed securities to shrink the magnitude of excess reserves in the system and ultimately to restore the Fed's balance sheet to a predominately all-Treasury portfolio.\n\nA degree of humility is appropriate given the lack of experience as to how markets will respond when economic conditions eventually cause investors to anticipate exit. When asset purchases are anticipated to end or when asset sales begin to be anticipated, this will affect term premia in ways that cannot be precisely predicted in advance. That said, I do expect the repricing will prove manageable. We will seek to communicate so as to avoid generating sharp shifts in term premia and in long-term interest rates. Also, we will play close attention to ensure that financial institutions are managing their interest rate risks appropriately.\n\nThe third set of costs is the impact of higher short-term rates on the Federal Reserve's earnings and balance sheet when exit occurs. When we ultimately raise short-term interest rates, this will squeeze the Fed's net interest margin. Also, when the Fed sells long-term assets, there is some prospect for losses on these sales depending on the level of long-term interest rates at the time when such sales occur. This means that the Fed's earning could fall sharply or even turn negative in a given year. We look at this issue very closely to understand the risks here. The good news is that a very large proportion of our liabilities—those associated with currency outstanding—has no interest cost. This mitigates the risk of a sharp net interest margin squeeze. Moreover, our analysis shows that the cumulative income generated over the period in which the balance sheet has been unusually large is likely to exceed normal levels under a wide range of scenarios.\n\nIn my view, while the costs are real and need to be carefully evaluated, they pale relative to the costs of not achieving a sustainable economic recovery. A failure in that regard would lead to widespread chronic unemployment. Not only would that be tragic for millions of people, but it also would generate chronic shortfalls in the nation's potential output and fiscal capacity. Relative to the costs outlined above, the benefits from avoiding such an outcome seem overwhelming.\n\nCyclical and structural policy\nAlthough I favor an aggressive monetary policy in the current situation, I also recognize that monetary policy is not a panacea. We all know that in the long run money is neutral—that is, that while monetary policy can help the economy return to full employment following a shock, the full employment level of output, employment and real income depends on factors outside of monetary policy. Also, we must recognize that the strength of the current cyclical recovery will depend importantly on non-monetary policy choices.\n\nOther steps are needed to secure the best available economic outcome. In particular, attention should be paid to what could be done to capitalize on the recent stabilization in house prices to improve access to mortgage credit and to foster competition in mortgage origination to ensure a more complete pass-through of low secondary mortgage rates to households. Indeed, if balance sheet dynamics are more important and frictions around housing more powerful than we initially understood, then there should be strong payoff to policies that ease them.\n\nAt the same time, Congress and the White House should take steps that reduce the short-term and long-term uncertainty over fiscal policy. Currently, households and businesses face elevated short-term uncertainty as to what will happen to tax and spending policies in 2013 and how this will affect the economic outlook. I believe this is restraining hiring and investment today.\n\nBut families and businesses also face long-term uncertainty about how the country's fiscal challenges will be addressed.  Providing greater clarity about the scope and terms of Social Security and Medicare must be helpful, especially in correcting those expectations that are unduly pessimistic. On this score, Social Security is particularly noteworthy. According to a 2011 Pew Research Center poll, more than 40 percent of people aged 18 to 30 believe they will receive no retirement income from Social Security, even though Social Security receipts are estimated to equal about 75 percent of benefits on a sustainable basis under the current regime.5\n\nCongress and the White House should enact a fiscal program that starts with mild restraint, but credibly builds that restraint over time so as to put the nation's debt burden on a clearly sustainable course. Ideally, the program would have broad bipartisan support and provide clarity not just on the near-term outlook, but also about how the major entitlement programs would be adjusted.\n\nAlso, steps could be taken to increase the productive capacity of the economy over time. Such actions are desirable because a more productive economy will generate higher living standards and have greater fiscal capacity.\n\nLet me briefly mention a few steps that could be taken to increase the economy's potential over time—immigration policies that attract workers with scarce skills to the United States; education policies and job retraining programs that build and replenish human capital; spending on infrastructure to remove bottlenecks; tax simplification and the elimination of tax policies that distort investment and saving decisions; regulatory policies that are attentive to costs and benefits and that emphasize getting the incentives right.\n\nCounter-cyclical policies and structural policies are not substitutes, they are complements. We need both. The strength of demand today is importantly influenced by expectations about future living standards.  The lower the expected path of national income, the less favorable the distribution of that income is expected to be, and the greater the uncertainty over the mix of tax rates and benefits a person or business expects to pay and receive, the less they will spend or invest today.  Thus, policies that improve the long-run outlook make a cyclical recovery easier to achieve today.\n\nConversely, a monetary policy that promotes a cyclical recovery supports the economy's long-run prospects. Left for too long, long term unemployment will eventually lead to permanent atrophying of skills that will restrain the economy's growth potential. This is also true for the cohort of young workers who are stuck in jobs for which they are overqualified and who are having trouble securing the professional experience that would make them increasingly productive over time.\n\nAlthough the outlook for the U.S. economy remains somewhat cloudy as we look into 2013, I remain a long-run optimist about where we are headed. The long term prospects of the U.S. economy are excellent. The United States leads the world in higher education, technology and innovation and has recently acquired new comparative advantages in energy. We have an exceptionally dynamic labor market, high rates of entrepreneurialism, competitive product markets, and a well-capitalized financial system that relentlessly reallocates capital from one sector to the next in search of higher returns.\n\nEven over the next few years, while there are significant downside risks relating to the fiscal cliff and the eurozone, it is possible that the recovery could turn out stronger than expected. The underlying process of balance sheet repair is considerably advanced, housing is recovering and, as that occurs, our newly recalibrated monetary policy could gain additional traction. Thus, if uncertainties about the U.S. fiscal path and the future of the eurozone were resolved in a constructive manner, growth could pick up more vigorously than anticipated.\n\nThis would be a wonderful outcome. The September FOMC statement noted: the Committee expects \"that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the recovery strengthens.\" Consistent with this, if we were to see some good news on growth I would not expect us to respond in a hasty manner.  Only as we became confident that the recovery was securely established, would I expect our monetary policy stance to evolve to ensure that it remained appropriate to achievement of our objective: maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.

        "content": "Good morning. I am Bill Dudley, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. I would like to welcome you to today's conference titled \"Distressed Residential Real Estate: Dimensions, Impacts, and Remedies,\" which we are co-sponsoring with the Rockefeller Institute of Government.\n\nIn addition to my role at this institution, I serve as vice chair of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which is charged with conducting the monetary policy for the United States. As I am sure you are aware, the FOMC has taken some extraordinary measures over the past few years to ease financial conditions and thereby improve the pace of economic recovery. While those measures have certainly helped to make the economy stronger than it otherwise would have been, nonetheless, the pace of the recovery to date has been disappointing. Over the three year period from mid-2009 to mid-2012, the real output of the U.S. economy has grown at a compound annual rate of just over 2 percent. As a result, employment gains have been modest, only matching the growth in the population, and the unemployment rate remains unacceptably high.\n\nWhile there are several headwinds that have been restraining economic growth, a key impediment is that the housing market has failed to respond fully to the significant easing of monetary policy. Now it is true that various housing market indicators have looked somewhat better of late. Housing starts and sales of new and existing single-family homes are trending up gradually. Nationally, home prices have stabilized and begun to rise modestly after falling roughly 30 percent from their 2006 peak. However, the absolute level of starts and sales remain quite low, particularly when viewed on a per capita basis. Moreover, housing market conditions still vary significantly across the country, with the worst performing counties still experiencing high volumes of distressed sales and annual house price declines of around 5 percent. The net result is that while housing’s contribution to growth has finally turned positive, its magnitude is far below that experienced in previous recoveries.\n\nThere are several factors behind the relative sluggishness of housing market activity. Although mortgage credit availability is slowly improving, it remains impaired, especially for households with less-than-sterling credit histories. Moreover, we are still dealing with the legacy of the housing boom and bust. According to CoreLogic, more than one out of four homeowners with a mortgage are \"underwater,\" making it difficult for the borrowers to either refinance or sell. In addition, as the conference speakers who follow me will make clear, there continue to be large volumes of properties for which the homeowner is either seriously delinquent or already in the foreclosure process. It is quite likely that most of these properties will eventually end up on lenders’ balance sheets and then be offered for sale.\n\nAs I discussed in a speech given earlier this year in New Jersey, the New York Fed is deeply committed to contributing to efforts to resolve the housing crisis that continues to impede our economic performance. Our economists monitor the housing market and analyze its impact on the national economy. My outreach staff works with community groups and housing practitioners to support local programs that aid distressed homeowners. Our lawyers perform pro bono work for homeowners facing foreclosure and advise on legal reforms, while our researchers and market analysts have developed proposals to mitigate current problems and improve the future structure of housing finance. Indeed, today’s conference is an outgrowth of these efforts, and many of these ideas will be presented in today’s various panels.\n\nThank you for your attention. I hope today’s conference proves both stimulating and useful for you. I’ll now turn the mic over to Thomas Gais, director of the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government and our co-sponsor of this conference."

        "content": "Good afternoon, I am pleased to be in northern New Jersey to address the 8th Morris County Economic Development Corporation (MCEDC) Business Growth Forum—an annual event organized by the Morris County Chamber of Commerce. It is always a pleasure to speak with the business community and I thank you for inviting me here today.\n\nI get out of my office in New York City regularly to inform myself—first-hand—about economic conditions and challenges across the second Federal Reserve District. Each visit within the region helps me to strengthen relationships with the diverse people of this District and build a deeper understanding of the economic challenges that we face. Today, I want to talk a bit about the Fed—what we do and why we do it. Then I’ll provide some thoughts about the national and local economic outlook. Normally in these regional outreach speeches I say little about monetary policy. But since the Federal Reserve made some meaningful decisions last week and it is important for people to understand the reasons and motivations for our actions. I will conclude with a brief discussion of policy.\n\nAfter that, I’ll be happy to answer any questions you have about what the Fed does and why, and about the economic outlook.\n\nAs always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee, also known as the FOMC.\n\nWhat the New York Fed Does\nBy way of introduction, I will briefly review what my colleagues and I do at the New York Fed. The New York Fed is one of 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks that, together with the Board of Governors in Washington D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System, our nation’s central bank.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is independent within government. By law, we are charged with managing the nation’s monetary policy—taking actions that raise or lower interest rates to promote full employment and price stability. The Federal Reserve is also charged with promoting financial stability, without which we cannot achieve our economic objectives. We play an important role in the nation’s payments and settlements system, which you might think of as the plumbing of the financial system. And we have a specific mandate to promote economic development in each of our regions.\n\nAs president of the New York Fed, I serve as the vice chair of the FOMC, the Federal Reserve committee that meets eight times a year in Washington to set interest rates and make other decisions about monetary policy. The members of this committee all strive to achieve our statutory mandate. Sometimes we have different views on the specific policy choices at hand, and you should view this as completely appropriate: these are hard questions—particularly during difficult economic circumstances such as we face today.\n\nIn fact, I think we make better decisions as a committee because we don't all think alike. But we are united in our commitment to our dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment and price stability and in our belief that preserving the independence of the Federal Reserve in making monetary policy decisions is very much in the public interest. That independence allows us to make tough decisions based on data and analysis insulated from short-term political pressures.\n\nAt FOMC meetings, each Committee member presents a current outlook for his or her region and for the nation. In formulating these assessments, we consult with many sources—our boards of directors, regional advisory councils, community leaders and other key stakeholders. My meeting with you and others today is part of this systematic effort to understand what is going on in the grassroots of our economy. To help me gather more information about our region, I met this morning with Fox Valve, a small business in Dover that manufactures specialized, highly engineered industrial parts. After that, I had the pleasure of participating in a roundtable discussion with members of the local Mexican-American business community. After this lunch, I will travel to Picatinny Arsenal to learn about its role in the state’s economic activity. I’ll also meet with the leaders of New Jersey Community Capital to learn about their cutting-edge programs for helping distressed homeowners and then I’ll speak to the students, faculty and alumni at Montclair State University.\n\nIn addition, my colleagues and I at the New York Fed continually track conditions in our District, and we have created a number of tools for that purpose. For example, my staff produces indices of economic activity for New York City, New York State and New Jersey. We also track local household credit conditions, including the amount and type of personal debt and whether payments are being made in a timely way.\n\nWe also conduct a periodic poll about the credit needs of small businesses, which are an important source of new jobs in the region. In our latest poll of several hundred firms, many report that they did not apply for credit because they were \"discouraged.\" Perhaps surprisingly, many of these non-applicants have credit profiles similar to other firms who successfully sought credit. This finding suggests that the demand for credit could pick up as some \"discouraged\" firms learn that they might be able to obtain credit now.\n\nIf you, as a representative of a small business, would like to participate in our next poll, please pass your card to my colleagues, who are in the audience, or see me after the speech and we will be glad to add you as a respondent.\n\nTo promote economic development in our local communities, we publish a lot of data and analysis on the local economy, including our small business poll findings. In addition we provide education outreach initiatives to help small businesses. For example, in October, we will host a workshop in Newark to help local businesses learn about export credit facilities and new tools for marketing. At the same time, we will launch our annual financial awareness video competition aimed at helping young adults make sound personal financial decisions.\n\nAs you know, even states as wealthy as New Jersey have large pockets of poverty. So, we target some of our work specifically to low- and moderate-income groups.\n\nWe have worked hard to help neighborhoods that face high foreclosure rates. This work is informed by analysis that suggests that high levels of foreclosures affect the value of neighboring homes, the local tax base and economic vitality more broadly. We have provided housing counselors and community development groups with the latest information on mortgage conditions, via mortgage briefs, roundtables, presentations and newsletters—including an interactive tool on our website that shows monthly delinquency and foreclosure conditions at the local level. This fall we will host a conference on distressed residential real estate to share what we and leading experts have learned with senior policymakers and practitioners from across the United States.\n\nAll in all, there is a lot to keep myself and my colleagues busy.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions\nSo how is our region doing? Let me start by saying that New Jersey is well-positioned to prosper. New Jersey is the 11th largest state—with a population of 8.8 million and this population is well-educated. Roughly 35 percent of adults over 24 years old have a college degree, well over the national average. Here in Morris County, that figure is almost 50 percent. The state is also quite ethnically diverse: roughly 20 percent of New Jersey residents were born abroad.\n\nThe state’s economy is industrially diverse, resembling the nation. New Jersey employs many people in healthcare, professional and business services, wholesale and retail trade, and leisure and hospitality. In the northern part of the state, we see a disproportionate share of jobs in a few industries: finance, particularly in Hudson County; goods distribution, related to the ports, rail lines and trucking and warehousing activities that are prominent here; pharmaceuticals manufacturing and R&D; and private education.\n\nThe area obviously benefits from its important links to New York City. In particular, many residents of this area, including myself, commute each day to the city.\n\nSo how is the recovery proceeding here? Based on the New York Fed’s indices, economic activity in the state did not begin to recover until November 2010, more than a year after the nation and New York City. Since then, activity has recovered at a moderate pace, although we are still operating below our previous peak.\n\nEmployment in New Jersey declined substantially during the downturn. Our employers cut about 250,000 jobs. This represents a 6 percent loss—roughly on par with the loss nationwide. Less than one in four of those jobs have been recovered to date, slightly weaker than the nationwide recovery and, of course, much weaker than I would like to see. Over the past year, the private sector has seen moderate job gains led by some of the key sectors I mentioned earlier, particularly professional and business services, education and health, and leisure and hospitality. But the state continues to shed jobs in manufacturing and there has been little recovery in construction. State and local government cut back employment substantially during 2010, though there has been a modest pick up over the past year.\n\nUnemployment among New Jersey residents remains high. July’s reading of 9.8 percent puts the state’s rate well above the U.S. average.\n\nMore broadly, how are the state’s families faring financially? While the median household income among New Jersey families is the second highest in the nation—at about $69,400—roughly a tenth of residents live in families with incomes below the poverty line. Although this rate is below the national rate of 14 percent, it varies considerably by county across the state, and is particularly high in Essex, Hudson and Passaic counties. Reducing poverty is a major challenge for policymakers.\n\nThe New York Fed’s measures of regional credit conditions suggest continued financial challenges for families here. As of the second quarter of 2012, for those people with a credit report, average debt per person in New Jersey was about $63,000, roughly unchanged over the past several years. Delinquency rates on that debt are high: 8.4 percent of all debt in the state is seriously delinquent, up from 7.4 percent in 2011 and above the national rate of 6.7 percent. So, many New Jersey households are still struggling with their finances.\n\nAlthough there are some recent signs that home prices in the state are starting to firm, nevertheless, the housing crisis continues to take a toll on our homeowners. As of June, 9.3 percent of all mortgage debt in New Jersey was 90-plus days delinquent, three percentage points above the national rate. And that delinquency rate is actually a little higher here in northern New Jersey.\n\nNational Economic Conditions\nThe performance of the U.S. economy since the end of the recession in 2009 has been disappointing. Real GDP has grown at an annual rate of just over 2 percent over this period, and it was even slower in the first half of 2012. As a result, employment gains have been modest, unemployment remains above 8 percent—an unacceptably high level—and participation in the jobs market remains depressed. Moreover, about 5 million workers have been unemployed for six months or more. This is important because long-term unemployment can cause job skills to atrophy making it more difficult for such people to find jobs in the future. While the good news is that the job-finding rates of the long-term unemployed have not yet deteriorated as many feared, we ought not to take this for granted going forward.\n\nAlthough energy prices have begun to rise again, total inflation, as measured by year-over-year changes of the Consumer Price Index, is still around 1¾ percent—less than half the rate in September of 2011. In recent months, core inflation has also slowed and it is now also under 2 percent.\n\nHigher energy and grain prices mean that headline inflation will likely edge somewhat higher for a few months before moving slightly lower again. But measures of the underlying rate of inflation are moderate, wage gains remain subdued, and longer-term inflation expectations are fully consistent with our longer run inflation objective of 2 per cent as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator. Near term, the economic outlook is that the growth pace is likely to remain disappointing. On the positive side, motor vehicle sales in August increased solidly. Nevertheless, retail sales outside of autos and gasoline were soft in August as households continue to be cautious.\n\nOne brighter spot has been the housing market. Housing starts and sales of new and existing single-family homes are trending up gradually. Nationally, home prices have stabilized and begun to rise modestly after falling roughly 30 percent from their 2006 peak. Housing market conditions still vary significantly across the country with the worst performing counties experiencing annual house price declines of 8 percent or more. This sector is just getting back on its feet, so that even strong gains in the residential investment sector from its current tiny base will provide only a modest contribution to overall GDP growth. In addition, homeowner net worth remains much below its pre-crisis level.\n\nThe near-term outlook for the business sector is particularly worrisome right now. New orders for nondefense capital goods and information on business plans for spending on new structures both suggest weakness in business fixed investment. Also, many indicators point to sluggish manufacturing activity, including the ISM manufacturing composite index, several regional manufacturing surveys, and August industrial production. Our own Empire State Manufacturing Survey fell deeper into negative territory in September. This manufacturing slowdown stems from several factors, including the slowdown in the pace of growth abroad and uncertainties about how the fiscal cliff in Washington will be resolved.\n\nSo why has the economy grown so slowly since the official end of the \"Great Recession?\" There are many reasons, but I would cite five factors as particularly important:\n\nGiven the signs of improvement in some of these areas, including the slow but steady progress in healing balance sheets and restoring the supply of credit, I anticipate that the pace of economic growth will gradually pick up, supported by very low interest rates. But heading into the FOMC meeting last week, I judged that, if we did not ease monetary policy further, the pace of improvement would be unacceptably slow.\n\nMonetary Policy\nLast week the FOMC took additional action to promote a more robust recovery in a context of price stability. In order to ease policy, the FOMC deployed two complementary tools: asset purchases and forward guidance on interest rates. With respect to asset purchases, the Committee said it would start buying additional mortgage-backed securities at a rate of $40 billion a month. In terms of rate guidance, the Committee said it anticipated that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate would likely be warranted \"at least through mid-2015.\"\n\nAs Chairman Bernanke explained in the press conference that followed the meeting, the Committee also took two steps to underscore its commitment to ongoing support for the recovery. First, the Committee said that if it did not see substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, it will continue the MBS purchase program, undertake additional asset purchases and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until it does. Second, the Committee emphasized that it expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.\n\nAs usual, the Committee will publish minutes of the meeting three weeks after it took place. In the interim, however, I thought it might be useful to provide my own perspective on these actions.\n\nIn my view, the decision to ease policy further is fully consistent with our dual mandate and policy framework. As I mentioned earlier, we have two goals—to promote maximum employment and price stability. We therefore seek to minimize how far employment is from its long run normal level and inflation is from our longer-run goal of 2 percent on the PCE measure. Because monetary policy works with a time lag, we base policy not just on where the economy is today but where we expect it to be in the future. To do this, we make economic forecasts, based on data and insights from a broad range of economic models. We also take into account the balance of risks around our base case outlook.\n\nLooking ahead, in the absence of further monetary easing, I concluded that growth would remain too subdued over the next several years to make big inroads into the spare capacity that remains from the Great Recession. As a result, unemployment would remain unacceptably high, with economic risks skewed to the downside. Meanwhile, with substantial slack in labor markets and inflation expectations stable, inflation was likely to remain a bit below our 2 per cent longer-run objective.\n\nIn this situation, I concluded that our policy framework means that further monetary policy easing was appropriate provided that the benefits of using the tools available outweighed the costs. In my judgment, this standard has been satisfied here. I am confident that the costs are manageable, based in part on the experience we have of using the tools these past four years and that the benefits substantially exceed the costs, recognizing, of course, that our actions are not so powerful that they will instantly transform the economic outlook.\n\nSo how do our actions support economic activity? Buying assets and extending interest rate guidance puts downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, so they are lower than they would otherwise be for any given economic outlook. This supports the price of assets such as equities and homes. Buying mortgage-backed securities has the additional effect of narrowing the interest rate spread between these assets and Treasuries, which further reduces mortgage rates. Moreover, to the extent that our actions are seen as supporting the recovery and providing some insurance against adverse shocks, confidence in the medium-term economic outlook should also increase, making businesses and households more willing to invest, hire and spend. If we are successful, long-term Treasury yields could actually rise as confidence in a sustainable recovery increases. At the same time, the expected returns on private assets should rise and risk premia decline. This matters because such shifts would provide support to the economic recovery.\n\nNow it is true that some of the channels through which monetary policy affects the economy may be partially impaired at the moment. For example, because of ongoing restrictions in the supply of mortgage credit to customers with less than perfect credit records, the impact of lower mortgage rates on housing is probably less powerful than normal. While this restraint should slowly ease as house prices stabilize, the difficulties of households with lower credit scores in obtaining mortgage credit warrants ongoing attention. However, it is also worth noting other channels through which monetary policy affects economic activity are not impaired, including the impact on spending that is generated by rising wealth, declining risk premia and improving confidence.\n\nIt is important to recognize that our tools are not all-powerful—monetary policy is not a panacea for all that ails our economy. But, at the margin, firms facing lower borrowing costs for any given economic outlook will invest and hire more. People who refinance at lower rates, or see the value of their homes and 401K pension plans go up, will spend more. I believe that a nudge in the right direction will move us closer to a self-reinforcing cycle of more hiring, more spending, more growth, and more investment. This is the type of virtuous cycle that we should seek and one that is consistent with a self-sustaining and improving economy.\n\nI believe our latest statement provides greater clarity about how we intend to use the tools we have to promote our statutory objectives. As Chairman Bernanke said at his press conference, the idea is to make it \"more explicit, more transparent to the public, make it more obvious that the Fed will do what’s needed to provide the support for the economy.\"\n\nIn particular, the amount of asset purchases that we undertake will be a function of how the economy evolves. If the economy is weaker, we’ll do more. If the economy is stronger, and we see a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market sooner, we’ll end up doing less. From my perspective, linking our purchases more closely to economic outcomes underlines our determination to generate the kind of recovery that will deliver more rapid progress toward maximum employment in the context of price stability.\n\nSo what does \"substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market\" mean to me? Note that I will be focusing on the outlook, not just the current state of labor market conditions. In that context, it wouldn’t be enough for me just to see the unemployment rate decline a bit. It would also matter why the unemployment rate is declining and whether that improvement is likely to be sustained in the future. For example, higher payroll growth that was not supported by stronger economic growth, or falling unemployment rates that were due mainly to declining participation in the labor market, would not likely meet my test. Therefore, to gauge how substantial the improvement in the outlook for the labor market is, I will be looking at a range of indicators, including the unemployment rate, payrolls, the participation rate, the employment to population ratio and job finding rates, as well as the growth momentum within the economy.\n\nAs we approach year-end, the maturity extension program in which we are increasing our holdings of long-dated Treasuries will be coming to an end. I’ll be taking stock on how we are doing with respect to our employment and inflation goals and whether it will be appropriate to continue purchasing longer-dated Treasuries when that program concludes. I think that this will depend on whether we have seen a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook in the interim and any further evidence about the costs and benefits of continuing such purchases.\n\nIn terms of our monetary policy regime, the FOMC statement noted that the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy \"for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.\" This is important because in situations such as the one we find ourselves in today, when monetary policy is somewhat constrained because we cannot lower the federal funds rate below zero, one of the most powerful things a central bank can do is to provide guidance as to how it will behave in the future. In this respect, I am pleased that we have drawn a sharper distinction between what we expect the economy to look like in a few years time and how we expect to set policy based on that outlook.\n\nIn particular, when the Committee extended the period for which it anticipates keeping the federal funds rate at exceptionally low levels—which I interpret to mean the current range of zero to 25 basis points—to \"at least through mid-2015,\" I don't think this was due to greater pessimism about the economic outlook. In fact, when you look at the September Summary of Economic Projections of the Committee members—the medium-term growth outlook was upgraded a bit relative to prior July projections. In my judgment, combining the statement and our projections, the proper inference is that we were acting to secure a better outcome—more rapid progress toward full employment and price stability.\n\nConclusion\nTo sum up, too many people remain without the jobs that they need to help support their families and themselves, and while the economic expansion is continuing, we aren’t yet growing fast enough to put back to work many of the idle workers and business facilities that represent the productive potential of our economy. Meanwhile analysis of the inflation outlook suggests that price increases are likely to be close to our 2 per cent longer run objective over the coming years.\n\nNot all of the factors that are holding back growth are directly amenable to monetary policy. Our nation’s economic challenges cannot be solved and our economic fortunes restored by the Federal Reserve alone. Others—notably the next Congress and White House—will have to step up to the plate.\n\nBut I am confident that the Fed will promote maximum employment and price stability to the greatest extent our tools permit, and we will stay the course. We are setting policy to achieve a stronger recovery in the context of price stability. When that finally materializes, I’ll view it as consistent with the result we are trying to achieve, and not a reason to pull back our policies prematurely. If you’re trying to get a car moving that is stuck in the mud, you don’t stop pushing the moment the wheels start turning—you keep pushing until the car is rolling and is clearly free.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions."

        "content": "Good morning and greetings from New York City. I sincerely thank the Chamber for giving me the opportunity to address your annual meeting. Unfortunately I am unable to be in Puerto Rico in person, because I have a broken leg and am under doctor’s orders not to fly.  The good news is that I am on the mend and that I have this opportunity to speak to you via video \n\nWe at the New York Fed are pleased that Puerto Rico is part of the Second Federal Reserve District that we represent in the Federal Reserve System. We are committed to the people of the Island and to its growth and prosperity. Our commitment is reflected in our ongoing work with our many partners on the Island.  Last spring, with the Puerto Rico Chamber of Commerce and other local partners, we co-sponsored a forum aimed at helping small businesses in Puerto Rico learn about export opportunities.  We have been involved with education on the Island for two decades, including by helping to set up the Alianza. Today we help promote financial literacy through a video competition in partnership with the Puerto Rican Bankers Association. \n\nOur banking supervisors work to strengthen the financial system so it can readily supply credit to families and businesses, while our research economists monitor and analyze local economic conditions.  This analysis—along with similar analyses from other regions across our nation—feeds into the decisions the Federal Reserve makes on monetary policy. \n\nIn support of this work, I and other senior officials have traveled to Puerto Rico a number of times in recent years and met with a wide range of stakeholders, including university officials, students, business leaders, entrepreneurs, bankers and government officials. \n\nWhat we learn during these engagements helps to shape our understanding of the Puerto Rican economy and our efforts to support it.  I have seen numerous examples of expansion and growth.  This gives me confidence that Puerto Rico has the capability to be an economic success story.  Nevertheless, these local engagements have also confirmed to me that conditions are not what we want them to be—in particular, growth and expansion are not happening broadly enough.  The task of putting the Island on a path of robust, sustainable and inclusive growth remains a work in progress. \n\nDuring my visit here in March 2011, a number of business and community leaders expressed their concern that the economy had loss competitiveness.  These local leaders asked if we would look at what might be holding back growth on the Island. Much high quality work has already been done on this subject by local experts. However, they thought it might be helpful for the New York Fed, as an independent third party, to evaluate what might be done to promote competitiveness and productivity on the Island.\n\nI readily agreed that we would do so. I commissioned a team of economists from our Research group and other experts from our international and outreach teams, to analyze the challenges facing Puerto Rico.  I asked them to put forward some recommendations on how to capitalize on the Island’s strengths and restore growth. \n\nThe report released today on the competitiveness of Puerto Rico’s economy, is the product of their work and extensive consultation with local, national and international experts.  I have read it closely and commend it to your attention. The report is intended as nonpartisan technical analysis and should be viewed in that vein.  Even those who do not agree with every aspect of the analysis, I hope, will acknowledge that this is a serious, good-faith effort to examine, in detail, a number of important issues that deserve attention.  Of course, many of these issues can only be considered as part of the political process.  It is for the people of Puerto Rico to judge the appropriate trade-offs involved—not me, certainly, or my staff at the New York Fed.\n\nIn a few moments Jamie McAndrews, executive vice president and director of research, will summarize the report and its recommendations. Before he does so, I would like to share with you my assessment of economic conditions on the mainland and in Puerto Rico.\n\nAs always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.   \n\nNational Economic Conditions\nThe mainland U.S. economy has continued to slowly recover from the after-effects of the housing boom and bust and the financial crisis.  But the recovery has been disappointing. Despite a monetary policy that has been extraordinarily accommodative by historical standards, the economy has grown only about 2 percent over the past year. After a brighter start to the year, economic momentum has slowed in the last few months.  (This may partly be a payback for the mild winter, which brought forward some spending.)  Employment growth remains positive, but has slowed considerably of late as the economy has lost forward momentum, and the unemployment rate remains elevated.\n\nThe headwinds retarding recovery are well known. Many consumers have been deleveraging in response to the large losses in wealth generated mainly by the collapse in home prices. The supply of credit—particularly mortgage credit—to many families remains constrained, limiting the degree to which many households can fully benefit from low interest rates.\n\nAlthough there have been some positive signs in the housing market recently, housing activity nevertheless remains at very low levels.  The sector has been restrained by several factors including the large shadow inventory making its way through the foreclosure pipeline, tight underwriting standards for new mortgage origination, and the sharp slowdown in household formation. \n\nAlthough the corporate sector as a whole is now relatively healthy, there still is a significant constraint on the availability of credit to small business. Business investment continues to expand, but at a restrained pace.  I presume that this partially reflects uncertainty over the economic outlook, including the risks around the evolution of U.S. fiscal policy and the crisis in Europe.\n\nFiscal policy has already become restrictive as state and local governments have cut expenditures in response to revenue shortfalls. Moreover, we face the so-called “fiscal cliff” at the start of next year.   At the beginning of 2013, federal fiscal policy is scheduled under current law to become sharply contractionary, with abrupt increases in taxes and cuts in spending.   Businesspeople tell me that the uncertainty about how Congress and the Administration will deal with the fiscal cliff—and our fiscal challenges more broadly—is already inhibiting hiring and investment. The fiscal cliff represents a threat to the recovery that is wholly avoidable.  But we will only avoid it if our politicians act responsibly. We need a credible strategy for bringing down the federal budget deficit over time in a manner supportive of ongoing economic recovery.   Any plan should start slowly, but build steadily over time.  It should be bipartisan in nature so that the plan is viewed as sustainable across the political cycle.  \n\nMeanwhile the crisis in the eurozone has resulted in a sharp slow-down in economic growth in Europe and tighter financial conditions globally.  It has hurt U.S. consumer and business confidence and is already a material drag on U.S. growth.  Economic momentum in many other regions of the world has also slowed somewhat and this is also restraining the demand for U.S. exports. \n\nAssuming that Congress avoids the fiscal cliff and European leaders successfully manage through their challenges, there are solid grounds for expecting that growth will gradually strengthen in coming years.  U.S. banks are healthier and credit conditions, while still tight, are gradually easing, the housing sector is showing early signs of recovery, and households appear quite far along in the deleveraging process.\n \nOn the inflation side, we have succeeded in delivering inflation very close to our 2 percent price stability objective. Over the past year or so, price trends have been a bit stickier than one might have anticipated given the large amount of slack in the economy. To some degree, this likely reflects earlier upward pressures on commodity prices, the anchoring exerted by stable inflation expectations, and the stickiness of nominal wages.  With gasoline prices now falling sharply and upward pressures from apparel prices now appearing likely to dissipate, I expect that inflation will decline a bit in coming months, falling somewhat further below our 2 percent objective. \n\nMore generally, there are several reasons to think that inflation will remain moderate. First, the economy continues to operate with significant slack. Second, measures of underlying inflation show little upward pressure, and the growth rate of nominal labor compensation is low and stable.  Moreover, inflation expectations remain well-anchored. Taking into account all these factors along with our current stance of monetary policy, I anticipate that inflation will be slightly below our 2 percent long-run objective over the next few years.\n\nOne of the challenges I face as a policymaker is how much to adjust my medium term economic forecast in response to near-term developments, particularly when there is elevated uncertainty.  Although I have made some adjustments of late, they have been relatively modest to date. That is because there are important issues—such as the outlook in Europe and the degree to which we have lost underlying momentum at home—where more information is needed before making an informed judgment. \n\nAlthough some of the current uncertainties will take time to resolve, I can imagine material data on a number of dimensions could become available in the coming weeks and months that could lead me to adjust my forecast further. I will be paying particularly close attention to whether domestic momentum and hiring picks up now that the pay-back for the mild winter is over, and whether financial conditions, which are heavily influenced at present by developments in Europe, ease or tighten further.\n\nI am the vice-chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed committee that sets monetary policy to promote its statutory goals of full employment and price stability. Last week, the committee reaffirmed that it currently anticipates that the Federal Reserve’s federal funds rate target will remain exceptionally low—which I understand to mean at its current level—at least through late 2014. The FOMC also voted to provide additional support for economic activity by extending its maturity extension program—popularly referred to as Operation Twist—through the end of the year.  This extension means that we will be buying an additional $267 billion of longer term Treasury securities, paid for by selling or redeeming the same amount of shorter term Treasuries.\n\nThis action reduces the supply of longer dated Treasury securities on the market and lowers longer term interest rates relative to where they would otherwise be in the absence of such a program. That puts downward pressure on corporate borrowing costs and mortgage rates, and supports asset prices such as housing and equities—all of which promotes growth.\n\nIn addition, the FOMC adopted new language to describe its policy outlook, stating that it is “prepared to take further action as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability.”  I will let those words speak for themselves. \n\nLocal Economic Conditions\nNow let me turn to economic conditions in Puerto Rico.  Puerto Rico’s real, or inflation-adjusted Gross National Product has declined for the past four years and this has been accompanied by a sharp decline in the real income of Island residents. According to a monthly index of economic activity produced by the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico, economic activity began to decline as far back as 2005.  Although the index has been stable for the past several months and this may be a signal that the economic downturn on the Island may have ended, a solid recovery has yet to take hold and conditions remain challenging.     \n\nThe job market remains a trouble spot for the Island’s economy.  Total employment fell by about 13 percent or roughly 140,000 jobs, between its peak back in 2005 and mid-2010. This is nearly double the 7 percent job loss on the mainland.  For the past two years, employment has appeared to have bottomed out, but there has been little evidence of recovery.    \n\nThe Island’s unemployment rate has fallen by more than a percentage point over the past year, but this is not necessarily good news.  The fall was largely the result of a fall in labor force participation. At 14.8 percent the unemployment rate remains unacceptably high. \n\nHigh unemployment and low labor force participation remain perhaps the biggest challenges to the Puerto Rico economy.  Even in relatively prosperous times, the unemployment rate on the Island has been more than double the rate on the mainland.  High unemployment and low labor force participation are especially serious problems for young workers and are perhaps the clearest evidence that Puerto Rico needs to make better economic progress. \n\nMany of the current problems facing Puerto Rico relate not just to cyclical weakness but to deeper structural challenges. This brings us to the subject of the report we issued today.\n\nI do not presume that this report is the last word on these important questions. We do not presume to claim that we have all the answers.  Rather, I hope that it is the start of a constructive and bipartisan debate that will advance good public policy and a better future for the people of Puerto Rico. I also hope that it will be read and considered beyond the business and government community, across the society at large.  The goal we seek is not simply business success and expansion, but broad-based prosperity with rising standards of living and greater opportunities for all Puerto Ricans.  \n\nI want to thank you again for the opportunity to address the Chamber. Jamie McAndrews, executive vice president and director of research, will now talk about the report we released and lay out its findings and recommendations.    \n_____________________________________________________\n\n* Remarks were delivered by Krishna Guha, executive vice president, on Mr. Dudley's behalf."

        "content": "Good afternoon and welcome once again to the New York Fed’s Quarterly Regional Economic Press Briefing.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to talk with the journalists covering our region—and through you, to the people in our District.  This morning I will focus on regional economic conditions, with particular attention to job polarization, which I would define as the expansion of the number of jobs at the upper and lower ends of the wage and skill distribution and a shrinking of job opportunities for those in the middle.  We will see how these trends are playing out in our region.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nNational Economic Conditions\nThe U.S. economy is continuing to slowly recover from the after-effects of the housing boom and bust and the financial crisis.  But the recovery has been disappointing. Indeed, when we look back at economic forecasts made over the past three or four years it is notable that growth has systematically fallen short of both the Federal Reserve and private-sector forecasts.\n\nDespite what has been an unusually accommodative monetary policy by historical standards, the economy has grown at only a 2.1 percent pace over the last four quarters and the Blue Chip consensus forecast only anticipates a modest acceleration to a 2.4 percent rate over the next four quarters.\n\nThe headwinds retarding recovery are well known.  Consumers have been deleveraging in response to the large losses in wealth generated in large part by the collapse in home prices.  Housing activity remains depressed for many reasons.  These include the large shadow inventory making its way through the foreclosure pipeline, tight underwriting standards for new mortgage origination, and the sharp slowdown in household formation.\n\nAlthough the corporate sector as a whole is now reasonably healthy, there still is a significant constraint on the availability of credit to small business.  Fiscal policy has become restrictive as state and local governments have cut expenditures in response to revenue shortfalls;  and the uncertainty about how Congress and the Administration will address the 2013 federal “fiscal cliff” is likely to inhibit hiring and investment by business.  Global economic growth has slowed as European activity has stagnated and this is capping the demand for U.S. exports.\n\nOn the brighter side, some of these headwinds appear to be subsiding.  Employment growth has picked up somewhat, which should eventually lead to faster household formation and more demand for housing.  U.S. banks are healthier so that credit conditions, while still tight, are gradually easing.  And, households appear quite far along in the deleveraging process by a number of important measures.  For example, the ratio of household debt service relative to income is back to levels last seen in the early 1990s.\n\nFor these reasons, I expect that growth will gradually strengthen over the next few years.  Nevertheless, significant downside risks remain, especially those related to the challenges in Europe and how the potential “fiscal cliff” in the United States will be resolved after the fall elections.  Even if these risks do not materialize, I anticipate only slow progress toward full employment.\n\nOn the inflation side, in recent years our forecasts have been noticeably more accurate than on the growth side, and we have succeeded in delivering inflation very close to our 2 percent price stability objective.  Through March, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures deflator, overall consumer prices have risen 2.1 percent over the past 12 months, and prices excluding food and energy have risen 2.0 percent.\n\nBut price trends have been a bit stickier than one might have anticipated given the large amount of slack in the economy.  To some degree, this likely reflects the anchoring exerted by stable inflation expectations.  But some of the price pressures can be attributed to other, more temporary, factors:\n\nMore generally, there are several reasons to think that inflation will remain moderate and close to our objective. First, and most obviously, the economy continues to operate with significant slack.  Second, measures of underlying inflation show little upward pressure.  In fact, one—the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Underlying Inflation Gauge—is turning down. This measure uses a very wide set of variables to forecast the underlying inflation trend. Third, it is hard to be very concerned about inflation risks when the growth rate of nominal labor compensation is so low and stable.  It is noteworthy to me that the employment cost index has risen only 2.1 percent over the past four quarters and has shown no acceleration.  Fourth, inflation expectations remain well-anchored. This is critically important because inflation expectations are an important driver of actual inflation outcomes. Taking into account the current stance of monetary policy, I anticipate that inflation will decline to slightly below our 2 percent long-run objective over the next few years.\n\nSo what does this all imply for monetary policy?  I currently anticipate that the Federal Reserve’s federal funds rate target will remain exceptionally low—that is at the current level—at least through late 2014.\n\nGiven our forecast of stable prices and a still slow path back to full employment, there is an argument for easing further. But, unfortunately, our tools have costs associated with them as well as benefits.  Thus, we must weigh these costs against the benefits of further action.\n\nAs long as the U.S. economy continues to grow sufficiently fast to cut into the nation’s unused economic resources at a meaningful pace, I think the benefits from further action are unlikely to exceed the costs.  But if the economy were to slow so that we were no longer making material progress toward full employment, the downside risks to growth were to increase sharply, or if deflation risks were to climb materially, then the benefits of further accommodation would increase in my estimation and this could tilt the balance toward additional easing.\n\nUnder such circumstances, further balance sheet action might be called for. We could choose between further extension of the duration of the Federal Reserve’s existing Treasury portfolio and another large-scale asset purchase program of Treasuries or agency mortgage-backed securities.\n\nConversely, I would be willing to consider tightening policy at a somewhat earlier stage if growth strengthened sufficiently to materially improve the medium-term outlook and substantially reduce tail risks, or if there was evidence of a genuine threat to medium-term inflation, including a rise in inflation expectations. In such a case, I would anticipate that the first step would be to bring in the late 2014 date of the policy guidance.  This would effectively tighten financial conditions not only by changing the expected path of short-term interest rates, but also by bringing forward the expected start of balance sheet normalization.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions\nLet me turn now to the regional economy, the focus of our presentations today.  Since our last briefing, the recovery in the region has picked up some steam.     \n\nAs attendees at previous regional press briefings may recall, the New York Fed produces economic activity indexes to help monitor the performance of the regional economy.  Based on these measures, activity in New York State and New York City has expanded at a healthy clip, while New Jersey’s growth continues at a more moderate pace.  In Puerto Rico, the activity index produced by the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico shows that the Island’s downturn appears to have ended, but the pick up that we noted at our last briefing has not persisted and the level of activity there has stalled.    \n\nLooking at payroll employment, however, the pattern of recovery is a bit more positive, though mixed across the region.  New York State and New York City saw faster job growth than the nation since our last briefing.  Job creation in the city has been particularly robust and employment in the city is now above its pre-recession peak.  In New Jersey, however, employment stands only slightly above where it was at our last briefing and still is well below its previous peak.   In Puerto Rico, employment continues to fluctuate near its lows, with no sign of a pickup. \n\nJob Polarization\nOur special topic today is the issue of job polarization. As I have visited different parts of the district—most recently trips to Long Island, Syracuse and Buffalo—employers have told me that they are beginning to add jobs, particularly in high-tech fields.  These jobs can best be characterized as high skilled and technologically advanced.  I have heard similar stories from our small business advisory council, our upstate advisory council and even our community banks.  These anecdotes are reflected in our research on labor market dynamics.  Over the past three decades, job opportunities have become increasingly concentrated in high wage/high skill occupations and low wage/low skill occupations, while job opportunities for those in the middle have been shrinking. At the same time, there has been a growing gap in wages between jobs that pay the most and those that pay the least. Taken together, this phenomenon is often referred to as job polarization. \n\nThe root causes of job polarization appear to be technology and globalization, which have displaced many jobs, particularly those involving routine tasks.  This loss of jobs has been especially pronounced for what we often think of as traditional middle-skilled workers. Its impact is perhaps most evident in the manufacturing sector, where so many jobs have been lost in recent decades. Given the strong history of manufacturing in our region, job polarization has been an important feature in our local economy.\n\nNo doubt, the widening wage gap and loss of job opportunities for middle-skilled workers has contributed to a rise in economic inequality and created challenges for many workers and their families. More than ever before, jobs are requiring a greater degree of knowledge and skill. In order to adapt to these changes, it is increasingly important for workers to acquire and upgrade their skills, whether through formal education or other forms of training. In addition, it is important for employers to communicate their needs to educational institutions so that they can offer the coursework and programs so that people can develop the right skills to fill the available jobs. For these reasons, we think it is particularly important to highlight these trends in today’s briefing.\n\nConclusion\nIn summary, recent data are consistent with the expectation of moderate growth in 2012 and stronger, but still not robust, growth in 2013.  I also expect both headline and core inflation rates should moderate over the next few months.  In our region, the recovery of activity and employment has continued, though the data indicate relatively stronger performance in New York State and New York City than in New Jersey, while Puerto Rico has yet to show any meaningful improvement. Our special topic shows a trend toward job polarization both in the nation and the region, which focuses our attention on the ever-growing importance for workers to acquire skills and upgrade their skills on an ongoing basis.    \n\nI will now ask Jim Orr to present the update of economic conditions in our region."

        "content": "It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to speak here today.  My remarks will focus on how I think about monetary policy in today’s challenging economic environment.  As part of this, I will discuss how simple policy rules might appropriately be used as a guide to decisionmaking.  I do this not because policy rules play a dominant role in my own thinking, but because the use of these tools is widespread, with many framing their arguments this way.  To start with the punch line, although I believe simple policy rules can provide useful input into the policymaking process, it would be unwise to rely on them mechanically.  As always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nPolicy must strive to promote the dual mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability given to the Federal Reserve by Congress.  I believe that this should be done in a transparent and systematic manner because this will help us to achieve our objectives.  In particular, a well-articulated framework for policy that explains our goals and how we use our tools to promote these goals helps market participants, businesses, and workers to anticipate how the Federal Reserve will respond under different circumstances and plan accordingly.1\n\nThis helps to anchor private sector expectations in ways that make it easier to achieve the dual mandate objectives.  In contrast, if we acted in an unpredictable way, policy would be ineffective at anchoring expectations and this shortcoming would disrupt the transmission of the monetary policy impulse to the real economy.\n\nOver the years, this logic has led the Federal Reserve to become increasingly transparent and systematic in its decisionmaking.2 In January, the Federal Open Market Committee took another important step in this direction, endorsing a public statement of longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy.  This document articulated a 2 percent inflation o bjective and committed the FOMC to a “balanced approach” with respect to promoting the dual mandate objectives.\n\nFor me, the key issue is how to interpret these principles and put them into practice.  I interpret the strategy document as expressing a relatively straightforward proposition:  The Fed should seek the policy setting that generates the best achievable path back to full employment and price stability following shocks that push us away from either of our objectives.\n\nI regard the policymaking process as a systematic effort to investigate what policy setting would deliver the best achievable set of economic outcomes,3 taking into consideration all available information, including risks not fully summarized in the base case point forecasts.  Our approach is not greatly different from those of central banks that operate inflation targeting regimes, but in our case we explicitly seek to promote both aspects of our dual mandate.4 \n\nThe basic question is how the FOMC should implement monetary policy to best push the economy back to its dual objectives.  Prescriptions from simple policy rules such as Taylor Rules, named after Stanford economist John Taylor, have a legitimate role to play in this evaluation as do more complex simulations such as optimal control rules.  In a Taylor Rule, the nominal federal funds rate depends on the equilibrium or neutral real short-term rate of interest, the deviation of the level of economic activity from estimates of the level of activity that would be consistent with long-run price stability, and the deviation of inflation from the central bank’s target.5 \n\nThe Taylor Rule formulation has a number of characteristics that make it a useful input into the policy-setting process.  First, it very explicitly focuses on the two parameters—the long-term inflation objective and the level of potential output consistent with that objective—that map directly to the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate objectives.  Second, standard Taylor Rules are self-equilibrating.  They respond to economic shocks and forecast errors in a way that pushes the economy back toward the central bank’s objectives.  Third, academic research shows that Taylor-type rules typically perform quite well across a wide range of economic models.  This is important because we want rules that are robust; that is, not overly sensitive to model-specific assumptions about how the economy performs or how households and businesses alter their expectations and behavior in response to changes in monetary policy. \n\nFourth, with respect to the United States, the most popular versions of the Taylor Rule approximate how policy has evolved since the late 1980s—a period in which the Federal Reserve has been successful in keeping inflation in check (Figure 1). This suggests that policymakers, faced with the economic conditions of that period, weighted deviations from their goals in a manner similar to the weights used in these versions of the Taylor Rule. \n\nDespite these attractive features, I do not believe that simple policy rules can take the place of in-depth analysis of economic conditions, evaluation of alternative policy plans, and ultimately policy judgment.  While simple policy rules provide useful information to policymakers, their very virtue—simplicity—means they cannot capture all information that is relevant for policymaking.  For example, such rules cannot easily incorporate asymmetric risks or financial stability issues. \n\nMoreover, the usefulness of simple policy rules depends critically on the stability of the relationship between monetary policy and economic outcomes.  If the relationship between monetary policy and the real economy were stable over time, following a relatively simple and unchanging policy rule would likely generate acceptable results.  However, if the linkage between monetary policy and the real economy is more variable, as I believe it is, then an approach that is more pragmatic and updates the policy setting in a clear and systematic manner based upon what the FOMC learns over time will be more effective.\n\nIn particular, a simple policy rule can generate poor macroeconomic outcomes when either the structure of the economy or the transmission mechanism of monetary policy changes in a significant way (whether the change is temporary or permanent).  If private sector economic agents—workers, businesses, investors— thought we would implement a particular policy rule regardless of changes of these kinds, policy would not be effective at stabilizing private sector expectations in ways that promote the dual mandate objectives.  This is particularly relevant in the unusual environment that we find ourselves in—the aftermath of a housing bust and a financial crisis.\n\nIn the current context, there is an additional complication that is extremely important.  Simple policy rules implicitly assume that monetary policy is unconstrained and that the Fed can always achieve the federal funds rate policy setting the rule proposes—even if it is negative. By extension, they also assume that it is as easy to ease policy as it is to tighten policy if certain risks materialize. In practice this is not the case.  Because our traditional tool, the federal funds rate, is already at its effective zero lower bound, we may want to react differently to a given economic outlook and set of risks than we would if policy were unconstrained.  We are certainly not completely constrained: we have additional tools such as the balance sheet and forward policy guidance that we can use to provide additional monetary policy stimulus.  But these tools have costs as well as benefits.  Moreover, we can only imperfectly translate the impact of these policy instruments into interest rate equivalents for the purposes of evaluation using simple rules.\n\nSo for many reasons, I focus my attention primarily on how we are progressing and expect to progress relative to our dual mandate objectives.  In this context, simple policy rules are an input, but my judgment also is informed by the economic environment and what we learn about the responsiveness of the economy to monetary policy. \n\nNevertheless, it is possible to translate my assessments into a language that would be more familiar to those who think in terms of a Taylor-type rule. \n\nRecall that in a Taylor Rule framework, five major parameters can be adjusted:\n\nThus, while the Taylor Rule generally is viewed as a fixed formula, its underlying framework is sufficiently flexible that such a rule could be modified to reflect certain types of new information. \nWhat values should we use?  In the United States, the inflation objective is well specified—a 2 percent annual rate for the personal consumption expenditures deflator.6  The FOMC has formally committed itself to this objective. \n\nIn contrast, there is disagreement among FOMC participants about how far the U.S. economy is operating from potential.  Our staff forecast at the New York Federal Reserve estimates that the long-term unemployment rate is about 5 percent.  The central tendency in the most recent Summary of Economic Projections is a bit higher at 5.2 percent to 6.0 percent, but the degree of dispersion is not particularly wide. \n\nMore difficult is the judgment about what weights to put on deviations of output from potential versus deviations in expected inflation from the Fed’s inflation target.  This will differ among policymakers based on their views about the costs of deviations from the dual objectives and the structure of the economy.  This debate can be summed up by looking at the two most well-known versions of the Taylor Rule—the original version put forward by Mr. Taylor, which is commonly referred to as Taylor 1993, and a later version updated by other economists that Mr. Taylor has discussed but does not endorse, which is referred to as Taylor 1999.7  Taylor 1999 puts more weight on deviations of output from potential than Taylor 1993.  Thus, Taylor 1999 would lead to a later liftoff of the federal funds rate as the economy returns to full employment.\n\nWhich set of weights is better is a matter of judgment. John Taylor prefers Taylor 1993.  My own thinking, when translated into Taylor Rule terms, favors the weights in the Taylor 1999 formulation.  I believe that Taylor 1999 is likely to perform better in achieving the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate objectives.  Compared with Taylor 1993 it can achieve significantly greater stability in employment without sacrificing the medium-term inflation objective or significantly increasing the variability of inflation outcomes. \n\nFinally, the remaining parameter in the Taylor Rule is the neutral, real short-term interest rate.  This is the interest rate adjusted for inflation that neither stimulates nor slows the economy.  It is typically set at 2 percent.  Although there is no reason why the neutral real rate cannot change over time, the 2 percent rate is typically plugged in without further attention.  Whether this is appropriate is a critical question in today’s economic environment that I will return to a bit later.\n\nLet me now discuss the economic outlook, and examine some of the implications for monetary policy.  In doing so I will look at results obtained by applying some variants of the Taylor Rule, and explain some of my concerns about using simple policy rules in a mechanical way for setting monetary policy. \n\nAs I see it, the U.S. economy is continuing to slowly recover from the after-effects of the housing boom and bust and the financial crisis.  But the recovery has been disappointing. Indeed, when we look back at economic forecasts made over the past three or four years it is notable that growth has systematically fallen short of both the Federal Reserve and private-sector forecasts. \n\nDespite what has been an unusually accommodative monetary policy by historical standards, the economy has grown at only a 2.1 percent pace over the last four quarters and the Blue Chip consensus forecast only anticipates a modest acceleration to a 2.4 percent rate over the next four quarters (Figure 2).\n\nThe headwinds retarding recovery are well known.  Consumers have been deleveraging in response to the large losses in wealth generated in large part by the collapse in home prices.  Housing activity remains depressed for many reasons.  These include the large shadow inventory making its way through the foreclosure pipeline, tight underwriting standards for new mortgage origination, and the sharp slowdown in household formation. \n\nAlthough the corporate sector as a whole is now reasonably healthy, there still is a significant constraint on the availability of credit to small business.  Fiscal policy has become restrictive as state and local governments have cut expenditures in response to revenue shortfalls;  and the uncertainty about how Congress and the Administration will address the 2013 federal “fiscal cliff” is likely to inhibit hiring and investment by business.  Global economic growth has slowed as European activity has stagnated and this is capping the demand for U.S. exports. \n\nOn the brighter side, some of these headwinds appear to be subsiding.  Employment growth has picked up somewhat (Figure 3), which should eventually lead to faster household formation and more demand for housing.  U.S. banks are healthier so that credit conditions, while still tight, are gradually easing.  And, households appear quite far along in the deleveraging process by a number of important measures.  For example, the ratio of household debt service relative to income is back to levels last seen in early 1990s (Figure 4).\n\nFor these reasons, I expect that growth will gradually strengthen over the next few years.  Nevertheless, significant downside risks remain, especially those related to the challenges in Europe and how the potential “fiscal cliff” in the United States will be resolved after the fall elections.  Even if these risks do not materialize, I anticipate only slow progress toward full employment.\n\nOn the inflation side, in recent years our forecasts have been noticeably more accurate than on the growth side, and we have succeeded in delivering inflation very close to our 2 percent price stability objective.  Through March, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures deflator, overall consumer prices have risen 2.1 percent over the past 12 months, and prices excluding food and energy have risen 2.0 percent (Figure 5).\n\nBut price trends have been a bit stickier than one might have anticipated given the large amount of slack in the economy.  To some degree, this likely reflects the anchoring exerted by stable inflation expectations.  But some of the price pressures can be attributed to other, more temporary, factors:\n\nSome of these upward pressures on inflation appear to be fading. Oil and gasoline prices have fallen in recent months.  Apparel price inflation should gradually ease, given the sharp drop seen in cotton prices.  Owners’ equivalent rent should also eventually stabilize as multi-family construction picks up and programs that shift real estate owned by banks to investors so they can be rented gear up. \n\nMore generally, there are several reasons to think that inflation will remain moderate and close to our objective. First, and most obviously, the economy continues to operate with significant slack.  Second, measures of underlying inflation show little upward pressure.  In fact, one—the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Underlying Inflation Gauge—is turning down.  This measure uses a very wide set of variables to forecast the underlying inflation trend (Figure 6). Third, it is hard to be very concerned about inflation risks when the growth rate of nominal labor compensation is so low and stable.  It is noteworthy to me that the employment cost index has risen only 2.1 percent over the past four quarters and has shown no acceleration (Figure 7). Fourth, inflation expectations remain well-anchored (Figure 8). This is critically important because inflation expectations are an important driver of actual inflation outcomes. Taking into account the current stance of monetary policy, I anticipate that inflation will decline to slightly below our 2 percent long-run objective over the next few years.\n\nSo what does this all imply for monetary policy?  I currently anticipate that the Federal Reserve’s federal funds rate target will remain exceptionally low—that is at the current level—at least through late 2014.\n\nThis policy setting is more accommodative than the setting prescribed by the Taylor 1999 rule discussed earlier.8  Using the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s current staff forecast, the Taylor 1999 rule—unadjusted for the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet actions —implies liftoff in 2014.9 \n\nBut this is incomplete because it does not incorporate any adjustment for the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet actions.  I estimate that the current balance sheet provides the equivalent of roughly 150 to 200 additional basis points of federal funds rate easing.10 But as time passes, we will come closer to the date when the balance sheet will begin to be normalized.  This implies that the amount of stimulus from the balance sheet will gradually lessen over time.  Putting these adjustments into the Taylor 1999 formulation would pull the liftoff date to 2013 (Figure 9).\n\nSo, why do I believe the policy that promotes the best achievable path back to our dual mandate objectives should be more accommodative than that implied by Taylor 1999—adjusted or unadjusted?  Taylor 1999, like other simple rules, does not take into account two key considerations:\n\nI don’t believe that the standard Taylor 1999 formulation is a good guide for policy right now because the neutral real rate assumption embedded in this rule of 2 percent simply doesn’t look plausible.  This is important because the degree of stimulus depends not on the current policy setting but on the difference between the current level and the neutral level. For example, a short-term rate that appears highly stimulative under standard assumptions may in fact be much less so under alternative estimates of the neutral real rate.  If the neutral real rate has fallen, as I believe it has, then the entire trajectory of short-term rates implied by Taylor 1999 shifts down and this pushes back the liftoff date implied by Taylor 1999 significantly. \n\nSo how strong is the evidence that the neutral real rate has fallen significantly at least in the short term?  First, and most importantly, if the neutral real rate were really 2 percent, then the U.S. economy should be growing faster11 as monetary policy would be extraordinarily stimulative right now.  But, if that is the case, then why do we see such a lackluster economic performance?  Thomas Laubach and John Williams have devised a means of estimating how the equilibrium real interest rate varies over time based on how the economy has actually performed.  The estimate generated by their model for the first quarter of 2012 is 0.3 percent.12 \n\nSecond, we can identify good reasons why the neutral real rate is depressed currently. The channels through which monetary policy stimulates the economy are weaker than normal right now.13 \n\nMonetary policy works through its effect on financial conditions that influence economic activity.  Thus, the linkage between the policy setting and the economy can be affected by changes in the relationships between policy and financial conditions or between financial conditions and the economy. \n\nLet’s consider the linkage between the policy setting and financial conditions first.  In my view, the major components of financial conditions include: 1) the value of the equity market; 2) the level of real interest rates across the yield curve; 3) the level of credit spreads; 4) the availability of credit; and 5) the exchange value of the dollar.  There are certainly others, but these are probably the most important ones.  If we look at these financial indicators as a set, financial conditions do not appear to be unusually tight or easy in aggregate: \n\nSimilarly, there is evidence that the linkage between financial conditions and economic activity is attenuated as well. The most obvious example of this is the housing sector. But the subdued overall rate of credit expansion for both households and the business sector is also noteworthy. This has occurred despite a monetary policy that would be judged on its face as one of the most stimulative in history. \n\nFinally, market expectations suggest that the equilibrium real rate of interest will remain depressed.  To me, it is particularly noteworthy that the real forward interest rate expected 5 to 10 years in the future is currently only 0.3 percent.  It has been moving lower recently and is far lower than at any time in recent memory (Figure 15). While this pattern likely reflects in part a very low term premium, it may also be driven by an assessment that the equilibrium real rate has fallen and will remain unusually low for years.\n\nThis evidence implies that current circumstances warrant the use of a significantly lower neutral real short-term rate in the Taylor Rule formulations.  As economic conditions normalize, supported by accommodative monetary policy, the neutral interest rate presumably would gradually rise back toward its long run level over time.  For example, adjusting Taylor 1999 for a zero percent neutral real rate that gradually normalizes over time would push liftoff beyond 2014 (Figure 16).\n\nRisk management considerations also suggest that a more stimulative monetary policy than prescribed by Taylor 1999 is appropriate.  In particular, simple policy rules implicitly treat the welfare losses generated by deviations from the central forecast path symmetrically.  But I don’t believe that the potential losses are currently symmetric. In my view, the distribution of potential outcomes is currently skewed to the downside, reflecting risks posed by developments in Europe and the impending U.S. fiscal cliff. \n\nMoreover, the costs associated with such downside outcomes are likely to be considerably higher than the costs of realizing upside surprises.  For example, consider two alternative scenarios:  an economy that grows very quickly, but starting with some genuine spare capacity, versus an economy operating way below potential that stagnates, pushing the United States into a liquidity trap. \n\nIn the first case, we have good tools with which to respond.  As the economy moved closer to full employment, we could raise short-term interest rates and subsequently sell assets from our portfolio.  By doing this, we would tighten financial conditions, slow the economy and ensure it remained on a path consistent with our dual mandate objectives.  The losses to society from this scenario should not be very large, provided we act in a manner that keeps medium-term inflation expectations in check. \n\nBut the losses to society may be very high in the second case.  That is because—as Japan has discovered over the past two decades—once in a liquidity trap it is not easy to return to full employment and price stability.  Pinned at the lower bound, we don’t have as good a set of tools as we would ordinarily have to push the economy back toward our dual mandate objectives.  As a result of this asymmetry, we should give somewhat more weight to avoiding the liquidity trap outcome. \n\nEmbedded within the traditional Taylor Rule formulations is the implicit return path back to full employment and price stability that the FOMC achieved in the past when faced with shocks that pushed economic activity below its potential level.14 \n\nIn the current economic cycle, I think it is apparent that the path back to the Fed’s dual mandate objectives has been much slower than the one that the FOMC found acceptable in the past.  Growth has consistently been disappointing relative to both our own and consensus forecasts.  Recent performance and forecasts relative to the dual mandate objectives suggest that standard rules calibrated in earlier times understate the degree of accommodation required to achieve the desired return path to the dual mandate objectives.\n\nWe should focus on how fast we are moving toward our employment and inflation objectives, and be wary of the risks that we see around that path.  If progress toward the mandate objectives is slower than desired, then this is telling us that monetary policy needs to be kept at a more accommodative setting for a longer time period than a standard rule would suggest. As downside risks continue to be present, the case for accommodation is even stronger.\n\nGiven our forecast of stable prices and a still slow path back to full employment, there is an argument for easing further. But, unfortunately, our tools have costs associated with them as well as benefits.  Thus, we must weigh these costs against the benefits of further action.\n\nAs long as the U.S. economy continues to grow sufficiently fast to cut into the nation’s unused economic resources at a meaningful pace, I think the benefits from further action are unlikely to exceed the costs.  But if the economy were to slow so that we were no longer making material progress toward full employment, the downside risks to growth were to increase sharply, or if deflation risks were to climb materially, then the benefits of further accommodation would increase in my estimation and this could tilt the balance toward additional easing. \n\nUnder such circumstances, further balance sheet action might be called for. We could choose between further extension of the duration of the Federal Reserve’s existing Treasury portfolio and another large-scale asset purchase program of Treasuries or agency mortgage-backed securities. \n\nConversely, I would be willing to consider tightening policy at a somewhat earlier stage if growth strengthened sufficiently to materially improve the medium-term outlook and substantially reduce tail risks, or if there was evidence of a genuine threat to medium-term inflation, including a rise in inflation expectations. In such a case, I would anticipate that the first step would be to bring in the late 2014 date of the policy guidance.  This would effectively tighten financial conditions not only by changing the expected path of short-term interest rates, but also by bringing forward the expected start of balance sheet normalization. \n\nTo sum up, I see substantial advantages in behaving in as systematic fashion as possible in setting monetary policy.  But that should be done in a way that fully accounts for any constraints on policy imposed by the economic environment, the presence of asymmetric risks, and allows us to learn as we go.  The fact is that the economy is recovering after an unusually deep recession and a severe financial crisis. We don’t have much experience with this type of episode and how the economy is likely to perform. What we need to focus on is not what interest rate a given rule generates, but what policy setting can be expected to deliver the appropriate return path to the dual mandate objectives—the type of return path that standard Taylor Rule formulations achieved in different economic circumstances in the past.\n\nThank you very much for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions. \n\n_____________________________________________________\n\n2 The policy response to the extreme shock of the financial crisis was predictably vigorous, even if its detail was hard to specify in advance, and the knowledge that the Federal Reserve would act “as needed” to promote the dual mandate anchored inflation expectations and helped to avoid a deflation outcome.\n\n3 In formal terms, this approach would be described as a target-rule or forecast-targeting rule.\n\n4 In practice, so-called inflation-targeting central banks also tend to take into account employment and other aspects of the real economy; hence, their approach is often referred to as “flexible inflation targeting.”\n\n5 More formally, a Taylor Rule can be represented as:\n\n FFR = r* + π + a(π-π*) + b[100(Y-Y*)/Y*]\n\nwhere:\nFFR = federal funds rate\nr* = neutral real federal funds rate\nπ = rate of inflation\nπ* = target inflation rate\nY = output\nY* = output at full employment\na = weight put on inflation gap\nb = weight put on output gap\n\n6 Over the past 25 years, CPI inflation has averaged about 30 basis points to 50 basis points above PCE inflation.\n\n7 For Taylor 1993, the output gap and inflation gap parameters are both 0.5.  For the Taylor 1999 version, which updates the original formulation to take into account data over a longer period of time, the output gap parameter is 1.0:\nTaylor 1993  FFR=2% + π + 0.5(π-2%) + 0.5[100(Y-Y*)/Y*]\nTaylor 1999  FFR=2% + π +0.5(π-2%) + 1.0[100(Y-Y*)/Y*]\n\n8 In contrast, optimal control simulations using FRBUS put the federal funds rate liftoff in 2015; see Vice Chair Yellen’s speech of April 12 (http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20120411a.htm).\n\n9 For more details on this forecast, go to: http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2012/05/just-released-the-new-york-fed-staff-forecast-may-2012.html.\n\n10 This estimate should be considered very imprecise.  To generate this estimate we first need to estimate how much long-term rates have been pushed down because of the Federal Reserve balance sheet programs.  Although there is considerable uncertainty, New York Fed staff has estimated that the Fed’s programs have pushed down the term premium by about 50 basis points. \n\nThe question then becomes how much would the federal funds rate have to fall to generate the same result?  That depends on how changes in the federal funds rate pass through to longer-term interest rates.  If reductions in the federal funds rate were viewed as permanent, then the pass-through would presumably be 1 to 1.  However, if the federal funds rate reductions were viewed as fully transitory, then there would be virtually no pass-through.  Econometric estimates indicate a value of about 4 to 1, a four basis points reduction in the federal funds rate would lead to a one basis point reduction in long-term rates.  However, this degree of pass-through seems too low in the current environment in which the reductions in the federal funds rate have been in place for some time and are expected to continue for several more years.  If one assumes a parameter value of 3 to 4 and uses 50 basis points as the estimate of the balance sheet impact on longer-term rates, then this implies that these actions have been equivalent to a 150 to 200 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate currently. \n\nAs the onset of balance sheet normalization comes closer over time, the effect of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet actions on the term premium will gradually diminish.  This means that the size of the federal funds rate adjustment should also diminish over time. \n\n11 Or, if we were wrong about spare capacity, inflation should be higher.\n\n12 See Thomas Laubach and John Williams, “Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest,” Review of Economics and Statistics, November 2003, pp.1063-1070.  The link to the updated estimates is: http://www.frbsf.org/economics/economists/jwilliams/Laubach_Williams_updated_estimates.xls.\n\n13 Impairment to the transmission mechanism implies that the neutral rate that neither stimulates nor slows the economy will be lower than it would otherwise be.\n\n14 Obviously, there is a cost to those who are unemployed longer than necessary with no offsetting gain in terms of greater price stability.  But there also is another potential long-run cost.  Those who have been unemployed for a long period of time may lose their job skills and become less employable in the future.  This can push up the non-inflationary rate of unemployment (NAIRU).  Not only is this bad for those who are unemployed due to the loss of their job skills, it is bad for the nation as a whole because the rise in the NAIRU lowers the effective productive capacity of the economy and, with it, the capacity of the country to service its debts."

        "content": "It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak here today. As I see it, the complex interconnections that exist between the real and financial sectors of the economy, both within and between countries, have important implications for both macroeconomic and regulatory policy. In particular, cross-border coordination in both realms is warranted. Often, macroeconomic and regulatory policies are too narrow in their focus. At times, policies are designed with the goal of being “best” at the national level. Yet the resulting mix of national policies is distinctly inferior to what a well-coordinated global regime could have produced.\n\nToday I will discuss two important challenges that go along with living in an interconnected world. The first is how to define what aspects of macroeconomic policy or regulation require greater international coordination and harmonization. Some issues can be handled effectively at a national level, but the crisis has demonstrated clearly that many can not. The second challenge is how to make international coordination workable so that progress can be made in a timely manner while still preserving sufficient autonomy for countries to fashion policies to suit their particular idiosyncratic structures. As always, my remarks today reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System. \n\nWe live in a globalized economy in which the flows of products, capital, and ideas across borders have led to significant economic gains for literally hundreds of millions of people around the world. Thus, there is a strong public interest in ensuring that this global economic integration is supported by a coherent set of coordinated national macroeconomic policies and a harmonized international regulatory regime. This applies to the policy actions we undertake to reduce economic imbalances as well as to the regulations we develop to address the vulnerabilities in our financial system that were exposed by the crisis. The better we are able to develop cooperative global solutions to these types of issues, the more successful we will be in creating a sounder and more sustainable global economy and financial system.\n\nIt is clear that there were important imbalances in both economic and financial activity in the years preceding the financial crisis. For example, in the U.S., too much of economic activity was based on an unsustainable housing boom. The turmoil in financial markets that was unleashed when the boom collapsed subsequently forced the U.S. and other countries to undergo significant adjustments. These adjustments were often sudden. They transmitted large shocks across the global economy. These shocks, in turn, necessitated other adjustments in trade, investment, and in financial markets elsewhere. \n\nMore generally, we know that the global economy operates under an important constraint—the sum of trade balances around the world, properly measured, must add up to zero. When one country follows policies that are designed to increase exports, there must be an offsetting adjustment elsewhere—either higher imports or fewer exports by another country. Similarly, there is the same adding up constraint in terms of the financial flows that accompany trade and investment on the capital account—current account balances around the world—again properly measured—must add up to zero. \n\nWhat this means in practical terms is that the outcomes for economic activity and capital flows for any individual country depend not only on the public policy and private decisions made within that country, but also on policies and mix of activities pursued in other countries. For example, for Germany to have a large trade surplus with the rest of Europe, other European countries must run trade deficits. And if Germany runs such surpluses it must accumulate large financial claims on the other countries. Or, if the U.S. has an unsustainably high level of consumption, the adjustment to a lower, more sustainable level must be offset by greater investment and exports if the U.S. economy is to be able to operate close to full employment. \n\nThe fact that it takes (at least) two to tango to make these types of adjustments is just another way of saying that our economies are interconnected. In order for the U.S. to reduce its dependence on consumption and to increase its exports, there need to be offsetting adjustments in other countries, such as China. Thus, the key issue to consider in crafting internationally coordinated macroeconomic policy is not whether these adjustments will ultimately take place. They will take place because they have to take place. Instead, the issue for policymakers is whether the policies we put in place will allow adjustments to occur in a way that is consistent with a stable global economy, high levels of employment, and low inflation.\n\nAt times, the situation is akin to the Prisoner’s Dilemma—a non-cooperative approach will lead to inferior results for both players compared to a cooperative approach in which each side foregoes the chance for highest potential payoff in exchange for the payoff that maximizes returns jointly. But effective cooperation that leads to higher joint returns is difficult in this game because of the complexity of the inter-linkages and the political and institutional constraints that constrain the scope for action at the national level.\n\nIn macroeconomic terms, the prospects for achieving a more cooperative solution can be enhanced by policy transparency so that the policy goals and reaction function of each authority can be well understood by others. This again applies both within and across countries. For example, the Federal Reserve is making efforts to provide greater clarity about its inflation objective in the context of the dual mandate. In doing so, the Fed is also continuing to underscore that actions such as our purchase of U.S. government securities are driven exclusively by our monetary policy goals, and that these policy actions will not continue beyond the moment they become inconsistent with our dual mandate objectives. In general, policymakers should strive to ensure that we have both fiscal and monetary policy frameworks that are transparent and viewed as credible and durable.  \n\nInterconnectedness means that events—be it the tragedy of a Japanese earthquake and tsunami, a revolution in Libya, or a financial crisis sparked by a housing boom and bust in the United States—can be transmitted to domestic economies located far away from the initial source of shock, often at market-speed measured in milliseconds. This interconnectedness underscores our common interest in cooperating not just to facilitate needed economic adjustments, but also to address fragilities in our interconnected global financial system.\n\nI think coordination on regulatory matters differs from on macroeconomic issues in two important respects. First, the benefits to cooperation and coordination on certain aspects of regulation seem easier to identify up front. Second, while policy coordination on regulatory issues is also very challenging, it may not be quite as difficult as in the macroeconomic realm.  The stakeholders are not typically as numerous or diffuse, the problems are generally easier to identify, the gains from a cooperative solution are more obvious, and the cooperative solutions themselves may be easier to implement. \n\nOn the regulatory side, I’ll start with a few broad observations. First, it is essential that regulations be harmonized internationally to a much greater degree than in the past. This will ensure there is a common minimum level of standards, which in turn will help discourage regulatory arbitrage and a “race to the bottom”.\n\nSecond, it is critical that the harmonized regulations produce something that is coherent and effective on an international level, and that the different regimes in specific jurisdictions add up to a workable whole. \n\nThird, regulatory harmonization and cooperation, by necessity requires trust and a willingness to share relevant information across jurisdictions. A corollary to this is that national regulators need to be willing to constrain their unilateral actions somewhat in order to facilitate engagement and cooperative solutions on a global basis.  \n\nIn this respect, I think there are two areas where considerable progress has been made since the crisis—the capital regulation of globally active banking organizations and the establishment of global standards for financial market infrastructures. The first initiative is designed to ensure that globally active firms have sufficient capital to keep their risk of failure very low. The second initiative is designed to strengthen the financial market infrastructure so that if a large globally systemic firm were to fail, this event would not threaten to bring down the entire financial system.\n\nBut even in these areas there still is much to do. With respect to Basel III, it is important that the regime be implemented on a consistent basis around the world.  In particular, the definitions of capital must not be watered down and risk-weighted asset calculations must be done in a consistent manner around the world.  An identical portfolio of assets should generate a comparable amount of risk-weighted assets regardless of the country in which the bank’s home office is domiciled.  \n\nWith respect to standards for financial market infrastructures, the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures, which were published last month, are an important step forward.  These principles establish the minimum standard for important FMIs around the world. \n\nBut the establishment of these standards is just the first step. National authorities now need to ensure that their domestic regulatory regimes embody these principles, and these national regimes have to be credibly assessed for ongoing conformance to the new standards.   \n\nGlobal standards for financial market infrastructures are necessary if we are to build a safe global system of central counterparty clearinghouse (CCPs) infrastructures though which to clear standardized over-the-counter derivatives trades around the world. For national regulators to be comfortable with such an arrangement there has to be an appropriate level of information exchange and cooperative oversight, and the Principles explicitly mandate this. Although cross-border information exchange and cooperative oversight are certainly not new—the coordination of currency settlement around the world through CLS is one important example—the model has to be further developed and adopted more broadly across a wider range of important global financial market infrastructures. \n\nHow we proceed from here will be critical to our success in building a global financial system that is both stable and efficient. By facilitating the greatest netting down of risk, global CCPs through which all standardized OTC derivatives trades would be cleared, hold out the potential for the greatest amount of risk reduction and, thus, improvement in financial stability. But, for that outcome to occur, there needs to be a global oversight framework that ensures that the CCPs are held to global standards—not just in theory, but also in practice.  \n\nThere are other areas where we face significant challenges in effective global information exchange and regulatory cooperation. We have much more to do to develop resolution regimes for globally systemic financial institutions, including establishing the rules of the game for the exchange of supervisory data for such firms, in clearly identifying ex ante the responsibilities of home and host countries in terms of potential liquidity support, and in overseeing the orderly wind-downs of such firms when they encounter difficulties.\n\nThe exchange of supervisory information is important both for understanding the consolidated condition of a bank that operates in a host country, and for gaining insights into broader financial stability issues. For example, giving supervisors in host countries improved access to consolidated balance sheet information for foreign firms operating in their jurisdiction would allow for a more accurate assessment of a firm’s liquidity position and funding plans.\n\nAnother area where there needs to be greater international cooperation is in defining the roles of home and host countries especially during times of stress. What is the responsibility, for example, of the host country to provide lender-of–last- resort liquidity to foreign firms operating in their jurisdiction? At what stage, if any, does that responsibility shift to home country? Should these responsibilities change depending on the degree of information exchange or the degree or duration of stress?  \n\nOn the resolution front, we know that the benefits of a harmonized global regime would be substantial. By providing greater transparency to investors and depositors about the rules of the game in the event of distress, such a regime would likely reduce the likelihood of runs and financial panics while also allowing financial intermediation to occur on a global basis.\n\nHowever, it is proving challenging for some jurisdictions to provide clarity around how an orderly resolution would be implemented in practice. At the same time, this lack of clarity within jurisdictions is contributing to and exacerbated by the lack of a harmonized approach across different legal and regulatory regimes. Many questions must be answered:  How would different creditor and counterparty claims be treated? Who would provide the bridge financing to facilitate the orderly liquidation? Would the home country regime ensure equal treatment of all banks’ claims around the world, regardless of jurisdiction or legal entity? Would there be clarity about this, ex ante?\n\nIf an effective global resolution regime with clearly defined ex ante characteristics were to turn out to be a bridge too far, national authorities may have to fall back on a subsidiarization model, in which global firms would have to establish subsidiaries on a country-by-country basis each with their own capital and liquidity buffers. Such a regime would require greater capital and liquidity as the banks would lose the significant risk diversification benefits gained from operating in many different countries. Such a regime would also presumably make it more difficult for these firms to provide financial services seamlessly to multinational corporations, global asset managers, and others that operate on an international basis. Even in this scenario, however, it would be important to ensure that national resolution regimes could interact with each other in a coherent manner.\n\nTo sum up, my view is that we live in a globalized world both with respect to the macro-economy and the financial system. But too often we set macroeconomic policy and regulatory policy at a national level, and miss important opportunities to coordinate and make the global economic and financial system stronger overall. We need to understand where greater global perspective is required and we need to apply that perspective consistently across jurisdictions in a timely manner. If we don’t do this, we won’t achieve all the benefits that are possible from global specialization and we will continue to run significant risks with respect to financial stability.\n\nThank you for your kind attention."

        "content": "Good morning, I am pleased to be here in Buffalo to address the Buffalo-Niagara Partnership.  It is always a pleasure to speak with the business community because of the leadership role you play in the economy of the region.  I thank you all for inviting me here today.\n\nI try to get out of my office in New York City as much as I can to get a sense of regional economic conditions across the second Federal Reserve District.   I was last here in Buffalo in 2010 and, more recently, I traveled to West Point and the Capital region and Long Island.     \n\nThese visits are just as important as any trip I might take to Washington, D.C., to help formulate monetary policy, or to Switzerland, to help shape international bank regulation.  Each visit within the region helps me to deepen the relationships with the people I represent.  I believe that the understanding of issues and concerns that I gain today will help ensure that the Fed’s policy decisions reflect the public interest.\n\nToday, I want to talk a bit about the Fed—what we do and why we do it. Then I’ll provide some thoughts about the economic outlook nationally and locally.  After that, I’ll be happy to answer any questions you have about what the Fed does and why, and about the economic outlook.\n\nAs always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee, also known as the FOMC.\n\nWhat the New York Fed Does\n\nBy way of introduction, I will briefly review what my colleagues and I do at the New York Fed on behalf of the Second District.\n\nI have the great fortune to serve as vice chair of the FOMC that meets eight times a year in Washington to set interest rates and make other decisions about monetary policy.  The members of this committee all strive to set policy to advance the mandate given to us by Congress to promote the maximum level of employment consistent with price stability.  Sometimes we have different views on the specific policy choice at hand, and you should view this as completely appropriate: these are hard questions—particularly during difficult economic circumstances such as we face today.   In fact, I think we make better decisions as a committee because we don't all think alike.  But we are united in our commitment to our dual mandate and in our belief that Fed independence is essential to the public interest.  That independence allows us to make tough decisions insulated from short-term political pressures.\n\nAt FOMC meetings, each Committee member presents a current outlook for his or her region and the nation.  For these assessments, we consult our researchers and add critical information that we learn from listening to our boards of directors, regional advisory councils and community leaders, such as you and others I'll meet on this visit. For example, last month members of our small business advisory council told us that for the first time in several years, employees were leaving for other jobs and that they would need to replace those who left for better opportunities elsewhere.  The fact that some people with jobs felt confident enough to seek and take other job opportunities was another signal to us that the job market may be improving—although, to be sure, we read such signals cautiously.   \n\nTo help me gather more information about the region, yesterday, I had breakfast in Syracuse with business and community leaders at the Center for Economic Development.  Then I met with the staff of PathStone, a community development organization, met faculty and students at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University and had lunch with university officials who manage the tech transfer process.  In the afternoon, we drove to Skaneateles Falls to tour Welch Allyn, a manufacturer of medical diagnostic instruments.   Dr. Julie Shimer is the president and CEO.  Dr. Shimer was also recently appointed chair of the Empire State Development Corporation, and we talked about challenges and opportunities for economic development in New York State.   \n\nAfter this morning’s gathering, I will speak with staff of the Empire Justice Center, meet with Lt. Governor Bob Duffy, convene a meeting of our Upstate Advisory Board, whose members are major leaders in the upstate economy, and visit the Roswell Park Cancer Institute to learn about their role in economic development in western New York and in the broader world arena.\n\nMy colleagues and I at the New York Fed continually track conditions in our District, and we have created a number of tools for that purpose. For example, my staff produces monthly indexes of economic activity for New York City, the state of New York and New Jersey.  These indexes are essentially measures of local output—similar to gross domestic product, or GDP, at the national level.  These measures provide a more complete gauge of activity than the employment report, which is another important metric at the state level.  We have also constructed a consumer credit panel to track local household credit conditions at the county and even the zip code level, including the amount and type of personal debt and whether payments are being made in a timely way.\n\nIn addition, we conduct a periodic poll about the credit needs of small businesses, which are an important source of new jobs.  We are just launching our latest poll that also includes questions about the skill needs of small businesses and whether the right kinds of skilled labor are available.  Almost 900 regional businesses responded to our last poll, some of which were from this region.  If you, as a representative of a small business, would like to participate in our current poll, please pass your card to my colleagues, who are in the audience, or see me after the speech and we will be glad to add you as a respondent.\n\nResults from prior polls stressed the problem of access to capital.  In response we held two workshops at the Bank last December.  In the first workshop, senior officers from the Export-Import Bank, the Small Business Administration and the Department of Commerce described the various loan programs available to small businesses from their agencies, as well as programs to help identify markets.  The second workshop reviewed the business plans of 40 small businesses and then matched them with potential lenders.  We plan to hold a similar workshop in Upstate New York this year. \n\nAs you know, even states that are wealthier, such as New York, have large pockets of poverty. So, we target some of our work specifically to low- and moderate-income groups. \n\nWe have worked hard to help neighborhoods that face high foreclosure rates, although much remains to be done.  We have provided housing advocates with the latest information on mortgage conditions, via mortgage briefs, roundtables, presentations and newsletters.  We have now developed an interactive online tool that shows monthly delinquency and foreclosure conditions, which we believe will aid the work of housing counselors and other parties seeking to help these communities.  It is available on our website along with other data and information useful to policymakers, business people and the general public. \n\nWe use our website to share what we learn about our diverse District, and you will find detailed information about the region at the site.  I invite you to visit newyorkfed.org to explore our highly localized maps and information on small business, credit and housing conditions and even the latest job openings at the New York Fed.\n\nFinally, and crucially, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, we are working with our colleagues in Washington, D.C., and at other agencies to help put the nation's financial system on a firmer footing.   Our supervisors are working hard to ensure that our District’s banks are operating safely and soundly.  Although much has been done, we are not finished and are determined to keep at it. I recognize fully that there can be no return to pre-crisis business as usual—whether on the part of the financial sector or on the part of regulators like ourselves.\n\nAll in all, there is a lot to keep myself and my colleagues busy.\n\nNational Economic Conditions\n\nNow I’d like to turn to the national and regional economy.  The incoming data on the U.S. economy generally has been a bit more upbeat over the past few months, suggesting that the recovery may be finally establishing a somewhat firmer footing.  Real GDP expanded at a 3.0 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2011, the fastest growth since the first half of 2010.  The average monthly job gain was 212,000 in the first quarter of 2012, up from 164,000 in the fourth quarter.  Sales of light-weight motor vehicles were about 14 ½ million at an annual rate in the first quarter, the best quarter for vehicle sales in four years.  Survey measures of business activity have rebounded from their dips in the middle of last year, and are now at levels that typically indicate solid overall growth.  Even housing starts have firmed somewhat in the last few months, although they remain at depressed levels.\n\nWhile these developments are certainly encouraging, it is still too soon to conclude that we are out of the woods.  To begin with, the economic data looked brighter at this point in 2010 and again in 2011, only to fade later in those years.\n\nMoreover, the United States experienced unusually mild weather over the first quarter, with the number of heating degree days more than 20 percent below the average of the preceding five years, which may have pulled forward some economic activity and hiring.  \n\nIn this regard, the somewhat softer March labor market report that was released last Friday may reflect the earlier positive influence of the mild weather on job creation in January and February, although other less sanguine interpretations are also plausible.  We thus will need to see more data to determine the extent to which the March data represent a transitory weather-related setback. \n\nRegardless of the importance of the mild winter in distorting the economic data, real economic activity has yet to be strong enough on a sustained basis to make a big dent in the overall amount of slack in the U.S. economy.  While growth was stronger in the fourth quarter, most of it was due to inventory accumulation.  Growth of final sales remained quite weak.  Historically, quarters in which inventory investment makes significant growth contributions are typically followed by quarters in which that growth contribution is modest or even negative.  That appears to be what is shaping up for the first quarter of this year. \n\nBased on available data, our current expectations are that real GDP will expand at around a 2 ¼ percent annual rate during the first quarter of 2012.  Even with the robust increase of light vehicle sales, overall consumer spending in the first quarter appears to be rising at a similar moderate rate.  At the same time, real disposable income has been flat over the past three months, and the large increase of gasoline prices is likely further sapping consumers’ real purchasing power. And growth of business investment spending, which softened in the fourth quarter of 2011, may have been even a little softer in the first quarter of this year.\n\nTo put the recent pace of growth into perspective, we believe that the economy’s long-run sustainable growth rate—what economists call the potential growth rate—is around a 2 ¼ percent annual rate.  We need sustained growth above that rate to absorb the still substantial amount of unused productive capacity.  Thus, our recent growth rates are barely keeping up with our potential. \n\nEven though the unemployment rate has declined sharply from 9 percent last September to 8.2 percent in March, it is still unacceptably high.  In addition, many other measures of the labor market remain weak.  The labor force participation rate, the percentage of people employed, and the total number of hours worked in the economy all dropped sharply during the recession and remain well below their pre-recession levels, even taking into account the impact of demographic shifts.  Also, it appears that productivity growth has slumped recently.  Although that means that a given amount of growth translates into bigger employment gains, it certainly is not an unmitigated positive development.\n\nAlso, we cannot lose sight of the fact that the economy still faces significant headwinds and that there are some meaningful downside risks.  In the headwinds department, I would include the run-up in gasoline prices mentioned earlier because that will sap purchasing power, the continued impediments to a strong recovery from ongoing weakness in the housing sector, and fiscal drag at the federal and state and local levels.  In terms of downside risks, these include the risk that growth abroad disappoints and the risk of further disruptions to the supply of oil and higher oil prices.  \n\nOn the inflation front, the overall rate of increase of consumer prices, as measured by the 12-month change of the price index for personal consumption expenditures, slowed to 2.3 percent in February from a recent peak of 2.9 percent last September.  Even though the recent rise of gasoline prices mentioned above could interrupt this pattern, we expect this moderation of overall inflation to resume later this year. \n\nWhile the underlying core inflation rate, that strips out volatile food and energy prices, has been somewhat higher than expected a few months back, it appears that the annual rate of core inflation1 has peaked and we expect it to begin to decline later this year.2  Finally, inflation expectations, which play an important role in the inflation process, remain well anchored.  By this I mean that people expect that the rate of inflation will continue to be relatively low for some time to come.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions\n\nSo how is the recovery proceeding in the state and the region?  As I mentioned, the New York Fed produces indexes that help us track economic activity in the region.  Based on these measures, the economic recovery that began in New York State in late 2009 has continued through early 2012, and even gained some momentum.  \n\nAcross Upstate New York, the cycle of recession and recovery has been much less pronounced than in the nation, which means that the region has been more stable in recent years than many other places around the country. This has been particularly true in Buffalo, which experienced an employment decline of about 3½ percent during the downturn—a significant loss, to be sure—but well below the over 6 percent decline that occurred nationally.\n\nOne reason why Upstate New York weathered the storm better than the nation as a whole is the resiliency of its housing markets. Like much of Upstate New York, Buffalo’s housing market has proven to be more stable than many other parts of the country.  In fact, since the peak of the national housing market in early 2006, home prices in the Buffalo area have increased by about 10 percent, compared with a decline of more than 30 percent nationally.  As a result, the drop-off in economic activity that is connected, directly and indirectly, to the performance of the housing sector has not been as severe here as in many other places around the country.\n\nThis stability is underscored by our latest quarterly consumer credit panel data, which shows that total household debt burdens have remained relatively low by national standards and that mortgage delinquency rates are lower in the Buffalo area than in other parts of the state and nation.\n\nThe recovery is proceeding in Buffalo, slowly but surely. So far, the region has gained back nearly 12,000 of the roughly 20,000 jobs it lost during the downturn.  This is somewhat faster progress than the nation has made, although, in part, that’s because the downturn was less severe here.\n\nOne particularly good bit of news is that for the first time in decades, manufacturing has been a source of job growth in the region, rather than decline, adding more than 3,000 jobs over the past few years. That’s nearly twice the pace of growth of the U.S. manufacturing sector.\n\nThat said, it is somewhat worrying that the pace of the recovery locally has actually slowed in recent months just as the national recovery has started to gain some momentum.  Despite this recent slowdown, I believe there are reasons to be optimistic about Buffalo’s longer-term outlook. In particular, the decades long economic restructuring that has occurred in the region has resulted in a more diversified economy. While the region still maintains a strong manufacturing presence, it is no longer the main source of jobs in the area.  In its place, the health and education sectors have emerged as important sources of job opportunity and economic development potential.  These sectors have provided stability to the region through the recession and recovery.\n\nThe recent announcement of Governor Cuomo’s $1 billion economic development pledge to the region is another positive development.  This commitment represents a tremendous opportunity for the region to accelerate the economic transformation already underway.  Therefore, it is important for the community to think strategically about how best to use these funds to leverage the region’s existing strengths.\n\nBuffalo’s colleges and universities deserve special attention within this strategy.  Not only do these institutions produce highly skilled labor, they also promote innovation by creating new knowledge and inventions through academic research and development.  It can be especially beneficial for local businesses to take advantage of both the knowledge created and the availability of research facilities at local colleges and universities.\n\nPartnerships between private industry and higher-education institutions are an important ingredient in this regard.  Going forward, I believe these partnerships will become more important than ever—particularly for places like Buffalo that continue to undergo economic restructuring. Fortunately, the region has a strong higher education sector in place.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo sum up, the incoming data on the U.S. economy has been a bit more upbeat of late, suggesting that the recovery may be getting better established.  But, while these developments are certainly encouraging, it is far too soon to conclude that we are out of the woods in terms of generating a strong, sustainable recovery.  On the inflation front, the year-over-year rate of consumer price inflation has slowed in recent months, and despite the recent rise of gasoline prices, we expect inflation to moderate further in 2012.\n\nHere in Buffalo, the economic restructuring has positioned the region’s health and education sector as a potentially solid base for longer-term growth.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions."

That appears to be what is shaping up for the first quarter of this year. \n\nBased on available data, our current expectations are that real GDP will expand at around a 2 ¼ percent annual rate during the first quarter of 2012.  Even with the robust increase of light vehicle sales, overall consumer spending in the first quarter appears to be rising at a similar moderate rate.  At the same time, real disposable income has been flat over the past three months, and the large increase of gasoline prices is likely further sapping consumers’ real purchasing power.  And growth of business investment spending, which softened in the fourth quarter of 2011, may have been even a little softer in the first quarter of this year.\n\nTo put the recent pace of growth into perspective, we believe that the economy’s long-run sustainable growth rate—what economists call the potential growth rate—is around a 2 ¼ percent annual rate.  We need sustained growth above that rate to absorb the still substantial amount of unused productive capacity.  Thus, our recent growth rates are barely keeping up with our potential. \n\nEven though the unemployment rate has declined sharply from 9 percent last September to 8.2 percent in March, it is still unacceptably high.  In addition, many other measures of the labor market remain weak.  The labor force participation rate, the percentage of people employed, and the total number of hours worked in the economy all dropped sharply during the recession and remain well below their pre-recession levels, even taking into account the impact of demographic shifts.  Also, it appears that productivity growth has slumped recently.  Although that means that a given amount of growth translates into bigger employment gains, it certainly is not an unmitigated positive development.\n\nAlso, we cannot lose sight of the fact that the economy still faces significant headwinds and that there are some meaningful downside risks.  In the headwinds department, I would include the run-up in gasoline prices mentioned earlier because that will sap purchasing power, the continued impediments to a strong recovery from ongoing weakness in the housing sector, and fiscal drag at the federal and state and local levels.  In terms of downside risks, these include the risk that growth abroad disappoints and the risk of further disruptions to the supply of oil and higher oil prices.  \n\nOn the inflation front, the overall rate of increase of consumer prices, as measured by the 12-month change of the price index for personal consumption expenditures slowed to 2.3 percent in February from a recent peak of 2.9 percent last September.  Even though the recent rise of gasoline prices mentioned above could interrupt this pattern, we expect this moderation of overall inflation to resume later this year. \n\nWhile the underlying core inflation rate, that strips out volatile food and energy prices, has been somewhat higher than expected a few months back, it appears that the annual rate of core inflation1 has peaked and we expect it to begin to decline later this year.2  Finally, inflation expectations, which play an important role in the inflation process, remain well anchored.  By this I mean that people expect that the rate of inflation will continue to be relatively low for some time to come.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions\n\nSo how is the recovery proceeding in the state and region?  As I mentioned, the New York Fed produces indexes that help us track economic activity in the region.  Based on these measures, the economic recovery that began in New York State in late 2009 has continued through early 2012, and even gained some momentum.\n\nAcross Upstate New York, broadly speaking, the cycle of recession and recovery has been much less pronounced than in the nation, and even the state as a whole. This pattern has been true in Syracuse, as well. Employment fell by a little over 4 percent during the downturn—a steep drop, to be sure—but only about two-thirds of the decline that occurred nationally.  This is quite a change from the region’s past recessions, which have tended to be longer and deeper than the nation’s.\n\nOne reason why Upstate New York weathered the economic storm a bit better than the nation is the resiliency of its housing markets.  Like much of Upstate New York, Syracuse’s housing market has been relatively stable and did not experience a boom-bust cycle like much of the rest of the nation.  In fact, since the peak of the national housing market in early 2006, home prices in Syracuse have increased by close to 10 percent, compared with a decline of more than 30 percent nationally.\n\nAs a result, the drop off in economic activity that is connected, directly and indirectly, to the performance of the housing sector has not been as severe here as it was in many other places.  This stability is underscored by our latest quarterly consumer credit panel data, which shows that total household debt burdens have remained relatively low by national standards and that mortgage delinquency rates are lower in the Syracuse region than in other parts of the state and nation.\n\nHowever, while the national recovery has started to gain some momentum in recent months, job growth in Syracuse has remained somewhat weak.  To date, the region has regained only about a third of the roughly 13,000 jobs that were lost during the downturn.  So the recovery has been disappointing thus far.   \n\nDespite the weak overall job growth, the region continues to undergo substantial economic restructuring.  And, in fact, many parts of the economy are growing.  Most prominently, the business services sector has added about 2,000 jobs since the recession ended, and the leisure and hospitality sector has also expanded.\n\nAs a result of the economic restructuring in Syracuse, health and education are now among the most important industries in the region, employing roughly a fifth of all workers.  While the “eds and meds” sector experienced some job losses last year, it is generally less susceptible to downturns than other sectors of the economy, and expanded before, during and after the Great Recession. No doubt, the area’s many local colleges and universities play an important role in this regard.\n\nSyracuse’s colleges and universities deserve special attention because they are important regional assets that can help Syracuse continue to actively participate in the knowledge economy.  Our own research at the New York Fed has shown that higher- education institutions can help to build their local area’s skilled workforce, which is critical to the long-run economic success of any region.  These institutions produce highly skilled labor and help their regions innovate by creating new knowledge and inventions through academic research and development.  It can be especially beneficial for local businesses to take advantage of the research facilities available at local colleges and universities.\n\nPartnerships between private industry and higher-education institutions are an important ingredient in this regard.  Going forward, I believe these partnerships will become more important than ever—particularly for places like Syracuse that continue to experience economic restructuring.  Fortunately, this region already has a strong higher education industry in place.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo sum up, the incoming data on the U.S. economy has been a bit more upbeat of late, suggesting that the recovery may be getting better established.  But, while these developments are certainly encouraging, it is far too soon to conclude that we are out of the woods in terms of generating a strong, sustainable recovery.  On the inflation front, the year-over-year rate of consumer price inflation has slowed in recent months, and despite the recent rise of gasoline prices, we expect inflation to moderate further in 2012.\n\nHere in Syracuse, while the recovery to date has not been as strong as we would like, the region’s vibrant health and education sector provides a solid base for longer-term growth.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions."

        "content": "Introduction\nChairman Paul, Ranking Member Clay, and members of the Subcommittee, my name is Bill Dudley, and I am President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. It is an honor to testify today about the economic and fiscal challenges facing Europe, and the Federal Reserve’s efforts to support financial stability in the United States. Financial stability enables U.S. businesses and households to maintain their access to credit and ensures sustained economic growth. This is why promoting financial stability is an important objective of the Federal Reserve, and other central banks around the world.\n\nLet me preface these remarks by stating that the views expressed in my written and oral testimony are solely my own and do not represent official views of the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or any other part of the Federal Reserve System. Additionally, because I am precluded by law from discussing confidential supervisory information, I will not be able to speak about the financial condition or regulatory treatment or rating of any individual financial institution.\n\nThe U.S. economy is currently expanding at a moderate pace, and strains in global financial markets, although having eased recently, continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook. Because developments in Europe will have an important bearing on the prospects for growth and jobs here in the U.S., the Federal Reserve is monitoring the situation there closely. This is also why we have taken special steps in recent months, together with other central banks, to support the flow of credit to households and businesses.\n\nEurope\n\nThe economic situation in Europe has been unsettled for the better part of two years, with pressure on sovereign debt markets and local banking systems. High debts, large deficits and slow growth in several European countries have called into question the sustainability of the entire euro area. The resulting strains in European markets have affected the U.S. economy.\n\nThe euro area has the capacity, including the fiscal capacity, to overcome its challenges. However, the politics are very difficult, both because the problem has many dimensions, and because many different countries and institutions in the euro area have to coordinate their actions in order to achieve a coherent and effective policy response.\n\nEurope's leadership has affirmed its commitment to the European Union and its single currency union on numerous occasions. And the leadership is working harder than ever to achieve greater coordination in areas such as fiscal policy. A more robust and resilient European Union would be a welcome development for the United States. Three recent developments are especially encouraging in that regard.\n\nFirst, liquidity concerns have eased significantly following the European Central Bank’s (ECB) long-term refinancing operations in December and February. Through this program, the ECB provides three-year loans to European banks at low rates, accepting a wide array of collateral in return. Hundreds of banks accessed the program in each operation, and the ECB lent nearly €1 trillion in total. As a result, the cost of funding throughout Europe has declined since the program began, the euro has stabilized, and the sovereign bond market has improved. Changes in the ECB’s collateral rules and reserve requirements have also had a positive impact.\n\nSecond, earlier this month, the Greek government worked with European leaders and its largest creditors to restructure the bulk of its €206 billion of outstanding privately-held bonds. This not only reduced Greece’s total indebtedness, it helped calm persistent worries that a disorderly Greek default could become the trigger for a global economic crisis. Shortly after the debt restructuring, the EU approved a €130 billion aid package for Greece. Together, these measures will provide key support to Greek leaders as they pursue the difficult fiscal reforms that are essential over the long term.\n\nThird, leaders in most euro area countries have approved a new treaty designed to increase fiscal coordination. The new rules already appear to be making a difference. Both Spain and Italy recently completed 2012 budgets that move their deficits closer to EU targets. Further, Spain and Italy took their fiscal actions in close consultation with finance ministers from other countries in the euro area, demonstrating a healthy ability to work together. While difficult work still lies ahead, countries in the euro area have made meaningful progress toward achieving long-term fiscal sustainability.\n\nLooking to the future, the difficult work that remains also presents special risks—both for Europe and the United States. If Europe fails to chart an effective course forward, this could have a number of negative implications here. In particular, there are three areas of potential risk that I would like to highlight for the Subcommittee today.\n\nFirst, if economic conditions in Europe were to weaken significantly, demand for U.S. exports would decrease. This would hurt domestic growth and have a negative impact on U.S. jobs. It is important to recognize that the euro area is the world’s second largest economy after the U.S. and an important trading partner for us. Also, Europe is a significant investor in the U.S. economy, and vice versa. Thus, what happens in Europe has significant implications for our economy.\n\nSecond, deterioration in the European economy could put pressure on the U.S. banking system. As the recent round of stress tests revealed, U.S. banks are much more robust and resilient than they were a few years ago. They have bolstered their capital significantly, built up their loan loss reserves and have significantly larger liquidity buffers. The direct net exposures of U.S. banks to the so-called \"peripheral\" European countries are actually quite modest. The good news in the United States means that we are better able to handle bad news from Europe.\n\nWith that said, the exposures of U.S. banks climb sharply when one also considers their exposures to the core European countries and to the overall European banking system. U.S. money market mutual funds, in particular, have significant European holdings. This means that if the crisis were to broaden further and intensify, it would put pressure on the capital and liquidity buffers of U.S. banks and other financial institutions.\n\nThird, severe stresses in European financial markets would disrupt financial markets here, which could harm the real economy. Stress in the financial markets causes banks to more carefully husband their balance sheets. When that phenomenon occurs, the availability of credit to U.S. households and businesses becomes constrained. Such conditions could also cause equity prices to fall, impairing the value of Americans’ pension and 401(k) holdings. This would damage the U.S. recovery and result in slower output growth and less job creation. At a time when U.S. unemployment is very high, this is a particularly unacceptable outcome. In the extreme, U.S. financial markets could become so impaired that the flow of credit to households and businesses would dry up.\n\nU.S. Dollar Swaps\nIn today’s globally integrated economy, banks headquartered abroad play an important role in providing credit and other financial services in the United States. About $1 trillion in worldwide dollar financing comes from foreign banks, $700 billion in the form of loans within the U.S. For these banks to provide U.S. dollar loans, they have to maintain access to U.S. dollar funding. At a time when it is already hard enough for American families and firms to get the credit they need, we have a strong interest in making sure that these banks can continue to be active in the U.S. dollar markets.\n\nBanks headquartered outside the U.S. make extensive use of dollars in their financing activities. In part, this results from the fact that the U.S. dollar is the world's number one currency—a status that brings with it many benefits for our country. It is in our national interest to make sure that non-U.S. banks remain able to access the U.S. dollar funding they need to continue financing their U.S. dollar assets. If access to dollar funding were to become severely impaired, this could necessitate the abrupt, forced sales of dollar assets by these banks, which could seriously disrupt U.S. markets and adversely affect American businesses, consumers and jobs.\n\nOne way we can help to support the availability of dollar funding, and ensure that credit continues to flow to American households and businesses, is by engaging in currency swaps with other central banks. Such swaps are a policy tool the Federal Reserve has used to support dollar liquidity for nearly fifty years. Most recently, the Federal Reserve established dollar swap lines with major central banks during the global financial crisis of 2008, and reactivated them in May 2010. Last November, the FOMC, cooperating with five other central banks, reduced the rate being charged on these swaps to increase usage.\n\nThe swaps are intended to create a credible backstop to support—but not supplant—private markets. Banks with surplus dollars are more likely to lend to banks in need of dollars if they know that the borrowing bank will be able to obtain the dollars it needs to repay the loan, if necessary, from its central bank.\n\nUltimately, these dollar swaps are designed to support financial stability, and avoid an unnecessary tightening in financial conditions, so that economic activity and job creation in the United States can continue to recover. Our principal aim is to protect U.S. banks, businesses and consumers from adverse economic trends abroad. I am pleased that the swaps seem to be working. In conjunction with the ECB’s long-term refinancing operations, the swaps have helped European banks avoid the significant liquidity pressures we feared a few months ago and have reduced the risk that they would need to sell off their U.S. dollar assets abruptly.\n\nConclusion\nIn sum, I am hopeful that Europe can effectively address its current fiscal challenges. The Federal Reserve is actively and carefully assessing this situation and the potential impact on the U.S. economy. At this time, although I do not anticipate further efforts by the Federal Reserve to address the potential spillover effects of Europe on the United States, we will continue to monitor the situation closely.\n\nThank you for your invitation to testify today, and I look forward to answering your questions."

        "title": "Reforming the OTC Derivatives Market",
        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2012/dud120322",
        "content": "It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to speak here. Today I will focus on two related aspects of the regulatory reform agenda that are complex and global in nature. \n\nFirst, I will discuss the efforts underway to reform the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets. This includes creating strong incentives to standardize trades and clear those trades through central counterparties (CCPs) and improving disclosure and transparency through mandatory reporting of all OTC derivative trades to trade repositories. \n\nSecond, I will discuss the global program to establish tougher standards for the regulation and oversight of financial market infrastructures (FMI)—focusing particularly on CCPs for over-the-counter derivatives.\n\nOver the past two years, two important standard setting bodies—the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the Technical Committee of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) have been developing a new package of standards called, Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures. The aim is to strengthen the resiliency and robustness of FMIs that are systemically important and are the backbone of the global financial system. I anticipate that the approval process will be completed and the finalized Principles document will be issued and broadly distributed sometime next month.\n\nAs always, what I have to say here reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System. Also, I speak for myself rather than for CPSS and IOSCO. \n\nTurning to my first topic, the financial crisis exposed many shortcomings with respect to the OTC derivatives market. For example, the use of OTC derivatives referencing private-label mortgage-backed securities that held poor quality subprime and alt-A mortgages multiplied the amount of gains and losses in the financial system. There were not only the losses on the actual mortgages, but also on the CDS that were linked to these mortgages through the OTC derivatives market. This increased the stress on the system when the referenced subprime and alt-A mortgages began to perform poorly. \n\nMoreover, the structural characteristics of the over-the-counter derivatives market itself amplified the shocks created by the housing bust in several ways. First, the collateral calls generated by sharp movements in the mark-to-market value of the OTC derivative trades drained liquidity buffers and provoked the fire sales of assets. These fire sales increased volatility and provoked still greater margin calls. This dynamic was one reason why the market prices of these assets overshot to the downside—that is they fell more than needed simply to reflect the increase in expected credit losses. In other words, the illiquidity risk premiums embedded into the prices of these assets became very large.  \n\nSecond, the bilateral nature of the OTC derivatives market—between the two parties to the contract—be it dealer and customer or dealer and dealer—created its own set of difficulties. When counterparties became concerned about the health of a particular dealer, they often moved their trades—via novation—to other dealers. They did this to protect themselves should the dealer subsequently fail. But this process was difficult to carry out quickly and in size. The cumbersome nature of the process disturbed market liquidity and function. It also tended to drain off the liquidity from the troubled dealers because these dealers often used the counterparty cash collateral to fund their own operations. When customers moved their business, the collateral balances departed with them and this worsened the funding crunch on the troubled dealers.  \n\nThird, when a large counterparty, Lehman Brothers, filed for bankruptcy, it could no longer meet its obligations. The claims of Lehman’s customers, including those open OTC derivatives positions in which Lehman owed them money, were frozen. The lack of adequate segregation of the customers’ assets from the Lehman estate and the inability to move the outstanding obligations to other dealers—which we refer to as the lack of portability—created large problems for Lehman’s counterparties. Often Lehman’s clients were in the position that one side of a trade executed with Lehman was frozen, but the offsetting side remained open and exposed to volatile financial markets. This asymmetry contributed to the sharp increase in market volatility, the dramatic reduction in market liquidity, and the impairment in market function following the Lehman failure. Fear that this could happen again if another firm failed, encouraged flight from other dealers perceived by market participants to be relatively weak that might have large potential exposures. \n\nOf course, as if this were not bad enough, the opaqueness of the OTC derivatives market made the situation much worse. No one had a clear insight into the financial health of their counterparties. Although each market participant could calculate its bilateral exposures to a particular dealer and the particular dealer could understand its own exposure to each of its own counterparties, this didn’t answer the broader question: how exposed were the clients and dealers to others in the financial system through their derivatives trades and other open positions? Because there was no easy way to know who was in difficulty or not, the incentives were all on the side of assuming the worse—closing out open trades, hoarding liquidity, and retreating to the sidelines. The crisis had made it crystal clear that the regulatory regime had not kept pace with the rapid growth of the global OTC derivatives market. \n\nIn assessing the shortcomings of the OTC derivatives market after the crisis, a global consensus has been reached. Although I will be over-simplifying in the interest of time, I view the following aspects of reform as the most important. First, there have to be strong incentives in the system—such as capital requirements on banks and securities dealers—to provide an impetus for dealers to standardize OTC derivatives trades whenever practical. The goal is fewer bespoke trades and more standardized trades. Second, the G20 leaders agreed that all standardized OTC derivative trades should be mandatorily cleared through CCPs by the end of 2012. Third, records for all OTC derivative trades—including bilateral bespoke trades—must be reported to trade repositories. The data as part of this reporting requirement would include key trade attributes and a legal entity identifier so that aggregate exposures could be readily calculated. Fourth, the two standard-setting bodies mentioned earlier—CPSS and IOSCO—would strengthen and broaden the principles for financial market infrastructures. Fifth, these Principles would be adopted globally, strengthening the resilience of the financial system.\n\nThe logic behind these five elements of reform goes like this: \n\nStandardizing trades improves transparency and price discovery. This mitigates the opaqueness that helped to generate the illiquidity and loss of market function evident during the crisis.  \n\nRequiring that such trades be cleared through CCPs is designed to reduce the aggregate amount of risk in the system. That is because the gross exposures can be netted down when all the dealers clear through one common central clearing party. In a CCP framework, the bilateral exposures of each dealer to one another are replaced by a single set of claims to and from the CCP. The idea is that because some dealers are likely to be long some trades to one dealer and short some trades to other dealers, passing both sets of trades through a single CCP can reduce the aggregate amount of risk in the system. This would occur as the long trades are netted out against the short trades, leaving only the remaining smaller net exposure of the dealer to the CCP.  \n\nInserting a CCP in between two counterparties to a trade can also help reduce the \"run risk\" faced by a potentially troubled dealer. As we saw during the crisis, market participants often abruptly pull their trades away from a dealer that they perceive to be weak, which in turn can have the self-fulfilling effect of magnifying market or liquidity pressures on the dealer. If, however, trades with the dealer are cleared through a CCP, direct exposures to the dealer are eliminated and replaced by exposures to the CCP itself. This risk shifting can reduce the incentives to suddenly halt trading with a dealer, for example, due to uncertainty about the dealer’s financial condition or future prospects.\n\nMandatory reporting of trades to trade repositories is designed to ensure that the details of each contract are preserved and available to the regulatory authorities.  \n\nFinally, the fact that CCPs will be central to the system dramatically increases their importance. In essence, global CCPs will be systemically important. Thus, for the system to be safer it is not sufficient to ensure that trades are standardized and that they are mandated to be cleared through CCPs, but also it is necessary that CCPs be “bullet proof.” They have to have the ability to perform and meet their obligations regardless of the degree of stress in the financial system and even if one or more of their participants were to fail in a disorderly manner. Hence, there is a compelling need for tougher principles that are broadly enforced.\n\nIn addition, to ensure that this all works as well in practice as in theory, the Financial Stability Board, CPSS and IOSCO, and other regulatory authorities have emphasized the importance of four safeguards to ensure that mandatory, standardized clearing through CCPs will make the financial system more robust and resilient. \n\nThe first safeguard is that the oversight of global CCPs needs to be cooperative—involving the securities regulators and central banks in the country in which the CCP operates (the home country) and the countries for which the CCP may be systemically important. Global CCPs are likely to be established—some are already up and running—that will clear different types of OTC derivatives such as interest rate swaps, credit default swaps, or commodity-based swaps that are traded around the world, both solely within one country or on a cross-border basis. \n\nMany regulators have important stakes in ensuring that a global CCP can meet its obligations. In addition to regulators of the country in which the CCP is headquartered, these include foreign regulators. These regulators may be interested parties for many reasons. For example, their currencies may be used in settling the obligations of the CCP, they may have counterparties to the CCP that are headquartered or do significant amounts of business in their country, or they may have FMIs that are linked to the CCP. \n\nI want to emphasize that effective cooperative oversight is essential. Otherwise, the risk is that the system will become overly fragmented, with a proliferation of national CCPs. In this case, many of the risk-reducing benefits from CCPs could be lost or severely attenuated. That is because fewer offsetting positions would likely be cleared through any particular CCP and this would reduce the scope for reducing large gross exposures into much smaller net positions. \n\nThe second safeguard is to ensure fair, open and safe access to global FMIs around the world.  It is important, for example, that global CCPs have rules that are not exclusionary or that unnecessarily entrench the position of whatever dealer, firm, or FMI is currently dominant in the market. \n\nThe third safeguard is to establish rules to ensure that, if a major market participant were to fail, a CCP can liquefy its collateral quickly so that it can meet its obligations in a timely way. But this also needs to be done in a way that would not disrupt financial markets or the CCP’s participants. As I will discuss shortly, although there may be a potential role for central banks here, CCPs, at a minimum, must have their own liquidity resources as the first line of defense.  \n\nFourth, there needs to be a viable resolution regime for CCPs. This is needed to ensure that the CCP either can be recapitalized and recover or, if necessary, wound down in an orderly way without disrupting the provision of essential market services. Also, a resolution regime is necessary to ensure that a central bank that might lend to a CCP in extremis will be repaid. \n\nTo help ensure that these safeguards are met, a major part of the reform effort is to establish a strong set of principles for financial market infrastructures. These principles must embody the four safeguards and ensure that the infrastructure can withstand any stresses that could plausibly occur. \n\nThe process of developing such a set of principles began about two years ago and is now nearing completion.  \n\nSo why the new principles and what do they embody? During the crisis, financial market infrastructures performed very well.  In fact, FMIs were actually a source of strength. They enabled market participants to settle obligations when they came due in a timely way. Also, their robustness gave confidence to market participants that they could continue to trade, knowing that the transactions would almost certainly be settled and cleared without difficulty.\n\nDespite this excellent record of performance during a period of unprecedented stress, there still is room for improvement. First, future stresses could be more severe or might come in different forms. This could expose vulnerabilities in FMIs that have, up to now, not been visible. Also, extraordinary interventions in the crisis to backstop market function or rescue key financial intermediaries may have prevented the stress level from reaching the point where FMIs couldn’t perform their functions. Because there can be no assurance that such interventions will necessarily occur in the future, it is important that the stability of the FMI architecture not depend on timely extraordinary interventions. \n\nSecond, under the new regime of central clearing for standardized OTC derivatives trades, the role of FMIs will become even more important in the future. Moreover, the new regime will lead to the development of new types of FMIs. CCPs for OTC derivatives will become widespread—and trade repositories will be established. Principles are needed to underpin these new institutional arrangements.  \n\nThird, for FMIs to be resilient they would undoubtedly need to have some ability to access central bank services, including the lender of last resort function. But, if FMIs had access to such services, this would create moral hazard. The best way to address this conundrum is to hold the FMIs to tougher global standards. \n\nFourth, a stronger and better system of FMI governance and oversight can help to ensure that those systems that support a global market are subject to consistent standards regardless of the jurisdiction where they operate. Relying solely on a patchwork of differing national standards in a global world would not work well. It would encourage business to migrate to the lowest standard. Without establishing a global floor, there would otherwise be a “race for the bottom.” \n\nThese are the major reasons why CPSS and IOSCO took on the task of strengthening and broadening the standards for FMIs.  \n\nThere are two major goals of this effort. The first goal is to strengthen the current standards by: 1) raising the bar for existing standards such as for governance, credit risk, liquidity risk, collateral and margin requirements; 2) including requirements for new areas such as segregation and portability, general business risk, links, tiering and disclosure; and 3) extending coverage to include trade repositories.  \n\nAs proposed in the consultation document, the Principles will significantly strengthen existing requirements for an FMI’s governance and financial resources. One way the Principles do this is by requiring FMIs to take a more comprehensive and proactive view of the roles they play, the risks they face, and their potential to support the stability of the broader financial system. In particular, as markets become even more interconnected, FMIs must approach their governance and risk management more holistically, in a manner consistent with their growing importance to the global markets and the stakeholders that they serve. \n\nRegarding an FMI’s financial standards, it is important that they be prepared to handle even greater potential disruptions and more extreme market conditions. For example, while an FMI must cover its largest current credit exposure to any single participant under pre-crisis standards, the Principles would require an FMI to collateralize its current credit exposures to all of its participants. Furthermore, for CCPs that face potential future credit exposures from the open contracts that they guarantee, the Principles impose rigorous stress testing and strengthened margin and default fund requirements. These requirements are to guard against a wide range of possible stress scenarios in extreme but plausible market conditions.\n\nThe Principles also raise the bar for an FMI’s management of liquidity risk to ensure that systemically important payment obligations can be settled on time. For instance, when sizing its potential liquidity needs in the event of a participant default, an FMI should have sufficient liquid resources to cover not only the shortfall caused by the default of the individual legal entity that settles directly through the FMI, but also the shortfall that could arise from the failure of all affiliates of the direct participant. In addition, FMIs will need to address how potential uncovered liquidity shortfalls or credit losses would be allocated, and how the FMI would replenish any financial resources it uses in a stress event so that it can continue to operate in a safe and sound manner.   \n\nThe Principles also introduce a number of new requirements. Some of these address shortcomings that were observed during the crisis. For example, the Principles require CCPs to have segregation and portability arrangements that protect customer positions and collateral. An FMI will also be required to manage the risks it bears from and poses to, not only its participants and their customers, but also to other entities with which it does business such as linked FMIs, settlement banks, custody banks, and liquidity providers. Furthermore, the Principles will require FMIs to establish a dedicated financial cushion that could absorb unanticipated general business losses. This is to ensure that an FMI can continue to provide its critical services. The Principles also require that FMIs have plans for their recapitalization or orderly wind down, if that were to prove to be necessary. \n\nFinally, the coverage of the international standards has been expanded to trade repositories as a new category of FMI, to further complement the G-20 OTC derivatives initiative for mandatory trade reporting. The Principles that address trade repositories focus on their transparency and the disclosure of market data. This reflects the important and unique role they will play in disseminating information both to regulators and to the market more broadly.\n\nThe second major goal is to promote consistent global enforcement of the standards. Toward this end, the Principles unify and harmonize three existing sets of standards—Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems; Recommendations for Securities Settlement Systems; and Recommendations for Central Counterparties.  \n\nAs part of this effort, the Principles strengthen the “responsibilities of authorities.” This includes a new framework for cooperation among financial authorities. It calls for central banks, market regulators, and other relevant authorities to cooperate with each other, both domestically and internationally, and to support each other in fulfilling their respective mandates to promote the safety and efficiency of FMIs. This builds upon existing frameworks that have already been used successfully by CPSS and IOSCO for effective cooperation in the oversight of global institutions.  Such cooperation can facilitate more comprehensive oversight, improve efficiency and effectiveness, reduce or eliminate any gaps in regulation, supervision, and oversight, and minimize potential duplication of effort and burden on both the FMIs and the cooperating authorities.\n\nToward the goal of consistent global enforcement, the Principles are considered to be minimum requirements. In contrast, the three old sets of guidance were weaker, being recommendations rather than requirements. As recommendations, they could be ignored. In contrast, as the Principles make clear, countries that are members of CPSS and IOSCO are to apply the principles to “the fullest extent possible.” This means that regulation and legal frameworks are to be adjusted as needed in order to accommodate the standards.\n\nTo ensure that this happens, CPSS and IOSCO are also developing disclosure and assessment regimes. The purpose is to facilitate a consistent set of disclosures by the different FMIs and a consistent set of assessment methodologies that can be used by the relevant international institutions, namely the International Money Fund and the World Bank, and by the relevant national authorities of the FMIs domiciled in their jurisdictions. \n\nWhen the Principles are published next month, CPSS and IOSCO will also issue a disclosure regime proposal and an assessment regime proposal. These will be put forward for a 60-day consultation period to give the market participants, FMIs, and regulators an opportunity to comment.  \n\nAlso, once the Principles are rolled out and countries start to implement the legal and regulatory changes necessary to put the Principles into practice, it is anticipated that CPSS and IOSCO will undertake a monitoring effort to see how it is going. The focus will be on evaluating how quickly and broadly the Principles are being embedded in national legal and regulatory frameworks. \n\nThe Principles are important in supporting the G20 strategy of mandatory clearing of standardized OTC derivatives trades and in ensuring that the four safeguards discussed earlier for global CCPs and other FMIs are implemented. \n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the new Principles lay out the responsibilities of authorities for cooperative oversight. Cooperation can take a variety of forms, including formal arrangements that are organized under memoranda of understandings, specific protocols or other documentation for the exchange of critical information, and informal arrangements for regular and ad hoc communications. Much work is currently underway to establish various forms of effective cooperation, particularly for individual CCPs and trade repositories that are becoming globally important. However, as the work toward meeting the G-20 commitments continues, much more work is needed to design and implement such arrangements for the relevant FMIs.\n\nIn terms of the issue of access, explicit requirements for FMIs are embedded in the Principles. The Principles establish a framework that covers access by direct participants, indirect participants—i.e., those who trade indirectly through a direct participant, and access and links between FMIs. \n\nIn terms of the lender of last resort issue, the Principles strengthen the requirements for FMIs in terms of such aspects of financial strength such as capital and liquidity, and operational and business risk. This implies that enforcement of the Principles should significantly mitigate any moral hazard issue that could arise if an FMI were able to obtain credit from a central bank.\n\nOn resolution, the Principles contain explicit requirements to ensure that all systemically important FMIs have viable recovery plans and, if circumstances ever warrant, could be wound down in an orderly fashion without the disruption of the provision of key services. The Principles’ provisions for an FMI’s recovery and orderly wind down will inform upcoming work by CPSS-IOSCO on the potential role and attributes of official regimes for the resolution of FMIs. This work is underway and should be completed later this year. \n\nI’m pleased to see what has already been accomplished. But let’s be clear, when the Principles are published that won’t be the end. To quote Winston Churchill, it will only be “the end of the beginning”. Thereafter, the resolution, disclosure and assessment frameworks will need to be finalized later this year. The CPSS and IOSCO members will have to adopt the new Principles into their regulatory and legal frameworks, with a target date of year-end. The new Principles will then be put into effect next year, with FMIs expected to observe the new Principles as shortly thereafter as is feasible.   This is obviously an ambitious schedule, but one that is fully consistent with the G20 leaders’ mandate. \n\nFinally, we should recognize that the global financial system is a complex one that is continuously evolving and that we are introducing many significant changes into that system. We have to recognize that there may be trade-offs between some of our objectives, and that the system may evolve in ways that we do not expect.  There  may be unintended consequences. Maybe the major dealers will not standardize as many trades as is desirable or, perhaps, CCPs will develop in too fragmented a manner so that the netting of risk doesn’t occur to the extent potentially feasible.   Or the development of global CCPs could have unanticipated negative consequences for market structure, competition and/or efficiency.\n\nWe must be open-minded about the potential need for mid-course corrections. We will need to ensure that the incentives are right to get the greatest amount of risk reduced in the most efficient manner. Currently, for example, we are evaluating how the changes in terms of the Basel capital and liquidity standards for banks will interact with the changes in the OTC derivatives regime in terms of influencing the incentives for standardizing OTC trades and mandatory clearing through CCPs.  But we shouldn’t kid ourselves—we’ll be off in our forecast. Thus, we must be ready to make adjustments as this process unfolds and we learn more.\n\nAs long as regulators, FMIs, and market participants make the effort, we should be able to make the financial system much safer, resilient, and transparent. The changes in train, if properly executed, should, over time, significantly reduce the shortcomings in the OTC derivatives market that exacerbated the financial crisis. Properly enacted and implemented, net exposures should be smaller because of the netting that occurs through the CCP process. Transparency into counterparty risk should be greatly improved via disclosure requirements and the ability to aggregate trade information in trade repositories, and end user trading positions should be much better protected by segregation and portability requirements and a more robust financial market infrastructure. Although there is still much to do as part of this process, I’m optimistic that we are on the right road.  We just need to continue to push ahead and not forget the lessons learned from the financial crisis.    \n\nThank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions."

        "content": "Over the past few years, I have been engaged in a series of outreach meetings all across my Federal Reserve District. For example, in 2010 I visited several upstate cities. Early last year I made visits to various parts of the city—Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens—and to Puerto Rico. In August, I met with community and business leaders and elected officials in Newark, Patterson and Jersey City. In November, I went to West Point and the Capital region.\n\nI consider these visits just as important as my trips to Washington, D.C., to help formulate monetary policy or to Switzerland to help shape international bank regulation. Each visit within the region helps me to deepen the relationships with the people I represent. I believe that the understanding of issues and concerns that I gain today will help ensure that the Fed's policy decisions reflect the public interest in the broadest sense.\n\nToday, I want to talk with you first about the Fed—what we do and why we do it. Then I'll provide some thoughts about the economic outlook nationally and locally. How the economy performs is important in many ways. At the personal level, for example, it affects your family's finances and students' job prospects at graduation time. Collectively, it affects the potential of our nation to confront and deal with the many challenges we face.\n\nAs always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee, also known as the FOMC.\n\nWhat the New York Fed Does\nBy way of introduction, I will briefly review what the New York Fed does and what makes my job so interesting.\n\nI am vice chair of the FOMC, which meets eight times a year in Washington to set interest rates and make other decisions about monetary policy. The members of this committee all strive to set policy to advance the mandate given to us by Congress to promote the maximum level of employment consistent with price stability. Sometimes we have different views on the specific policy choice at hand, and you should view this as completely appropriate: these are hard questions— particularly at times like this. In fact, I think we make better decisions as a committee because we don't all think alike. But we are united in our commitment to our dual mandate and in our belief that Fed independence is essential to the public interest, because it allows us to make tough decisions insulated from short-term political pressures.\n\nAt FOMC meetings, each Committee member presents a current outlook for his or her region and the nation. For these assessments, we consult our researchers and add critical information that we learn from listening to our boards of directors, regional advisory councils and community leaders, such as you and others I'll meet on this visit. This trip includes a meeting with the Long Island Housing Partnership—and a visit to some distressed neighborhoods, a tour of the D'Addario string factory and lunch with its workers; and concludes with a tour and meeting at the Brookhaven National Laboratory.\n\nAt the New York Fed, we continually track conditions in our District, and we have created a number of tools for that purpose. For example, my staff produces monthly indexes of economic activity for New York City, the entire state of New York, and New Jersey. These indexes are essentially measures of local output—similar to gross domestic product, or GDP, at the national level. These measures provide a more complete gauge of activity than the employment report, which is another important metric at the state level. We have also constructed a consumer credit panel to track local household credit conditions, including the amount and type of personal debt and whether payments are being made in a timely way.\n\nIn addition, we have a periodic poll about the credit needs of small businesses, which are an important source of new jobs. We are just launching our latest survey that also includes questions about the skill needs of small businesses and if the right kinds of skilled labor are available. Almost 900 regional businesses responded to our last poll, of which roughly 5 percent were from Long Island. If you, as part of a small business, would like to participate in our current poll, please pass your card to my colleagues, who are in the audience, or see me after the speech and we will be glad to add you as a respondent.\n\nIn December, we hosted a workshop for small businesses in the New York City metro area to provide information about how they can export their products and services. The Export-Import Bank, the Small Business Administration and the U.S. Department of Commerce were on hand to tell participants how to tap demand in the global marketplace and what government programs are available to enhance credit and to increase lines of working capital. In 2012, we're further developing our small business program. We hope to partner with many of you to support the small business sector.\n\nAs you know, even states as wealthy as New York have large pockets of poverty. So, we target some key initiatives specifically to low- and moderate-income groups. Here on Long Island there are pockets that suffered greatly in the recession. In Nassau County, communities in Hempstead, Baldwin, Roosevelt and New Hyde Park have a foreclosure rate over four times the national average.* The same holds true for parts of Brentwood, Central Islip and Patchogue, in Suffolk County.\n\nWe have worked hard to help neighborhoods that face high foreclosure rates. Over the past three years, my staff has come to Long Island to meet with housing counselors and legal services practitioners. We have provided housing advocates with the latest information on mortgage conditions, via mortgage briefs, roundtables, presentations and newsletters. We have now developed an online resource that shows delinquency and foreclosure conditions in neighborhoods each month. We believe that this site will be a useful complement, aiding the work of housing counselors and other parties seeking to help these communities.\n\nTo share what we learn about our diverse District, we have a website, with detailed information about the region. I invite you to visit newyorkfed.org to explore our highly localized maps and information on small business, credit and housing conditions and even the latest job openings at the New York Fed.\n\nFinally, and crucially, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, we are working with our colleagues in Washington, D.C., and at other agencies to help put the nation's financial system on a firmer footing. Much has been done, yet much remains to be done and we are determined to keep at it. I recognize fully that there can be no return to pre-crisis business as usual—whether on the part of the financial sector or on the part of regulators like ourselves.\n\nAll in all, there is a lot to keep myself and my colleagues busy.\n\nNational Economic Conditions\nThe incoming data on the U.S. economy has been a bit more upbeat of late, suggesting that the recovery may be finally establishing a somewhat firmer footing. Real GDP expanded at a 3 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2011, the fastest growth since the first half of 2010. The average monthly gain in nonfarm payroll employment moved up to 256,000 in January and February from 164,000 in the fourth quarter. Sales of light-weight motor vehicles rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 15.1 million in February, the highest since early 2008. The ISM nonmanufacturing index rose for the third consecutive month in February and now stands at its highest level in a year. Even the housing starts data have firmed somewhat, although from quite depressed levels.\n\nWhile these developments are certainly encouraging, it is far too soon to conclude that we are out of the woods. To begin with, the economic data looked brighter at this point in 2010 and again in 2011, only to fade as we got into the second and third quarters of those years.1 Moreover, the United States has experienced unusually mild weather over the past few months, with the number of heating degree days in January and February about 17 percent below the average of the preceding five years. While this reduces the amount that households and businesses must spend for heating, I suspect that it temporarily boosts economic activity overall. For example, the mild weather is certainly conducive to higher than normal levels of construction activity, and we did see a surge in hours worked in that sector over the past few months.\n\nMore importantly, real economic activity has yet to be strong enough on a sustained basis to make a big dent in the overall amount of slack in the U.S. economy. While it is true that growth was stronger in the fourth quarter, most of that growth was due to inventory accumulation. Growth of final sales was actually quite weak. Historically, a quarter in which inventory investment makes a significant growth contribution is typically followed by a quarter in which that growth contribution is modest or even negative. That appears to be what is shaping up for the first quarter of this year.\n\nBased on available data, current expectations are that real GDP will expand at around a 2 percent annual rate during the first quarter of 2012. Despite the increase of light vehicle sales, overall consumer spending has been sluggish. While growth of retail sales in February was reasonably strong in nominal terms, it was considerably less impressive when the large increase of gasoline prices that occurred that month is taken into account. Based on data for the first half of March, gasoline prices are continuing to move higher which will further sap consumers' real purchasing power. And growth of business investment spending, which was quite strong in the second and third quarters of 2011, entered the new year with little forward momentum.\n\nTo put the recent pace of growth into perspective, we believe that the economy's long-run sustainable growth rate (what economists call the potential growth rate) is around a 2 1/4 percent annual rate. We need sustained growth above that rate to absorb the substantial amount of unused productive capacity. Thus, our recent growth rates are barely keeping up with our potential.\n\nAlthough the sharp decline in the unemployment from 9 percent last September to 8.3 percent in February suggests we are doing better than that, it is important to recognize that about half of that decline was due to a declining labor force participation rate. In fact, had the labor force participation rate not declined from around 66 percent in mid-2008 to under 64 percent in February, the unemployment rate would still be over 10 percent. Also, it appears that productivity growth has slumped recently. Although that means that a given amount of growth translates into bigger employment gains, it certainly is not an unmitigated good development.\n\nAlso, we cannot lose sight of the fact that the economy still faces significant headwinds and there are some meaningful downside risks. In the headwinds department, I would include the run-up in gasoline prices mentioned earlier because that will sap purchasing power, the continued impediments to a strong recovery of the housing sector, and fiscal drag at the federal and state and local levels. In terms of downside risks, these include the risk that growth abroad disappoints and the risk of further disruptions to the supply of oil and higher oil prices.\n\nOn the inflation front, the overall rate of increase of consumer prices, as measured by the 12-month change of the consumer price index slowed to 2.9 percent in February from a recent peak of 3.9 percent last September. Despite the recent rise of gasoline prices mentioned above that may interrupt this pattern, we expect this moderation in the growth rate of consumer prices to resume later this year. While the underlying core inflation rate, that strips out volatile food and energy prices, has been somewhat higher than expected a few months back, it appears that the annual rate of core inflation2 has peaked and we expect it to begin to decline later this year.3 Finally, inflation expectations, which play an important role in the inflation process, remain well anchored. By this I mean that people expect that the rate of inflation will continue to be relatively low for some time to come.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions\nSo how is the recovery proceeding in the state and the region? As I mentioned, the New York Fed produces indexes that help us track economic activity in the region. Based on these measures, the economic recovery got underway in both New York State and New York City in late 2009, and economic activity has continued to expand through early 2012.\n\nThe New York Fed also conducts the monthly Empire State Manufacturing Survey to monitor conditions for regional manufacturers. The most recent survey, for which a number of Long Island firms participated, points to continued expansion in manufacturing activity throughout the first quarter of 2012 and heightened optimism about the general business outlook.\n\nRecently released employment revisions indicate that the economic recovery has taken hold on Long Island. But there still is a long way to go. Employment on the island declined by a little over 4 percent in the downturn—a steep drop, to be sure, but only about two-thirds of the decline that occurred nationally. Since bottoming out in late 2009, employment here on the island has rebounded by almost 2 1/2 percent. So we've come a bit more than halfway back to the early 2008 peak.\n\nMoreover, these job gains have come despite ongoing job cuts in local government. While other parts of the region sustained job losses in local government starting in 2010, Long Island's just started in the spring of last year, creating a drag on the labor market overall. Nevertheless, the private sector has picked up the slack. This is most pronounced in professional and business services, finance, leisure and hospitality, and health care. Even the island's manufacturing sector has added jobs over the past year.\n\nAnother sign that a recovery is taking hold on Long Island is that banks that were created just before or just after the financial crisis—while only a small portion of the local market—are starting to show signs of growth.\n\nLong Island's labor market has also been aided by its proximity to New York City. With a large portion of the island's workforce commuting to New York City, especially from Nassau County, the brisk job creation we've seen in the city has helped matters here as well. Unemployment here on the island topped out at 7.6 percent back in late 2009, and it has hovered around 7 percent for most of the past year—a high rate to be sure, but well below both the national and state levels.\n\nTurning to the housing market—there matters are more dreary. After more than doubling between 2000 and 2006, home prices on Long Island are down more than 20 percent from their peak and prices have yet to show any strong signs of bottoming out. This weakness is underscored by our latest quarterly consumer credit panel data. This dataset shows that mortgage delinquency rates on the island are much higher than in other parts of the state and continued to edge higher in the fourth quarter of last year.4\n\nThe housing crisis also has also put pressure on local school finances. Historically, the island has been heavily dependent on local sources for its school funding, and the housing debacle has generated a sharp drop in local property tax revenue. State aid has been generally insufficient to make up for these losses and school administrators have been forced to cut both instructional and non-instructional spending.\n\nDespite some of these ongoing problems, I believe that the long-term outlook for Long Island's economic growth is quite positive. The island's workforce is particularly well educated, with well over a third of adults holding a college degree. It has a sizeable industrial base, which is concentrated in high-tech manufacturing. Moreover, Brookhaven Labs and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, as well as a fine array of academic institutions, provide a strong foundation for the island's tech sector and business sector more broadly. The recent move to create stronger ties between the business community, research labs and SUNY (State University of New York) is a welcome development. It has the potential to help leverage the island's existing assets to enhance the prospects for economic development.\n\nConclusion\nTo sum up, the incoming data on the U.S. economy has been a bit more upbeat of late, suggesting that the recovery may be getting better established. But, while these developments are certainly encouraging, it is far too soon to conclude that we are out of the woods in terms of generating a strong, sustainable recovery. On the inflation front, the year-over-year rate of consumer price inflation has slowed in recent months, and despite the recent rise of gasoline prices, we expect inflation to moderate further in 2012.\n\nLooking ahead, the key challenge for the Long Island economy will be to continue to prepare its residents for the best jobs being created here. Expanding educational access and opportunity and the skills that go along with it will go a long way to broadening participation in the economy to all residents and bolstering Long Island in the future.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n__________________________________________\n1 This recurring pattern has led some economists to question whether the depth and duration of the Great Recession has distorted the usual patterns of seasonal adjustment.\n2 As measured by the 12-month change in core CPI.\n3 See for instance, the behavior of the three- and six-month core CPI.\n4 For more information, see the New York Fed's consumer credit panel.\n\n* The foreclosure rate reference for these communities was calculated with a partial subset of active loans.

        "content": "Good morning and welcome once again to the New York Fed’s Quarterly Regional Economic Press Briefing. I am pleased to have this opportunity to talk with the journalists covering our region—and through you, to the people in our District. This morning I will focus on regional economic conditions, with particular attention to how the recession has affected public school spending in New York and New Jersey—states that dominate the Second Federal Reserve District. Following my remarks, my colleagues will provide more details. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nNational Economic Conditions\nI will begin with a review of overall economic conditions. Recent data suggest that the U.S. economy ended 2011 on a somewhat stronger note—the best performance since the first half of 2010. Nonetheless, the amount of slack in the economy remains substantial. Moreover, I think it is unlikely that the pace of growth we saw in the fourth quarter will carry through to the first half of 2012.\n\nGrowth of consumer spending strengthened in the fourth quarter, adding a needed boost to the economy. Much of this stronger spending was for durable goods, particularly motor vehicles. In the fourth quarter of 2011, sales of light-weight motor vehicles reached the highest quarterly rate since the first half of 2008. This increase is encouraging because it suggests that consumers are now more able to borrow money to finance their purchases of cars and trucks.\n\nHowever, I must note that this boost is likely due in part to temporary factors. First, vehicle sales in the middle of 2011 were depressed due to supply chain disruptions stemming from the tragic earthquake and tsunami in Japan. In addition, a stimulus-related tax provision that allowed businesses to immediately expense some investments expired at the end of 2011. So, some purchases were no doubt timed to occur before that expiration.\n\nMoreover, for goods and services other than durable goods, the rate of growth of consumer spending has been rather tepid. The picture that emerges—up to now—is of a consumer who continues to be cautious.\n\nIn addition to stronger growth of consumer spending, manufacturing output has firmed over the past several months. For example, the widely followed Institute of Supply Management manufacturing composite index rose from October to December 2011. Improvements were particularly notable in new orders and production activity. Stronger growth of consumer spending on durable goods is likely boosting the manufacturing sector. In addition, growth of U.S. exports has been well maintained, while import growth has been subdued.\n\nAlongside the somewhat stronger near-term growth we have also seen some improvement in the labor market. Workers are filing fewer initial claims for unemployment insurance. New claims have fallen to levels not seen since mid-2008. Private-sector employees are working more hours. Aggregate hours worked rose at a 3 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2011, up from essentially no growth in the third quarter. Combined with average hourly earnings rising at a 1.8 percent rate, the increase in hours worked suggests an annual rate of increase in private wage and salary income of close to 5 percent. This is a respectable rate that might support more spending—if sustained.\n\nA firmer labor market has been accompanied by partial recovery in consumer confidence over the past few months. Confidence is rising up from levels that were often—in the third quarter of 2011—lower than at the depths of the Great Recession.\n\nIt should be noted that while workers’ hours grew at a healthy pace in the fourth quarter, employers added an average of just 140,000 payroll jobs per month, somewhat less than in the third quarter. Despite this rather tepid increase in jobs, the unemployment rate fell a cumulative 0.5 percentage points from September to December. This apparent discrepancy is due to two factors—faster job growth as measured by the household survey and an outright decline of the labor force. Workers aged 25 to 54 have been particularly prone to dropping out, which suggests that the decline in the unemployment rate may overstate the improvement in labor market conditions.\n\nDespite some improvements, the economy continues to operate with significant excess slack. Less than 59 percent of the U.S. working-age population has a job. This is unacceptably low—just about the same share as in late 2009 and well below the levels in 2006 and 2007.\n\nOnce again, this large amount of slack is putting downward pressure on trend inflation. After a brief run-up during the second quarter of 2011—reflecting the pass-through from higher commodity prices and supply-chain disruptions—inflation has retreated and may be headed down further.\n\nAs I noted earlier, it is unlikely that the faster growth experienced in the fourth quarter of 2011 will be matched in the first half of 2012. In addition to the temporary nature of some of the recent improvement, there are significant impediments to a robust recovery that I’ll list briefly.\n\nFirst, global financial and economic conditions may impede faster growth. In particular, growth in the euro area is slowing and a recession may be underway with adverse direct and indirect effects on the U.S. economy.\n\nSecond, fiscal policy has become more contractionary. Despite the extension of the payroll tax cut, the stance of federal fiscal policy has tightened and employment and spending by state and local governments continues to decline.\n\nThird, despite record low mortgage interest rates, the depressed housing market remains a significant impediment.1 While house prices are no longer overvalued by historical standards, restrictions on access to credit and the large number of homes in the foreclosure pipeline means that home prices remain under downward pressure. The ongoing weakness in housing makes achieving a vigorous economic recovery more difficult for several reasons:\n\nIn a recent speech I discussed some policy interventions that could help to stabilize the housing market. I will not discuss this further as our focus today is on education.\n\nIn sum, I continue to expect moderate growth in the year ahead and see the risks to that outlook as skewed to the downside, mainly due to uncertainty as to how events in Europe will unfold.\n\nEarlier this week we had a meeting of the FOMC. The committee reiterated its intention to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy to support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with the dual mandate. The committee said it now anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.\n\nThe committee also released a statement of longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy within the context of the dual mandate, and published information on individual participants’ expectations of the appropriate future interest rate path. As Chairman Bernanke explained in his press conference on Wednesday, the strategy statement “should not be interpreted as indicating any change in how the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy. Rather, its purpose is to increase the transparency and predictability of policy.”\n\nFurther details on the discussion at the meeting will be available when the minutes are published in three weeks.\n\nI will not comment on monetary policy any further today beyond stating that monetary policy has done and will continue to do its part in supporting the recovery—but it is not all-powerful. Other complementary policy actions in housing, fiscal policy and structural adjustment or rebalancing of the economy will be essential if we are to achieve the best available recovery.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions\nTurning now to the regional economy, growth slowed in late 2011 in New York City and New York State, whereas New Jersey has seen a modest pickup.\n\nAs attendees at previous regional press briefings may recall, the New York Fed produces economic activity indexes to help monitor the performance of the regional economy.2 Based on these measures, economic activity has leveled off in both New York State and New York City since the summer, following above-average growth in the first half of 2011. In contrast, New Jersey’s economy, which was sluggish throughout 2010 and into the first half of 2011, has picked up noticeably in recent months.\n\nWe monitor Puerto Rico using an index produced by the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico. This index suggests that the island’s recession, which started back in 2005, may finally be ending. After bottoming out last August, activity has risen fairly sharply—reaching a one-year high in November. Still, Puerto Rico’s recovery has had a number of “false starts” before and this measure is noisy. Thus, the recent improvements will need to be sustained for longer before we can confidently declare that the island’s recession is over.\n\nTurning to the employment situation, our region finished 2011 on a mixed note. In New Jersey, private-sector job growth was quite robust in the fourth quarter, despite a small dip in December. New York State, in contrast, slowed more in December and has seen only minimal job gains since we last met in August.\n\nJob growth in the region no longer appears to be out-performing the nation, and regional unemployment rates remain unacceptably high: at around 9 percent in both New York City and New Jersey, and close to 8 percent across New York State.\n\nTurning to New York City, the local job market, which had been quite resilient during and after the recession, has lagged recently—partly reflecting weakness in the city’s securities industry. Still, the Big Apple has recovered over half of the jobs lost during the recession, whereas the nation has recouped only about a third of its job losses thus far. Despite recent weakness in the securities industry, other industries, such as tourism, and professional and business services, have fared reasonably well in the City. Weakness in financial activities industry—and securities in particular—is worrisome because this sector has tended to drive overall local growth and provide a major source of tax revenue for the city and the state.\n\nThe New York Fed also conducts the Empire State Manufacturing Survey to track conditions for regional manufacturers. I am pleased to say that January’s report points to some firming in manufacturing and a pickup in hiring—a big improvement from late last year, when this survey consistently signaled little or no growth.\n\nNonetheless, ongoing weakness in the housing market, coupled with a sluggish jobs recovery has increased financial pressures on families. Attendees at previous press briefings may recall that at the New York Fed we have a special consumer credit panel that allows us to track these trends closely.3 Since the beginning of 2008, many regional households have been reducing their per-person debt for mortgages, credit cards and auto loans quite consistently. However, the last three to four quarters show signs that households may have reached the end of this deleveraging process. Debt levels have been flat to slightly increasing in both New York and New Jersey—as they have also been for the United States as a whole. Only in Puerto Rico have debt levels continued to decline, suggesting that households on the island may not be finished with their deleveraging.\n\nThe picture for debt delinquencies is similar. Although still quite high by historical standards, as of the third quarter of 2011, delinquencies were subsiding in New York and New Jersey, as they were for the nation as a whole. Unfortunately, Puerto Rican households stand out as now having a higher delinquency rate than the mainland, New York and New Jersey—and one that is continuing to rise. Thus, although the financial strains on many families in the region remain severe and are very troubling to me, they do show some signs of abating slowly outside of Puerto Rico.\n\nImpact of the Great Recession on Public Schools in the Region\nNow, I will turn to our special topic. In an important sense, schools constitute the backbone of our national and regional economy. Yet, this backbone can be vulnerable during recessions. Schools teach our citizens skills, including how to read, write, do math, create art or music and work in teams. Economists call these skills “human capital” because they are an important input that fuels a nation’s or region’s economic growth and development. In this way, schools play a key role in shaping our future. Therefore, it is essential to understand how the Great Recession has affected our ability to educate the next generations of students.\n\nThus, today, we will examine how the recession has affected funding levels for schools in our region. As you know, there is an ongoing vigorous debate about how to most effectively organize public education and provide incentives to teachers, students and administrators. Such inquiry is key to any effort to ensure the best possible education for our citizens, but it is beyond the scope of this briefing.\n\nThe housing bust and the onset of the recession in 2007 strained state and local government finances. Most local governments rely heavily on property tax revenue to fund their schools and other activities. This was particularly true during the first half of the decade, when the housing boom strongly supported property tax revenues. Then came the bust; steep declines in the housing market led to corresponding drops in local property tax revenue. State governments’ revenues also fell, as rising unemployment cut income tax revenue and reduced consumption shrank sales tax revenues. Since most state and local governments spend at least half of their budgets on education, these developments have constrained funding for our primary and secondary schools.\n\nTo stave off drastic state and local government spending cuts, the federal government allocated $100 billion to states, including New York and New Jersey, for education through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). Research done here at the New York Fed reveals that school finances in both New York and New Jersey were impacted by the Great Recession, with New Jersey sustaining particularly severe cuts.4 ARRA funds helped school finances in both states, yet did not completely compensate for lost state and local revenues.\n\nWith ARRA funding drying up and our local and state economies still under stress, a question looms before us. How might we expect school finances and student learning to fare in the near future? Given the key role that human capital plays in our nation’s growth, this is an important issue. We at the New York Fed will continue to monitor school finances and other education indicators in our region closely as this will, over time, affect our regional economy.\n\nConclusion\nIn summary, during the second half of 2011, growth slowed in New York, falling well short of the national rate, although New Jersey kept pace. It’s also important to note that the national labor market is showing more consistent signs of improvement, and the regional labor market has continued to make progress. However, at the national level, the pace of recovery remains sluggish by historical standards and is likely to slow somewhat in early 2012. Thus, unemployment, both nationally and locally, is likely to remain unacceptably high for some time. Also, inflation is likely to be below our objective for several years. Clearly, much work remains to achieve the Fed’s dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability.\n\nThe Great Recession has affected education financing in both New York and New Jersey, but New Jersey was hit harder. Through its impact on the education of the next generation, this situation could have troubling implications for the ability of the next generation to succeed in the demanding jobs of the future.\n\nI will now ask Jason Bram to provide additional details on the regional economy.\n\n___________________________________________________\n1 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 2012 White Paper, \"The U.S. Housing Market: Current Conditions and Policy Considerations\" and “Housing and the Economic Recovery” by William Dudley.\n\n2 For more information, see Indexes of Coincident Economic Indicators on the New York Fed website.\n\n3 For a more information, see “An Introduction to the FRBNY Consumer Credit Panel,” New York Fed Staff Report No. 479, November 2010.

        "content": "In a recent speech1 I talked about a number of the challenges facing the economy as we seek to secure the recovery and build for the future. Today I will focus on one of these: the problems in the U.S. housing market. In focusing today on housing, I would emphasize that this is only one factor behind the frustratingly slow economic recovery. Nevertheless, it is an important one that deserves our attention. As always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe New York Fed is deeply committed to contributing to efforts to resolve the housing crisis that still afflicts our nation. Our economists monitor the housing market and analyze its impact on the national economy. My outreach staff work with community groups and housing practitioners to support local programs that aid distressed homeowners. Our lawyers perform pro-bono work for homeowners facing foreclosure and advise on legal reforms, while our researchers and market analysts have developed proposals to mitigate current problems and improve the future structure of housing finance.\n\nIn my presentation today, I will explain why a more robust housing market matters for the wider economy. I will also highlight those factors specific to the housing market that create a risk that it will linger in an extremely weak state for longer than is necessary and remain vulnerable to further weakness.\n\nI will make the case for further housing-related policy interventions that would help stabilize home prices, improve the housing outlook and generate an earlier recovery in housing activity. I believe such actions would support growth and make monetary policy more effective in promoting the dual mandate given to the Federal Reserve by Congress—maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability.\n\nThe Housing Bust\nGiven the excesses of the housing boom that took place in the early to middle part of the last decade, a substantial downward adjustment in housing was unavoidable. Since peaking in the second quarter of 2006, home prices have fallen by about 30 percent,2 returning to levels that last prevailed in mid-2003. In the states of Arizona, California, Florida and Nevada, where home prices rose much more than the national average, prices have declined by roughly 40 percent. Over the past year, house prices have declined by another 4 percent, though they remained roughly flat, when one excludes distress sales.\n\nHome construction collapsed with new single family starts falling from a peak rate of 1.75 million homes per year to a low of 360,000 in early 2009. After a very slight pick-up, they have been bumping along at about a 425,000 annual rate for over a year.\n\nAlthough the number of mortgages becoming delinquent is off its peak, it remains very elevated and increased in the third quarter of 2011.3 According to the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, at the end of that quarter there were roughly 1.5 million first lien mortgages 90 or more days past due, and 2 million first lien mortgages in some stage of foreclosure.\n\nOver time, without an improvement in housing and the labor market, more loans will become seriously delinquent. Moreover, absent more aggressive efforts to find economically efficient alternatives to foreclosure — loans already seriously delinquent and in foreclosure will become real estate owned by the lender, or REO. My staff estimate that the flow of properties into lender REO in 2012 and 2013 could be as high as 1.8 million per year, up from around 1.1 million in 2011 and around 600,000 in 2010.\n\nThe overhang of properties in the foreclosure/REO pipeline continues to exert downward pressure on house prices and housing activity. Recent surveys by MacroMarkets and by Fannie Mae indicate that households expect negligible gains in home prices over the next few years, with many expecting that prices will continue to decline.\n\nMacroeconomic Consequences\nThe ongoing weakness in housing has made it more difficult to achieve a vigorous economic recovery. Housing has inhibited economic activity through a number of channels.\n\nFirst, the strong rebound in residential investment that typically powers economic recoveries following deep recessions has been absent. For example, nine quarters following the ends of the mid-1970s and early 1980s recessions, residential investment had climbed by 65 percent and 55 percent, respectively, above the level at the corresponding troughs. In contrast, during this cycle, there has been no rebound. In the third quarter of 2011, residential investment was still somewhat below the level in the second quarter of 2009.\n\nSecond, by eroding household wealth, the decline in housing prices has contributed to greater weakness in consumption. For most American households the family home is by far the largest tangible asset, a buffer against misfortune, and often a significant savings vehicle to fund retirement.4 \n\nSince home values peaked in 2006, homeowners have lost more than half their home equity—about $7.3 trillion—and expectations of future gains have also declined. At present roughly 11 million households are in negative equity with the aggregate amount of negative equity estimated to be roughly $700 billion.5 \n\nThird, the weakness in home prices has reduced credit availability. Because the home is the primary source of collateral for most households, financial institutions are less willing to lend when house prices have declined substantially and could fall further. In addition, problems in the foreclosure process and obstacles to efficient modification of loans in securitizations, which I'll describe in a moment, make a house of a given value less attractive as collateral to secure a loan. As a result, as home prices have fallen, financial institutions have tightened lending standards. This has reduced the amount of credit available for households, including for small business formation.\n\nFourth, the big drop in house prices has made it more difficult for borrowers to refinance. This has undercut to a degree the ability of monetary policy to support demand.\n\nTraditionally, refinancing activity has been an important channel through which lower interest rates support spending and employment. Refinancing frees up borrower income. Because those who refinance tend to have a higher marginal propensity to consume from income than the investors receiving the mortgage payments, such refinancing activity increases overall demand. However, the fall in home equity combined with a pro-cyclical tightening of refinancing standards and fees means that many borrowers who would like to refinance cannot do so.\n\nProblems in Housing\nBy many measures—including affordability ratios and price-to-rent ratios—home prices have fallen back to or below their pre-boom levels. Indeed, housing no longer appears overvalued. In many former boom localities, the price of existing homes has fallen below the cost of building a new home.6 Also, after several years of depressed construction the national stock of housing no longer looks excessive relative to the nation's population.\n\nNevertheless, housing currently remains in excess supply, in part, because household formation rates remain depressed.\n\nNormally, when there is excess supply, markets self-correct fairly efficiently. Prices fall until they reach a level at which supply and demand are balanced. Unfortunately, the housing market has a number of specific features that complicate this adjustment process and mean it could undershoot — and remain weaker for longer than is necessary.\n\nHousing is a very long-lived asset. Once new building ceases in stressed markets, further reductions in demand cannot be matched by further supply reductions.7 This means that the market clearing price for housing is highly sensitive to those factors that influence demand.\n\nMoreover, there is a feedback loop from prices to demand, with weaker prices leading to weaker demand. If house prices are anticipated to increase, then the expected capital gain helps to offset the financing cost of owning a home. However, if households believe that house prices could decline further, the expected capital loss adds to the financing cost of owning a home and prospective buyers will be reluctant to buy even if mortgage rates are low.\n\nThat said, it should also be recognized that the factors that affect demand and home prices are not immutable. They depend, in part, on policy choices. Consider, for example, the fact that most home purchases are financed with long-term mortgage credit. This means that the demand for housing is highly sensitive to the availability and cost of that credit.\n\nOutcomes in housing are also affected by the legal and operational infrastructure of the mortgage market. This apparatus has been wholly inadequate for dealing with a systemic shock to housing and employment, and is amplifying bad outcomes. A flawed resolution regime—very different from the more efficient regime for resolving excess debt in private commercial property—exacerbates the risks of under-shooting.\n\nConflicts of interest are embedded in mortgage securitization structures and between first and second lien-holders. There are challenges to how the industry records and transfers interests in these mortgages. For mortgages that are part of securitizations, the legal obstacles to loan modification that preserve value are substantial. Meanwhile, mortgage servicers lack the systems, processes, governance, resources and incentives to deal effectively with a large volume of delinquent borrowers—who often suffer poor customer treatment at a time of personal distress.8 \n\nThe result is inefficiently low levels of mortgage modification, too few \"short sales\" 9 by mutual agreement between distressed borrowers and lenders, and too much reliance on the foreclosure process. This process also has many legal impediments and has become even more inefficient as the volume of loans in the pipeline increases. One consequence has been lengthening delays in completing foreclosures—including unavoidable foreclosures. These delays have increased the economic damage caused by foreclosure and reduced recovery rates.\n\nThe damage caused by inefficient foreclosures is worth emphasizing. It is not just the direct loss of value in terms of deterioration of homes that are ultimately foreclosed. In addition, as I have personally witnessed in my outreach visits across the New York Fed's District, foreclosures impose significant costs on families, surrounding neighborhoods and communities. Unmaintained homes facing foreclosure drag down the value of nearby homes. Also, property taxes on non-foreclosed homes often go up due to a declining tax base and this puts additional downward pressure on housing prices.\n\nForeclosures also undercut housing demand. Households that go through foreclosure need to repair their credit records and to accumulate new downpayments. For several years they are no longer available as potential home buyers and this also contributes to softer demand and weaker housing prices.\n\nFurther declines in home prices also could be reinforcing because they would likely make the already daunting foreclosure/REO pipeline even larger. Currently, households in negative equity or \"underwater\" on their loans owe $65,000 on average more on their mortgages than the value of their homes. Since the recession, most defaults have been by necessity — that is, they have been prompted by a job loss, health problems or divorce coupled with the household being in negative equity. No doubt, however, there is some degree or duration of negative equity that may cause households to conclude that a default is inevitable and should be taken sooner rather than later. If this point were reached, defaults by choice could significantly swell the flow of homes into the foreclosure pipeline.\n\nThe Case for Housing Intervention\nAll these factors imply that there are many potential equilibrium outcomes in terms of housing demand and home prices—some considerably more desirable than others. Negative price expectations and flawed financing and administrative mechanisms, if left unaddressed, can contribute to ongoing weakness in housing demand and make it harder to generate a robust economic recovery.\n\nPersistent weakness in housing is particularly problematic because it acts as a drag on spending and job creation in an environment in which such weakness can not be easily offset by other policy adjustments. Housing policy should seek to break adverse feedback loops, promote more economically efficient outcomes in housing and support growth.\n\nIn recent speeches,10 I have called for a \"comprehensive approach\" to stabilize the national real estate market and lay the foundations for recovery. I believe this should include measures to improve access to mortgage credit, reduce obstacles to refinancing, lessen the flow of homes into foreclosure through bridge financing and accelerated principal reduction, and to facilitate the absorption of REO back into use as owner- or renter- housing.\n\nMany of these policies simply seek to solve or bypass the legal and incentive problems in the market today and mimic efficient private actions that might be taken if mortgage loans were all held in portfolio and accounting rules did not discourage net present value maximization.\n\nOthers seek to solve coordination problems and take account of the externalities or spillovers to generate outcomes that are superior from the broadest perspective of the nation as a whole.\n\nEarlier this week Chairman Bernanke sent members of Congress a thoughtful analysis of housing policy11 by staff at the Board of Governors in Washington that evaluates a number of these same issues. What I would like to do today is to elaborate on some specific proposals we have developed in New York, in order to try to persuade you that there are workable solutions to our housing problems at costs that I deem very reasonable relative to the economically inefficient path we are on. Of course, I am open to other promising alternatives that would address the same issues.\n\nI note also that a truly comprehensive approach would also include long-term reform —including reform of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac—to put housing finance on a more stable footing and to equip the market to deal more effectively with any future systemic shocks.\n\nBut I will not discuss these issues in-depth today.\n\nAccess to Mortgage Credit\nRestoring demand for housing requires new mortgage debt to be offered to creditworthy borrowers on reasonable terms. This is important because residential mortgage lending terms tightened significantly during the crisis, and have not eased subsequently.12\n\nIndeed, over 50 percent of all new loans—and 70 percent of new prime conforming loans—go to borrowers with FICO scores of 760 or above, compared with about 30 percent before the crisis. Borrowers with credit scores of 720 or less now make up less than 30 percent of new originations, although they represent 52 percent of the population with credit scores.\n\nSteps should be taken to improve households' access to credit. Currently, lenders are discouraged from making new prime conforming loans due to excessively stringent put-back rules on these mortgages. Such rules give Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac broad scope to force the originator to repurchase at par loans that go delinquent if there are any errors in the mortgage loan paperwork—even if the error has no direct link to the delinquency.\n\nIt is essential that lenders are accountable for the representations they make and are appropriately penalized for any misrepresentations. However, doing this via a blanket repurchase regime leads to bad outcomes at a time when there is an unusually high risk of job loss leading to delinquency. It would be better to establish alternative ways to penalize lenders for misrepresentation that were not in practice so closely tied to the risk of job loss.13 \n\nThe current repurchase regime exposes lenders originating prime conforming loans to significant credit risk and encourages them to focus only on the lowest-risk customers.\n\nLenders are applying tougher restrictions than the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac formally require in order to limit the risk that they will have to take back such loans when they become delinquent.\n\nFor mortgages guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a better balance between incentives for sound underwriting and credit availability could be achieved by inserting a materiality test in the rep and warranty agreement.\n\nIn the future, it would be worth exploring whether a better regime in general would be to have representations and warranties with a finite duration, but supplemented by a rigorous quality control check of the underwiting based on a random sample of the mortgages as they are being securitized.14\n\nToday's tough underwriting standards and high risk-based premiums for conforming loan borrowers should also be reviewed. I do not want to see a return to the lax standards and underpricing of credit risk of the boom period. But the guarantee fees for new purchase mortgages should be based on the expected losses on these mortgages—not the realized losses on loans of earlier vintages.\n\nThere is also a strong case for tackling the downward bias on appraisals, which are voiding many transactions between willing buyers and willing sellers. Incentives for individual appraisers favor conservatism today—just as they favored over-optimism during the boom.\n\nThis problem is aggravated by the difficulty in establishing benchmark prices in markets with few transactions and a high share of distress sales. The industry could establish appraisal standards that avoid such procylical outcomes.\n\nMortgage Refinancing\nIncreasing refinancing would support the housing market by promoting aggregate demand and employment. Refinancing creates additional cash flow for borrowers to absorb any adverse income shocks and this reduces the likelihood of default, distress sales and foreclosures.\n\nHowever, there are significant obstacles to refinancing in current circumstances. Declines in home equity have been aggravated by tighter standards, high refinancing fees, burdensome administrative processes, and legal risks to the lenders refinancing the loan.\n\nBecause the taxpayer, via Fannie and Freddie, is already exposed to the risk of conforming loans defaulting, it makes no sense to make it expensive or difficult for borrowers with these loans to refinance. After all, refinancing reduces the credit risk to which taxpayers are exposed. It is also inefficient to fully re-underwrite applications for such refinancings. For example, appraisals could be greatly simplified and made less expensive by using automated valuation models.\n\nThe Home Affordable Refinance Program, or HARP, was set up to facilitate refinancing of high loan-to-value prime conforming mortgages. The announced goal of the HARP was to refinance 3 million to 4 million mortgages. However, shortcomings with the original program mean that less than a million HARP refinancings have taken place.\n\nLegal risks discouraged lenders from participating more fully in HARP to date. Notably, if a lender refinanced a loan made by another company, it was liable for the underwriting associated with the original loan. The profit from refinancing was unattractive relative to the risk of being forced to repurchase the loan. Given this, lenders had little incentive to compete to refinance loans and this led to higher mortgage rates and less refinancing.\n\nMany of these issues have been addressed by recent revisions to HARP and related decisions by Fannie Mae, but more could and should be done. Remaining legal issues could be alleviated by harmonizing standards between Fannie and Freddie.\n\nI would like to see refinancing made broadly available on streamlined terms and with moderate fees to all prime conforming borrowers who are current on their payments. This could substantially increase the number of refinancings.\n\nBridge Financing\nTo stabilize the housing market, we also need to weaken the link between unemployment and new foreclosures. The primary reason for distress sales and mortgage defaults today is the loss of a job. Even if it were possible, it would be inefficient for homeowners with mortgages to self-insure against a job loss.\n\nSome support for unemployed homeowners has been provided in some states under the Hardest Hit program. I favor a broad program to provide bridge financing for all qualified borrowers with demonstrated ability to service their debts who become unemployed involuntarily—though categorically not those who quit or are terminated with cause. In economic terms, this is a form of collective insurance.15 \n\nMy staff estimates that there are 4 million to 5 million \"at risk\" homeowners who can afford their mortgage, but who would struggle to make their payments in the event that the primary earner in the household became unemployed.\n\nWith the current weak labor markets, they estimate around 600,000 of these at-risk households will experience an involuntary job loss that lasts longer than a month over the next year. The average annual amount that would be required to keep the mortgage current for these households while unemployed and receiving unemployment insurance is around $21,000. This would be a loan not a grant.16 \n\nThis implies an annual bridge lending program of $15 billion per year during the current stress period. This seems expensive, but this is not the cost of such a program, just the cash outlay in the early years. In the future, loan repayments would help to offset the program cost.\n\nMoreover, when one factors in the reduced negative externalities achieved by limiting distress sales, the expected program cost would be even lower.\n\nOf course, any bridge financing loans would need to be properly secured in order to protect taxpayers interests. In situations in which the value of the loan already exceeded the value of the home, it might be appropriate to require lenders to write down the excess debt as a condition for the borrower obtaining a bridge loan. This would ensure that the bridging funds did not \"bail out\" the lender. Writing down excess debt would likely be in the lender's rational self-interest given the borrower's situation, since a distress sale or foreclosure at current market prices would generally yield larger losses.\n\nEarned Principal Reduction\nInvestment firms that purchase delinquent mortgages routinely reduce principal in order to maximize value on these loans. It would make sense for Fannie and Freddie to do this as well in order to minimize loss of value on the delinquent loans they guarantee.\n\nHowever, I am uncomfortable with the notion that \"underwater\" borrowers who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth should have to go delinquent before they have a chance of securing a reduction in their mortgage debt. I believe we should also develop a program for earned principal reduction for borrowers who are underwater but keep on making their mortgage payments. Such a program would strengthen the incentives for mortgage holders who are underwater to continue to stay current on their loans, and reduce the likely number of defaults and REO sales.\n\nNegative equity is one of the most significant predictors of mortgage default across all types of mortgage products, including when you control for credit scores and level of income documentation. While recent underwater borrowers have not been defaulting at a rapid pace, they are also not prepaying, implying that underwater mortgages remain \"at risk\" for a prolonged period of time to any adverse shock to the borrower.\n\nIt is admittedly challenging to predict how underwater borrowers will ultimately perform and this performance will be sensitive to the path of home prices. Nonetheless, analysis by my staff that looks at likely borrower behavior over an extended time horizon suggests that without a significant turnaround in home prices and employment, a substantial proportion of those loans that are deeply underwater will ultimately default — absent an earned principal reduction program.\n\nOne option developed by my staff is for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to give underwater borrowers on loans that they have guaranteed the right to pay off the loan at below par in the future under certain circumstances, including that the borrowers have continued to make timely payments. For instance, the borrower could be given an open-ended option to pay off the loan at an LTV of 125 percent, and the right to pay off the loan at an LTV of 95 percent after three years of timely payments.\n\nThe borrower would be protected from further declines in home prices, but in return would give up a portion of any upside from future capital gains on the home via a shared appreciation agreement. Note that under this arrangement some of the reduction in the loan amount would be paid by the borrower as the outstanding balance was amortized by continued monthly payments.\n\nREO Portfolio\nEven with aggressive policies to minimize the flow of loans into foreclosure, my staff estimates that large volumes of properties would still flow into lenders' REO over the next few years. This growing overhang could continue to depress prices.\n\nThus, along with more incentives to promote short sales, steps should be taken to facilitate the timely and orderly absorption of these properties back into the market including as renter-occupied housing. An interagency group including the Federal Reserve is working on issues relating to REO-to-rental conversions. Appropriate policies would simultaneously lessen downward pressure on home prices and upward pressure on rents.\n\nAmong other steps, investors could be encouraged to purchase REO to be made available as rental housing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could increase the number of loans offered to individual investors, provided the investor puts up an adequate amount of equity for each mortgage. And REO properties in a given locality could be bundled for sale.\n\nThe government might consider a package of tax incentives for purchases of REO that are used as rental properties. Such incentives might include a reduction of the current 27½ year depreciation period and/or a reduction of capital gains tax liability if the property is held for a minimum period, such as five years.\n\nOne idea developed by my staff—let's call it \"homes for heros\"—would be to create a new tax credit or other home purchase subsidy specifically for veterans of our foreign wars that would enable these veterans to purchase such properties at a discount. There are over 2½ million Gulf War II veterans alone, many of whom served multiple tours of duty overseas, and a significant proportion of them might otherwise not be able to purchase homes today.\n\nOur nation owes them a great debt, and such a policy would provide a boost to housing demand quickly.\n\nMoral Hazard\nSome argue that any interventions to improve the real estate market would lead to moral hazard—that is these intervention would reward bad behaviors. I think these concerns are overstated. First, the programs that have been proposed can be designed with the proper incentives to limit moral hazard and to encourage desireable behavior.\n\nSecond, in contrast to the earlier phase of housing crisis when mostly subprime borrowers came under stress, many of the borrowers running into trouble with their mortgages today took out conforming loans subject to standard downpayment requirements, had respectable FICO scores and borrowed a moderate amount to finance an average house. The problem was that these purchases occurred near the peak in the market and now many of the buyers have suffered an adverse life shock such as unemployment or illness. This isn't a moral hazard issue, this is just the bad luck associated with the timing of the purchase and an exceptionally weak jobs market. Punishing such misfortune accomplishes little.\n\nThe Taxpayer Interest\nI believe that the proposals I put forward are strongly in the public interest. I also believe that they would be good for taxpayers. Consider, for instance, the proposal for earned principal reduction. While this would certainly involve outlays, these would be offset by reduced defaults. Whether there is a net cost or not depends on the reduction in the default rate that would come with principal reduction and how this reduction would affect the performance of the overall housing market and the economy.\n\nBased on recent data on borrower behavior,17 my staff calculates that the taxpayer (through the effect on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) would be better off with earned principal reduction under a base case of roughly flat house prices and persistent weakness in the jobs market. Under a scenario of modest house price increases, the combination of fewer defaults and shared appreciation also produces a net benefit.\n\nThis result occurs before taking into account the positive externalities of nudging house prices onto a stronger path, which would reduce the magnitude of losses on loans that do default. On an expected value basis, such a program appears still more compelling, since Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are currently exposed to the downside risk of further declines in home prices.\n\nOf course, just focusing on the impact on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is much too narrow even from a taxpayer perspective. If you believe as I do that improving the outlook for housing would materially strengthen the over economy, one must also include the fiscal benefits generated by stronger economic growth.\n\nHousing Policy and Monetary Policy\nIn closing, the housing policy agenda I describe would address one factor that has impeded the economic recovery. Implementing such policies would improve the economic outlook and make monetary accommodation more effective.\n\nHowever, because the outlook for unemployment is unacceptably high relative to our dual mandate and the outlook for inflation is moderate, I believe it is also appropriate to continue to evaluate whether we could provide additional accommodation in a manner that produces more benefits than costs, regardless of whether action in housing is undertaken or not.\n\nMonetary policy and housing policy are much more complements than substitutes.\n\nAs I hope I have convinced you today, while the Fed has will do all it can to achieve our dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability, we have to recognize that there is more to economic policy than just monetary policy. Low interest rates help housing, but cannot resolve the problems in that sector that are pressing on wider economic activity. With additional housing policy interventions, we could achieve a better set of economic outcomes than with just monetary policy alone.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n___________________________________________________\n1 William C.

Source of data is CoreLogic.\n\n6 In Las Vegas, for instance, the ratio of house prices to replacement costs is now 0.7, having peaked at about 2.0 during the boom.\n\n7 The supply curve is fixed and vertical at the post-bubble stock of housing so the entire adjustment to changes in demand takes place via prices rather than quantities.\n\n8 A number of these issues were documented by an interagency task force that included the Federal Reserve and are being addressed through consent orders requiring supervised institutions to remedy deficiencies.\n\n9 When the amount of debt secured by a property exceeds its likely net sales price, a \"short sale\" can be a less costly alternative to foreclosure. The short sale agreement between the homeowner and lender often grants the lender final approval of the sales price and may release the homeowner from any deficiency.\n\n10 \"The National and Regional Economic Outlook,\" October 24, 2011, and \"Securing the Recovery\" November 17, 2011.\n\n11 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2012. White Paper, \"The U.S. Housing Market: Current Conditions and Policy Considerations,\" January 4.  \n\n12 According to the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey.\n\n13 We should want the cost of misrepresenting loans to be invariant to the state of the jobs market.\n\n14 Risk retention will also apply to some forms of mortgages in future.\n\n15 In the early 1980s, Pennsylvania created such a loan program to assist homeowners dealing with unemployment due to the closing down of steel mills. The program was called the Homeowners's Emergency Mortgage Assistance Program, or HEMAP. Since its inception, over 80 percent of the loans made under the program have been fully repaid and the borrowers able to remain in their homes. A new program could be funded by the federal government or individual states.\n\n16 In addition, the repayment terms for the bridge loan once the owner becomes reemployed should be contingent on the owner's reemployment earnings.\n\n17 Lender Processing Services data."
