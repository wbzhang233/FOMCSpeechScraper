    "content": "Today I want to talk about a security market that should offer safety during this period of financial market turbulence\u2014the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities or TIPS market. Now that this market is more than 10 years old, it should be sufficiently mature to permit a fair evaluation of its efficacy as a funding vehicle for the U.S. Treasury. Some research studies have concluded that the incremental financing costs associated with the TIPS program have been substantial, leading some to conclude that the costs may outweigh the benefits. Today I am going to lay out the reasons why I disagree with this conclusion.\n\nPut simply, I come here to praise TIPS\u2026 In my opinion, the benefits of the TIPS program significantly exceed the costs of the program.\n\nBefore saying anything more, let me emphasize the phrase in the prior sentence\u2014\u201cin my opinion.\u201d The views that I express today are my own and may not represent the views of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe logic of issuing inflation-protected securities is straightforward. Wouldn\u2019t some investors pay a premium\u2014that is, accept a lower expected return\u2014in exchange for guaranteed, full compensation for inflation? Because the United States and a number of other countries decided that the answer was likely enough to be \u201cyes,\u201d they developed an inflation-indexed government debt market.\n\nHas the program been a good development from the perspective of the U.S. Treasury? What about from the public\u2019s perspective?\n\nA good starting point for answering these questions is to account for the costs and benefits of the program relative to an appropriate counterfactual. For example, we might start by comparing the difference in funding costs to the Treasury of TIPS versus a program of comparable duration nominal Treasuries.\n\nBut we should also be careful not to ignore other potential benefits of the TIPS program. As I see it, these potential benefits include:\n\nAlthough it is difficult to quantify these benefits, I will argue that they are considerable and should not be ignored in evaluating the benefits of the TIPS program.\n\nTurning first to the issue of measuring the impact of TIPS issuance on the government\u2019s funding costs, this could be done simply by comparing the ex-post costs of a program of TIPS issuance to the costs of a comparable program of nominal Treasury issuance. Studies of this sort have typically shown that TIPS issuance has resulted in a higher net cost to the Treasury. For example, a 2004 paper by Brian Sack and Robert Elsasser found a net cost to the Treasury from the start of the program through early 2004 of slightly less than $3 billion. A more recent paper by Jennifer Roush of the Federal Reserve Board finds that total ex-post costs of TIPS through March 2007 were in the range of $5-8 billion. Unfortunately, although this methodology is attractive in its simplicity, it has some flaws that undercut its usefulness in reaching conclusions about the attractiveness of the TIPS program.\n\nThe problem with an ex-post analysis is that it depends critically upon the performance of inflation over the period in question. If inflation turns out to have been meaningfully different than what was expected at the time of TIPS issuance, then this difference\u2014the so-called \u201cinflation surprise\u201d\u2014can be important in affecting the relative costs of TIPS versus nominal Treasury issuance. If inflation turns out to be higher than expected, then TIPS issuance will likely look to have been more expensive than nominal Treasury issuance. If inflation turns out lower, an ex-post analysis will likely show a saving from the TIPS program.\n\nOver the long run\u2014and I mean the very long run\u2014there should be roughly as many downward surprises in inflation performance as upward surprises. But within any relatively short period, such as the last decade, this certainly does not need to be the case. In other words, over such a short period, the outcome of an ex-post analysis can be heavily influenced by which of the two sides\u2014the Treasury or investors\u2014was the lucky recipient of the net inflation surprise that occurred over the period in question.\nFor example, in countries, such as the United Kingdom, where inflation declined following the inception of an inflation-linked debt program, ex-post studies generally suggest that these programs have reduced financing costs for these countries.\n\nThe fact that the Treasury saved or lost money ex post is thus not a very reliable guide as to whether the strategic decision to implement a TIPS program has been a good idea. The relevant question is whether the Treasury obtained the financing it needed at a lower ex- ante cost. If the experiment were to be run thousands of times drawing from the underlying distribution of possible inflation outcomes, would Treasury\u2019s costs have been lower, on average, with TIPS or with nominal Treasuries? To conclude on the basis of one coin flip or roll of the dice as ex-post analysis essentially does surely is not the best way to evaluate the respective costs of TIPS issuance versus nominal Treasuries.\n\nTo execute an ex-ante analysis, we need a real-time measure of the inflation expectations of TIPS investors that is not contaminated by premiums for inflation risk or liquidity differentials. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have a perfect measure. Nevertheless, we may be able to get close. We do have estimates of expected inflation from other sources\u2014such as the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. If such measures do indeed reflect the inflation expectations of investors, then we can conduct a reasonably accurate ex-ante analysis.\n\nTIPS analysts often talk about a concept they call the breakeven inflation rate. Essentially, this is the realized inflation rate that would cause investors to come out the same in terms of total compensation regardless of whether they had bought TIPS or nominal securities. If inflation comes in above the breakeven rate, the investor who bought TIPS comes out ahead ex post; if inflation comes in below the breakeven rate, the investor who bought nominal securities wins. When I wrote this speech, the breakeven inflation rate at the ten-year maturity point was about 2.4 percent. This compares to the Philadelphia Survey of Professional Forecasters\u2019 most recent long-run estimate for CPI inflation of 2.4 percent. If we assume that the SPF fairly represents the expectations of investors, then the current constellation of data indicates that investors are roughly indifferent between the benefit of being protected against inflation risk versus the cost in terms of the greater illiquidity of TIPS relative to on-the-run nominal Treasuries. Thus, on an ex-ante basis, it appears that the cost of issuing TIPS is currently about equal to the cost of issuing nominal Treasuries. From this perspective, there appears to be no net benefit or cost from TIPS in terms of expected financing costs.\n\nThat does not sound very compelling for TIPS. But I think it is important to emphasize that this standoff is occurring at a time when the preference for liquidity is especially strong. This benefits nominal Treasuries versus TIPS. When market turmoil subsides and this liquidity premium shrinks, one might expect TIPS to move ahead on an ex-ante basis.\n\nEven on an ex-post basis, a detailed analysis of the timing of the net costs of TIPS issuance suggests that continuing a TIPS program makes sense. In her examination of the ex-post costs of the TIPS program, Jennifer Roush finds that the entire cost occurs during the early years of the TIPS program\u2014up until around 2004. Roush\u2019s analysis suggests that there were large startup costs associated with the TIPS program. Initially, TIPS were quite illiquid and investors demanded significant compensation for this illiquidity. But as the market developed, this illiquidity discount shrank.\n\nThe important point to take away from Roush\u2019s analysis is that the large startup costs of the TIPS program have passed and are now, in essence, sunk costs. Thus, if the question is whether the TIPS program should be continued on the basis of expected interest expense, then the answer appears to be \u201cyes.\u201d Since 2004, TIPS issuance appears to have saved the Treasury money and the program appears likely to be \u201cprofitable\u201d from the perspective of the Treasury on an ongoing basis.\n\nSo it\u2019s TIPS by a small margin at this point. But that\u2019s before we have included some of the other considerable\u2014although more difficult to quantify\u2014benefits associated with TIPS issuance.\n\nLet me now discuss some of these other benefits. The comparison between the prevailing interest rates on TIPS versus nominal Treasuries provides insight into the relative costs associated with issuing the last dollar of debt. Is the marginal cost of TIPS lower than the marginal cost of nominal Treasuries? But just as important is whether TIPS issuance, by displacing nominal Treasury issuance, reduces the average cost of nominal Treasuries. This would occur if TIPS were not perfect substitutes for nominal Treasury securities and if the demand for nominal Treasuries were downward sloping\u2014i.e., not completely elastic.\n\nThe first condition almost certainly holds given the different attributes of TIPS versus nominal Treasuries. If they were perfect substitutes, then there would not be a liquidity premium for nominal Treasuries versus TIPS. The second condition almost certainly holds because numerous studies have found that an increase in the net amount of Treasury borrowing leads to higher expected borrowing costs for the Treasury.\n\nHow big might this effect be? To get an idea of potential magnitude let\u2019s make two assumptions. First, let\u2019s assume that TIPS and nominal Treasuries are not substitutes at all. This is too strong, but it will make it simpler to think through the analysis and it will be offset by a second assumption that will be on the conservative side.\n\nSecond, let\u2019s assume that each $100 billion increase in Treasury issuance leads to a 1 basis point increase in nominal Treasury yields. In contrast to the first assumption, this assumption appears to be very conservative. After all, a study by Thomas Laubach that looked at the impact of a one percentage point increase in the projected debt-to-GDP level (about $140 billion currently), found that such an increase could be expected to raise the future level of interest rates by about 4 basis points. This is not quite the same comparison because he was focused on an increase in the expected amount of debt outstanding and we are looking at a change in the composition of Treasury debt issuance. Nevertheless, it suggests that our 1 basis point assumption may be in the ballpark\u2014it certainly does not seem, on the face of it, to be unreasonably large.\n\nApplying this 1 basis point saving to the entire stock of nominal marketable Treasury debt outstanding\u2014after all, we are arguing that less nominal issuance reduces the average cost of all nominal marketable Treasury debt (about $4 trillion), this would imply a saving from TIPS issuance of about $400 million per year. While this estimate provides a false level of precision, it does suggest that the magnitude of the potential saving from this source is not trivial, especially viewed relative to the ex-post cost estimates of the TIPS program discussed earlier.\n\nThe second noteworthy benefit that stems from TIPS issuance is the fact that it reduces risk to the U.S. government in terms of the variability of its net financial position. Although the U.S. Treasury historically has focused on the net interest expense and rollover risk associated with funding the U.S. budget deficit, one could argue that this is an incomplete set of objectives. The Treasury might also take into consideration the goal of minimizing the volatility of its net financial position. After all, this goal is consistent with Treasury\u2019s long-repeated policy of maintaining regular and predictable debt issuance to help minimize net interest costs.\n\nSo what role might TIPS play in this regard? That\u2019s simple. The rate of inflation influences both the cost of TIPS and the government\u2019s tax receipts. Thus, some level of TIPS issuance may reduce the variability of the government\u2019s net financial position. This, in turn, should lead to a more regular and predictable pattern of issuance, which should help minimize interest costs.\n\nThe potential role of TIPS in terms of the asset-liability management of the government\u2019s fiscal position is just the flip side of the role of TIPS for entities such as pension plans that have liabilities linked to inflation. The Treasury has assets in the form of anticipated tax revenue that are sensitive to inflation. If this is the case, it may make sense for its liabilities\u2014its expected borrowing costs\u2014to also have some sensitivity to unexpected shifts in inflation. In contrast, for a pension plan in which benefits are indexed to inflation, it is just the reverse\u2014it is useful to have assets that are sensitive to inflation.\n\nThe point I want to emphasize here is that the Treasury\u2019s borrowing decisions should be made within an asset-liability management framework. The goal is not just to minimize the government\u2019s net interest expense. If that were the case, then all borrowing should occur in the Treasury bill market given that the yield curve is upward sloping on average. Instead, the Treasury\u2019s borrowing regime should consider many elements including interest expense, rollover risk, and the impact of the borrowing regime on the variability of the government\u2019s net financial position. I am only suggesting that the last factor\u2014the impact of borrowing on the variability of the net financial position\u2014should be added to the mix and that the role of TIPS should be evaluated in that context.\n\nThe third noteworthy benefit from the TIPS program is the value of TIPS as a tool for assessing inflation expectations. Because keeping inflation expectations well-anchored is so important in keeping inflation itself in check, real-time measures of inflation expectations may lead to better monetary policy-making. This, in turn, should improve macroeconomic performance. Although this is very difficult to quantify in terms of value, I think it is safe to say that in a $14 trillion economy, even a modest improvement in performance generates large dollar benefits.\n\nU.S. policymakers focus on four broad sets of inflation expectation measures:\n\nBut in practice, the value of the first three measures is limited by the lack of timeliness\u2014new data become available only monthly, about every six weeks, or quarterly. Also, real money isn\u2019t riding on the accuracy of the survey responses. In contrast, the comparison between nominal Treasury and TIPS yields represents the consensus of market participants.\n\nFor these reasons, policymakers put considerable weight on the inflation expectations proxied by the difference between nominal Treasury note and TIPS yields. Here the emphasis is not on the break-even inflation rate as implied by, say, the 5-year Treasury notes versus 5-year TIPS or 10-year Treasury notes versus 10-year TIPS, but instead on forward measures of breakeven inflation.\n\nFor example, the 5-year, 5-year forward breakeven inflation measure is a very important part of the monetary policymaking process. Without a TIPS market, this tool would be unavailable and I think it would be safe to say that monetary policy would suffer as a consequence.\n\nHow much is this tool worth? Of course, it is very difficult to say. Perhaps, we would flatter ourselves and think that we could do just as well without such a market-based, real-time measure of inflation expectations. But I doubt it. After all, inflation expectations, when untethered, are very difficult to re-anchor. TIPS help make it easier to keep inflation expectations firmly in check.\n\nFinally, TIPS offer a benefit to investors because they have less risk than any other asset class. With virtually no credit risk or inflation risk, TIPS are one of the safest of investments.1 For investors that want such safety, TIPS offer significant benefits. How much is this worth? Is the value of this completely captured in the relative interest costs of TIPS? Probably not, because the relative interest costs between TIPS and nominal Treasuries are set at the margin. I think there is some value in having a high-quality hedge to inflation risk, especially one that is available to less sophisticated investors.\n\nHopefully, I have convinced you that the benefits of an ongoing TIPS program exceed its costs. So now I want to turn to a related question: Are there ways to increase the benefits?\n\nI would be willing to make two modest suggestions here. First, it may make sense to emphasize longer-dated TIPS issuance rather than shorter-dated issuance. Analytically, the logic goes as follows. Inflation uncertainty is likely to increase at longer time horizons. Thus, investors are likely to pay a greater premium for inflation protection at longer-time horizons. This implies that the cost savings associated with TIPS are likely to be greater for longer maturities rather than shorter maturities.\n\nThis prediction is supported by empirical studies that have examined the premium that investors pay for inflation protection both in the United States and elsewhere. For example, a recent study by Brian Sack of Macroeconomic Advisors finds that forward breakeven inflation rates increase as maturity lengthens. In contrast, the level of survey-based measures of inflation expectations is quite constant beyond a time horizon of a few years. This means that the difference between forward breakeven inflation and inflation expectations climbs as the time horizon extends. This strongly suggests that the premium that investors pay for inflation protection increases as maturities lengthen.\n\nSecond, it may make sense to concentrate TIPS issuance and limit the number of outstanding issues. This might increase the liquidity of outstanding TIPS issues. That might help reduce the illiquidity discount associated with TIPS relative to on-the-run nominal Treasury securities.\n\nLong live TIPS! That\u2019s my conclusion. Thanks for your attention.\n\n__________________________________\n\nSpecial thanks to Jennifer Roush and David Wilcox at the Federal Reserve Board and my colleagues at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2014Michelle Steinberg, Debby Perelmuter, Lorie Logan, Joshua Frost and Lara Green-Spector for their insightful comments and suggestions.\n\n1 There is some inflation basis risk in that TIPS are based on the not seasonally adjusted consumer price index and a household\u2019s expenditure basket might differ from the basket in the CPI. Also, pension and endowment liabilities may be more closely related to other inflation or wage measures than the CPI."

    "content": "Second New York Fed-Princeton Liquidity Conference \u203a\u203a\n\nWelcome to the New York Fed and to this conference on liquidity. You are addressing some of the most important issues affecting financial markets today. Your timing is good, perhaps too good. We are all going to need some time and perspective before we will know enough to draw conclusions and recommendations from the events of the past six months. The conditions that led to this crisis took a long time to develop and they will take some time to resolve. I think it is appropriate, though, that as central banks act to address the challenges in markets today, we also begin to define the agenda for future research and policy.\n\nOn December 12, the Federal Reserve and several other major central banks, announced a series of actions in response to the elevated pressures in funding markets. Together, these actions provide a more flexible and potentially more effective set of instruments, alongside our conventional monetary policy instruments, to help mitigate the risks that liquidity pressures in markets going forward could pose to the broader economy. With this framework of tools, we have the capacity to calibrate our response as market conditions change.\n\nAlthough the specifics vary across central banks, the approaches outlined have several important common elements. We each have taken actions to provide more financing at terms longer than overnight. We each have chosen to auction funding against a broader range of collateral, collateral other than government securities, and in our case with a broader set of counterparties. And we have activated swap lines to help the relevant central banks provide liquidity in dollars in their markets.\n\nThe initial spark to the pressures we observe in markets today was the sharp deterioration in the value of nonprime mortgage securities and the resulting increase in uncertainty about the value of a much larger amount of financial assets exposed to that risk. This was magnified by a substantial increase in uncertainty about the economic outlook and the consequences of that uncertainty for asset values and credit losses. Financial institutions faced a sharp drop in demand for a range of assets, impairing the securitization market as a source of funding. And a substantial amount of these illiquid assets were held in vehicles with implicit or explicit liquidity guarantees provided by banks. This produced a large unexpected increase in demand for funding from banks at the same time banks confronted a reduced capacity to raise financing.\n\nAs market participants have adjusted to what has been a very acute change in expectations about economic and credit risk, they have become more cautious in how they use their liquidity and capital. The symptoms of this are apparent in the high risk premia across a range of assets, as well as in the dramatic contraction in the volume of transactions for certain assets and the securities that reference those assets. Elevated term premia in the interbank market has the effect of tightening overall financial conditions, offsetting some of the impact of reductions in the target federal funds rate.\n\nThe danger this poses is the risk of an adverse, self-reinforcing dynamic in which concerns about overall liquidity magnify concerns about credit problems. As financial institutions prepare for a more challenging funding environment, in part by conserving capital, and as they anticipate the higher potential losses that would normally accompany an economic slowdown, their response, in aggregate, makes markets and the economy potentially more vulnerable to that adverse outcome. The risk is a greater contraction in the availability of credit beyond what might have otherwise occurred, with attendant risks to growth.\n\nMonetary policy has an important role to play in addressing these dynamics in markets. By adjusting policy proactively as the risk to the outlook changes, central banks can help reduce the probability of the extreme adverse outcome. And this can positively affect the incentives that might otherwise lead market participants to protect themselves against the extreme outcome.\n\nCentral banks have been employing a range of different tools to help reduce the incentive for an excessive level of liquidity hoarding by banks that might impede an efficient flow of liquidity among banks. Although the mix of tools and approaches has varied across the major economies, each has tried to provide a more effective form of liquidity insurance to its financial institutions by expanding the capacity of banks to borrow at longer maturities from the central banks against a broader range of collateral.\n\nThe actions to address liquidity issues\u2014those we announced this week and those that we have taken over the past five months\u2014can help reinforce our monetary policy actions by providing greater assurance for market participants of access to funding. By allowing strong banks to borrow against collateral that they can no longer easily finance in the market, the central bank is providing an additional source of liquidity to banks as a complement to our open market operations.\n\nThe Term Auction Facility gives us a tool that lies somewhere between our open market operations and our primary credit program. It provides a mechanism for expanding the range of collateral against which we provide funds to the market\u2014in effect to change the composition of our balance sheet\u2014in ways we cannot do through traditional open market operations. And it does this in a way that may be more effective in mitigating a broader marketwide liquidity shortage than does the existing discount window facility, in part because of the perceived stigma in recourse to a facility that has come to be regarded as a source of funds for individual institutions facing a temporary, exceptional need for liquidity. Because the quantity of funds to be injected is known in advance, this mechanism poses fewer complications for our ability to reduce volatility in the fed funds rate around the target.\n\nThe auction facility and other measures we have taken to address market liquidity problems do not directly address the balance sheet or capital constraints facing financial institutions. Nor can they be expected directly to reduce the perceived risk in exposure to other financial counterparties. But by providing a more effective form of access to liquidity, these new measures can help reduce the uncertainty that gives institutions the incentive to secure liquidity in ways that might lead to a further deterioration on market conditions.\n\nMajor financial institutions in the United States and elsewhere entered this period of adjustment with capital substantially above the various regulatory thresholds. These capital cushions have enabled banks to expand their balance sheets as they have met contingent commitments and as the economics of other non-bank financing vehicles have deteriorated. This has been an important part of the adjustment process in markets.\n\nWe have also seen some early steps by a range of different institutions to bring new capital into the banking and financial system. This is a healthy development. It reduces the need for further asset sales to preserve capital ratios. And it gives those institutions that acted earlier and on a more substantial scale the flexibility to play a greater role in markets and in the economy going forward.\n\nFinally, let me say something about future challenges in this area that are of special relevance to today\u2019s conference and to the research agenda in which you are all engaged.\n\nWe are already involved in a coordinated review with other central banks and supervisors of how we should adapt policy and supervision in the wake of this financial crisis. Two issues are of particular interest in the context of this conference.\n\nThe first relates to the incentives we create, through regulation and supervision and other policies, for influencing how financial market participants manage liquidity risk. Several aspects of the existing capital framework and other parts of the policy and regulatory framework affect these incentives. In addition, the evolution of the financial system has altered the role and importance of liquidity provision by banks and how that provision of liquidity responds to different types of stress to the financial system.\n\nThe second issue relates to the tools that central banks have at their disposal for providing liquidity in ways that do support our monetary policy objectives. Do we need additional instruments that would better enable us to mitigate marketwide liquidity problems? And how can we mitigate the moral hazard risk inherent in such instruments?\n\nEfforts are underway to address these issues both within the Fed and among our central banking colleagues around the world. We will be looking both to financial market participants and to the academic community for advice.\n\nFor now, though, our principal task is to address the challenges of the present. The Federal Reserve Act gives us broad authority to act in response to these types of conditions. We will continue to examine ways to adapt our instruments as market conditions evolve. We will do so in close cooperation with other central banks, as indeed we have since August. And we will do so in the tradition of pragmatism and flexibility that has been one of the defining features of the central bank of the United States.\n\nThank you.\n\n____________________________________\n\nI would like to thank Jamie McAndrews and Meg McConnell of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for assistance and comments."

    "speaker": "Unknown",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2007/dud071017",
    "content": "Exhibits 1-14\n\nIt is a pleasure to have an opportunity to speak here today. Before I begin in earnest let me start by saying my comments represent my own views and opinions and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI have entitled this speech, \u201cMay You Live in Interesting Times,\u201d for two reasons. First, it is a reminder to me that many things\u2014including this expression itself\u2014are not always as they seem. I had always understood that this saying referred to an ancient Chinese proverb or curse. Imagine my surprise when I did some investigative work in preparation for this speech. It turns out that Chinese scholars know of no such Chinese proverb or curse. According to Wikipedia, which is a well-known online encyclopedia, the expression is a Western invention\u2014undoubtedly ascribed to the Chinese to make it look more wise, inscrutable, enduring and ancient.\n\nSecond, despite the fact that this expression may not be the genuine article, it is, nevertheless, an apt way to characterize the past few months.\n\nIt is remarkable what we have observed in financial markets.\n\nBriefly, let me give you a few examples of events that I never expected to see\u2014ever:\n\nObviously, these have been interesting times with plenty to think about\n\nIn my mind, the major conundrum that deserves further investigation and evaluation is a question that Chairman Bernanke considered in his speech at the recent Jackson Hole conference:\n\nHow did the problems in the subprime mortgage area\u2014with losses that probably will ultimately turn out to be in a range of $100-200 billion\u2014lead to such broad market distress?\n\nIf we can elucidate how that happened, then maybe we can also get some insight into how long the market dysfunction might last and what policy responses to this dysfunction might be appropriate. We have been spending a considerable amount of time thinking about this issue in recent months.\n\nSo let\u2019s start with the subprime mortgage market. By now, the salient facts are pretty well known and agreed upon. Delinquency rates for adjustable rate subprime debt have been climbing rapidly and the rate of deterioration is most severe for the most recent vintages.\n\nExhibit 1 shows the delinquency rates for the subprime mortgages contained in different recent vintages of mortgage-backed securities. In this exhibit, the 07-2 tranche references mortgage-backed securities issued during the first half of 2007, which contain subprime mortgages mainly originated in late 2006 and early 2007. The 07-1 tranche references subprime mortgage loans six months earlier, and so on. Note that the trajectory of the 07-2 vintage\u2014the most recent vintage\u2014is distinctly worse than for earlier vintages.\n\nThe more recent vintages are performing more poorly because the underlying mortgage loans for these vintages have less protection from prior home price appreciation and are the victim of a trend to greater laxness in underwriting standards.\n\nClearly, the delinquency rates for the recent vintages are going to keep rising and will ultimately be exceptionally high. The rise in delinquencies and foreclosures will be exacerbated by the downward trend in home prices and tightening of mortgage loan underwriting standards.\n\nThe upward trajectories in delinquency rates for subprime mortgages shown in Exhibit 1 have led to sharp price declines for the ABX indexes associated with the particular vintage and tranche of the basket of mortgage-backed securities. The ABX indexes represent the cost of buying protection against losses on the tranches of the basket of underlying mortgage backed-securities that they reference. A lower price means a higher cost for purchasing loss protection.\n\nAs shown in Exhibit 2, the prices for the BBB-rated ABX index tranches have declined sharply, with the most pronounced declines in the most recent vintages.\n\nAs expected losses on subprime mortgages have increased, investors have also become more worried about the safety of the more highly rated tranches that have a more senior claim on the cash flows generated by the underlying subprime mortgage loans. As shown in Exhibit 3, for the 07-1 vintage, there have been significant price declines even in the higher rated tranches.\n\nHowever, it is important to put this in context of the broader financial market. In particular, note that the adjustable subprime mortgage market is not that big in that context. Total outstanding adjustable-rate subprime mortgages are less than $1 trillion. Moreover, those mortgages originated during 2006 and early 2007 represent only a fraction of that total. Thus, even if subprime delinquency rates keep climbing to unprecedented levels, it seems likely that total losses will be roughly in a range of $100-200 billion. Although this is a lot of money, it pales next to the $58 trillion of net worth of U.S. households or the $16 trillion market capitalization of the U.S. equity market.\n\nTo put these losses in perspective, a 1 percent gain or loss in the U.S. stock market\u2014which often occurs on a daily basis\u2014is about the same order of magnitude of the likely subprime mortgage losses that will be gradually realized over the next few years.\n\nSo why have these losses\u2014which are the root cause of recent market problems\u2014led to so much market turbulence?\n\nIn my view, the losses in subprime mortgages had wide-ranging effects because these mortgages were embedded in a broad array of structured finance securities such as mortgage-backed securities and collateralized derivative obligations and often underpinned highly rated investment assets. As it became apparent that the subprime area was going to be a disaster, the securities that referenced these assets performed extremely poorly.\n\nThe poor investment performance of these securities made investors much less willing to invest in structured-finance products more generally. Investors lost confidence because highly rated securities that referenced subprime assets performed poorly and because investors found it difficult to value complex structured-finance products.\n\nThis loss of confidence triggered several broader developments:\n\nIn my view, the key development was the unanticipated pressure that was placed on bank balance sheets. This was generated from three major sources:\n\n1) Investor demand for securitized non-agency mortgage-backed securities has dried up. Banks originators now have to hold such loans in their bank portfolios.\n\n2) Bank backstop liquidity facilities have been triggered as investor appetite for asset-backed commerical paper has fallen sharply.\n\n3) The expectation that banks will have difficulty syndicating the bridge loans they provided to finance leveraged buy-outs.\n\nOf these three sources of pressure, the rollup of ABCP programs seems to have been the most important. The potential magnitude of the funding requirement is the largest and how much will come back onto bank balance sheets remains uncertain.\n\nSo let\u2019s take a look in more detail at these three areas of stress. Turning first to the mortgage area, the constraint on mortgage loan origination can be seen most visibly in the widening in the spread between fixed-rate prime jumbo mortgage loan and conforming mortgage loan rates. As can be seen in Exhibit 4, the spread widened from about 25 basis points to around 100 basis points before narrowing a bit over the past few weeks. The rate on such mortgage loans has had to rise to induce banks to free up balance sheet capacity to carry such mortgages on their books.\n\nTurning next to the asset-backed commercial paper area, the problem began when commercial paper investors became aware that their investments could be vulnerable to loss but were uncertain as to the extent of their exposure to particular programs.\n\nThis fear of loss among investors had a legitimate basis for those ABCP programs that finance mortgage-related assets without full bank credit enhancement. An inability to roll over maturing commercial paper in these programs could force the liquidation of the assets that the commercial paper funded. In the current market, that could lead to investor losses.\n\nThe problem started in extendable commercial paper market programs, where the credit enhancement backstop by banks was typically either absent or less than 100 percent. The problem then quickly migrated to structured investment vehicles (SIV) programs, which suffered from similar shortcomings.\n\nFrom there, the problem spread as risk-averse investors started to shun the entire asset class. Asset-backed commercial paper rates rose for those programs that were able to roll over their outstanding commercial paper. This is shown in Exhibit 5, which compares unsecured and secured commercial paper rates. The volume of outstanding asset-backed commercial paper shrank sharply as some issuers were unable to roll over their maturing paper. Exhibit 6 illustrates the downtrend in the volume of outstanding ABCP.\n\nThe pressure on the asset-backed commercial paper market was temporarily exacerbated by the behavior of money market mutual fund investors, who shifted funds from prime money market funds to Treasury-only money market funds (see Exhibit 7). Because the total assets in money market mutual funds are nearly four times the size of outstanding Treasury bills, these flows led to a large, albeit mostly transitory fall in Treasury bill yields. This is shown in Exhibit 8.\n\nThe good news is that the money flows into the prime money mutual funds have stabilized. This reflects greater discernment among investors about the risks associated with different types of asset-backed commercial paper and the widening yield differentials between prime and Treasury-only money market funds.\n\nMoreover, it is noteworthy that those areas of asset-backed commercial paper market with underlying structural problems\u2014primarily the extendible, SIV and \"SIV-lite\" portions of the market\u2014represent only a small proportion of total asset-backed commercial paper outstanding. For example, as shown in Exhibit 9, SIV programs only represented about 5 percent of the asset-backed commercial paper market in September, down from about 8 percent before the recent sharp contraction.\n\nMoreover, as shown in Exhibit 10, much of the asset-backed commercial paper market does not finance residential mortgage asset-backed securities, so there is less uncertainty about the underlying value of the assets. And, much of the market has solid credit support, with 100 percent bank credit enhancement.\n\nAs a result, as time has passed, investors have gradually been able to distinguish between the different types of ABCP programs. Stability has returned to the multiseller, bank-sponsored programs. As a result, the overall ABCP market is no longer contracting rapidly. However, the extendable and SIV programs continue to be under pressure.\n\nThe third source of balance sheet pressure stems from the sharp contraction in collateralized debt obligation (CDO) and collateralized loan obligation (CLO) issuance. As can be seen in Exhibit 11, CDO and CLO issuance volumes have plummeted in recent months.\n\nThe virtual closure of the CDO market, in turn, has led to a virtual cessation of high-yield debt issuance\u2014illustrated in Exhibit 12. This occurred because the CDO market was an important source of demand for high-yield debt. With investors shunning CDOs, the associated demand for high-yield debt by potential CDO issuers dried up.\n\nThese developments have created uncertainty for commercial and investment banks about their ability to syndicate the large volume of loan and debt commitments that they have made to finance private equity buyouts. These institutions are faced with the prospect that they may have to carry such loans on their books for an extended period of time at a discount to par value. Syndication will be more difficult because the ability to transform a large proportion of these obligations into marketable investment grade product through the alchemy of structured finance is not currently a readily available option.\n\nOver the past few weeks, banks have started to syndicate such loans. Typically, however, the loans offered for sale have been the more senior tranches and, even in these cases, the loans have been sold at a discount to par. Banks are making progress in reducing their exposures, but the pace has been slow.\n\nThis pressure on bank balance sheets\u2014both existing and anticipated\u2014has led to significant dysfunction in financial markets. In particular, primary dealers have pulled back in their willingness to finance the security positions of investment banks, hedge funds and other leveraged investors.\n\nAt the same time, this balance sheet pressure\u2014as well as worries about counterparty risk, have led to a significant rise in term borrowing rates. Banks that are sellers of funds have shifted to the overnight market to preserve their liquidity and this shift has starved the term market of funds, pushing those rates higher. As shown in Exhibit 13, the spread between one-month LIBOR and the one-month interest rate swap rate has widened sharply and one-month LIBOR has generally traded considerably above the anticipated level of the overnight federal funds rate. The same pressure on funding rates has been also evident in Europe. Exhibit 14 shows the same spread for the one-month Euribor rate.\n\nFor banks that had relied on term funding from the interbank market, the rise in term rates has pushed them into the overnight market. In addition, these depository institutions have turned to the Federal Home Bank Loan System as a source of term funding. For example, FHLB advances rose by $110 billion in August. In contrast, despite the 50 basis point reduction in the spread between the discount rate and the federal funds rate target, the dollar value of discount window borrowings never rose much and, in recent weeks has dropped back to negligible levels.\n\nThe use of FHLB advances rather than borrowing from the discount window reflects several factors: 1) the lower cost of FHLB advances, 2) the ability to borrow at longer terms from the FHLB and 3) the lack of stigma in using FHLB advances as a source of funding.\n\nSo where do we go from here? Clearly, the adjustment process is far from over. Asset-backed commercial paper programs are still being rolled up. Moreover, it remains unclear what proportion of leverage loan commitments commercial and investment banks will be able to syndicate and at what price. The pressure evident in bank term funding markets indicates that the pressure on bank balance sheets\u2014either real or anticipated\u2014has not yet abated much.\n\nThat said, the situation does appear to have improved. First, investors\u2019 ability to distinguish between \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d ABCP programs and structured finance products has improved considerably and I would expect this trend to continue as investors obtain better information.\n\nSecond, as time passes, the uncertainty about bank balance sheet pressures and funding requirements should lessen.\n\nThird, the market response to so-called headline risk has changed markedly in recent weeks. In particular, large financial organizations that have announced large mark-to-market losses have generally seen their stock prices go up rather than down.\n\nFourth, in the mortgage sector, depository institutions will undoubtedly\u2014at the right price\u2014take up some of the slack in the prime jumbo mortgage market.\n\nBut it undoubtedly will take time for circumstances to return to normal. And, the structured finance market will undoubtedly have to change a lot to return to close to a normal market function. Increased transparency and greater homogeneity will probably be required for investors\u2019 appetite to increase significantly for such products.\n\nOn the policy side, the Federal Reserve has responded to the market turbulence in two ways. First, steps were taken to supply liquidity to market participants and to ensure that market participants understood that such liquidity would be available if the situation worsened.\n\nOn August 10, open market operations conducted three repurchase operations adding reserves to the banking system. This proved sufficient to break the upward pressure evident in the federal funds market, which had caused the overnight federal funds rate to trade above the Federal Open Market Committee's specified target over the prior few days.\n\nOn August 17, the FOMC announced a change to its discount window regime. The gap between the discount rate and the target federal funds rate was lowered to 50 basis points from 100 basis points and borrowers were told that they could borrow for terms up to 30 days.\n\nAlthough this change did not lead to a big increase in borrowing, that was not unexpected. Even at a 50 basis point spread, the primary credit rate was higher than the rate on alternative sources of funds for most depository institutions. The so-called \u201cstigma\u201d from borrowing from the window exists, in part, because the borrowing occurs at a penalty rate.\n\nThat said, it would be wonderful if we could reduce the \u201cstigma\u201d so that it was inconsequential in the borrowing decision. One of our jobs is to act as the lender of last resort. The \u201cstigma\u201d against borrowing from the discount window can interfere somewhat with that.\n\nNevertheless, the change in the discount rate did appear to calm markets. It was a signal that the central bank stood willing to provide liquidity against collateral if markets were to take a turn for the worse.\n\nWe believe that the policy change had an impact, in part, because we witnessed\u2014concurrently\u2014a big increase in the amount of collateral pledged by banks at the window. This indicates that banks did view the window as an important liquidity backstop. Over the past few months, total collateral pledged has climbed by more than $150 billion.\n\nOur tentative conclusion is that the change in the discount window regime did appear to prove helpful by reducing the risks of a full-blown liquidity crisis.\n\nOn August 21, the securities lending fee was lowered to 50 basis points from 100 basis points. This is what we charge primary dealers to borrow Treasury securities from the System Open Market Account. The fee was lowered to encourage greater borrowing of Treasury securities from the Fed\u2019s portfolio in order to ease disruptions in the Treasury bill market. Securities lending did increase and this helped calm the Treasury bill market.\n\nFinally, on September 18, the FOMC lowered its effective federal funds rate target to 4.75 percent from 5.25 percent. The rate reduction was undertaken not because of market stress or turbulence per se, but because increased stringency in the credit markets threatened the U.S. growth outlook.\n\nTo quote from the minutes to the September 18 FOMC meeting:\n\n\"The disruptions to the market for nonconforming mortgages were likely to reduce further the demand for housing, and recent financial developments could well lead to a more general tightening of credit availability.\"\n\nAs far as what will happen from here, it is not for me to offer an opinion on such weighty matters.\n\nOn that score I offer up the last FOMC statement as a better guide. The concluding paragraph reads:\n\n\u201cDevelopments in financial markets since the Committee\u2019s last regular meeting have increased the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook. The Committee will continue to assess the effects of these and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.\u201d\n\nI would read that as meaning what it says. Interestingly, financial market participants are uncertain about what the FOMC will do next. As I write this, the November fed funds futures contract implies that market participants place about a one-out-of-three probability on a 25 basis points reduction in the federal funds rate target at the October 30-31 meeting. So the message is: Stay tuned.\n\nThank you."

    "content": "We are meeting at a time of relatively favorable U.S. economic performance, but also of growing concern about our relative position in the world and our longer-term economic prospects at home.\n\nOn a wide range of measures, the American economy and American business are performing well. We are in the fifth year of expansion in the United States and in the midst of the strongest global economic expansion in more than three decades. Corporate profits as a share of GDP are close to the highest level in four decades.\n\nCorporate balance sheets are healthy. The six-month trailing bond default rate has stayed near zero this year, and the delinquency rate on commercial and industrial loans at banks remains extremely low.\n\nWe have seen a substantial acceleration in trend productivity growth over the past decade. And although productivity gains have slowed recently, as they typically do as expansions mature, U.S. companies remain at the forefront of changes in science and technology\u2014and in the application of those innovations to business processes across a range of industries.\n\nOverall, the U.S. economy continues to display remarkable resilience and flexibility, despite a range of adverse shocks. This is a remarkably favorable picture; and yet there is growing concern about the long-term challenges for the U.S. economy and their implications for future prosperity.\n\nIn parts of the business community, there is growing anxiety about a perceived shift in the locus of dynamism and growth away from the United States toward Asia and other parts of the world.\n\nPublic opinion surveys report increased concern among Americans about economic security; about the prospects for future income growth and economic mobility; and about the implications of the long-term increase in income inequality.\n\nAnd there we can see growing concern among the general public and in the business community about the struggle to find a political consensus to support reforms to help us meet these challenges.\n\nThe United States has long been one of the most open of the major economies. This basic policy choice, along with a range of other actions that have made our economy relatively flexible, has allowed us to be a substantial beneficiary of the rapid increase in global economic integration and in the growing economic success of the rest of the world.\n\nGlobalization has brought challenges as well as benefits, however. The combined forces of technological change, immigration, and the rapid integration of China, India, and other economies into the world economy are altering the dynamics of competitive pressures on U.S. companies. The pace of change seems to be increasing, and more things we produce, and more of our services, are becoming tradable. And this seems to have fed anxiety, among firms and their employees, about the challenges in coping with these forces.\n\nThese changes have taken place in the context of a longer-term increase in income inequality in the United States. Incomes have grown more rapidly for the richer and better educated than for those at lower points of the income scale.\n\nThese changes have, in turn, contributed to some erosion in the strength of the political center in the United States on a range of economic policy issues. Surveys suggest diminished support for global trade. And there is more divisiveness on a range of issues such as tax policy and the appropriate role for government in the regulation of economic activity.\n\nOver the last half century and more, the U.S. economy has enjoyed some substantial and important relative advantages. Among the most important of these are the quality of our best universities; our openness to change; the incentives provided for innovation; the strength of property rights; the depth and liquidity of our world-class financial markets; and a record of stability in macroeconomic policy.\n\nThese relative strengths of the U.S. economy remain significant and substantial. But the rest of the world is getting better at establishing the important conditions for dynamism and innovation. These improvements are not a reflection of U.S. weakness, nor are they themselves a threat to U.S. competitiveness. We will benefit from more rapid growth in the rest of the world, but at the same time we need to be more attentive to addressing a range of challenges that could ultimately damage the prospect for future growth in living standards here at home.\n\nI want to talk about challenges we face in four areas:\n\nLet me start with openness.\n\nThe pressures that have come with globalization and technological change have led many to suggest that we should become less open as a country, that we should slow the pace of integration, or that we should provide greater insulation or protection from competition for selective parts of the U.S. economy.\n\nMoving in this direction would, I believe, be a fundamental mistake. More than ever before our fortunes are linked to those of the global economy. If anything, we need to become more open, not less; more open to trade in goods and services, but also to investment, to people and to ideas.\n\nGlobal integration is not the solution to all our problems, but acting to restrict it or to insulate us from its consequences would damage our capacity to grow and to adapt to change, and these costs would make it harder, not easier, to deal with our longer-term challenges. To the extent we are reluctant to remove restrictions or subsidies in the United States, we make it easier for the forces in other countries to block reforms from which we would benefit.\n\nThe world has a lot of experience with the costs and benefits of protection, and the balance of judgment on those questions has not significantly changed even with all the changes that technology and policy have brought to global trade. Economies that are more open have generally seen more rapid growth, both in incomes and in employment. Economies that are less open have generally grown less rapidly.\n\nOpenness itself, of course, is not enough.\n\nOur capacity to adapt to change depends in part on the effectiveness of government policy in a range of important areas. Education seems the most obvious of these, but policy in health care, in public infrastructure, and many other areas will also play an increasingly important role in determining the relative strength of the U.S. economy in this more integrated world.\n\nThe U.S. educational system combines the strengths of high completion rates for secondary education, a rich variety of post-secondary school educational options, and exceptionally strong elite universities, with the weaknesses of substantial unevenness in the quality of public education, and large disparities in the educational opportunities available to those of modest income and the relatively rich. By some estimates, students from families in the bottom half of the income distribution account for only 10 percent of all places in our elite universities.\n\nAn education system should be judged by how it serves the majority of the population, not just the performance of its best institutions. And as technological progress continues and global integration increases, our system will be judged by how good a job it does equipping a broader range of students with the skills commensurate with these challenges. In communities across the country, there are encouraging efforts at experimentation and reform. Progress is probably going to require more substantial public investments in education going forward.\n\nHealth care does not usually make the agenda of conferences on competitiveness, but we\u2019re seeing a welcome wave of attention in the business community to the broader economic imperative of health care reform. The U.S. system has compelling strengths in the quality of care and the choices available to much of the population. But our system is also remarkable for the magnitude of the costs, the incidence of those costs across the economy, the number of uninsured, and our poor performance on health outcomes even compared with less wealthy economies. To cite just one example, infant mortality rates in the United States are more than two times the level in Japan.\n\nIn a world in which economic performance depends increasingly on flexibility and adaptability to change, we probably need to move to a system in which a change in employer or profession does not carry the substantial uncertainty it does today about how one will provide for one\u2019s health and that of one\u2019s family. This seems fundamental to the willingness of Americans to support the level of openness to trade and to change that is an essential part of our present and our future.\n\nA defining feature of the American economy has been our embrace of the market, and the recognition that market forces are, in general, the most effective way of allocating resources. But markets cannot solve all problems, and government policy plays an important role in how well markets function. The test of policy is not just in the incentives we create for competition and innovation, but also in the clarity and stability offered by the regulatory framework and in the quality of public goods that governments deliver.\n\nAny one who travels outside the United States today returns with an appreciation about how rapidly public infrastructure is improving in many parts of the world, relative to what is evident in many parts of the United States.\n\nAs global markets become more integrated and companies and capital can move more freely across borders, policymakers will face new challenges in the design of regulations. They will have to look more carefully at the balance of benefits and costs, when companies have more choice about where to invest. They will have to find ways for regulations to evolve more quickly in response to developments in markets. They will have to explore ways to cooperate more closely with other governments, where national approaches alone cannot be effective.\n\nWe need to get used to a world in which we will see, in many areas, less willingness to adopt a U.S. model or to defer to a U.S. view on the appropriate global standard.\n\nYou can see some of these dynamics in the financial arena, and concern about the erosion in the relative position of the U.S. financial system.\n\nFinancial markets outside the United States are now deeper and more liquid than they used to be, making it easier for companies to raise capital domestically at reasonable cost. These financial markets are at an earlier stage in the process of capital market development, and they will therefore experience rapid growth in securitization and the role of derivatives.\n\nThese factors, more than other differences in tax, accounting, or legal regulatory regimes, account for the bulk of the declines' share of equity and debt raised in the United States by companies around the world. And this shift is something that we benefit from, not just in the direct sense that U.S. financial institutions play an important role in those markets, but in the broader sense that we will gain from the improvements in economic growth that come from financial market development around the world.\n\nBut in this context, we need to be more attentive to the risk that specific aspects of our system, regulations or other constraints, create a greater disincentive to locate a financial business here, or to invest here, or to raise capital here, than would have been the case five or ten years ago. We need to take a careful look at how we regulate financial activity in a world where capital is more mobile, and the structure of the financial system has diverged substantially from the system for which our regulatory framework was designed.\n\nThat does not mean we should contemplate weaker regulation or lower standards. The strength of the U.S. system is in part the result of the confidence we have developed in the integrity and resilience of our markets, in part by establishing strong standards for investor protection, market practices, and safety and soundness. Sustaining this confidence will be critical to the future strength of our financial system.\n\nTo complete this list of policy challenges that are important to U.S. competitiveness, let me conclude with a few brief points on the broader imperatives of macroeconomic policy.\n\nThe United States faces very substantial gaps between our fiscal resources and our expenditure commitments. The size of these gaps, these deficits, have been masked in recent years by a substantial, unanticipated and probably transitory surge in revenues, and by an unusually long period of unusually low long-term interest rates, in part the consequence of foreign official capital flows.\n\nBut these gaps remain substantial and the U.S. fiscal position is unsustainable. Time does not help. We are going to have to begin to develop a political consensus on the mix of policy changes that can bring our commitment and resources more into balance, if we are to preserve confidence in our market and our long-term economic prospects.\n\nOne of the most important roles for public policy is the maintenance of a stable macroeconomic framework that enables firms to make long-term investment decisions. In this sense, the fiscal policy choices ahead for this country will be critically important to the overall environment in which U.S. enterprises operate.\n\nThe business community will play an important role in shaping the policy response to these longer-term economic challenges. These reforms will have a long fuse. The benefits will be shared broadly, rather than captured specifically by particular sectors of the economy.\n\nAmerican companies have a strong collective interest in sustaining public support for global integration, improving the quality of public goods the government provides in education, health care and infrastructure, and in preserving confidence in U.S. fiscal sustainability.\n\nThank you."

    "date": "Jun 20, 2007",
    "speaker": "Unknown",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2007/gei070620",
    "content": "It is a pleasure to be here at the San Francisco Fed and to join you in looking back at the Asian financial crises. Many people in this room played critical roles in the drama of that time. We did not always completely agree, but we usually found a way to work together on a common strategy.\n\nThe crises hit with remarkable speed and force, with substantial effects on the world economy as a whole. The collapse in confidence led to substantial and sustained outflows of capital, forcing large exchange rate devaluations, a sharp fall in asset prices and leaving entire banking systems virtually insolvent. GDP fell by between 10 and 15 percent. The crises forced substantial changes in the IMF\u2019s instruments for crisis resolution and a major international effort to strengthen financial systems.\n\nEven after a decade, the crises are a subject of debate and controversy. For many, they represented a failure of financial globalization, a dramatic demonstration of the perils of openness to capital flows. A popular perception was that economies with strong records of growth and financial management were forced into positions of vulnerability by externally imposed programs of capital-account liberalization and then were pushed into turmoil by an unstable, even predatory international financial system. Adherents of this view tended to view the policy response to the crisis as harsh or inept or both.\n\nTime has taken some of the edge off these criticisms, but they still affect the political debate in the region today. They reflect anxieties about the balance of risks and benefits of economic and financial integration that still play an important role in shaping economic policy, even with the substantial progress achieved since the crises.\n\nI want to outline some of the principal lessons of that period, both in terms of reducing vulnerability to financial crisis and in terms of strategies for crisis resolution. I offer these with the knowledge that it is hard for anyone who was not a finance minister or a central bank governor in the region at the time to understand what it was like. As one of those involved in shaping the international response, I can say that there was a lot we did not fully appreciate about the dynamics of the crises then, and that justifies humility today in thinking about the lessons for the future.\n\nCurrency mismatches and balance sheet problems\nIn general, the crises were the consequence of fundamental economic problems, often manifested in the buildup of substantial balance sheet problems, with excessive short-term borrowing in foreign currency by the sovereign, the banking system, or both.\n\nIn Asia, the accumulation of short-term debt was concentrated in the banking system. Banks borrowed dollars and yen on a large scale and then lent those funds to corporations that earned their revenues in domestic currency. This created a mismatch between the currency denomisnation of the banks\u2019 liabilities and their assets. And this mismatch created an acute vulnerability to exchange rate risk.\n\nThe rapid increase in foreign currency exposure was encouraged by fixed exchange rate regimes, since these created the illusion of protection from exchange rate risk. It was encouraged by tax incentives that favored short-term foreign currency borrowing through offshore banking centers. It was fed by the selective liberalization of capital controls on foreign borrowing, while limitations on equity inflows were left in place. It was exacerbated by classic moral hazard\u2014the result of past government interventions to limit corporate and bank failures. And it was made worse by poor disclosure, which masked the scale of the increase in external liabilities and the deterioration in the level of official reserves.\n\nThe scale of the buildup of foreign currency debt was fundamental to the dynamics of the crises. Once confidence weakened, and fixed exchange rate commitments became unsustainable, the economies experienced a sharp reversal in capital flows as both residents and nonresidents sought to limit their exposure to domestic institutions and assets.\n\nThis broad flight from domestic assets created conditions similar to a classic bank run. The exchange rate decline magnified concern about potential losses in the corporate sector and banking system, which led to a further shift in assets out of the country, which exacerbated the exchange rate decline. These balance sheet vulnerabilities led to a vicious cycle in which the exchange rate and financial weaknesses reinforced each other.\n\nAs economies slipped toward the edge of the cliff, policymakers were left with alarmingly few options to try to contain the crisis and mitigate the damage inflicted on the real economy. Given that real interest rates were already negative, relaxing monetary policy further risked accentuating the exchange rate decline, which would, in turn, have exacerbated the problems of the banking system. But with demand already in free fall, policymakers were equally reluctant to tighten policy and risk further damage to growth.\n\nFiscal positions in Asia were far weaker than they initially appeared to be because of the enormous contingent liabilities that governments faced as a result of the collapse of the banking systems. This limited the room for countercyclical fiscal policy, although each government moved eventually to put in place modest fiscal stimulus.\n\nThis diagnosis of financial vulnerabilities led to a very substantial improvement in the quality of national balance sheets in the region. More on this later.\n\nExchange rate regimes and the perils of the middle\nA second, and closely related lesson, relates to the exchange rate regime. In the crisis countries, the exchange rate regime of choice had been a fixed but adjustable peg. This was softer than a currency board\u2014the possibility of adjustment was built into the arrangement, but it was presented as a commitment to a fixed nominal exchange rate for an indefinite period of time.\n\nAlthough these regimes of limited exchange rate flexibility had been regarded as a means of achieving economic stability, in fact they turned out to be a source of instability. Nominal exchange rates against the dollar had been held fixed for some time, while real effective exchange rates had appreciated significantly. Because of weaknesses in the financial system, the investment booms of the previous decade had not translated into increased productivity.\n\nAs investors grew concerned about potential weakness, pressure on the exchange rate further intensified until it became unsustainable. Exchange rate intervention proved ineffective. Once confidence had been shattered, the markets responded with brutal speed and force. Monetary authorities without a record of institutional independence and without a sufficiently clear mandate for price stability did not have the experience or credibility needed to restore confidence quickly.\n\nThe crises helped bring about a fundamental reassessment of the merits of fixed but adjustable exchange rate regimes, regimes that try to exist somewhere in the middle between the opposite extremes of irrevocably fixed and purely floating. The new consensus, which you can now see in policy choices across emerging markets, is that the soft middle is fundamentally untenable for an economy that is open to cross-border capital flows. With the limited exceptions of those cases where full monetary union or a currency board is optimal, or where a fixed exchange rate can provide a nominal anchor for a disinflation strategy, the general view now is that flexible exchange rate regimes make more sense for emerging market economies.\n\nExchange rate flexibility offers the advantage of allowing monetary policy to be directed at sustaining price stability, which in turn offers a better prospect of sustained growth. Changes in fundamental factors such as productivity growth and inevitable shocks to demand and supply require changes in relative prices, both domestically and internationally. A flexible exchange rate makes it easier for relative prices to move rapidly and effectively in the appropriate direction and so generally eases the cost of adjustment.\n\nRegional economic integration has increased rapidly in Asia in recent years, but these economies still seem a long way from the point where economic or political conditions would make a compelling case for some kind of regional monetary integration. (In Europe, of course, the political case for monetary integration largely preceded the economic argument.) For Asian economies, as for most emerging economies today, the principal challenge is to establish conditions that will enable them to prosper in a world where their exchange rates adjust more freely to changing fundamentals.\n\nCapital-account liberalization\nA third important conclusion from the crises relates to strategies for capital-account liberalization. Although this was not the conventional wisdom at the time, I think the evidence supports the view that the policy mistakes that contributed to the crises lay not in the decision to become more open to capital flows, but in the how those governments chose to become more open.\n\nThe supervisory and regulatory regimes over the financial system did not provide a strong enough framework of incentives for risk management and controls over financial intermediaries. But the more consequential mistake was that the crisis economies each in different ways chose to liberalize capital controls selectively. Each had in place other incentives or distortions that led to an excessive reliance on short-term borrowing through the banking system.\n\nThese weaknesses left the financial system and the economies as a whole with less capacity to manage the greater pressures and risks that came with openness to capital flows.\n\nThe policy consensus that has emerged from this experience has a more cautious view of the benefits of financial integration, a greater awareness of the damage caused by creating incentives that distort the composition of flows and a greater appreciation of the importance of having in place a strong set of institutions, in the financial system in particular. It has also fostered a greater skepticism within governments of their ability to sustain and adjust a set of limited controls on capital flows, once an economy has passed a certain point of relative openness. Money tends to move around these controls with progressive ease, and it becomes more difficult over time to counteract this force with acceptable costs to other objectives. For this basic reason, many emerging market governments that were early proponents of selective controls have moved to eliminate them.\n\nFaced with the challenges of managing policy in an increasingly integrated world economy, the dominant instinct of officials is often to try to shield the economy from volatility. But the crises of the 1990s helped demonstrate why this approach can be both futile and counterproductive. As economies become more open to capital flows, policies designed to insulate an economy from external shocks, whether they be fixed exchange rate regimes or selective capital controls and restrictions on international transactions, rarely offer durable stability, and they bring additional risks. These risks come in the form of additional distortions that might undermine future growth or magnify vulnerability to future financial volatility.\n\nThe more promising approach is to invest in the complement of institutions and policies that enable an economy to live more comfortably with openness. Focusing on those measures that will enable an economy to be more flexible and to adapt more quickly to change ultimately will be a more effective policy strategy. It is politically more difficult, but economically more effective than those solutions that seem to offer protection from competition and volatility.\n\nCrisis resolution\nA fourth lesson, or series of lessons, comes from our experience in crisis resolution. The strategies adopted to stabilize markets and then to foster recovery varied significantly across the crisis economies. Each involved a somewhat different mix of policy reforms and temporary financial assistance, tailored to the different conditions that prevailed.\n\nWhere there was success, the common feature was what Larry Summers called the Powell Doctrine applied to international finance\u2014the overwhelming use of force, with a clear strategy for resolution. The \u201cforce\u201d in this sense applied both to the scale of financing made available relative to the need and to the quality of the policy measures.\n\nVery substantial resources were deployed in support of the recovery efforts, and a large share of the resources was made available upfront, in order to try to mitigate the liquidity problem and to stem the loss of confidence. In contrast to the typical IMF program, governments were permitted to use a portion of the IMF-supplied resources to take some pressure off the exchange rate, as foreign investors sought to reduce their exposures to the crisis countries in the initial stages of the crises.\n\nBut the provision of large external financial resources was not, by itself, sufficient to achieve stability. The critical feature of every program was a set of policy measures designed to address the causes of the crisis, to stabilize confidence and to put in place conditions for recovery.\n\nIn some cases, the initial policy response looked tentative or inadequate. In others, the reform program did not appear to have broad support within the government. Broader political uncertainty associated with a pending election or change in leadership also undermined confidence in the commitment to a credible recovery plan. Where confidence in the recovery plan was weak, the financial resources had little impact on market sentiment and confidence faltered. Even though the resources looked large relative to past financial interventions, they were easily overwhelmed when markets were unimpressed by the policy response.\n\nErnesto Zedillo explained the policy challenge exceptionally well when he wrote that since markets tend to overreact at the onset of crisis, so policy needs to overreact too.\n\nA classic problem in financial crises is to distinguish between problems of illiquidity and insolvency. This diagnosis is critical to the design of an effective response, but it is very hard to do. We\u2014in this case I mean the IMF, its major creditors and the governments in the region\u2014treated these cases as closer to the illiquidity extreme on the continuum, rather than to the insolvency extreme.\n\nIn the Asian crisis countries, unlike in Russia or Argentina, there was no plausible case for arguing that the sovereign governments had accumulated debts they were unable to repay. A forced restructuring of the external debt of a country or a forced suspension of payments on those obligations would have made the crisis in Asia, and more broadly, substantially worse.\n\nThese were not conditions of insolvency, but nor were they purely temporary liquidity problems that could have been addressed through the quick infusion of unconditional finance without any change in policies. The crisis economies all tried that strategy in the weeks and in some cases months before going to the IMF for assistance. Those strategies failed not simply because the governments ran out of reserves, but because they had failed to embrace a broader set of policy changes powerful enough to restore confidence in future stability and growth.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that the strategies ultimately adopted in each case were quite unorthodox and were certainly not uniform. Besides the novel approach adopted in terms of the scale and structure of financing and the degree of international cooperation in support of the programs, the policy packages were also notable in the degree of emphasis placed on, for example, financial-sector reform and improvements to disclosure.\n\nIn each case, the reforms proposed were the result of careful analysis of the causes of the individual crises and a pragmatic assessment of what was needed to correct the conditions that had led to problems and to restore confidence. And in all cases, the strategy was continually modified and adjusted as conditions changed and as the principals responsible developed a better feel for what was working and what was not.\n\nConclusion\nRecovery in the Asian crisis countries took time, but it was stronger and more rapid than had been typical in other emerging market financial crises. Barely 18 months after the crisis, for example, Korean GDP had returned to pre-crisis levels, and this was true for all the Asian crisis countries by 2003. Growth has been relatively strong and stable since, though at a pace somewhat below the unsustainable rates of the decade prior to the crises.\n\nThe countries directly affected by the crises a decade ago are fundamentally stronger. The balance sheet weaknesses have been transformed into strength. Financial-sector reforms have been undertaken on a generally impressive scale. Stronger legal and institutional frameworks have helped create an environment in which enterprise is thriving. Macroeconomic policy has been reasonably prudent, and debt-to-GDP ratios are declining. Exchange rate regimes have become more flexible.\n\nThese changes have made these economies far more resilient than they were a decade ago. They are much less likely to face the type of crisis, the acute, self-reinforcing panic produced by the balance sheet problems of that era.\n\nIs there more to be done? Of course, but the challenge now is not so much the challenge of building stronger defenses against crisis, but rather the longer-term challenge of building a greater capacity to adapt to change in this increasingly integrated and rapidly evolving global economy.\n\nThank you."

    "content": "Good evening. I am pleased to be able to join you tonight. The past decade has been one of remarkable achievement in Asia. This is a testament to the resilience and dynamism of this region, and yet the memories of the financial crises remain vivid and still exert a powerful influence on policy today. Tonight, I want to reflect on what policymakers learned from the crises, to review the extent of the progress since and to examine some of the challenges ahead.\n\nThe Asian financial crises of the late 1990s were exceptional in many respects. Described at the time by some as the first crises of the 21st century, they were commonly regarded as without precedent and fundamentally different from previous emerging market financial crises. Here were countries with a remarkable record of rapid economic growth over several decades, substantial rates of investment, with low inflation and relatively strong fiscal positions. Most conventional indicators of economic performance and financial strength did not suggest acute underlying vulnerability.\n\nYet the crises erupted with remarkable speed and force. The sudden collapse of confidence led to a sharp reversal of capital flows to the region. On the eve of the crises, net capital inflows to the Asian crisis countries were equal to almost 6 percent of their GDP. Over the next two years, the flow of capital more than fully reversed. Income and output contracted abruptly: in the worst affected countries, GDP shrank by more than 10 percentage points from peak to trough and in one case, the contraction was closer to 15 percent. By any standards, these financial crises were unusually severe. The crises marked a sudden and dramatic break with the past, and brought a new sense of vulnerability to economies perceived as strong and successful.\n\nYet though some of the characteristics of the Asian crises distinguished them from other episodes of financial turmoil, they shared several important features in common with crises in countries with modern, market-oriented financial systems. They were largely unanticipated. A rise in borrowing created vulnerability to a shift in asset prices. Uncertainty about the scale and nature of the underlying vulnerability magnified the problem. Contagion spread rapidly. Markets overshot.\n\nThe fundamental economic and financial weaknesses that were the source of vulnerability were the consequence of the interaction between weak domestic financial systems, selective liberalization of controls on capital flows and fixed exchange rate regimes.\n\nBanking systems combined relatively weak supervision with broad government guarantees, some explicit, but more commonly implicit, reflecting a tradition of public sector intervention to protect troubled companies and banks from failure. Tax and regulatory incentives promoted short-term borrowing in foreign currency through the banking system. Capital inflows, largely through the banking system, helped finance a boom in investment and real estate. Distortions in the financial system led to a misallocation of resources so that high rates of private investment did not generate substantial improvements in productivity. Exchange rate regimes where the domestic currency was fixed to the dollar generated false expectations of stability, and the resulting increase in unhedged borrowing generated large exposures to changes in the exchange rate or interest rates.\n\nBy 1997, the short-term external debt of the private sector had risen substantially, relative to GDP and to reserves, and this created conditions similar to a classic bank run, when the crises hit.\n\nThe initial spark for the loss of confidence is still not fully clear, as is often the case in financial crises. And although the particular dynamics differed across the countries in the region, the basic pattern was common, with a rapid and sustained effort by domestic and foreign investors to reduce their exposure to further losses. The initial effects of this behavior made the exchange rate commitments untenable, and when those commitments were broken and currencies fell, the panic became self-reinforcing.\n\nUncertainty and lack of information fed the run. Market participants were unable to judge whether deteriorating developments reflected temporary liquidity problems or deeper solvency issues. They reacted by assuming the worst. These shifts in market sentiment risked becoming self-validating, with liquidity problems transformed into solvency problems with broader risk of default.\n\nThe capacity of policymakers to restore stability was constrained by the depth of the balance sheet problems. In some cases, where the scale of external borrowing was less acute, policymakers had more room to act. But in most cases, policy options were very limited. Initially, governments were reluctant to let exchange rates move too far, because of fears that this would force banks and companies that had borrowed in dollars or yen into default on a scale that could further damage growth. At the same time, the authorities were reluctant to tighten monetary policy as a way to help stabilize the exchange rate because of concern it would hurt growth and perhaps exacerbate the flight from domestic assets.\n\nThis dilemma made the initial policy response in the crisis countries look halting and tentative. And, uncertainty about the strength and continuity of political leadership further hampered government efforts to recover credibility. In the countries hit hardest by the crisis, looming issues of succession and elections compounded the problem of confidence.\n\nThe crises prompted a searching reassessment of the conventional economic wisdom and a new appreciation of the challenges that come with financial integration. The classic measures of macroeconomic stability and policy prudence, in fiscal positions and measured inflation rates, could mask substantial structural weaknesses, and these same structural weaknesses could ultimately undermine the achievements of otherwise reasonably conservative macroeconomic policy management. Partial capital account liberalization, which encouraged the accumulation of short-term debt obligations, brought substantial risk, magnifying weaknesses in domestic financial systems. Exchange rate commitments provided less stability than had been assumed. The rise in capital mobility increased exposure to shifts in sentiment. Markets could now adjust much faster than policy could typically react.\n\nThese judgments precipitated major changes in policies and a sustained investment in improvements to the institutional framework of domestic financial systems across the region. And these changes in turn laid the foundation for recovery and for the very substantial improvements in economic and financial strength now evident across the region.\n\nAchievements since the crises\nAlthough it took some time for policy to begin to restore confidence, recovery was stronger and more rapid than had been typical in other emerging market financial crises. Barely 18 months after the crisis, for example, Korean GDP had returned to pre-crisis levels, and this was true for all the Asian crisis countries by 2003. Growth has been relatively strong and stable since, though at a pace somewhat below the unsustainable rates of the decade prior to the crises.\n\nThe balance sheets of the region have been transformed from weakness into strength. Current account balances are generally in surplus. External debt of the banking and corporate sector has fallen. Banking systems are now much less exposed to liabilities in foreign currencies; and the currency mismatches that made economies so vulnerable as the crises erupted have been greatly reduced. Official reserves have risen to levels without precedent in modern financial history.\n\nFiscal positions have strengthened. After rising initially with the substantial costs associated with bank recapitalization programs, in recent years public debt ratios have generally been declining as a share of GDP.\n\nMonetary policy regimes have become more mature, with some progress toward greater de facto independence for central banks, with clearer mandates for price stability.\n\nExchange rate regimes in the crisis countries have become somewhat more flexible, providing greater scope for monetary policy to sustain the domestic conditions for price stability.\n\nFinancial systems are substantially stronger. Bank capital ratios now provide a significantly larger cushion against potential losses\u2014though capital ratios in Asian banking sectors are still generally lower than those in other emerging economies. The quality of bank assets has improved. Non-performing loans, estimated to have peaked at between one-quarter and three-quarters of total loans in the crisis countries, are now under 10 percent of total loans. Financial institutions that required government intervention have largely been restored to private ownership. Domestic capital markets are an increasingly important channel of intermediation in financial systems that had historically been dominated by banks.\n\nThese are impressive achievements by any measure. And the changes that have taken place provide a strong foundation for future growth and they make it much less likely that these economies will be vulnerable to the type of crises of a decade ago. This progress is reflected in a broad range of financial market indicators of risk. Risk premia in domestic interest rates markets are low. Spreads on remaining dollar-denominated debt have fallen to levels that reflect little concern about future financial stress.\n\nIt is important to bear in mind that some of the most dramatic changes in the performance of Asian and other emerging market economies have taken place in an unusually benign economic environment. The past four years have marked the strongest sustained period of growth for several decades. Global interest rates have been relatively low. Asset prices in many markets have been rising for a sustained period of time. Volatility in equity, interest rate and foreign exchange markets has fallen to unusually low levels, and although we\u2019ve seen the occasional sharp correction in some markets, recovery has typically been quick.\n\nThese favorable conditions make everything look somewhat better than it otherwise would. But the improvements in Asia are real, and they will make the region more resilient in the face of future challenges.\n\nThe challenges ahead\nEven with the relative prosperity of the recent past, policy in much of the region reflects substantial ambivalence about the risks that come with financial openness. The memory of the trauma of the crisis explains much of this ambivalence. The difficulties in managing this more recent period of substantial capital inflows provides an additional source of unease. Policy regimes across the region are to a significant degree directed at providing some insulation for the domestic economy from what is considered a volatile global financial environment.\n\nThis impulse reflects itself in many different ways. It is manifested in exchange rate regimes that still permit relatively limited variability against the dollar. It is manifested in the extent of reserve accumulation, in part the consequence of resistance to exchange rate appreciation. And it is manifested in the remaining controls on capital movements and the occasional experimentation with the introduction of new controls.\n\nThe search for durable insurance against future volatility is an understandable response to the searing experience of the crises of a decade ago. But there is risk in this as well. And the incomplete embrace of integration could contain the seeds of future vulnerability.\n\nIn this sense, the policy agenda needs to move from a focus on creating stronger defenses against crisis to building a greater ability to adapt to change. This requires strong institutions for the management of macroeconomic policy so that the monetary and fiscal policies are able to respond to shocks in a credible manner. It requires strong financial institutions with a substantial capacity to absorb losses and cope with volatility. It requires regulatory policies that encourage competition and innovation, with strong protections for property rights, low barriers to entry and effective financial supervision. And it requires investments in a nation\u2019s human capital, in education, healthcare and pension provision. This complement of policies improves the prospects for producing the mix of flexibility and resilience necessary for sustained growth in a more integrated world economy.\n\nIn emerging Asia, two key areas where there is the need and opportunity for further progress are in the financial system and in the monetary policy framework.\n\nThe financial sector plays an important role in the flexibility and adaptability of economies to change, in the resilience of economies and in the capacity of the monetary authorities to respond to adverse shocks to asset prices or demand. Although much has been achieved in Asia over the past decade, as the damage inflicted by the crises has been repaired, further reform will be important to the capacity of these economies to innovate and grow and to live more comfortably with openness to capital flows.\n\nThis requires stronger banks and more developed capital markets. Thus far, we have seen more progress on the former than the latter, but both are important and there remains considerable scope for broadening and deepening capital markets in emerging Asia. The extent of financial innovation in the industrial economies makes it possible for Asian countries to take advantage of huge improvements in the efficiency of financial intermediation. Embrace of these reforms will help ensure that high levels of domestic savings are deployed more efficiently, that companies and financial institutions are able to manage risks more effectively and that the financial system is more resilient in the face of future stress.\n\nMonetary policy regimes in much of Asia are burdened by two different types of constraints on independence. The first relates to the institutional relationship between the central bank and the government and the second to the multiple objectives assigned to the central banks.\n\nAll the evidence points to improved long-term inflation performance when monetary policymakers are freed from institutional constraints that hamper their freedom of maneuver and given full operational independence. Such independence is best achieved by enshrining it in an institutional framework that provides for legal independence from the government, with accountability for achieving a clearly defined mandate focused on price stability. Few Asian central banks yet enjoy full legal independence, though most now have greater de facto independence than they once had.\n\nFixed, or partially fixed exchange rate regimes, of course, also constrain the independence of monetary policy. As capital accounts become progressively more open, few countries can sustain over time a commitment to exchange rate stability without risking price stability. Eventually central banks will run up against limits on their capacity to sterilize the effects of exchange market intervention designed to limit the pace and extent of appreciation of the exchange rate. Although measured inflation in emerging Asian economies remains relatively low, the pace of credit growth and the behavior of asset prices provide some evidence of a growing tension among competing objectives. The longer this policy conflict persists, the greater the distortions building up in the economy, the greater the risk of future inflation and the greater the risk of a bumpy future.\n\nReserves in emerging Asia recently passed the $2.5 trillion mark, double their size at the end of 2003. Given the levels that have been reached in many countries, it may no longer be appropriate to view rising reserves as a source of increasing strength against future volatility. They are, increasingly, signs of the allocative distortions that result from the exchange rate regime. And they are in a sense too much of a good thing.\n\nConclusion\nThe economic and financial transformation of the crisis economies has been extraordinary. The policy reforms adopted in the wake of the crises have made those economies less vulnerable and more resilient. And these changes justify substantial confidence about Asia\u2019s economic future.\n\nAsia\u2019s success fundamentally changes the international economic and financial system. It is no longer tenable to view the world as divided between a dominant core of mature industrial economies and a smaller periphery of emerging economies. Asia is now so closely integrated with the rest of the world, so large in relative terms, and growing so rapidly that the policy choices made in this region will have a much greater impact on the rest of the world. And it means that Asia will need to prepare for a future in which it relies more on the strength of growth at home rather than on the strength of growth in the rest of the world.\n\nAs Asia makes further progress in financial reform and toward more flexible exchange rate regimes, it will be in a better position both to deal with the inevitable challenges that come with economic and financial integration, and to make the necessary transition to stronger domestic demand led-growth, which will prove a more sustainable foundation for future improvements in living standards.\n\nThank you."

    "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you, Yusuke, for your very kind introduction. It is a pleasure to be here among so many friends, and to have this opportunity to share with you some thoughts on the progress that has been made in the emerging markets, and the potential issues that may lie ahead.\n\nAs Yusuke noted, much of my professional career has been devoted to dealing with financial vulnerability and volatility in the emerging world.\n\nAnd certainly, over the years, and into the start of this decade, there has been no shortage of excitement. Crises such as 1980s debt crisis, the 1994 tequila crisis, the Asia crisis and the Russian default each had important global implications, and demanded the attention of policymakers worldwide.\n\nBut when we speak of the emerging markets today, it seems, in a sense, that the world has been turned on its head. The emerging market economies\u2014which for so long were seen as a seemingly endless source of instability, fragility and chronic shortages of capital\u2014are now an important part of global resilience.\n\nThe emerging world has become an important source for the global supply of goods and services, and of savings, and, at the margins, an important influence on the price of both.\n\nThrough a combination of better policies, better economic performance, and in some cases, just better luck, the emerging world appears considerably less likely to be an independent source of volatility for the global financial system during the years immediately ahead, and perhaps for considerably longer.\n\nHow that happened is familiar, but it is no less remarkable for that reason.\n\nTo be sure, the progress I've just described has occurred in the midst of an extraordinarily supportive global environment, on both the real and the financial sides. And the outlook, it seems, is for more of the same. According to the IMF, global GDP growth should continue to be strong in both 2007 and 2008. If that's right, the strongest four-year run in decades will soon enough become the strongest six-year run since they began keeping the books.\n\nVolatility has been remarkably low across a broad range of markets\u2014debt, equities, currencies\u2014and, across the board, ample flows are continuing, if not accelerating. True, we saw a brief flurry of excitement in EM financial markets earlier in the year. But you would need a magnifying glass to see it against the broader pattern of historical volatility. And since then, EM equity markets have reached news highs, while EM debt spreads have breached already historic lows. In the process, the markets seem to have been hearing every potentially discordant note as sweetly harmonious.\n\nSo, in a world in which almost every risk looks worth taking, almost every investment appears worthy, almost every country worth betting on, what should we be looking at for clues as to the shape of things to come?\n\nLet me offer a few thoughts, in no particular order, on developments that might be worth thinking about.\n\nThe first has to do with local political and policy risks. Yes, it is remarkable how much has been accomplished with regard to macro policy in recent years, and how relatively disciplined countries have been in the absence of strong market constraints. And yes, vulnerability has been reduced. But that does not automatically translate into the underpinnings for growth.\n\nProgress on the micro side has been far more modest. In many countries, complex, politically contentious structural reforms are needed to consolidate progress and improve prospects for sustained growth. Unmet structural challenges are holding potential growth in check, limiting job growth and real incomes, leaving countries vulnerable to the global commodity cycle\u2014and to erosion of domestic political support. Without a broader distribution of the benefits of reform\u2014and by that I mean better growth in employment prospects and real incomes, less inequality, better institutions, better public services\u2014stability in a number of countries is by no means assured. We have already seen the specter of populism emerge in one region and, while that threat appears to have diminished at the margin, it would be foolish to assume it\u2019s been banished forever.\n\nThe second goes to the broader context. It hardly seems to do justice to current market conditions to describe them as \"benign\". Years of strong global growth, low and stable inflation, and low and stable long-term interest rates have combined to create an environment in which almost every risk does look worth taking. All credit spreads are narrow, fueling everything from private equity to the housing market to emerging market funds to EM and global economic activity.\n\nAnd in this environment of generalized enthusiasm, emerging market spreads have emerged as the narrowest of the narrow, with prices on most EM assets trading through comparably rated corporates.\n\nNow, a case can be made that global credit spreads should be low. As we all know, financial innovation has allowed risk to be sliced, diced and traded as never before, both spreading risk and, at least theoretically, shifting it to those better positioned to bear it. But we also know that low interest rates, low volatility, and the seeming ability to trade out of any risk create obvious incentives to build up leverage, often in ways that are not readily transparent. Leverage contributes to very tight pricing in good times. But it also introduces the scope for large and sudden reversals when the cycle turns. And unfortunately, leverage is something that we often measure least well where it counts the most.\n\nNot many of the intermediaries I talk with believe risk is fairly priced today. In the tradeoff between business risk and financial risk, the balance remains tilted in the direction of financial risk, as firms find it hard to sacrifice predictable benefits in the face of unpredictable risks.\n\nTo state the matter more generally, the recent long period of stability may contain the seeds of its own undoing. To quote an old friend: \u201cLong trends are inherently dangerous. They make people forget what different environments look like, and encourage people to incorporate into their thinking only data from recent history\u201d. This makes reversals all the more sudden, surprising and powerful. And in this connection, we haven't lived through a full credit cycle with the complex structured credit products that currently dominate the landscape.\n\nThird, there does seem to be a bit of a disconnect, at present, between global economic and financial performance on the one hand, and the geopolitical context on the other. The relative calm that has characterized the global economy is all the more remarkable when you think about some of the things that have occurred or are currently unfolding, including\u2014the unsettled security situation across the Middle East, heightened tensions over nuclear proliferation, the re-emergence of political risk in some countries in Latin America, the coup in Thailand, violent protests in Hungary, unrest in the CE-3, the assassination of a reformer in Russia, disputes between Russia and its neighbors over energy, the failure to make progress on the trade front, the visible rise of protectionist sentiment and so on.\n\nFourth. While use of derivative structures has massively lowered the barriers to entry and helped to make massive amounts of capital available to countries that might not otherwise have had access, it is worth noting that this is also likely to be the case about barriers to exit.\n\nFifth. Linkages. The financial markets are much more tied together today than in the past by webs of debt, derivatives and structured products. These relationships are fantastically complicated, and as yet untested in any meaningful way.\n\nAnd it is worth noting that the incentive structures today are quite different than those that once motivated collective action in times of stress. Said another way, it is not at all clear today, in the event of distress, who will \u201cown the problem\u201d. It is now easier to price and insure against risk, although it is only in retrospect that investors will know whether they have purchased as much insurance as they thought.\n\nA related point: If there has been one theme that has dominated in recent years, it has been liquidity. Markets today are awash with liquidity, and the emerging world is enjoying record gross inflows. Abundant global liquidity has been a powerful wind at the back of economic and policy progress and has brought substantial benefits. But it is also bringing with it new pressures\u2014on exchange regimes, on institutional frameworks, on asset prices and on policy makers. And it is introducing the potential for distortions. Witness what occurred early this year in one country in the Far East. In addition, as we all know, liquidity is ephemeral\u2014it disappears at the most inconvenient times.\n\nSixth, there have been a number of changes in the pattern of capital flows to and from the emerging world that are potentially altering the landscape in important ways and thus worth thinking about.\n\nOne is the predominance of private-to-private flows, from private investors and lenders to private sector targets, involving a myriad of instruments\u2014FDI, equities, bonds, loans and local securities, and increasingly, derivatives. This pattern contrasts with the former world of private-to-public flows, where claims on EM public sector borrowers accounted for the bulk of the capital inflows, and problems dealing with those debts were the key source of stress.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, these days, in most countries, public external debt is declining or being held level in nominal terms, and shrinking quickly as a share of GDP. On the other hand, private sector indebtedness is on the rise, and will likely account for the bulk of future increases in international debt issuance. Indeed, corporate bond issuance has risen more than four-fold since 2001, and growth in syndicated loans to EM corporates has been even stronger.\n\nIn an environment of largely private-to-private linkages, the macro and fiscal backdrop remain essential\u2014this was certainly a lesson of the Asia crisis. However, the connections between that backdrop and credit performance on individual loans become less direct. And with potential weaknesses in private sector balance sheets a source of risk, the strength of the local legal and institutional structure becomes more central to how effectively and efficiently distress can be managed.\n\nAnd as I mentioned earlier, much remains to be done to strengthen local financial institutions, credit cultures, the legal framework for enforcing contracts and corporate governance.\n\nIn addition, in an environment of private-to-private linkages, getting a big-picture view of how balance sheets in the private sector are evolving, and of the sources and uses of funds, is often easier said than done. There is room for bodies such as the IIF to work with emerging market authorities to identify ways to strengthen the information architecture, thereby promoting better credit decisions by investors and creditors, foreign and domestic alike.\n\nAnother trend with potentially important implications is the growing internationalization of local debt markets. Foreign interest in the EM domestic debt markets has been spurred by low interest rates in the advanced world and perceptions of improved risk profiles in many potential recipient countries. To date, these flows have gone mostly to public debt securities. Growth of derivative exposures has also been significant and, in some cases, exceed outright holdings. Let me simply say this could be a source of unusual price action in future stress. People who are relying on conformance of credit derivatives and the underlying credit are likely to be surprised and disappointed.\n\nIncreased local market investing has brought with it important benefits for EM economies, often enabling borrowers to reduce FX exposures, and to issue at more attractive yields and longer maturities. But experience with foreign investment in local debt securities have not always been happy\u2014think Mexico 1994, or Russia 1998. Large inflows into local securities markets can sustain or even fuel large current account deficits, even when net public borrowing is modest. And since local debt markets in many countries are still quite small, foreign investors can be \"big fish in a small pond,\" swelling liquidity when they swim in, and draining it when they swim away.\n\nFinally, the traditional framework for thinking about potential stress needs to be broadened, away from its current focus on difficulties in countries making payments to advanced economy creditors. The emerging world is becoming an important exporter of capital. To date, the bulk of these outflows have gone to foreign exchange reserves and been managed by official sectors, largely in a cautious fashion.\n\nBut the growing interest in earning better returns on reserve assets may signal reduced caution going forward. Moreover, the private sector is increasingly playing a larger role in the recycling of external surpluses in the emerging world. As a result, capital flows from the emerging world could play an important new role in how future episodes of stress in the global financial system originate and are transmitted. Indeed, the ongoing debate as to whether the eventual unwinding of global imbalances will proceed in orderly or disruptive manner centers on precisely the stability of those flows. And for all the fuss about hedge funds, let me just observe that assets under management by sovereign wealth funds are about twice those in hedge funds\u2014and growing\u2014and less transparent.\n\nIn this connection, I mentioned stronger external liquidity positions as among the fundamental improvements that have left EM countries less crisis prone. However, reserve stockpiles in a number of countries now have moved well beyond plausible self-insurance needs, and reserves continue to be purchased to resist local currency appreciation. For these countries, further reserve purchases may be less a sign of strength than of the need for more progress in building domestic demand as a source of growth and in completing the transition to a modern monetary regime. Such progress, in turn, would help ensure that global current account adjustment takes place in gradual and orderly manner.\n\nAll of the developments that I have discussed\u2014the broad environment, the rise of private to private flows, the growth of local currency investment, and the evolving role of the emerging economies as a source of capital\u2014have many positive aspects to them. And many of the structural changes that I have referred to will take years to fully present themselves.\n\nAs these changes take place, they will also introduce new complexities and new linkages, and thus new potential pathways for risk. And they will introduce new challenges for monitoring and assessment that go well beyond the traditional architecture of country risk assessment. The challenge for risk managers, which in a broad sense includes all of us, is to try to anticipate what the future may bring, not just to avoid the mistakes of the past.\n\nLet me close by sharing with you a saying that I am particularly fond of and that I think is worth keeping in mind: \u201cWhen what is important changes, and the way you look at it doesn\u2019t, you are going to be surprised\u2026and the likelihood is that it won\u2019t be a happy surprise.\u201d"

Although this is a conference primarily about credit derivatives, I am going to talk about some of the broader changes we are seeing in financial and credit markets, and their implications for policy.\n\nYou are meeting during a period of remarkable change and exceptional conditions in financial markets.\n\nFinancial markets over the past several years have been characterized by an unusual constellation of low forward interest rates, ample liquidity, low risk premia and low expectations of future volatility. In some markets, asset prices have risen substantially, and credit growth has expanded rapidly. In credit markets more generally, spreads have declined to levels that reflect very low expectations of near term losses and credit standards have weakened.\n\nIt would not be accurate to say this is a world without volatility, for we have had a series of episodes of sharp declines in asset prices and increases in volatility. But these episodes have been contained and short lived, with markets recovering relatively quickly and with little appreciable effect on global economic activity.\n\nThese conditions are global in nature, though they take somewhat different forms in different markets. The forces behind all this are complex and not well understood, and this complicates any judgment of how enduring they will prove to be.\n\nThe main candidates in terms of fundamental explanations involve change in economic conditions and in the structure of financial markets.\n\nThere has been a marked improvement in global economic performance, with strong growth, relatively low inflation, and less volatility in both growth and inflation. This seems to have reduced concern about future fundamental risk, in terms of the potential damage of future shocks and in the ability of governments and central banks to both avoid the policy errors of the past and to competently manage some daunting longer\u2013term policy challenges.\n\nThe global trend toward independent central banks with clearer mandates for price stability has contributed to this confidence, as has the improvement in national balance sheets in emerging markets, with stronger fiscal positions, higher reserves, and less exposure to foreign\u2013currency denominated debt.\n\nChanges in financial markets, including those that are the subject of your conference, have improved the efficiency of financial intermediation and improved our confidence in the ability of markets to absorb stress. In financial systems around the world, the capital positions of banks have improved and capital markets are becoming deeper and playing a larger role in financial intermediation. Financial innovation has improved the capacity to measure and manage risk. Risk is spread more broadly across countries and institutions.\n\nTechnological change and the relaxation of controls have made it possible for capital to move more freely across national borders. And the characteristic reluctance of savers to invest outside their home market may be diminishing.\n\nAlongside these longer terms trends, financial markets today also show the effects of other forces. The extraordinary growth in earnings of energy and commodity exporters, the substantial rise in wealth that has come with rapid growth in China, India, and other emerging markets, together with efforts by many of those governments to stem the appreciation of their currencies, has led to a rise in capital flows, official and private, into the United States and other major economies. These flows seem large enough to have had a material effect on global interest rates and asset prices.\n\nThese changes in economic conditions reinforce each other. The long period of relative economic and financial stability has reinforced expectations of future stability, reducing implied volatility and risk premia, increasing comfort with higher leverage, and encouraging flows of capital into riskier assets. The low level of real interest rates that has prevailed in much of the world through this expansion has contributed to relatively accommodative financial conditions. The high levels of reserve accumulation by governments with heavily managed exchange rate regimes put downward pressure on forward interest rates, potentially distorting asset prices. The increase in size of sovereign wealth funds, the shift in assets to hedge fund and private equity managers, and the possible reduction in home bias among private savers have increased the amount of mobile capital in search of higher returns. The resilience of the market in the face of the latest shocks has increased confidence in future financial resilience. In these conditions, market participants face more acutely the classic dilemma of deciding whether to follow the market, or to buy more insurance against the risk of a reversal at the expense of near term returns.\n\nThis mix of forces operating on financial conditions presents challenges for policymakers and financial markets participants, for it makes it harder to figure out what is fundamental and enduring and what is temporary or transitional, or the result of policy distortions. Confidence exists alongside concerns about sustainability.\n\nAlthough there is much that is positive in the world today, there is little reason to believe we have entered a new era of permanent stability. Financial innovation and global financial integration do not offer the prospect of eliminating the risk of asset price and credit cycles, of manias and panics, or of shocks that could have systemic consequences.\n\nOver the past 25 years or so, we have seen a significant number of episodes of financial shocks, in U.S. markets and globally. Although more different than similar in their nature and impact, they had some common features. They were unanticipated. The causes varied, with some associated with a substantial deterioration in the real economy, and others not. And they typically involved the dynamic in which a sharp change in risk perception results in a fall in asset prices and a sharp reduction in market liquidity, and an increase in correlations across asset classes. As market participants move to protect themselves against further losses, by selling positions, requiring more margin, hedging against further declines, the shock is amplified and the brake becomes the accelerator.\n\nAll markets are vulnerable to this dynamic. The degree of vulnerability is not something we can measure with any confidence, for it depends not just on the how market participants behave in the event, but on the complex interaction of a number of different factors. The vulnerability depends, for example, on the size of the asset price misalignment, the conditions that produced it, and the magnitude of the shock to confidence in economic fundamentals. It depends on the scale of leverage in the system, and the incidence of leverage or concentration of exposure to different risk factors. It depends on the diversity of exposures or positions of different financial institutions. It depends on the presence or absence of distortions or market failures, moral hazard being the typical problem. It depends on perceptions of the capacity for monetary policy and other policies to adjust to mitigate the damage.\n\nThe dramatic changes we\u2019ve seen in the structure of financial markets over the past decade and more seem likely to have reduced this vulnerability. The larger global financial institutions are generally stronger in terms of capital relative to risk. Technology and innovation in financial instruments have made it easier for institutions to manage risk. Risk is less concentrated in the banking system, where moral hazard concerns and other classic market failures are more likely to be an issue, and spread more broadly across a greater diversity of institutions.\n\nAnd yet this overall judgment, that both financial efficiency and stability have improved, requires some qualification. Writing a decade ago about the history of the financial shocks of the 1980s and early 1990s, Jerry Corrigan argued that these same changes in financial markets we see today, though less pronounced then than now, created the possibility that financial shocks would be less frequent, but in some contexts they could be more damaging. This judgment, that systemic financial crises are less probable, but in the event they occur could be harder to manage, should be the principal preoccupation of market participants and policymakers today.\n\nWhat factors might contribute to this risk, a risk that could be described as the possibility of longer, fatter tails? One reason is a consequence of consolidation. The major banks are larger and stronger today, and it would take a much larger shock to make them vulnerable than was true in the past. But in that event, the consequence of their failure could be greater for markets.\n\nAnother reason is the consequence of leverage. Leveraged arbitrage activity, so some of the literature suggests, is likely to reduce volatility in normal times and increase it in times of stress, because of the greater financial constraints faced by leveraged funds relative to larger, more diversified banks and investment banks. Whether this matters in a systemic sense or not depends on the heterogeneity of funds and how correlated their exposures are with those of the major banks and investment banks.\n\nA third reason is the consequence of long periods of low losses and low volatility. When markets have been through a sustained period of relative stability and low credit losses, this reduces the estimates of potential losses produced by conventional risk management tools. Like gravity, this force is hard to counteract. And when we\u2019ve had a long period of low realized losses, rapid change in markets, dramatic growth in new instruments, and larger potential leverage, this creates a greater possibility of unanticipated losses, and therefore a greater potential for the trend\u2013amplifying, positive feedback effects that have characterized the major asset price shocks of 1987 and 1998.\n\nPolicymakers do not have the capacity to eliminate the risk of excess leverage or asset price misalignments, nor do we have the ability to act preemptively to diffuse them. And yet policy can play a very important role in limiting the vulnerability of financial markets to the risk that a shock will pose greater potential risks to the stability of the financial system and to economic growth. A few points about both monetary policy and supervision in this context.\n\nIt is now the consensus of most practicing central bankers that monetary policy can\u2019t do much preemptively to correct an existing substantial asset price misalignment. But if monetary policy is calibrated appropriately to keep aggregate demand growing roughly in balance with aggregate supply and to keep inflation low and stable, this reduces the risk that such misalignments will emerge and expand.\n\nThis is not always easy. It is especially hard to do in circumstances where the central bank is subject to other policy objectives. The most prominent source of conflict is an exchange rate objective; countries with even modestly open capital accounts will not find it possible to sustain a commitment to prevent the exchange rate from appreciating without eventually facing the risk of rising credit growth, asset price inflation, and inflation in the price of goods and services. This challenge is becoming harder to manage for some large emerging market economies, and it is the principal reason why in those countries there is an expectation in the markets that monetary policy will have to be tighter and exchange rate regimes more flexible over time. And as this happens it will, among other things, alter the balance of forces that have been operating on global capital flows.\n\nBeyond monetary policy, the principal tools available to policymakers are the province of supervision. And in this area, the most important things we can to reduce the risk of systemic financial crisis are to strengthen the shock absorbers in the financial system, both in terms of the financial cushions available to absorb losses and the capacity of the financial infrastructure to manage stress.\n\nIn terms of the financial cushions, the challenge is to sustain a level of capital and liquidity that is large enough to withstand a more adverse financial and economic environment than we have experience recently. Here the job of the risk management discipline is to try to compensate for failure of imagination, to counteract the gravitational effect on measured exposure produced by recent history, and to try to anticipate the adverse effects on market liquidity that may come with a shock. This requires a healthy skepticism about models, discipline and care in the face of competitive pressures, and humility about what we can know about the future.\n\nIn the world of infrastructure, the challenge is not just about the strength of the physical infrastructure, the capacity to handle volume, operational resilience, and vulnerability to single points of failure. Here the challenge is about the softer infrastructure, as well, such as the arrangements for resolving a credit event or the close\u2013out or liquidation of a complex fund or institution.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is involved in a range of important initiatives on both fronts, working closely with the lead supervisors of the major global financial institutions and market infrastructure operators. Over the past few years, we have initiated targeted reviews, aimed at improving the sophistication of stress\u2013testing practice, counterparty credit risk management in OTC derivatives, structured credit, and hedge funds, and the post\u2013trade processing infrastructure in the OTC derivatives markets. We are also looking carefully at liquidity risk management practice and the management of the bridge exposures institutions run in leverage lending, leveraged buyout and merger and acquistion financing, and credit activities more generally.\n\nThese initiatives are designed with several important features: first, to bring more evenness to the incentives faced by the major global institutions, through closer cooperation across supervisors within the United States and across countries; second, to foster more agility in the supervisory agenda, and a capacity to adapt to change that more closely matches the rapid evolution in market developments; and third, to try to encourage market\u2013led initiatives, reinforced rather than imposed by supervision. The careful work of Counterparty Credit Risk Management Policy Group II led by Jerry Corrigan\u2014with the supervisory initiatives I referred to is an example. Today, 18 global banks outlined another set of commitments to reduce settlement risk in the equity derivatives market.\n\nThis approach to supervision is designed to look ahead to try to ensure the adequacy of capital and liquidity, and the sophistication of risk management discipline relative to risk, over time and at all points in the cycle. I outlined earlier the reasons why monetary policy has only limited capacity to deal preemptively with financial bubbles. Similarly, I see little prospect that supervision will have the capacity to identify and address potential concentrations in exposure to individual risk factors, whether through changes to capital charges or other means. Focusing on the quality and strength of cushions against tail risk is the best way for supervision to be countercyclical rather than procyclical.\n\nThe subtitle of your conference is, I believe, \u201cWhere\u2019s the Risk?\u201d And as this implies, there is still substantial interest in markets and official circles in finding ways to use greater transparency to improve the capacity of markets, and supervisors, to try to address emerging risks early, to let the air out of crowded trades and concentrations of leverage or risk before they reach potentially troubling proportions. We will continue to explore ways to improve the quality of public disclosure by financial institutions, and other sources of information on financial activity. But we do not have the capacity to put in place a transparency regime over markets that would give people a real\u2013time picture of the incidence and magnitude of potential risks. The pace of change is too rapid, the number of positions, funds, and institutions too great, and the analytical challenge too complex to offer the promise of that type of early warning system.\n\nThe conditions we see prevailing in global financial markets today reflect a range of different factors, some fundamental and others that are less likely to be enduring. The most effective thing that policymakers and market participants can do in what is a necessarily uncertain world is to work to ensure that the shock absorbers are strong relative to the range of potential economic and financial outcomes.\n\nThank you."

    "content": "Good morning. I am pleased to be able to join you today. And it is a privilege to be here today with Canada's accomplished central bank governor, David Dodge. There are few people in central banks or in governments around the world today that have presided over as far reaching and successful a set of macroeconomic policy reforms as has David Dodge.\n\nI want to offer some reflections about the challenges managing macroeconomic policy in a more open and integrated world economy. And I want to say something about how the international monetary system, and the current framework of exchange rate regimes, might develop in the coming years.\n\nFor the past century or more, choices about exchange rate regimes have played an important role in economic outcomes across countries. From the Gold Standard of the late 19th and early 20th centuries through the Bretton Woods system and the episodes of exchange rate cooperation among the G5 and the G7 in the 1980s and after, the desire to achieve exchange rate stability was a major preoccupation of policymakers. The economic damage inflicted by the disastrous competitive devaluations among the major economies in the 1930s had a profound influence on thinking during much of the postwar period. And for governments and enterprises around the world today, the aversion to large fluctuations in exchange rates remains strong.\n\nAs the world has become more open to trade and more closely integrated, this sensitivity to exchange rate variability has intensified. And yet, experience suggests that resisting variability makes the adjustment to changing economic conditions more painful. In an increasingly open world economy, the ability to cope with change becomes more important, and for a large fraction of the world economic, exchange rate flexibility is a necessary condition for sustained favorable economic performance.\n\nChanges in fundamental factors such as productivity growth and the inevitable shocks to demand and supply require changes in relative prices, both domestically and internationally. A flexible exchange rate regime makes it easier for relative prices to move rapidly and effectively in the appropriate direction, and this generally eases the cost of that adjustment.\n\nEven in a fixed rate regime, this adjustment in response to changing circumstances will ultimately have to take place, of course. But if relative prices cannot adjust through the exchange rate, domestic output and employment will have to bear the brunt of adjustment instead.\n\nSince the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, we have seen the emergence of a diverse range of exchange rate arrangements. The large industrial economies have, by and large, decided to let their currencies adjust to changing circumstances without official intervention in exchange markets. Japan aside, it is now close to seven years since the last episode of concerted intervention among the major economies; and there has been no Japanese intervention for two years.\n\nAmong emerging economies, too, we have seen a marked trend toward more flexible exchange rate regimes. This is particularly pronounced in parts of Latin America. At the other end of the spectrum, some of the newer members of the European Union are gearing up to adopt the euro. Somewhere in the middle between these extremes of flexible exchange rate regimes and full monetary integration are the emerging market economies, mostly in Asia and among the major oil exporters in the Gulf, that still sustain fixed or partially fixed exchange rate regimes. Most of these countries link their currencies to the dollar, though we see varying degrees of flexibility in the closeness of that link.\n\nHow has the world fared under this diverse mixed of flexible and fixed exchange rate regimes? In general, I think, the costs of living with exchange rate volatility have been less than feared and attempts to limit volatility have been more damaging and less effective than expected.\n\nTake the experience of the major economies. Despite periods of very substantial swings in exchange rates, and the amplitude of the changes in exchange rates among the major currencies since 1973 have been exceptionally large, economic growth in the major economies have become more stable, not less. Quarterly GDP volatility in the United States, for example, has fallen by more than half since the mid 1980s. And average rates of inflation and the variability of inflation outcomes have of course declined substantially as well. This is not to say that these swings in exchange rates have not come with pain and trauma, only that overall economic performance has fared better than many would have expected three decades ago when contemplating life under flexible exchange rates.\n\nAmong emerging markets, experience with exchange rate flexibility has been more limited, and the record has been more mixed. Chile probably has one of the longest record of successful performance under a flexible regime, success due in large part of course to a strong record of prudent macroeconomic policy management and strong institutions. But there are many more examples today\u2014Brazil and Mexico are two\u2014of emerging economies with sustained periods of improved growth and inflation outcomes under more flexible exchange rate regimes.\n\nEmerging market economies face substantially greater challenges than the less open major economies in adjusting to a more integrated world and to the greater exposure to real and financial volatility that comes with integration. Large movements in capital flows can complicate the task of achieving sustainable growth, low inflation and financial stability. This is obvious for those countries experiencing sharp net outflows of capital, but the challenges are formidable even for those countries experiencing sustained periods of large inflows. And even those countries with more flexible exchange rates can see competitiveness eroded if their major trading partners resist exchange rate appreciation. For most countries, though, these challenges would be exacerbated rather than eased by a policy designed to try to sustain a fixed rate or to narrowly constrain variability in the exchange rate. Although it may seem counterintuitive, small open economies, even more than larger less open economies, need the flexibility that floating exchange rates bring.\n\nChanges in exchange rate regimes were present at the scene of most of the major emerging market financial crises of the last decade, and many have argued that the decisions to let the exchange rate adjust was a major source of the trauma that followed. But that's not a fair reading of the evidence. In general, the crises were the consequence of fundamental economic problems, often manifested in the buildup of substantial balance sheet problems, with excessive borrowing in foreign currency by the sovereign, the banking system, or both.\n\nThese balance sheet problems were one reason many governments chose to postpone currency adjustment for as long as possible, and these delays ensured that the cost of adjustment, when it was forced on these governments, was far higher than if action had been taken earlier. But this is not the whole story since the fixed exchange rate regime itself had contributed to the initial currency mismatch and associated balance sheet problems. By engineering artificial expectations of stability, the regime had led market participants to disregard the possibility of exchange rate devaluations, leading to mispricing of risk, insufficient hedging and ultimately to misallocation of financial and real resources.\n\nGovernments that found themselves in this position had very limited ability to mitigate the economic damage that was to come, but the policy choices that accompanied the exchange rate change often compounded the problem.\n\nJapan's experience provides another example, though the context was different. There is a perception in parts of Asia that the Japanese government's decision to let the yen appreciate in the late 1980s was principally responsible for Japan's so-called \u201clost decade\u201d of low growth. And, Japan, viewed through this prism, is cited as an example of the perils of letting an exchange rate move up in response to changing fundamentals. The reality is more complex. The problems of the Japanese economy in the 1990s were largely due to the aftereffects of the collapse of the real estate and asset price boom of the preceding decade, a boom fueled in part by efforts by the monetary authorities to limit the appreciation of the yen.\n\nThe size of the negative shock to demand from the collapse of the bubble was very substantial, and the capacity of the government and the central bank to mitigate the damage was constrained by the weakness in the banking system. A more forceful macroeconomic policy response, however, might have brought about a quicker recovery. In any case, the problem with the exchange rate choice was not the decision to let the rate adjust, but the decision to resist it and the role that played in magnifying the bubble, and thereby the subsequent damage from the fall.\n\nGiven where we are today, and what we know about the relative merits of flexible and fixed exchange rate regimes, what is the likely evolution of the current monetary system going forward? A few concluding observations.\n\nFirst, I think it is unlikely that we will see a substantial move toward monetary integration involving the major emerging market economies, in Asia or in the Western Hemisphere. As the economist Peter Kenen writes in his latest book, it is difficult today to envisage a substantial reduction in national currencies though the emergence of large regional monetary unions where they do not already exist.\n\nWithin Europe, we may yet see a further enlargement of the euro area. There may be other circumstances in which individual economies can derive benefit from a currency board system or from dollarization or euroization. Countries trying to emerge from a period of high inflation may in the future, as they have in the past, adopt a fixed exchange rate as a nominal external anchor for a disinflation strategy. These seem likely to be exceptions, however, to a general move toward more flexible exchange rate regimes.\n\nEven as regional economic integration increases in Asia and other parts of the world, these economies seem a long way from the point where economic, or political conditions, will make a compelling case for monetary integration. In Europe, of course, the political case for monetary integration to a large extent preceded the economic case. And the architects of the European Union integration worked consciously to induce a level of economic integration in Europe that would induce conditions that more closely met the economist's test for an optimal currency area.\n\nFor most of the emerging markets today, in contrast, the challenge is to establish the conditions that will enable them to live more comfortably in a world where their exchange rates will adjust more freely in response to changing fundamentals. As these economies become more open to capital flows, they will necessarily find it more difficult to occupy the tenuous middle ground with an exchange rate regime that is neither fully fixed nor flexible, but managed in a way that closely tracks the value of the dollar or carefully constrains fluctuations against the dollar.\n\nThis does not mean that these countries can be indifferent to exchange rate movements or that the exchange rate is irrelevant to the conduct of monetary policy. For many small open emerging economies, price stability and exchange rate stability are obviously intertwined, and a monetary rule that responds effectively to inflation pressure cannot afford to overlook the signals coming from the foreign exchange market. But attempts to target a particular level for the exchange rate or the slope of the change in the rate in response to different conditions will, as the capital account becomes more open, inevitably, come with substantial risks to monetary and financial stability.\n\nManaging the transition to a more open capital account and a more flexible exchange rate regime is not a simple task. These transitions need to be handled with care and attention to the development of a strong institutional framework for monetary policy and the financial system. The more successful transitions came in contexts where the monetary authorities were independent of political constraint, where balance sheet problems and currency mismatches in the government and the financial system were not acute, where the prevailing legal framework provided reasonable protections for property rights and the enforcement of contract, and where there was effective supervision of the banking system. Where these conditions were weaker, the transitions from fixed exchange rate regimes were more traumatic.\n\nThese conditions seem exacting, and the understandable need for caution often is invoked in defense of protracted and very gradual transitions. A certain degree of caution is wise: there is a great deal of risk in a poorly managed and premature shift toward flexibility. But there is risk in gradualism too. Delay magnifies the costs of living with the distortions caused by a managed rate.\n\nOnce relaxed, exchange and capital controls are both difficult and costly to reintroduce, and even relatively modest steps back from an open regime can be damaging to confidence and credibility, without buying much in the way of lasting stability.\n\nThe policy responses to the challenges that come with economic and financial integration principally involve choices for governments at the national level. International cooperation can in some circumstances help provide a more supportive environment, but there are no feasible changes to the architecture of the international financial system that offer the prospect of a durably stable external economic and financial environment for nations, large or small. Fundamentally, the only realistic choice for policymakers is to equip their economies with the flexibility to cope more successfully in this increasingly integrated global economy. And this means preparing for a world of more rather than less flexibility in exchange rate regimes.\n\nThank you."

    "title": "Global Economic Integration: The Opportunities and the Challenges",
    "date": "Apr 17, 2007",
    "speaker": "Unknown",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2007/gei070417",
    "content": "Let me again welcome you to the New York Fed and to this conference. We are especially pleased to have so many of our European colleagues here today. You have spent the morning discussing some of the important economic and financial issues facing the United States and Europe. But this is essentially a conference on integration. I want to step back and make some broader observations about the process of global economic integration and the package of policies that need to accompany greater openness.\n\nWe are, as the IMF noted last week in its latest World Economic Outlook, in an unusually prolonged and widespread global expansion\u2014the strongest in more than three decades. Economic integration and technological change have played a crucial part in driving this expansion and sustaining it in the face of recent shocks and some daunting longer-term economic policy challenges.\n\nYet there remains substantial ambivalence about the benefits of globalization. To many, the costs seem more compelling than the benefits. The sources of this ambivalence are varied. Some are familiar and some new.\n\nConcerns about the distributional impact of trade have been given new force by the decline in labor\u2019s share of national income; the long-term trend of rising income inequality; the increase in the share of goods and services that are tradable, and therefore of the broader scope of the population affected by the pressure of competition; and the perceived acceleration in the pace of economic change.\n\nThe greater mobility of financial flows has increased the sense among policymakers in many countries that their jobs have become harder, that they are less the masters of their own fate than in the past, and that they have a diminished ability to shield their companies and citizens from volatility.\n\nBut do these changes in economic circumstances and in perceptions fundamentally change what we know about the broad economic merits of global integration? I do not believe the basic economics of that judgment have changed.\n\nFew would argue that economic integration by itself is sufficient to achieve broad-based gains in income growth both within and across countries. The relative prosperity of nations reflects different choices made by governments about a range of policies and institutions beyond the realm of trade and financial restrictions. But integration is an essential ingredient for achieving sustained growth. Reasonable people can disagree on the magnitude of gains that can be attributed to trade rather than other economic policies. But the evidence in support of the broad consensus that openness and integration contribute significantly to better growth outcomes remains compelling.\n\nJust as compelling is the evidence against the proposition that protection in the form of restrictions on trade increases growth or reduces inequality. The world has a lot of experience with different policies designed to slow the pace of integration or to insulate parts of the economy from its effects, and these policies have generally been associated with worse economic outcomes. The poor do not benefit from protectionism.\n\nAlthough the balance of economic evidence has not fundamentally changed, the politics around globalization and integration have become more challenging.\n\nThe fact that the United States is now in the fifth consecutive year of expansion and that unemployment is now at 4.4 percent doesn\u2019t seem to have made trade any more popular. A recent Pew poll suggested that that nearly two-thirds of Americans feel less secure about their jobs than in earlier generations. And many attribute this increase in anxiety to trade.\n\nThis phenomenon of persistent and perhaps rising ambivalence about integration in the face of solid growth in average incomes is not unique to the United States. Here, as in many countries, the political consensus in favor of economic openness seems more fragile than it once was.\n\nThe debate about how to respond to this challenge tends to see the economic and political imperatives as in conflict. The most appealing political response\u2014usually some form of selective restriction on trade or investment\u2014is generally the option with the worst economic return. The typical political impulse is to try to address directly the source of the competitive pressure and to relieve it, but these measures cannot offer lasting relief. The economic price of protection, in terms of distorted incentives, reduced flexibility and broader costs on the economy as a whole, seem both more substantial and more enduring than any temporary political benefit.\n\nThe policy strategies that offer a better longer-term return do not try directly to relieve the pressures that come from economic and financial integration. Instead, they focus on the broader complement of policies and institutions that improve the capacity of economies to adapt to change and to absorb shocks. Those countries that have experienced the greatest gains as the world has become more integrated have been those with the type of policy and institutional infrastructure that facilitates economic flexibility and resilience in the face of change. The policies that offer the most promise in terms of broad-based income gains are not those that try to provide insulation from volatility, but those that make it easier to live with volatility.\n\nIn the realm of macroeconomic policy, this means further progress toward monetary policy credibility and fiscal sustainability, so that central banks and governments have the capacity to react to adverse shocks and mitigate the damage they can cause.\n\nEven with the remarkable improvements in the conduct of monetary policy around the world over the past two decades, central banks in many countries do not have institutional independence, in law or in practice. And many still operate under policy regimes directed at limiting exchange rate changes\u2014objectives that will necessarily conflict with their ability to achieve price stability, as their capital accounts become progressively more open. Economies with flexible exchange rate regimes generally fare better in the face of adverse external shocks. And in countries where central bank credibility is more firmly established, monetary authorities are better able to react to a sharp fall in asset prices or a negative demand shock.\n\nIn fiscal policy, the same basic point applies. Where fiscal sustainability is more firmly established, governments have more scope to respond to adverse demand shocks by reducing taxes or increasing expenditures. Where deficits are high and debt to GDP ratios are high and rising, government have less scope for countercyclical fiscal policy. In these cases fiscal stimulus is more likely to be met by a rise in risk premia, reducing, if not fully offsetting, the desired benefits to growth. Even in those emerging markets that have seen the most impressive progress toward fiscal sustainability, few have reached the point where they have built much of a cushion against future shocks. And in the United States and many other economies, the demographic changes now working their way through the economy entail very large future deficits and consequently very limited fiscal room for maneuver.\n\nThe right macroeconomic policy framework is crucial. But we have come to recognize that other issues, traditionally the province of microeconomics, have a vital role in contributing to effective macroeconomic policy. A critical factor distinguishing long-term economic performance among countries with relatively good monetary and fiscal policies is the degree of overall flexibility they exhibit in labor, product and financial markets. This is not simply about the presence or absence of regulation. It is a function of the incentives regulation creates and the extent to which it gets in the way of competition, impedes the allocation of labor and capital to industries with a higher return, favors established firms, and creates barriers to new entrants.\n\nAs the substantial body of research on structural reforms by the OECD has demonstrated, where regulation is more compatible with flexibility, productive growth has generally been higher, as technological advances have been diffused and adopted more rapidly. The IMF\u2019s latest World Economic Outlook reports that, among the major economies, those with more flexible labor markets have seen smaller declines in labor\u2019s share of income.\n\nOpen economies, of course, need strong and resilient financial systems. As financial systems develop and capital markets become more open and integrated, savings should be allocated more efficiently and risks distributed more broadly, both within and across countries. This process, however, is messy and very challenging to manage well. The history of economic crises over the last two decades is a history not just of fiscal profligacy and monetary policy mistakes, but of financial system weakness\u2014often the result of rapid deregulation and capital account liberalization in a context of weak supervision and a broad government guarantee of bank liabilities.\n\nThe development of deeper and more resilient financial markets is important for economies to be able to cope better with exchange rate flexibility and capital mobility. And financial strength is an important part of the arsenal of macro policy tools, for monetary policy is less effective in cushioning the effects of asset price and demand shocks in circumstances where the banking sector is impaired.\n\nA final and critical dimension of the policy framework that is important to the successful management of economic integration is the design of the public or social infrastructure. Raising the quality of educational outcomes is vital, as is the design of the network of insurance mechanisms, from unemployment insurance and training support, to health care and pension schemes. As progressively larger shares of the population become more exposed to the pressures of competition, as economies become more flexible, governments have to do a better job of designing programs of assistance that can ease the costs of adjustment.\n\nThese policies and institutional reforms are fundamentally the responsibility of national governments. International institutions can help, with technical assistance and financial support, but these challenges are essentially national challenges. The reforms of the international institutions now underway to make them more representative of the changing balance of economic activity in the world are laudable. And we share a common interest in a broad range of informal mechanisms for cooperation on policies in the financial arena. But ultimately it is the quality of the choices national governments make that will determine how their economies fare in a more open global economy.\n\nGlobal integration is not the primary source of the world\u2019s economic problems, nor can it be the primary solution to them. But economic integration can contribute significantly to sustained growth, rising incomes and declining poverty rates. The most effective policy response to the concerns of those who fear the consequences of further integration is to direct more political capital to the challenge of developing the economic and institutional infrastructure that will enable governments and their citizens to adapt more readily to change.\n\nThank you."

    "content": "I am grateful to Jeff Lacker for including me in this conference, and my compliments to him and the Richmond Fed for bringing together an excellent group to discuss the implications of recent innovations in credit markets.\n\nThe past few years have seen remarkable changes in credit markets, and this is a good time to take stock of what we know about those developments and their implications.\n\nThe latest wave of credit market innovations has elicited some concerns about their implications for the stability of the financial system, concerns similar to those associated with earlier periods of rapid change in financial markets. Will the most recent credit market innovations amplify credit cycles, contributing to \"excessive\" lending in times of relative stability, and then magnify the contraction in credit that follows? Will they introduce greater volatility in financial markets? Will they create greater risk of systemic financial crisis?\n\nThese concerns have been heightened in some quarters by the problems currently being experienced in the subprime mortgage sector. It will take some time before the full implications are understood and the full impact can be assessed. As of now, though, there are few signs that the disruptions in this one sector of the credit markets will have a lasting impact on credit markets as a whole.\n\nIndeed, economic theory and recent practical experience offer some reassurance against both these specific concerns and more general worries about the implications of credit market innovations for the performance of the financial system.\n\nThe rapid growth in these new types of credit instruments is, of course, a sign of their value to market participants. For borrowers, credit market innovation offers the prospect of increased credit supply; better pricing; and a relaxation of financial constraints. For investors, new credit instruments bring the prospect of broader risk and return opportunities; the ability to diversify portfolios; and increased flexibility. And for lenders, innovations can help free up funding and capital for other uses; they can help improve credit risk and asset/liability management; and they can improve the return on capital and provide new and cheaper funding sources.\n\nBy spreading risk more broadly, providing opportunities to manage and hedge risk, and making it possible to trade and price credit risk, credit market innovation should help make markets both more efficient and more resilient. They should help make markets better able to allocate capital to its highest return and better able to absorb stress. Broad, deep and well-functioning capital markets complemented by strong, well-capitalized banks, able to provide liquidity in times of strain, make for a more efficient financial system: one which contributes to better economic growth outcomes over time.\n\nThere are therefore compelling arguments in favor of a generally positive assessment of the consequences of innovation. Does experience provide support for these arguments, or are these changes too new for us to know?\n\nThe recent changes in credit markets have been dramatic. We have seen rapid growth of structured credit products, credit default swaps and new types of collateralized debt and loan obligations. Although these instruments are very new, they are the natural extension of earlier innovations in credit markets. Over a long period we have seen innovations ranging from the syndication of bank loans and the direct provision of credit through the capital markets, to the spread of asset-backed securities and products that separate different parts of the payments stream and different dimensions of the risk in a credit obligation into different instruments.\n\nThese changes have contributed to a substantial reduction in the share of total credit held by banks. They have produced a greater separation or distance between the entity that first arranges a loan and those who end up holding the risk, and more intermediaries in that chain. And they have contributed to a dramatic increase in the number and diversity of creditors to any individual borrower, and a greater capacity to actively trade credit risk.\n\nWe are now well into the third decade of experience with the consequences of these earlier innovations, and this history offers some useful lessons for evaluating the probable impact of the latest changes in credit markets.\n\nThe ease with which the U.S. financial system absorbed the substantial scale of corporate defaults that peaked in recent years in 2002 provides some support for the argument that broader and deeper capital markets make the system more resilient.\n\nIn general, there does not seem to be strong empirical support for the proposition that derivatives increase volatility in financial markets. Volatility is not higher where derivatives are most prevalent.\n\nCredit market innovation does not appear to have resulted in a large increase in leverage in the corporate sector, as some had feared. Indeed, nonfinancial corporate leverage in the United States is currently low by recent historical standards. The overall degree of balance sheet leverage by corporations, for example, is higher in some more traditional financial systems than it is in systems where credit market innovations are more advanced.\n\nDefault rates do not appear to have risen, nor recovery rates fallen as these credit innovations have spread, despite concerns they might lead to excess lending, the mis-pricing of credit risk and more messy and more complicated workouts, resulting from the greater diffusion of the investor base.\n\nAnd although the sources of the broad moderation in GDP volatility observed in the United States over the past two decades are still the subject of debate, the fact that this moderation occurred during a period of extensive innovation in credit and other financial markets should provide some comfort for those who expected the opposite.\n\nInnovations in credit markets are inevitably accompanied by challenges. Indeed, the history of innovation in financial markets provides many examples of periods of rapid change accompanied by fraud and abuse, by challenges in assessing value and risk, by concerns about the adequacy of investor and consumer protection, and by unexpected behavior of prices, defaults and correlations. To some degree, these types of problems are the inevitable consequence of change and innovation.\n\nAlthough recent experience as well as theory provide some reassurance against the concern that credit market innovation would make markets more volatile and the financial system more vulnerable, these judgments require qualification. Some aspects of this latest wave of innovation are different in substance\u2014therefore potentially in their implications\u2014from their predecessors. And these differences require attention.\n\nThere are three aspects of the latest set of changes which I think deserve more reflection.\n\nThe first is about the role of market liquidity and liquidity risk in how credit markets work. Credit market innovations have transformed the financial system from one in which most credit risk is in the form of loans, held to maturity on the balance sheets of banks, to a system in which most credit risk now takes an incredibly diverse array of different forms, much of it held by nonbank financial institutions that mark to market and can take on substantial leverage.\n\nU.S. financial institutions now hold only around 15 percent of total credit outstanding by the nonfarm nonfinancial sector: that is less than half the level of two decades ago. For the largest U.S. banks, credit exposures in over-the-counter derivatives is approaching the level of more traditional forms of credit exposure. Hedge funds, according to one recent survey, account for 58 percent of the volume in credit derivatives in the year to the first quarter of 2006.\n\nFinancial shocks take many forms. Some, such as in 1987 and 1998, involve a sharp increase in risk premia that precipitate a fall in asset prices and that in turn leads to what economists and engineers call \"positive feedback\" dynamics. As firms and investors move to hedge against future losses and to raise money to meet margin calls, the brake becomes the accelerator: markets come under additional pressure, pushing asset prices lower. Volatility increases. Liquidity in markets for more risky assets falls.\n\nIn systems where credit is more market-based and more credit risk is in leveraged financial institutions outside the banking system, a sharp rise in asset-price volatility and the concomitant reduction in market liquidity, can potentially have greater negative effects on credit markets. If losses in these institutions force them to withdraw from credit markets, credit availability will decline, unless or until other institutions in a stronger financial position are willing to step in. The greater connection between asset-price volatility, market liquidity and the credit mechanism is the necessary consequence of a system in which credit risk is dispersed outside the banking system, including among leveraged funds. This does not make the system less stable, though, only different. For if risk is spread more broadly, shocks should be absorbed with less trauma. Moreover, the system as a whole may be less vulnerable to distortions introduced by the moral hazard associated with the access that banks have to the safety net.\n\nA second issue we need to consider stems from the complexity of the new credit instruments, the challenges they present in terms of valuation and risk measurement and their short history of experience in times of stress.\n\nEven the most sophisticated participants in the markets for these instruments find the risk management challenges associated with these instruments daunting. This raises the prospect of unanticipated losses. Default rates are harder to predict where there has been a substantial change in the financial attributes of borrowers. The prices of instruments may not respond as expected to a given change in losses or in the value of the assets underlying these instruments. Hedging strategies may prove to be less effective than expected. Similarly rated instruments can behave very differently in stress events.\n\nThe response of prices and volatility to the downgrades in the automobile sector in the spring of 2005 and the recent experience in subprime mortgages and related asset-backed securities and credit derivatives illustrate different types of surprises faced by the participants in these markets. They are a reminder of the dimensions of uncertainty that exist about the shape of the distribution of potential returns. This is particularly true of what we might call the adverse tail, or the negative extreme. These challenges exist for all participants in these markets: for the institutions that underwrite, structure and distribute these risks; for those who trade or hold them; and for third parties, like the rating agencies.\n\nThese challenges of complexity are significant as well because they can exacerbate the problem of dealing with classic principal-agent problems. You can see this in the subprime mortgage market where, for example, a person may be rewarded for generating new mortgages on the basis of volume, without being directly exposed to the consequences of default; but these problems exist wherever incentives diverge and contracting is imperfect. Financial institutions typically maintain a range of different checks and balances to deal with the risk of misaligned incentives: for example, between a trader and the principal whose resources are at risk, or between the mortgage broker or underwriter and the firm that ultimately ends up holding the risk. But these checks and balances depend in part on the capacity of risk managers to observe and understand the underlying economic risk in these instruments. Where that is harder because of this combination of complexity, imbedded leverage, and short loss history, then market discipline will be weaker.\n\nA third issue relates to the dynamics of failure and the infrastructure that supports these markets. The dramatic growth in the volume of over-the-counter derivatives and the growth in the number and size of leveraged funds inevitably complicate the resolution of the failure of a large financial institution that is active in these markets. The sheer number of financial contracts that would have to be unraveled in the context of a default, the challenge that a former colleague of mine likes to refer to as \"unscrambling the eggs,\" could exacerbate and prolong uncertainty, and complicate the process of resolution.\n\nAs is typical during periods of rapid innovation, these markets grew much more quickly than did the supporting infrastructure. Take credit derivatives, for example. For most of the early years of this market, much of the post-trade processing system was not automated and required substantial manual intervention. Positions were assigned without the knowledge of counterparties. Confirmations backlogs rose to very high levels. As Alan Greenspan put it, the market was using 19th century methods of dealing with 21st century financial instruments.\n\nThis created a greater risk of operational problems and uncertainty about exposures in the event of stress. The capacity of market participants to mitigate these risks by improving the infrastructure was hampered by classic collective action problems, magnified by the greater number and diversity of participants.\n\nAll these challenges merit attention. They describe some of the risks that have accompanied the substantial benefits of credit market innovation. And they help illustrate why these broad changes in financial markets may have contributed to a system where the probability of a major crisis seems likely to be lower, but the losses associated with such a crisis may be greater or harder to mitigate.\n\nWhat should policymakers do to mitigate these risks?\n\nWe cannot turn back the clock on innovation or reverse the increase in complexity around risk management. We do not have the capacity to monitor or control concentrations of leverage or risk outside the banking system. We cannot identify the likely sources of future stress to the system, and act preemptively to diffuse them.\n\nThe most productive focus of policy attention has to be on improving the shock absorbers in the core of the financial system, in terms of capital and liquidity relative to risk and the robustness of the infrastructure.\n\nThese issues are the principal focus of day-to-day supervision and market oversight in the major financial centers around the world. The Federal Reserve is actively involved in a range of efforts, working closely with the primary supervisors of the major global financial institutions and the critical parts of the financial infrastructure, to encourage further progress. In this context, we are working to put in place a stronger regulatory capital regime and to strengthen the capacity of firms to absorb losses in stress conditions. We are encouraging more sophisticated and more conservative management of credit exposures in over-the-counter derivatives and structured financial products, as well as of exposures to hedge funds. And we are encouraging a range of efforts to modernize the operational infrastructure that underpins the over-the-counter derivatives markets, and to improve the capacity of market participants to manage a major default.\n\nThe stronger these shock absorbers, the more resilient markets will be in the face of future shocks, and the more confident we can be that banks will be a source of strength and of liquidity to markets in periods of stress and that the financial system will contribute to improved economic performance over time.\n\nThank you."

    "content": "Liquidity plays a central role in the functioning of financial markets. Structural changes in the financial system that have been underway for some time increase the importance of market liquidity. The allocation of capital increasingly relies on securities markets, where funds for investment in the real economy are raised through the direct issuance of securities to investors. A greater diversity of financial institutions, institutions other than banks, now play a more active role in the provision of credit and liquidity.\n\nLiquidity can mean many different things. One dimension of liquidity is the availability of credit or the ease with which institutions can borrow or take on leverage. This is generally referred to as funding liquidity.\n\nAnother dimension of liquidity is the ease with which market participants can transact, or the ability of markets to absorb large purchases or sales without much effect on prices. This is what is generally called market liquidity.\n\nAlthough these two concepts are distinct, they are closely related and are often mutually reinforcing. Fundamentally this is so because when funding liquidity is abundant traders have the resources with which to finance trading positions that smooth price shocks and make markets liquid.\n\nIn practice, this mutually reinforcing behavior is driven by a complex array of factors, including the degree of leverage embedded in the markets at any given time, the difficulty that lenders face in discerning whether a surge in volatility is driven by a transitory shock of some kind or a permanent shock to fundamentals, and risk management practices.\n\nInstitutions manage the credit risk in their trading-related exposure by requiring some counterparties to post collateral or margin. Typically, institutions require of hedge fund counterparties both initial margin against potential loss and variation margin, which requires payment to cover any decline in the value of the position. If the position declines in value, the counterparty will have to meet margin calls. If it does not have enough liquidity on hand to meet those calls, it will have to liquidate other positions to raise the requisite cash. The failure to satisfy such a margin call could lead to the liquidation of the position.\n\nThis approach to risk management can transform credit risk into liquidity risk. In most circumstances, the impact of this is unexceptional. Other institutions will find the new prices attractive and step in and buy. In exceptional circumstances, however, as creditors and counterparties seek to reduce their exposure to future losses, actions intended to limit individual exposure to risk may instead increase overall risk.\n\nWe do not know very much about what makes markets more or less vulnerable to this type of acute shock. This is in part because liquidity itself is not easy to measure.\n\nA broad range of indicators tells us something about funding liquidity, including growth in monetary aggregates, in financial assets and different forms of borrowing or credit. Other measures, such as movements in bid-ask spreads, the level of interest rates, changes in asset prices and risk premia, along with the level of volatility and expectations of future volatility, and turnover volume or other measures of market depth, help us evaluate market liquidity.\n\nYet none of the measures provides a reliable way of judging how vulnerable markets are to a reversal, or the scale of damage that might accompany a reversal.\n\nThese measurement limitations are similar to those that make it difficult to judge when, and by what magnitude, asset prices deviate from fundamental values at any given point in time.\n\nIn the case of liquidity, the shortcomings of our analytical tools are magnified by the difficulty of measuring leverage or identifying potential concentrations in the financial system. This has always been challenging, but the growth in the overall size of private pools of capital and the degree of embedded leverage that exists in many derivative instruments makes this more challenging today.\n\nWhen market liquidity and funding seem abundant, this is likely to be observable in things we can measure, like interest rates and credit spreads. And when liquidity ebbs, the effect is conspicuous in a range of observable market prices and volumes. But we do not have, and probably never will have, a set of indicators that offers the promise of predicting when liquidity conditions will reverse, or when markets are particularly vulnerable to a more acute decline in liquidity.\n\nIn this sense, liquidity is like confidence. And, like confidence, liquidity plays a critical role both in establishing the conditions than can lead to a financial shock, and in determining whether that shock becomes acute, threatening broader damage to the functioning of financial and credit markets.\n\nWhat role can policy play in reducing the vulnerability of markets to this type of dynamic?\n\nOf course, central banks have a range of instruments they can use in the event of a crisis. By injecting liquidity into the system, and thus strengthening confidence, they can reduce the risk that temporary liquidity problems will result in default by otherwise solvent institutions, or damage to the payment system or credit process.\n\nBut what can policymakers do ex ante to limit the risk of crisis? The most powerful instruments we have are those that affect the strength of the basic, fundamental shock absorbers in the financial system. When capital and liquidity cushions at the major institutions are strong, then markets as a whole are less vulnerable to the adverse spiral of asset price declines, increased volatility, and declining liquidity. And when the operational infrastructure is robust, markets will be able to absorb larger shocks and sharper changes in risk appetite with less risk of broader contagion. These shock absorbers are substantially stronger today than they have been in even in the relatively recent past.\n\nThese issues are the principal focus of day-to-day supervision and market oversight in the major financial centers around the world. The Federal Reserve is actively involved in a range of efforts, working closely with the primary supervisors of the major global financial institutions and the critical parts of the financial infrastructure, to encourage further progress.\n\nIn this context, we are working to put in place a stronger regulatory capital regime and to strengthen the capacity of firms to absorb losses in stress conditions. We are encouraging more sophisticated and more conservative management of credit exposures in over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and structured financial products, as well as of exposures to hedge funds. And we are encouraging a range of efforts to modernize the operational infrastructure that underpins the OTC derivatives markets, and to improve the capacity of market participants to manage adversity.\n\nThese efforts will all contribute to a more resilient system, one that is better able to withstand the effects of a major decline in asset prices or deterioration in credit.\n\nAre there other tools that policymakers and market participants could use to address this risk?\n\nSome policymakers have argued that public disclosure of information could help reduce the risk of future systemic financial crisis, by preventing the buildup of \"excessive\" leverage or concentrations of risk.\n\nThe principal focus of attention, as in the immediate wake of the failure of Long-Term Capital Management, has been on two quite different types of public disclosure.\n\nThe first is information that would make it easier to evaluate the overall leverage or risk profile of major hedge funds and their counterparties, and thereby judge their vulnerability to a sharp movement in asset prices. The second is information about the actual positions of individual funds or institutions: information that would make it easier to identify concentrated exposures to specific risk factors, and thereby assess more accurately the potential impact of the failure of a major fund or institutions on the market as a whole.\n\nThese pose very different challenges and offer different benefits. There are a number of crude measures of overall risk profile that, if disclosed to the market, would give counterparties information they do not now typically get about the risk of failure of the fund. One example is data on the size of daily variations in net asset value, VAR, or profit and loss over the previous quarter. This type of information would not reveal proprietary information about trading strategies or otherwise create substantial disincentives to risk taking. Although these would provide some information on the overall risk profile of the fund, they would be lagging indicators, and they would carry the usual risk of providing false comfort in some circumstances and excessive concern in others.\n\nAdopting such measures would give the institutions that provide financing and leverage to hedge funds a somewhat greater capacity to judge their direct risk to those funds. But that is not their principal challenge. The institutions already know the positions they are financing, and they can use the usual range of tools to measure the potential exposure, net of collateral, in those positions. And where they do not feel they have adequate information to evaluate the overall risk profile of the fund, they can manage that risk by taking less exposure, by requiring more margin, or by building a greater cushion of protection against overall risk. So the potential gains from a disclosure regime of this type would be limited, at least as compared with the cost of trying to put such a regime in place on the global scale that would be necessary to make it effective.\n\nBy far the greater challenge is to assess the potential impact of the failure of a major hedge fund on the firm's other exposures and other counterparties. This is a question about how correlated the firms other positions are to the risks the hedge fund is taking. It goes beyond the firm's direct credit exposure to the hedge fund, to the fund's overall risk profile. Large hedge funds typically use multiple prime brokers, and they are, of course, reluctant to disclose to those institutions real-time information on their overall positions and trading strategies. So the banks and investment banks do not generally know what their overall exposure to credit and market risks might be in the event that a large fund is forced to liquidate positions.\n\nThis knowledge gap has led many to advocate the provision of information on actual positions of the major funds, perhaps aggregated by a third party. According to the proponents, this would help market participants and regulators to identify potential concentrations or crowded trades, and that knowledge would help diffuse them before they became a problem.\n\nThis type of transparency has understandable and enduring appeal, but it is unachievable. There is no feasible way to try to capture in real time the rapidly changing exposures of different institutions to different risks in any meaningful fashion. No one with access to that information could make sensible judgments about the level and nature of actual concentrations and whether the risks are excessive.\n\nWe continue to explore ways in which the provision of greater information to counterparties and to the markets more generally could help reduce vulnerability to financial crises. For now, though, the practical limitations on achieving greater transparency underscore the importance strengthening the robustness of the shock absorbers in the financial system. We are not likely to ever be in a position where we have the capacity to identify the source and estimate the probability of future financial shocks. And policymakers are unlikely to ever be in a position to diffuse concentrations of risk or crowded trades ahead of a crisis. The most sensible thing we can do is to improve the capacity of the core of the financial system to handle adversity, and this requires continued focus on improving the strength of the capital and liquidity cushions, as well as the market infrastructure.\n\nLet me end with a few quick thoughts on the role of monetary policy in this context. Can monetary policy play a preemptive role in reducing the vulnerability of financial markets to the type of dynamic we saw in 1987 and 1998?\n\nCentral banks cannot realistically hold out the prospect of using monetary policy to prevent asset price bubbles, conditions of \"excess\" leverage in parts of the financial system, or other factors in markets that might lead to the types of positive feedback dynamics that were at the heart of some past crises.\n\nAnd yet many of the observations made about liquidity and market conditions over recent years have potential implications for monetary policy. Changes in risk premia, the level of asset prices, credit spreads, and interest rates, and in realized and expected volatility of asset prices\u2014these can all affect the pace at which overall demand grows, and can therefore potentially affect future inflation.\n\nIn discharging their responsibilities for the maintenance of price stability, central bankers need to be eclectic in looking at a range of different ways of measuring the stance of monetary policy, and its effects on the future path of growth and inflation. No indicators of liquidity or overall financial conditions provide a ready guide to judgments about monetary policy. But all these indicators merit careful attention, and they strengthen the argument against narrow or mechanistic approaches to thinking about the monetary and broader economic outlook.\n\nUltimately, though, ex ante judgments about leverage, concentrations and liquidity risk will continue to prove elusive. Our principal focus should therefore be not in the search for the capacity to preemptively diffuse conditions of excess leverage or liquidity, but in improving the capacity of the core of the financial system to withstand shocks and on mitigating the impact of those shocks. And, as always, central banks need to stand prepared to make appropriate monetary policy adjustments if changes in financial conditions would otherwise threaten the achievement of the goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth.\n\nThank you."

    "content": "It is a pleasure to be here at the Council on Foreign Relations, and to be here with Jerry Corrigan.\n\nA few brief remarks about the global economy, both the real and financial dimensions, to provide a basis for our discussion.\n\n2006 marked the fourth successive year of a global expansion that has been remarkable for its strength, for its breadth, and for its stability in the face of economic shocks and uncertainty in the geopolitical realm.\n\nThis period of broad-based growth in income has been supported by a number of important fundamental forces.\n\nRapid technological innovation and greater economic integration have brought stronger growth and higher levels of productivity. The acceleration in productivity growth that occurred in the United States in the second half of the last decade seems likely to remain intact. And productivity growth is accelerating outside the United States, most strikingly in some of the large emerging economies.\n\nFinancial innovation and greater integration of national financial systems has contributed to the strength of real economic activity by improving the allocation of resources within and among economies. Improvements to risk management and to capital cushions are likely to have made the financial system more stable and more resilient.\n\nAnd macroeconomic policy has improved around the world. The increase in monetary policy credibility in a broad range of countries has produced lower rates of inflation and more stability in inflation expectations. Greater public confidence in monetary policy was critical to laying the foundation for the improvements in real economic performance, by providing a stable foundation for long-term investment decisions.\n\nIn emerging markets, better monetary policy has been accompanied by more disciplined and conservative fiscal policy and a range of other policies that have reduced, though not eliminated, vulnerability to changes in confidence, capital flows and exchange rate movements.\n\nThese factors are each fundamentally important, and they are, of course, interrelated. The policies that delivered better inflation outcomes, more openness and competition and stronger financial systems were critical to fostering an environment in which improvements in productivity and growth could occur.\n\nThis expansion has also been notable for the financial conditions that have prevailed over the past several years.\n\nLong-term interest rates have remained relatively low in nominal and real terms. Equity and other asset prices have moved higher. Credit spreads have declined to quite low levels. Market participants report exceptionally high levels of liquidity. And volatility, both realized and expected, has remained low across many different types of financial assets, market and economies.\n\nThis general constellation of market conditions and asset prices is unusual, at least in comparison to what we have seen over the past several decades. This has been a distinguishing feature of the present expansion, but it is not something we fully understand, and we cannot be confident in judgments about how durable it will prove to be.\n\nTo a significant extent, these financial developments reflect a high degree of confidence in future macroeconomic and financial stability, reinforced by the improvements in inflation performance, growth outcomes and financial resilience of the past several years.\n\nBetter monetary policy has lowered expectations of future inflation and inflation volatility and has contributed to lower risk premiums in general. Changes in the cyclical behavior of financial intermediation and credit provision, coupled with the increased stability of the real economy, seem likely to have reinforced the improvements on the monetary policy front.\n\nAnd rapid growth in the major emerging market economies, together with the substantial earnings of energy-producing and commodity-exporting countries, have produced a substantial increase in wealth and savings relative to perceived investment opportunities. In a world where capital can now flow much more freely across national borders, a significant portion of these savings has moved across national borders.\n\nThese are powerful and fundamental forces, and they certainly help explain the broad reduction in risk premiums and the substantial demand for credit risk and financial assets.\n\nThere are other factors at work as well, however, that have less favorable implications. Part of this recent dynamic in financial markets is a consequence of the present state of the international monetary system, in which a substantial part of the world economy runs exchange rate regimes tied in some way to the dollar. This has entailed a sustained period of very substantial official accumulation of dollar reserves, putting downward pressure on U.S. interest rates and upward pressure on U.S. asset prices.\n\nThese forces are surely transitory, but their impact on capital flows, interest rates and asset prices are important, not just in terms of their short-term impact on growth. If they are large enough, they have the potential to alter or distort current decisions about investment and consumption in a way that could be detrimental to our longer-run growth prospects. And they are important because they work to mask or dampen the effects on risk premiums in financial markets that we might otherwise expect to be associated with the expected trajectory of the fiscal and external imbalances in the United States.\n\nGiven this broad context, I want to touch briefly on some of the policy issues that are likely to be important to the prospects for economic performance, here and around the world. Despite the relatively favorable performance of the global economy, we face a range of daunting longer-term economic policy challenges. The improvements in the conduct of monetary policy were critical to the improvements in productivity and growth that we are now seeing on a global scale. And monetary policy will, of course, continue to be critical, but monetary policy alone cannot provide the elements of the framework necessary to provide an environment for innovation and long-term decisions that will be so vital for future growth. Economic policy, in general, needs to be more forward looking in providing a longer-term framework for stability.\n\nOn the fiscal policy front, demographic changes confront governments around the world with exceptionally difficult choices. For the United States, these challenges are less acute than for many of the major economies, but they are still formidable in their scale and complexity. Even for the near term\u2014for the period before the increase in number of retirees starts to have a major impact on Social Security and Medicare expenditures\u2014we are running an unsustainably large fiscal deficit. Despite the recent improvements in revenues, the expected trajectory for the fiscal deficit will mean that federal government debt will continue to rise as a share of GDP. The restoration of fiscal rules\u2014such as those that require new tax cuts or expenditure programs to be funded with offsetting policy measures\u2014will help reduce the risk of further deterioration. However, they need to be complemented by a consensus on policy changes that will produce smaller future deficits.\n\nRestoring confidence in U.S. fiscal management would be important and necessary independent of the broader context of the global economy today, but it is more important given the size of our external imbalance, now running at the unprecedented level of 7 percent of GDP a year. The trade balance in real terms has been broadly stable over the past two years, but our net income payments have shifted to deficit, and the size of that component of the current account deficit seems likely to continue to expand. These large global imbalances, our current account deficit and the surpluses that are the counterpart to our deficit, will have to come down over time. How that process unfolds will depend on a complex mix of factors around the world. Confidence that the U.S. political system will act to generate a sustainable fiscal trajectory is important to raising the probability that this process of adjustment unfolds with less risk.\n\nA successful conclusion of the Doha round of trade negotiations would provide some insurance against the risk that the process of economic integration will be interrupted or reversed. Despite the relatively favorable average income gains of the past few years, a common feature of the political context in economies around the world is the fragility or weakness of public support for openness and economic integration.\n\nThe political challenge of sustaining support for the process of integration may be the most important economic challenge of our time. To paraphrase Lawrence Summers, it is not enough to explain that globalization is inevitable and that policies that look politically attractive as a response to economic anxiety will only hurt the economy as a whole. Nor is it a politically effective strategy to state simply that economic integration is a necessary and powerful force in raising average incomes, or that technological change may be more important than trade or immigration as an explanation for slower growth in real wages for many Americans.\n\nRaising the quality of education and exploring ways to improve the safety net are a necessary part of the solution to this challenge. But these reforms will have a long fuse and they may not yield the hoped-for increase in support. Trade does not appear to be more popular in countries with more generous safety nets, universal health care and highly subsidized higher education than it is today in the United States.\n\nThe political challenges of sustaining support for global economic integration and fiscal sustainability will be more difficult in the United States because of what has happened to the distribution of income and economic insecurity. Several broad economic forces substantially complicate an already difficult set of political challenges: the long-term increase in income inequality, the slow pace of growth in real wages for the middle quintiles of the population, the increase in the volatility of income that is a reflection of the greater flexibility of the U.S. economy, and the greater exposure of households to the risk in financing retirement and the burden of paying for health care.\n\nMore generally, the global financial system and the monetary arrangements that underpin it are in the process of a delicate and consequential transition as the major emerging market economies\u2014particularly in Asia\u2014move toward more mature monetary policy frameworks, more flexible exchange rate regimes and more open capital markets. This transition will require careful management, and the economic dimensions of getting it right would be complicated even without the political pressures those governments face.\n\nOne final note on the financial system. The global financial system is in the process of very dramatic change. The changes of even just the last five years are extraordinary, in terms of the size, and strength, and scope of the major global firms, the role of private leveraged funds, the extent of risk transfer and the increase in the size of the derivatives market, the change in the structure of the credit market, the increase in and changes in the pattern of cross border financial flows.\n\nThese changes, and others, seem likely to have made the financial system both more effective in moving capital to its most productive use and more stable and resilient over time. But they do not, of course, mean the end of systemic risk in financial markets. They could in some circumstances work to magnify rather than mitigate stress. Central banks, supervisors and those running the major private financial institutions need to continue to work to ensure that what Jerry Corrigan calls the \u201cshock absorbers\u201d in the financial system\u2014capital and liquidity and the operational infrastructure\u2014are sufficiently strong and robust to withstand economic and financial conditions more adverse than we have seen in the recent past.\n\nThank you."
