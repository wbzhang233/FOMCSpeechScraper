        "content": "Introduction\n\nDistinguished representatives of the global central banking community and official sector, current and former central bank account operations staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Federal Reserve System colleagues, I am honored to speak at this commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the opening of the first dollar accounts for central banks around the world on the books of the Federal Reserve.1 And it is, of course, very apt that we gather here in a room whose namesake, Benjamin Strong, was more than anyone else responsible for their establishment.\n\nOn May 3, 1917, the Federal Reserve signed its first reciprocal account agreement with a foreign central bank, the Bank of England, entailing the establishment of nostro2 and custody accounts on each other’s books. This was soon followed by agreements with several other central banks, including the Banque de France, Bank of Italy, and Bank of Japan.\n\nThese early agreements were instrumental in helping the newly-established Federal Reserve forge a global role for itself as an institution and for the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency. So as much as the account openings themselves, today we commemorate the symbolism, principles, and values they represent.\n\nToday’s event commemorates the start of the Federal Reserve’s international operations and involvement in the international arena. It honors the Federal Reserve’s past and ongoing support for the principle of the major central banks to provide safe, confidential, and reliable account services in their currencies to the global central banking community in support of financial stability and other central banking mandates. And it acknowledges the value of cooperation among the world’s central banks and the role that these initial operational ties played in paving the way for broader and deeper cooperation among central banks.\n\nIn doing so, we also recognize the individuals past and present who have played a role, often behind the scenes, in managing the Federal Reserve’s dollar account operations for the global official sector.\n\nThe Early Years: War, Ambition, and Cooperation\n\nThe story of the early years of the Federal Reserve’s dollar accounts for foreign central banks is one of war, ambition, and cooperation.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the first agreement was signed less than a month after the United States entered the First World War on April 6, 1917. Since the Federal Reserve leaders’ very first meeting in 1914, in addition to the weighty task of standing up from scratch a fully functioning central bank, they had to prepare for any eventuality concerning the impact of the Great War on the U.S. and the Federal Reserve’s responsibilities.3 Against this backdrop, Fed leaders foresaw that it would be useful to establish close banking relationships with foreign central banks to facilitate transactions arising from wartime needs and conditions, including payments for war-related U.S. exports, financing of wartime government debt, and gold transfers. It was left to Governor Benjamin Strong of the New York Fed to journey to Europe in the spring of 1916 to personally negotiate the early account agreements, allowing him to forge close personal relationships with European central bankers, most famously with the Bank of England’s Montagu Norman, or as Strong would come to call him: “my dear Monty.”4 While these initial discussions in 1916 did not lead immediately to agreements, partly owing to U.S. observance of neutrality, the groundwork had been laid such that by the time the U.S. entered the War in April 1917 the arrangement with the Bank of England could be executed rapidly.\n\nThe historical records show that the establishment of this first account agreement with the Bank of England involved a minor diplomatic faux pas, known as the British Treasury bills episode. President Wilson, having won reelection in 1916 on the claim of having kept the U.S. out of the Great War and observing strict neutrality, had directed the Federal Reserve Board in Washington to issue a clear-cut warning to U.S. banks not to invest in a pending large placement of British Treasury bills in the U.S. market. The immediate and worldwide effect of the statement was to give the impression that the U.S. had “broken with Britain,” an impression which officials were soon scrambling for ways to counteract.5 The result was the Federal Reserve Board’s decision, contrary to the terms of the account negotiations and to the consternation of the New York Fed, to unilaterally announce to the public the account agreement with the Bank of England. The whole episode spoke perhaps to the Fed’s inexperience in matters of delicate international financial diplomacy. In any event, the Bank of England magnanimously let the matter slide—noting that mistakes “may arise even in the best regulated families”—and the account agreement was executed on May 3, 1917 and operationalized on June 20, 1917.6,7 Andrew Hauser will provide more insight into this fascinating period in his remarks in a few minutes.\n\nAs expedient as the accounts were for wartime needs, the historical records show they were also motivated by ambitions of the Fed’s first leaders to establish the dollar as a major international currency and, for Benjamin Strong, to establish New York as a great international financial center to rival London. They had their work cut out for them. By 1914, while the U.S. was already the world’s largest economy and trading nation, its banking system remained curiously parochial and the dollar was not a major international currency.8 In fact, American firms continued to finance their trade almost entirely with credits from foreign banks, a source of resentment, with Paul Warburg, the first Federal Reserve vice chairman, referring to the annual acceptance fees paid to London banks as a form of “tribute.”9 With the passage of the Federal Reserve Act in 1913, some of the constraints on the emergence of a robust dollar trade financing market were removed and the newly established U.S. central bank could take a more active role in nurturing and backstopping a nascent dollar acceptance market, which it did. These efforts included buying dollar acceptances for foreign central bank accounts at competitive discount rates and providing guarantees, for a small fee, on payments at maturity of acceptances bought for these accounts.10 These actions helped to spur the dollar’s emergence as an important international currency, with dollar acceptances viewed as an attractive reserve asset by the 1920s.\n\nThe early accounts also represented tangible links of cooperation among major central banks, with much of this cooperation centered on efforts to maintain or restore the international gold standard in the aftermath of the First World War.11 The reciprocal relationships enabled central banks to buy and sell foreign exchange to influence credit conditions in each other’s markets with the aim of regulating cross-border gold movements. In this, central banks of the time viewed acting through foreign central bank correspondent accounts as preferable to acting through private intermediaries.\n\nCentral Banks’ Mutual Need for Safe, Confidential, and Reliable Account Services\n\nThe need for reciprocal relationships continues to resonate with central banks today even following the demise of the international gold standard and major changes in the international monetary system over the past one hundred years.\n\nWhy do central banks value these relationships so highly?\n\nSafety, confidentiality, and reliability are strong motivations for the reciprocal provision of banking and custody services among the world’s central banks. In particular, central banks around the world have a mutual need for correspondent banking12 and custody services to execute on core central banking functions in which the safety, confidentiality, and reliability of service provision is essential. This befits the character and role of central banks as highly risk-averse stewards of national wealth. It reflects the imperative for central banks to maintain untarnished credibility in the formulation and implementation of monetary policy, and an unblemished reputation in the operation and oversight of domestic and cross-border payment systems. And it is driven by central banks' responsibility to safeguard financial stability.\n\nThis results in central banks often preferring, and sometimes requiring, foreign reserve managers to use the account services of fellow central banks. This is especially true for liquidity tranches of reserve portfolios where safety and accessibility are critical for the execution of core central banking functions, including FX reserve management, FX intervention, time-sensitive official payments, macro-prudential policy, lender of last resort responsibilities, and other central bank operations that may require the use of foreign assets and currencies.\n\nAs stewards of national wealth in their capacity as managers of official foreign reserves, central banks seek to minimize custodial risk in the safekeeping of their foreign reserves.13 By using a central bank custodian, the risk of loss stemming from insolvency, negligence, or unauthorized disclosure is either removed or significantly reduced. Central banks do not pose counterparty risk and reserve managers’ use of fellow central bank account services reduces the risk of disclosure of central banks’ trading strategies. Relatedly, the confidentiality of holdings and activities in central bank accounts supports the execution of sensitive operations that may require utmost discretion to avoid setting off market panics or privileging one set of market participants over another. Finally, central banks’ use of a fellow central bank’s account services allows them to settle in central bank money, with attendant benefits from the standpoint of smooth and reliable settlement.\n\nCentral Bank Account Services and Global Financial Stability\n\nIn addition to the reciprocal benefits central banks derive from providing each other with account services in support of their mutual needs and common missions, many central banks have long recognized that their provision of account services to the global central banking community is important for supporting global financial stability. For these central banks, the rationale for offering account services to other central banks is grounded in the importance of their currencies for international transactions, cross-border funding, and in official reserve holdings. If a given currency is important internationally, the central bank of issue has a special responsibility to offer account services commensurate with this role to the global central banking community. For reserve currency-issuing central banks, this has typically meant a range of payment, investment and securities custody services for reserve assets in their currencies.\n\nFor the world’s major central banks, the maintenance of operational links through reciprocal account relationships is integral to their ability to engage in global financial stability operations. Having accounts, settlement instructions, tested and secure lines of communication, and business processes already in place at the time of or leading up to a crisis enhances major central banks’ ability to respond to crises efficiently and flexibly. There are numerous historical examples, both known and unknown to the public, of these account relationships being used to support the stability of the global financial system, perhaps best exemplified historically by the Bretton Woods network of central bank swap lines.14 More recently, in nearly every major international incident over the past twenty years that has prompted a coordinated response by the world’s major central banks—be it coordinated FX interventions by the major central banks in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima disaster, the swap lines established during the 2008 financial crisis, or swap lines in the wake of 9/11—the reciprocal accounts among major central banks formed the backbone for the actual or potential execution of stabilization policies. Without these accounts, coordinated central bank action in pursuit of financial stability objectives would be either severely handicapped or entail high risks in terms of the safety, confidentiality, and reliability of these operations.15\n\nThe practical reality is that in exigent situations characterized by fast-moving events, incomplete information, and intense pressure, even the best of policies can fall short unless a level of trust, experience, and internal muscle memory exists for operations to be executed effectively. Operational readiness is developed and conditioned through the daily interactions between central bank staffs in the course of managing each other’s cash and custody accounts, generating valuable in-house expertise in cross-border central banking operations and a network of inter-personal and institutional relationships in the global central banking community that may otherwise not exist. This knowledge and network of relationships may be leveraged by central banks to better understand the policy context behind global central bank actions, as well as the operating environments and constraints faced by central bank colleagues around the world.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s Dollar Account Services\n\nFor the Federal Reserve, the dollar’s predominant international role confers on it an especially strong interest in providing safe and efficient account infrastructure for the reserve management and cross-border payment needs of the global official sector. 16 The Federal Reserve’s account infrastructure for foreign official institutions performs a utility-like function for those institutions wishing to access U.S. fixed income markets and correspondent banking services in order to execute core central banking and official functions in which the safety, confidentiality, and reliability of service provision is essential.\n\nThrough the Central Bank and International Account Services area of the New York Fed, the Federal Reserve today offers banking and custody services in dollars to just under 180 foreign central banks and monetary authorities, approximately 18 international multilateral financial institutions, and a number of ministries of finance or national governments. The suite of services offered to these account holders is a basic package of dollar-denominated and gold services in three general areas: transfer and custody services for gold and fixed income securities; dollar-based payment services; and dollar-based cash management and investment services. Every day, New York Fed staff process on average hundreds of billions in transaction volumes on behalf of foreign official account holders. In total, approximately $3.6 trillion of dollar-denominated securities and cash deposits are held by foreign official account holders at the New York Fed, representing about half of the world’s official U.S. dollar reserves and one-third of the world’s total official FX reserves.\n\nReflecting the breadth of its foreign official customer base and dollar holdings, the Federal Reserve’s account platform is a centralized infrastructure through which dollar-denominated financial transactions between official institutions can occur under a single roof using the same clearing and settlement staff. This provides an important public benefit in terms of control of transactions, efficiency of execution, and confidentiality in two specific ways. First, this centralized account platform has played a critical role in the resolution of international debt crises throughout the 20th and early 21st centuries, such as the Latin American debt crises of the 1980s. Second, the centralized platform sustains a high level of operational readiness for cross-border dollar operations in support of global financial stability. By allowing direct payments between or among account holders on a shared platform, or between the Federal Reserve and account holders, the speed and efficiency of often time-critical official payments is greatly shortened and simplified. Combined with the Federal Reserve’s ownership and operation of critical payment systems such as the Fedwire Funds Service and the Fedwire Securities Service, this centralized platform supports the Federal Reserve’s crisis response capabilities in a highly dollar-based international financial system.\n\nIt should also be noted that the New York Fed’s long experience as the FOMC’s selected bank for open market operations on behalf of the Federal Reserve System confers on it a trusted level of competence, experience, and reliability with foreign official account holders. The same New York Fed front office personnel that purchase and sell Treasuries for the Federal Reserve’s own portfolio also execute trades on behalf of foreign official account holders. Moreover, the same New York Fed personnel that perform back office operations for the Federal Reserve’s own portfolio also perform back office operations for the transactions of foreign official account holders. This consolidated transactional platform used by both the Federal Reserve and its foreign official account holders means that the global official community can be assured that the quality of the services it receives from the Federal Reserve meets the same standards as the Federal Reserve sets for the servicing of its own portfolio.\n\nChoreographers of Central Bank Operations\n\nLet me now spend a moment discussing the people behind our account services. In doing so, I wish to recognize staff past and present who have played and continue to play a vital role every day in processing critical transactions on behalf of the global official community.\n\nYour experience in the daily management of the accounts of other central banks produces unique operational knowledge and expertise. Whether for time-sensitive transactions as part of the often intricate choreography of global financial stability operations or for more routine official payments, the insights developed and experiences with the policies, environments, and constraints of other central banks provide the Federal Reserve with enhanced capabilities to formulate and execute policies. The dedication, skill, and expertise of this staff transform on a daily basis the abstract principle of safe, confidential, and reliable service provision into an operational reality.\n\nSo, to the current and former staff here today, I pay tribute to your service to the global official community, to the Federal Reserve, and to the U.S. You are worthy heirs to the legacy of Benjamin Strong, Montagu Norman, and other early giants of central bank cooperation.\n\nThe Evolving Risk Environment in Cross-Border Payment Operations\n\nEven as we hold this commemoration and celebrate the legacy of central bank cooperation in this most tangible of forms, the evolving risk environment in cross-border payment operations requires us as central bankers to continually rededicate ourselves, in word and deed, to the mission of providing safe, confidential, and reliable services to each other.\n\nAs we are all no doubt aware, risks in cross-border payment operations have undergone major shifts in recent years, with cyber threats in particular emerging as one of the most critical security issues facing our community. For financial institutions, while cyber threats may have been regarded as a cost of doing business at one point, it is not an exaggeration to say that they are now viewed as potential existential threats, not just for individual firms but also for the broader financial system and critical infrastructures that support it. As central banks with broad mandates for financial stability, this is certainly a concern for us all.\n\nWe recognize the challenges and complexities in strengthening prevention, detection, and incident response regimes around fraudulent payment instructions. Users of financial messaging services such as SWIFT span the full range of IT sophistication and capacity, and remediating deficiencies in prevention and detection may require a substantial re-orientation of priorities and resources for some institutions. Overcoming these obstacles will be no easy task, but so long as there is a weak link in the cybersecurity chain criminals will seek to exploit it. As we face the common challenges of strengthening our cybersecurity defenses and payment controls, the need for cooperation is greater now than ever. The Federal Reserve stands ready to engage in further dialogue and cooperation with both its foreign official accountholders and fellow central bank service providers in addressing these challenges.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn doing so, we as a community can ensure that the provision of account services among central banks continues to bear the hallmarks of safety, confidentiality, and reliability which are essential to the execution of our public mandates.\n\nLet me conclude with some imagery from rural America.\n\nIn the traditionalist Amish communities of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Indiana known for simple living and for shunning modern technology, whenever there is a need for a new barn to be built, the Amish organize what are called barn raisings. In a barn raising, the community comes together to assist in building their neighbors' barns, with the understanding that the favor is eventually returned to other members of the community. The barn raising is a showcase of Amish planning, organization, and manual labor and serves as a practical linchpin of the agriculturally-rooted Amish society. However, while the barn raising fulfills a practical need, it also serves to tie the Amish community together by reinforcing Amish society through a very visible expression of the principle of mutual aid.17\n\nIn this 100th anniversary year of the first dollar account openings for foreign central banks by the Federal Reserve System of the United States, I can think of no more moving metaphor than this for the benefits that flow from central bank cooperation through the reciprocal provision of account services. Let us work together to preserve it.\n\nThank you for listening."

        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/sti171207",
        "content": "Good morning everyone.\n\nThank you for joining us at the New York Fed today and for your ongoing participation in the important discussion around culture and ethics in the financial services sector. This workshop and discussion are a critical part of our ongoing collective efforts on promoting financial industry culture reform. Business schools serve as a major supply source of the talent pool for mid-level management positions in the industry. This relationship makes aligning business education curricula and pedagogy with demands around improving industry culture a mutually beneficial strategy.\n\nWhile your conversation today has focused on the role of academia and industry, I want to take this opportunity to share with you how I’ve been thinking about the role of bank supervisors in the culture reform dialogue. I am the head of the Supervision Group of New York Fed, but my perspective and approach are influenced by my background and training as an economist. You’ll hear me talk about frictions and market failures; about production processes and intangible capital; and the conceptual rationale for a role for the official sector.\n\nThere are, of course, multiple ways to consider the relationship between culture and bank supervision. I hope my remarks, which are based on a whitepaper we published earlier today, will offer a complementary perspective to the type of work already underway by other supervisors and regulators, including the UK regulators (FCA and PRA), the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), DeNederlandsche Bank (DNB), the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), and other institutions like the Financial Stability Board and the Group of Thirty (G30). I am focusing my remarks today specifically on “misconduct risk,” but the conceptual arguments and framework apply more broadly to financial sector risk management in general.\n\nPlease note that the views I express today are my own and they do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nMisconduct Risk\n\nA primary goal of bank regulators and supervisors is to support the sustained provision of financial services to households and businesses in a fair and transparent way. In order to do this, we examine financial institutions, individually and collectively. We assess safety and soundness to ensure firms have the appropriate risk identification and risk management processes for prudent banking. We hold them to standards that require them to be resilient to a broad range of potential risks such as credit, market, liquidity, and operational risk.\n\nOne specific risk is employee “misconduct risk.” We define this as the potential for behaviors or business practices that are illegal, unethical, or contrary to a firm’s stated values, policies, and procedures. The impact of employee misconduct extends beyond the individual and can impact the firm as a whole, as well as the economy and financial markets more broadly. That is, misconduct risk has both prudential and financial stability implications.\n\nFor a firm, employee misconduct can make it less resilient by diverting management attention, by harming the firm’s reputation in a way that impedes its business, by driving adverse change in the composition of the workforce, or by depleting its capital through losses or fines. Since 2008, for example, firms have paid, in aggregate, in excess of $320 billion in fines related to misconduct.2\n\nFor the broader economy and financial markets, misconduct can inflict harm directly on consumers and employees. In addition, over time, market participants may lose confidence in the financial sector as a whole and adversely impact the sector’s critical role in financial intermediation. In 2016, for example, Gallup found that confidence in the financial sector had fallen by half over the previous decade.3\n\nThese incidents of misconduct can introduce frictions and raise the cost of financial intermediation, which in turn, reduces the flow of productive financial services. These sorts of external effects that spill over to other firms, consumers, and businesses are a critical rationale for official sector intervention related to employee misconduct.\n\nIn the U.S., official sector concern with the damage inflicted by employee misconduct dates back to the Banking Act of 1933.4 More recently, supervisors have traditionally addressed firm’s management of misconduct risk by assessing the effectiveness of firms’ risk management and internal control functions, such as compliance and audit. Yet, despite regulations, supervisory focus, and firms’ own efforts, significant misconduct risk and bad outcomes continue. Why? What explains this persistence?\n\nOne hypothesis is that recent problems are just a stream of idiosyncratic events, random draws of “bad apples.” Another hypothesis is that some firms have operational weaknesses, “bad processes,” that allow these outcomes to occur. I don’t believe, however, that either of these hypotheses tells the whole story.\n\nRoot cause analyses of many recent cases of misconduct in the financial sector suggest that misconduct is not just the product of a few individuals or bad processes, but rather the result of wider organizational breakdowns, enabled by a firm’s culture. From both a prudential perspective and a financial stability perspective, misconduct risk threatens our core supervisory objective to sustain the efficient provision of financial services to the economy. This suggests that supervisors have an obligation to promote strong internal practices and behaviors that mitigate misconduct risk and create a healthy culture.\n\nMisconduct Risk and Cultural Capital\n\nOne way to think about this is “cultural capital.”5 A firm’s cultural capital is a type of asset that impacts what a firm produces and how it operates. It is analogous to physical capital, like equipment, buildings and property, or to human capital, like the accumulated knowledge and skills of workers,6 or reputational capital, like the franchise value or brand recognition.7 Cultural capital is an input into a firm’s production process—impacting how it does its business.\n\nCultural capital is an intangible asset. That is, we generally experience the impact rather than the thing itself—but its impact can be measured, assessed, and ultimately influenced. For example, in an organization with a high level of cultural capital, misconduct risk is low and observed structures, processes, formal incentives, and desired business outcomes are consistent with the firm’s stated values. The unspoken patterns of behavior reinforce this alignment. Problems are escalated to senior managers routinely, as employees feel empowered to raise their hand and believe that their efforts will result in meaningful responses. And senior leaders advance through the organization because, in addition to strong business performance, they set a credible tone from above by modeling behaviors consistent with the firm’s values.\n\nBy contrast, consider some characteristics of an organization with low levels of cultural capital. In these firms, formal policies and procedures do not reflect “the way things are really done.” The stated values of the organization are not reflected in senior leader behaviors and actions of the organization’s members, and misconduct results from norms and pressures that drive individuals to make decisions that are not aligned with the values, business strategies, and risk appetite set by the board and senior leaders. Employees do not speak freely when they have concerns, and senior managers or the board of directors do not find out about improper conduct until it is uncovered by the authorities. Rules may be followed to the letter, but not in spirit. All of this increases misconduct risk and potentially damages the firm and the industry over time.\n\nLike other forms of tangible and intangible capital, firms must invest or its capital will deteriorate over time and adversely impact the firm’s productive capacity. To be clear, cultural capital is not loss absorbing like equity capital, but it can be loss preventing by influencing decisions, behaviors, and outcomes over time.\n\nMarket Failures and Misconduct Risk\n\nIf this is the case and misconduct risk is bad for the firm, some obvious questions follow: Why don’t firms invest in cultural capital and reduce the risk themselves? Why do regulators and supervisors need to get involved?\n\nI believe firms are ultimately responsible for these decisions and we do observe progress. Many large financial firms have increased their attention to misconduct risk and cultural drivers in the wake of serious frauds and enforcement actions over the past several years. But, the degree of commitment and progress in these efforts has not been even across the industry and serious or persistent misconduct continues in some firms.\n\nSo, why wouldn’t a firm do more? One can turn to traditional economic theory to offer an explanation for why a firm might underinvest in cultural capital. Firms may operate with levels of cultural capital beneath both the social optimum and even the private optimum due to different types of market failures. Today I will consider three well-known phenomenon—externalities, principal-agent problems, and adverse selection—that may explain why misconduct risk persists and why firms might underinvest in cultural capital relative to what might be socially optimal.\n\nExternalities\n\nExternalities are the impact that one actor has on other, unrelated actors. Externalities can drive a wedge between private and socially optimally outcomes and, from a supervisors’ perspective, lead firms to underinvest in their own resiliency by ignoring the broader impact of bad outcomes on the financial sector and the real economy.\n\nIn other contexts like environmental policy, externalities such as pollution motivate government intervention. In banking regulation, externalities are the conceptual driver behind the enhanced prudential standards for capital, liquidity, and risk management that are currently applied to the largest, most systemically important financial institutions.8\n\nPrincipal-agent problems\n\nPrincipal-agent problems reflect incentives for employees to act in ways that don’t align with the broader interests of management or shareholders. This can lead to excessive risk-taking, underinvestment in risk-reduction and risk-control mechanisms, and a focus on short-term returns at the cost of long-run viability. Think about the trader who is compensated on short-term P&L and not long-term value creation.\n\nThese issues can be amplified by the opacity intrinsic to many financial activities that allows misconduct to persist and erodes the cultural capital of the firm.\n\nAdverse selection\n\nAdverse selection occurs when those particularly ill-suited for something are the most likely to participate. This could be a complicating factor in this context if conduct-related events change the composition of a firm’s workforce. Firms with relatively low cultural capital (and a relatively high tolerance of misconduct risk) may attract and retain employees and clients more inclined to take inappropriate risks and push beyond internal limits and controls. Further, high-quality directors, executives, and employees might leave such firms or decline to join them, depleting the firm’s human capital and contributing to the deterioration of cultural capital.\n\nRole of the Official Sector\n\nThese are some of the types of market failures that may explain why a firm might not invest enough in its cultural capital to mitigate risks, including misconduct risk. And they suggest a role for the official sector to encourage resiliency, including investment in cultural capital, beyond what the firm would choose to do on its own. That is, if firms don’t have sufficient incentives to overcome these forces, then the official sector should push toward a better outcome.\n\nIn the case of misconduct risk, supervision seems like a particularly appropriate approach because the hard-to-define and evolving nature of behavior likely prevents easy regulatory solutions.9 Though some rule-writing could help re-align incentives, misconduct risk can take many different forms and, by its nature, seek to circumvent the rules.\n\nEssential drivers of culture and of misconduct risk, for example, relate to leadership and “tone from above,” areas that are inherently behavioral and qualitative in nature. Supervisors can assess behaviors in an ongoing manner and help to identify potential risks.10\n\nI’ll note that the need for a supervisory focus on employee misconduct and its underlying drivers dates back one and a half centuries to the origins of bank supervision. Then, in the U.S., the emphasis was on the “responsibility and integrity” of bank managers and directors and its relationship “to public confidence.”11 Part of the role of supervisors is to close gaps in the rules to advance safe and sound banking practices that support the sustained provision of financial services. Issues like misconduct risk and culture likely fall in these gaps because they involve the attitudes, norms, and behaviors and suggest a critical role for supervisors in addressing these risks.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude, misconduct risk poses clear threats to both prudential and financial stability objectives. The work supervisors do to address misconduct challenges is critical because there are limits to the regulatory or deterrence and enforcement approach. To understand how a firm manages misconduct risk and to improve resiliency and reduce the potential for unwanted disruptions to financial intermediation, we must increase our focus on firms’ decision-making practices and behaviors as a core aspect of good governance. We can draw from the growing literature about the root causes of misconduct and the underlying factors that drive unhealthy cultures to support this goal.\n\nHowever, as I am sure you already appreciate, addressing culture reform across an entire industry is a complex challenge and there is no one action or approach that will fully address it. We all must be willing to work at this from our various vantage points, as supervisors, as academics, and as industry participants. As you reflect on the conversations you have had today, the points that were raised, and the potential paths forward, I encourage you to consider the important role you each play and the potential impact we, collectively, can have by working together toward the ultimate goal of ensuring a safe and sound financial system that supports economic growth and stability."

        "title": "Opening Remarks on Higher Education: Financing, Costs, and Returns",
        "date": "Dec 7, 2017",
        "speaker": "William C. Dudley",
        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/dud171207",
        "content": "Good morning.  It is my pleasure to welcome you to the New York Fed for today’s conference on the costs and returns of higher education and higher education financing.  I am delighted to see such broad interest and attention from the academic community on this topic.  The role of education and education financing in today’s labor market and economy has never been more important.  It is a topic that I have spoken about frequently during my tenure here at the New York Fed, especially with regard to education’s importance for economic mobility.  Understanding educational investment decisions and their macroeconomic implications requires rigorous analysis from top academic researchers like you.  Let me briefly discuss some developments that I find particularly significant and worthy of investigation.  As always, what I say represents my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nAs has been well documented by Raj Chetty and his co-authors, income inequality has increased in recent decades, while economic mobility has stagnated.  Meanwhile, absolute mobility appears to have fallen, indicated by the declining share of children who earn more than their parents.  The combination of high inequality and low mobility is problematic, because it means that being born into a low-income family is more consequential today than in the past.  Since education is a key determinant of upward mobility, one way to increase economic mobility in the United States would be to increase overall post-secondary educational attainment.  There are, however, a number of important barriers to achieving that goal.\n\nFirst, many high school students and their parents appear to lack accurate information about the returns obtained from a college education.  New York Fed research shows evidence of systematic underestimation of the average benefits—and overestimation of costs—of a college education, with larger biases among lower-income and non-college households.  Research by Caroline Hoxby and Sarah Turner shows that among low-income high school students, even very high achievers are poorly informed about the academic options that are available and their effects on career opportunities.  This research finds that the provision of relevant information can lead to markedly better outcomes.\n\nA second impediment is the lack of preparedness among new college entrants, with large numbers of those students needing remedial courses that earn no college credit.  Low readiness contributes to persistently low college completion rates, especially among lower-income, part-time, and nontraditional students.  Higher dropout rates, in turn, contribute to a substantial reduction in the net expected and realized returns from college attendance.\n\nThe third major barrier to college attendance and completion is the rise in the cost of a college education.  While a college education is generally a good investment, the cost of attending a four-year college has risen considerably faster than wages over the last several decades.  This means that college has become increasingly unaffordable—which can act as a drag on economic mobility and the growth of a college-educated workforce, and by extension, on productivity growth and living standards.\n\nAs has been well documented by my New York Fed colleagues, many young Americans have adjusted to rising tuition and fees by taking on more debt.  This trend highlights the importance of the federal student loan program, which has helped mitigate the impact of the shift in financing of higher education from state and local funding to students and their families over the past few decades.  However, the end result is that more students leave college with significantly higher amounts of debt.  Student loan debt has more than tripled over the past two decades and now totals over $1.4 trillion.\n\nIt is important to consider what these changes in financing higher education mean for economic mobility.  First, New York Fed researchers have documented that a large percentage of student borrowers—especially those who attend less selective colleges or drop out—have trouble staying current on their loans, and often become delinquent and default on their debt.  We also know that these factors—slow repayment, delinquency, and default—are most prevalent among those from more modest family circumstances.  In addition, there is evidence that student debt acts as a drag on homeownership.  Specifically, our research indicates that when college tuition rises in a state, it leads to higher levels of student debt and a lower homeownership rate.  These factors matter for inequality and social mobility, because increasing home equity is the major form of wealth accumulation for the great majority of American families.  Thus, rising tuition and changes in the way that college is financed appear to have diminished the ability of higher education to lift people from poverty into the middle class.\n\nOf course, students’ reliance on debt and the returns from graduating vary across educational institutions.  Of particular interest here is recent work by Raj Chetty and his co-authors showing that some colleges—some of which can be found in the CUNY and California state systems—appear to be much better at fostering economic mobility than others.  In other words, they accept relatively large numbers of lower-income students while also producing large numbers of high earners, which means that these institutions facilitate considerable upward mobility.  Learning exactly how they do it and how it can be replicated strikes me as a first-order question for further study.  Recent research by Caroline Hoxby to assess differences in productivity across educational institutions makes important progress in that direction.\n\nIn summary, academic research on the financing, costs, and returns of higher education is more important now than it has ever been.  We are pleased to have many of those researchers participating in this conference. I would like to thank Raji Chakrabarti and Wilbert van der Klaauw and the New York Fed’s Research Group for organizing this timely conference, and for bringing together this superb group of scholars.  Thank you all for your participation.  I wish you a very productive and enjoyable conference."

        "content": "Eugene White:\n\nDr. Dudley is going to first give some general comments about the regional economy, and then we're going to move over here for a fireside chat to talk using some pre-prepared questions, and then from the audience.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nGreat to be here. My wife is a graduate of at the school and she sends her regards. She's the Chair of the Douglass investment fund, so she's actually involved with the college on an ongoing basis. It's also great to see Christine Cumming, whom I worked very closely with at the Fed. She was the First Vice President of the Fed, and is now on the faculty here. So, glad to see you here, Chris, as well.\n\nI thought I'd just talk a little bit about what we're doing on these kind of roadshows. Like, why do we do this? And talk a little bit about the regional economic outlook. The New York Fed—the Second District of the Federal Reserve, it's New York's Fed district, and it consists of New York State, Fairfield County, Connecticut, Northern New Jersey, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. And we think it's important that in terms of how we interact with our community, to actually go out into the community and find out what's really going on. It's one thing to look at economics, statistics, and data, but it's also very valuable to actually hear from people in terms of what are they experiencing in terms of the economy. What's happening to the labor market, what's happening to job availability, what's happening to the housing market. We learned a lot during the financial crisis about the difficulties people were having with maintaining their mortgages, staying current on their mortgages.\n\nSo, you get that information by reaching out into the community. I basically go out on four road trips a year throughout the district. So this is the fourth one for Northern New Jersey. We're going down to Puerto Rico which has been devastated by the hurricanes, in a couple of months. That’ll be the next one. It's been very valuable for me in terms of really understanding what's going on, on the ground.\n\nSo, basically is important. It informs how we think about the appropriate course of monetary policy. It's one thing to look at economic statistics, it's another thing to hear from real people on how the economy is actually affecting them on a day-to-day basis.\n\nThe second thing we do on these trips is we're really trying to understand what we can help bring to the community in terms of our own outreach efforts. We have a function in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York which is Outreach & Education, and we like to use that to try to actually help the communities that are in our district.\n\nSome of the ways that we do that, for example, is we recently ran a small business forum in New Brunswick about how small businesses can gain access to capital. In the wake of Superstorm Sandy, we actually had a set of workshops in New York about how could people actually navigate through the various aid programs and help people recover from the hurricane.\n\nWe also publish a lot of economic data that is actually helpful to the policymakers locally. So we do a small business survey for the region. We're also now starting to compile a lot of micro-data at the local level, so you'll actually sort of see how is it one day we're doing well and another day we're not very far away from doing much more poorly. And that actually helps policymakers make better decisions about how they can actually help their local community.\n\nAnd the last thing we do is I think we have a pretty strong ability to convene people. If we say something is important, a lot of people will sort of take this pretty seriously. And so if we can have various stakeholders come in—people from the education communities, from government, from private businesses, from community development groups—and have conversations about real issues, which I think actually pushes the ball forward in terms of making progress on tackling some of the tough public policy issues we face.\n\nOne of the things that I’m very focused on is income mobility. I think people they get in the United States, there's the American Dream, the idea that you can start from the bottom, work hard, and make your way up. But the fact is, income mobility in the United States isn't really good. And that's really something that we need to work on. That's why places like Rutgers are so important because it's really the educational communities that essentially give people that leg up. So, for example, Milton Friedman has a story, I thought was a very interesting one. His parents didn't go to college. Just like my wife Ann. Her parents didn't go to college, and so she came to Rutgers. Her family thought she should go to the local community college, and she said no, I'm going to go to Rutgers, I'm going to go to a four-year college.\n\nSo I think what happens in the educational communities in our region are really, really important in terms of giving people the job skills and that head start so they can actually make a success of themselves throughout their career. That's the one thing in the Second District, where we really have a comparative advantage, the number of really high quality educational institutions in the Second District is really without parallel.\n\nI mean, the only district that could even sort of, maybe slightly compete with us, might be the Boston Federal Reserve’s district. Having those educational communities work closely with business, I think is also important. So that's something else we very much stress. We want to have people graduate with the skills that businesses actually need so that those people can actually get jobs quite easily.\n\nSo that's really sort of the purpose of why we go on these road trips. Also we can give our views about the economy. So Eugene’s going to ask me a lot of questions, which I'll answer. I'm sure we'll cover not just the local economy but we'll also talk about the national economic outlook and things of that nature.\n\nEugene White:\n\nWe're going to have a fireside chat here. We're going to move over here.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nI'm looking for the fire.\n\nEugene White:\n\nI don't think in these buildings they allow you to light anything. Except maybe intellectual discussion. So, I've had a series of questions handed to me by faculty and graduate students and undergraduates to ask you.\n\nSo, one question which is submitted was a quote from Charles Steindel, the former Chief Economist for Chris Christie, who used to also work at the Fed. And he said that the New Jersey economy consistently grows at a 0.5 to 1% slower than the national economy. This has been going on for a half century or more. Given this regional divergence, how do regional considerations figure into the Fed's policy decisions?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, clearly, we set monetary policy for the nation as a whole. So some regions are doing better, some regions are doing less well. And we take all that in consideration in terms of monetary policy. We can't set monetary policy differentially. You can't have one monetary policy for New Jersey, another one for New York City, another one for upstate New York.\n\nSo, we have to understand that monetary policy is going to be set for the country as a whole. But the way the Federal Reserve is constructed, you have these 12 Federal Reserve Bank presidents, and they can very much come to the FOMC meetings and reflect what's going on in their regions. So the regional views and what's happening in the various regions do get very reflected in those monetary policy discussions and the decision-making.\n\nNow in terms of New Jersey, growing a little bit more slowly than the national average, I think that's part of a much broader story, which is the migration of people from the Northeast and Midwest to the South and West that's been going on for 30 years. Population growth in New Jersey is well below the national average, and that's really probably the primary driver of the fact that the growth rate in New Jersey is going to be a little bit weaker than the country as a whole.\n\nEugene White:\n\nOne of the things I think in terms of the Fed that people aren't aware, they might think that this is all self-chosen by bankers, and so forth. But really the Board of Directors is a very diverse group, right?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nYes, it is a very diverse group, and in fact, the bankers—so the Federal Reserve Act sets a mandate of we have to have a board of directors, and the board of directors consists of three groups. There's the Class A directors, which are the bankers—three of them. There's the Class B directors that are supposed to represent commerce. And the Class C directors that represent I think the community sort of broadly. The Class A directors, the bankers, they have no part in the selection process for the President of the Federal Reserve banks, which I think is a good thing. So, it makes it very clear that we're here to represent Main Street, not represent Wall Street.\n\nI've announced that I'm going to be stepping down sometime late spring, early summer. So we have a search committee composed of four members of the Board of Directors, excluding the bank directors, and they begin the process of a search for my successor.\n\nEugene White:\n\nSo, yesterday, bitcoin topped $10,000. How does the use of digital currencies impact monetary policy, and should the Fed play a greater role in adopting digital currencies to the payment system?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nRight now, bitcoin is tiny relative to the amount of payment transactions that are executed in the United States. It's essentially trivial in the broad scheme of things. But there are some aspects of bitcoin that are quite interesting. So like the ledger, you know, blockchain ledger technology is something that we think actually could be used in other applications.\n\nI think at this point it's really very premature to be talking about the Federal Reserve offering digital currencies, but it is something we are starting to think about. So, what would it mean to have a digital currency? How would we offer it? Do we actually need it? I think that in terms of bitcoin, I would be pretty cautionary about it. I think that it's not a stable store of value. It doesn't really have the characteristics you would like to have of a currency or a payment medium. It's not a stable store of value. The price goes up and down very sharply. And it's not legal tender. So someone doesn't actually have to accept bitcoin for your transaction. If I go in the store with dollars, or currencies, people actually have to accept my currency and make that transaction. So, I think that I would be, at this point, pretty skeptical of bitcoin. I think it's really more of a speculative activity at this point.\n\nEugene White:\n\nAlthough some central banks have moved ahead of the digital front. Sweden, for example, pushing very hard.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nYes, Sweden is an interesting case. Sweden, the use of cash is much less than in the United States, so that makes digital currency more easy to migrate to. Also more people are participating in the banking system. One of the challenges for the U.S. to move to a digital currency that a central bank offered is a lot of people are not really actually plugged into the banking system.\n\nSo, you'd have to have a system in place that actually brings those people that are currently unbanked into the financial system. To really have an effective digital currency in the U.S., we have to overcome that challenge.\n\nEugene White:\n\nYou mentioned about the income distribution. We know that in the U.S. that income distribution, we've had vast growth but it hasn't benefited everyone. Is there anything in monetary or perhaps banking policy that the Fed could do to perhaps improve the performance?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, monetary policy is a pretty blunt tool in terms of its ability to affect income distribution. But there are parts of banking regulation that do relate to income distribution, the Community Reinvestment Act basically says that you have to actually supply credit to disadvantaged neighborhoods. You can't discriminate based on location. So there are things in banking regulation that can actually help make sure that credit is flowing freely to areas that maybe otherwise would not get those funds.\n\nI think that the issue of income distribution, income mobility, I don't think we can do much directly in terms of our policy tools, in terms of monetary policy. But I think we can do a lot from the bully pulpit, basically put attention on this issue, underscore how important it is, and talk about things that we can do address it. Educational opportunity, workforce development, job retraining, the ability to actually have the ability to move from the inner city to where the jobs are. Because a lot of times we see, when we're traveling around the region, we see people in the inner cities actually can't literally get to where the jobs are because there's not appropriate transportation networks.\n\nChildcare is another issue. People have trouble holding down a job if they have a young child. Who's going to take care of their child during the day? And how do the economics of that work, if they're not making a very good salary? So I think there's a lot of issues. I think it's really an important issue for us to solve as the country because if you don't have a sense that wherever you're born, you have sort of a roughly similar opportunity to succeed based on your work effort, you don't really have a fair country, in some fundamental sense.\n\nRaj Chetty is a researcher who's done some terrific work on this issue and the work that he's done basically shows that where you're born, where you live geographically affects your future prospects. That is really quite disturbing. That means it's not about the person, it's about literally the luck of the draw of where they were born and raised. And so that shows that we have a lot of work to do on this front.\n\nEugene White:\n\nAnd in fact, mobility in the U.S. has actually declined. Interstate mobility has declined significantly.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nExactly.\n\nEugene White:\n\nLet me ask you a question, which is more about something which is within the Fed's compass of authority. What do you think the biggest risks to financial stability currently are, and where the next crisis—well, hard to ask the question—where the next crisis might originate? But suppose there were another failure on the order of Lehman Brothers. Are you concerned about the limitations that have been imposed on the Fed in terms of emergency lending?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nLet's have first with the issue of financial stability, how worried am I about it today? It's true that financial markets are pretty buoyant, and so that's raised the question, how concerned should we be about that? I would say at this point, I would say not that concerned, and the reason for that is that the markets I think really reflect the state of the economy. The economy's doing very well, it's been very stable. The economy has been growing 2, 2.5% a year consistently.\n\nWe're at a very low unemployment rate, 4.1%, and it looks like the expansion has got lots of room to go. There are not a lot of excesses in the economy. The credit growth is growing only slowly. Households seem to be in good shape, businesses are starting to ramp up their investment.\n\nSo, it seems to me like we actually have a very good prospects for this expansion to continue for quite some time. So, the financial markets in my mind sort of reflect that. If the financial markets were behaving in a way totally disjointed from how the economy is performing, I'd be a lot more worried.\n\nThe second reason I'm not so worried is that I think the banking system and the financial system is a lot more robust to stress today than it was 10 years ago. So banks have a lot more capital and have a lot more liquidity. There's a lot less leverage in the system. There's a lot less maturity transformation where people are borrowing short and lending long. And so that means even if markets were to go down, if the market prices were to go down, I think the financial system could bear that stress much, much better today than 10 years ago.\n\nThe issue that I'm actually a little bit worried about that no one else seems to be worried about is really the issue of fiscal sustainability. The budget deficit last year was 3.5% of GDP. In 2007, the budget deficit was 1.1% of GDP roughly at the same point in the economic cycle. So we're pretty deep into this economic cycle, and we still have a sizeable budget deficit, and we have a baby boom generation that's just about to retire, driving up costs for Medicare and Social Security.\n\nOn top of that, interest rates, the Federal Reserve is gradually normalizing interest rates, raising interest rates. So debt service costs, which have been very, very subdued due to the low level of interest rates over the last 10 years, those are also going to be going up. I'm a little surprised that financial markets aren't at all concerned about the sustainability of our fiscal position. I think that's something that people should be more focused on.\n\nEugene White:\n\nSince you brought up fiscal questions, I have to ask, since we have a tax package going through, and there's a partial rollback with the mortgage interest deduction, do you think that would have any effect perhaps on booming house prices? If that was rolled back?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI think to the extent that—in terms of the provisions that I see in the two tax bills in the House and the Senate, there could be some downward pressure on high-end housing, but the mortgage interest deductibility I think is going to be retained for about half a million dollars. So that means that for most homes, in most areas, I don't think that you're going to have a big consequence.\n\nI would hesitate to say, get too concerned about the fact that very high-end houses could go down in price a little bit. I think the economy can manage that just fine.\n\nEugene White:\n\nI know you have a busy schedule, but I'd like to take a few questions from the audience, if that's all right?\n\nAudience Member:\n\nI was really struck that after a report by the U.S. Treasury in June about financial reform for depository institutions, which really started out with the idea that the principle elements of Dodd-Frank and Basel III, et cetera, should probably stay in place? That both Chair Yellen and you have given very important speeches that have talked about the importance of preserving that basic structure.\n\nAre there particular things that concern you in the environment that led both you and the Chair to speak about this?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I think the concern on my part, and I think Chair Yellen can of course speak for herself, is that if you open up the Dodd-Frank Act, make sure you don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.\n\nThere's elements of the Act that I think are very, very important in making the financial system more strong and stable and resilient. Capital and liquidity for banks, especially large systemically important banks, the ability to have a resolution regime in place where you can actually liquidate a large financial institution that gets under stress; the ability to clear derivatives centrally through central counterparties, and make sure that you can actually then have the ability to examine those central counterparties, and make sure that they're well-run and operated.\n\nSo, as long as you keep those major pieces in place, then I think you can make some minor adjustments to the Dodd-Frank Act. Things that I've talked about and I think other people at the Fed have talked about these same things is relief for smaller banking institutions because smaller banks, if they fail, it's not going to be systemic, it's not going to threaten the viability of the financial system.\n\nThe Volcker Rule probably could be implemented in a way that is less burdensome to banks, and maybe gives banks and securities firms a little bit more flexibility to intervene when prices go up sharply or down sharply, which is what you actually want them to do in financial markets.\n\nI think the news that we've seen in terms of financial reform actually seems to be pretty positive. It's really more of about doing some changes at the margins as opposed to wholesale changes that would really dismantle Dodd-Frank.\n\nI think we really do remember the financial crisis, still, thank God. It was the worst financial crisis that we've had since the Great Depression. The unemployment rate soared, millions of people lost their homes. That's why we got the Dodd-Frank Act. We just have to remember that we need to have a financial system that's strong and resilient, and that the Dodd-Frank Act helps us achieve that goal.\n\nEugene White:\n\nQuestions? Yes?\n\nAudience Member:\nYes, I want to know how did working for Goldman Sachs impact your outlook as the President?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI don't think it was the fact that I sort of worked for an investment bank that was important. I think it was more important what I did in the investment bank. I was in the economic research department, and I was basically someone who basically supported the trading functions of the bank. And that was valuable to me when I came to the Fed because it allowed me to learn a lot about how markets actually work, how markets actually function.\n\nAnd we got deep into the financial crisis. What we saw is the financial markets started to not work well. People lost confidence, they lost trust. They started to disengage, and so my experience at Goldman Sachs, I think, actually helped me understand what was going wrong and then maybe how to address it.\n\nSo, in the fall of 2008, we introduced a number of very special liquidity facilities, things that we'd never done before, and I think my experience at Goldman and my understanding of how markets work, and my ability to reach out to people that I knew in the marketplace to talk to them, like what's going on?, and understand what they were saying to me, probably helped me.\n\nYou want to have—we're having a lot of transition at the Federal Reserve right now, and people ask me the question of, “What do you want with the Fed?” I think you want diversity. Diversity, I'm not just talking about diversity of gender and ethnicity but I'm also talking about diversity of background. So you don't want everyone to be a PhD economist from academia. You don't want everyone to be a markets person from Goldman Sachs. You want to have a mix because those different perspectives, when blended together, can lead to better policy outcomes.\n\nEugene White:\n\nSomeone else? This is a quiet audience. Yes?\n\nAudience Member:\nI had a question. You mentioned that you wanted diversity, both through academics and bankers. The new Fed Chairman-elect Jerome Powell, he doesn’t have an academic background. He's more of a Wall Street kind of guy. Do you think that's going to have an impact on his term looking at the Fed?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI think Jay's going to do very well. The thing that you really want I think as a Fed Chair—I don't think an Economic PhD is required. There are plenty of PhD economists within the Federal Reserve system. The Chair does not have to have a PhD in Economics.\n\nWhat you want is someone who's smart—which he is. You want someone who actually works hard—which he does. And you want someone who's not an ideologue. And the reason why I say not an ideologue, because you don't want people to think that they're so convinced that they know how the world works, that they ignore the evidence that contradicts that. And Jay is not an ideologue. So I think he's a fine choice to lead the Fed. I'm not concerned about it in the least.\n\nEugene White:\n\nOne more question, or two more? Certainly, yes?\n\nAudience Member:\nYou mentioned a lot of things to address income mobility, but I'm wondering where you see the role of community banks going forward? Back in the day, they were very important. But now we have a sort of new different kind of large bank system. Do you see community banks still playing a role in that mobility?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI think community banks play a hugely important role. We basically still have about 7,000 banks in the United States. And only about five or six of them are really, really large.\n\nSo, community banks play a unique role because I think they basically are much closer to their customers than large banks are. And so they play a particularly important role in local communities in terms of supplying credit to small businesses and to other customers where they know more about the customer. And so they can actually make more nuanced credit-lending decisions.\n\nSo, I think they're really important. They also play a very important role in community, in supporting the community. So, I'm a big fan of community banks. I mean my great-grandfather was a community banker, actually, in Sylvania, Ohio.\n\nI remember when I was young, I got shown his bank book during the Great Depression, and the bank book had a lot of debits, and these were debits where he was basically putting money into the bank to keep the bank alive during the Great Depression, and the bank did actually make it through the Great Depression.\n\nAnd so I'm very much a supporter of community banks. I think they perform a very important role. Which is why we want to have a regulatory regime that suits, not just the big banks, but also is appropriate for the small banks. We need to have a regulatory regime that's proportioned to the risks that the institution poses to the financial system and the role that the institutions play supplying credit, especially to small businesses and households where I think community banks play a very particularly important role.\n\nEugene White:\n\nWe have time for one more question?\n\nAudience Member:\nTo follow up on that then, could you comment on the role of fintech lenders vis-a-vis community banks?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, fintech lending I think is still very much in its early days, early stages. This is like peer-to-peer lending. I think it's something that we are following quite closely. I think there's a couple of questions about it. One is how will it actually perform through the business cycle?\n\nSo, today, it's performing okay—that doesn't really tell us that much because economic times are relatively good. So the real question is how it's going to perform through the business cycle. And the second question I think is going to be about regulation. Are there regulations that need to be put in place to make sure that they're on an equivalent playing field to lenders that are subject to bank regulations.\n\nSo, I think those are sort of the two questions on the table. I think we want to be careful not to just tamp down any innovation. I think we need to be open-minded to new innovations and developments that we see in the marketplace, but at the same time we don't want to necessarily sort of buy into them hook, line and sinker until we've actually seen that the business models are robust to the entire business cycle.\n\nEugene White:\n\nWell, thank you very much!\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nYes, thank you."

        "content": "Carla Hesse:\n\nIt’s wonderful to see a sea of blue in this beautiful space here, and to be here for such a wonderful occasion. When we planned this event, I didn’t think we realized we’d be in such an exciting moment, but I couldn’t be more thrilled to be here to have a conversation with Bill Dudley, who graduated from Cal with his Ph.D. in 1982.\n\nI want to mention that he got an undergraduate degree from a very small liberal arts college, and that’s meaningful because I think that the depth of having a liberal arts education underneath a very specialized advanced degree really helps people go to the distance in life, and to show the kind of leadership that Bill’s career has exemplified.\n\nAt Berkeley, he studied with Professor James Pierce, who was a beloved professor, and who I didn’t realize until tonight had launched him at the Fed for his first job, having gotten his Ph.D. He then went on to Goldman Sachs and then back to the Fed eventually, in 2009, where he succeeded Tim Geithner. And has been there until now, and now we’re in a very exciting moment of wondering where he’s going next.\n\nSo I’d like to invite him up here and ask him a few questions, and then we’re going to be sure to leave some time so that you can have at him too, because I’m sure he has thoughts that you’re curious to hear his views on.\n\nI thought we’d just start with the elephant in the room. How disruptive do you think this transition event is going to be?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI don’t think it’s going to be disruptive. A couple of things I guess I would point out. First of all, so far so good. I mean the quality of the appointments has been excellent. Jay Powell is a really capable, good pair of hands. I think Janet’s done a fabulous job, but if it wasn’t going to be Janet, Jay’s a really, really good choice to be the Chair of the Fed. And Randy Quarles, who has been appointed to be the Vice Chair of Supervision, is also extremely well qualified for his position. So, if things stay in that sort of vein, everything’s going to be really great.\n\nThe second thing I would say is that it’s a committee. When you think about monetary policy, you are really talking about, if you have a full complement, 19 participants on the Federal Open Market Committee. So it’s also important to recognize that changing out one or two people like me isn’t going to change what the committee thinks, because it is truly developing a consensus among the committee members that I think is important in terms of driving policy.\n\nAnother aspect of this is that the committee really is very united right now in terms of what the appropriate policy path is. So if you look at this summer when we announced that we’re going to go and start to normalize the balance sheet, every participant on the FOMC subscribed to the principles of how to normalize the balance sheet over time. There weren’t any dissents.\n\nSo you change out a few people, but I think the committee is really going to stay together.\n\nThe last thing I would just say—two final things I would say on that point. One thing I think is really important is that the Fed’s mission doesn’t change. We have a mandate from Congress: maximum sustainable employment and price stability. So, whoever you are and whatever background you come from, when you come to the Board of Governors or you become a president of one of the Federal Reserve Banks and then serve on the FOMC, your mission is to try to achieve those dual-mandate objectives. It’s not like you can just go off and do something totally different. That mandate doesn’t change.\n\nAnd then finally, it’s not just about the principals. People put so much focus on the Chair and the Vice Chair. The Federal Reserve has thousands of really qualified professionals working every day to help make the people at the top well informed and to help in their decision-making. And all those people are still going to be there, they’re still going to be working really hard.\n\nSo I think people—when you watch the movie “Too Big To Fail,” there’s no staff in the movie. There’s the Bernanke character, the Geithner character, the Paulson character around a table. That is not how policy is made. There’s just hundreds of people involved in thinking about what’s happening in the economy, what’s happening in financial markets. Thinking about various options of how you might respond. And that’s also true in the monetary policy realm.\n\nThe staff is still going to be there, they’re still highly qualified and very much committed to the mission. So, I’m really not worried at all.\n\nCarla Hesse:\n\nThat’s great. We’re all happy to hear that, I’m sure. So, what I thought we’d do is start with some broad questions, and then we’ll hone in and get a little more insider baseball.\n\nThe first question I wanted to ask you was about your views of the Trump Administration’s policies that are making it more difficult to secure H-1B visas and to limit legal immigration from several countries. Now, what impact do you think this will have on the United States economy, and what immigration policies should the United States have in place?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, we are completely apolitical, so I don’t have any views on any policies of the Trump Administration. That said, I think that when you educate people in the United States, you’re developing a lot of human capital, and I think it’s really logical that you’d want to have that kind of capital stay here in the United States.\n\nI mean, the spots at our leading universities—there are not that many spots. So, if you look at the economics program at Berkeley—when I went there, there were about 30 Ph.D. candidates per class. And about maybe half of them actually finished and got their Ph.D.’s. So, in my class, maybe 15 people actually got Ph.D.’s. Those are pretty scarce resources. If you’re going to educate someone to get a Ph.D. in the United States, wouldn’t it be better to try to encourage that person to stay in the United States and take advantage of that human capital that you poured all these resources into to develop?\n\nI don’t think you want to go quite so far and say if you get a Ph.D., you automatically get to stay in the United States, because obviously you do want to have secure borders. And you do care about any people who might have bad intent with respect to the U.S. So you certainly have to do the appropriate background checks, and things of that sort.\n\nBut I think the presumption should be more the default that if you do get a Ph.D. in the United States, the presumption is that you get to stay as opposed to that you have to leave. That’s just good public policy, in my view.\n\nCarla Hesse:\n\nYes, I mean you might be interested to know that the Berkeley Economics Department now graduates over a thousand BA’s a year.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI know it’s a very big—I actually spoke to the undergraduates a number of years ago. And it’s done in the stadium now.\n\nCarla Hesse:\n\nThere are five top-ranked programs in the country, but what really differentiates Berkeley is this incredible multiplier effect of the education that delivers at that very high level. It is a lot of human capital, and precious. So, staying with this sort of broader vein for a minute, I thought we’d ask a little bit about globalization, and what you see are the benefits and risks of globalization, trade, and increased competition.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, we could be here for several hours to really answer that question with any detail. Look, I think first of all, we have to recognize that globalization has had huge benefits for the world. I mean, literally, hundreds of millions of people have been wrested out of poverty over the last couple of decades. So that’s number one. That’s probably a good thing, net-net.\n\nNumber two, I think you have to recognize that globalization has benefits but it also has costs. The benefits for the U.S. have been low-cost goods and services from the rest of the world. But some of the costs in are the adjustment process that has to occur when businesses that were sheltered from competition are no longer sheltered from competition, and therefore have trouble actually carrying on.\n\nI think the big mistake is to think that putting up trade barriers is going to somehow make you better off. I do not believe that putting up trade barriers will make you better off. I think what it will do is it will force you to produce things that you are less good at producing. It will also risk the retaliation by those who you put the trade barriers up to, which will probably make you both worse off.\n\nIn terms of the whole debate about the benefits and costs of globalization, I think what we should be focused on is how to reduce the adjustment cost to those that are hurt by globalization, or by technological change.\n\nFor all the talk we have about globalization, I think technological change is probably actually more important in terms of the amount of stress it puts on certain segments of our citizenry. And I think we legitimately need to do a better job of helping those people adjust, rather than just saying, “Well, too bad, tough luck. Your plant closed down, you’re living in a small rural community, you don’t have many prospects for employment, and that’s just too bad.”\n\nSo I think that we need to temper the sharp edge of capitalism at times, and that means workforce development, job retraining, trade assistance adjustment. We could do a lot more on that front, and if we did that, I think there’d be more acceptance of the benefits of globalization and of free trade, and then you’d have a stronger political consensus for the regime in which we have operated for the last few decades.\n\nCarla Hesse:\n\nOne more question in this vein of global dynamics and their relationship to the economy. What do you think about the role of U.S. monetary policy in the global setting and its effect on the rest of the world? Is there a need for, in a similar vein, greater coordination between U.S. monetary policy and…?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, there is certainly a need for good communication. I go to Basel, Switzerland five times a year, at least. Basel is where all the central bankers get together to talk about the economy, and monetary policy, and regulatory policy. And that’s actually a really important venue because you get to know your counterparts. So, if you’re in the middle of a financial crisis, and you pick up the phone to speak to someone, you actually know who’s on the other end, and you actually have built up some trust and a relationship with them. So that’s really important.\n\nI think that it’s important to communicate well and clearly. It’s important to have those personal connections. In the middle of the financial crisis, when we were negotiating the foreign exchange swap lines with my counterparts at the ECB, the Bank of Japan, and a number of other central banks—having met the people and having interacted with them on many occasions made it much easier to get to a good place. So it’s really important to have those personal relationships.\n\nIn terms of coordination, I think there’s a limit to how far you can go, though. The mandate that’s set for the Federal Reserve on monetary policy by Congress is about maximum sustainable employment in the U.S. and price stability for the U.S. It says nothing about the rest of the world. So you have to recognize that the monetary policy that we pick here is the policy that we think is best for us.\n\nThat said, if we do the monetary policy well and we communicate well, we can also minimize the disruption to everybody else.\n\nSo, a good example is to compare and contrast the “taper tantrum” in 2013 and 2014 with the balance sheet normalization process this year. When we rolled out the balance sheet normalization process, we were very, very, very cautious in terms of how we communicated and how we actually implemented the program.\n\nWe started to talk about what we were thinking about long before we actually enacted the program, and then when we actually pulled the trigger and said we’re going to enact the program starting in October, it was a program that built very, very gradually. And it won’t be fully in place for another year.\n\nAnd so, there were no big surprises. And I think that was very, very helpful in making it so the markets adjusted to this change in policy very smoothly.\n\nSo we learned some lessons from the taper tantrum. I think communicating clearly, foreshadowing what you’re going to do, explaining why you’re doing what you’re doing, I think can not only be helpful to the U.S. and U.S. financial markets, it can also be helpful to the rest of the world.\n\nClearly, U.S. monetary policy is important for the rest of the world. What we do in the United States does affect financial markets all over the world. And we want to have financial markets globally that behave more well than badly, and to the extent that we can communicate clearly so that the adjustment process is smooth, I think that’s good for everybody.\n\nCarla Hesse:\n\nSo, let’s move onto the regulatory environment. You had the coverage in the Times, you’ve expressed some views on this, and maybe this will be an opportunity to elaborate a little bit more on what’s been covered already in the Times. Let me just start with asking you about how you view the unfolding of the Dodd-Frank Act. We all know that in response to the recession and financial crisis, Congress enacted much greater regulation in the financial industry. Recently, there have been calls to reassess that decision, and particularly to reassess and maybe even repeal the Dodd-Frank Act—or at least modify it in some form. How effective do you think Dodd-Frank has been, and can it be improved? Should it be reformed? Or is repeal a justified decision?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I certainly wouldn’t want to repeal the Dodd-Frank Act, and go back to the regime that we had in place prior to the financial crisis. I think we learned a lot during the financial crisis about a lot of inadequacies within our financial system. Banks didn’t have enough capital, they didn’t have enough liquidity. A lot of over-the-counter derivatives were cleared bilaterally, which created a huge mess when firms actually got into difficulty. We didn’t have particularly good oversight of the major financial market utilities. So large, systemically important firms weren’t required to have higher levels of capital and liquidity available to smaller firms.\n\nSo there’s a lot of really good things in the Dodd-Frank Act. Title II basically provides a mechanism though which you can actually resolve a large, systemically important firm, probably in a way that wouldn’t necessarily threaten to take down the entire financial system. I think there’s a lot more good than bad in the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nThat said, could it be improved? Yes, I think it could be improved. I’ve been on record saying very clearly that I think that some relief for smaller banking organizations probably makes sense, because small banking organizations are not systemic. A failure of a small banking firm is not going to threaten to take down the entire financial system. So, differentiating between how you regulate large institutions and small institutions I think makes a lot of sense.\n\nAnother change is the Volcker rule. The Volcker rule, as it has been implemented, has a pretty heavy hand of regulatory compliance to it. You could probably get most of the benefits of the Volcker rule with a lot less cost. But it’s important not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. I think that capital liquidity requirements do need to be higher on a permanent basis for large, systemically important institutions.\n\nI do believe that the central clearing of over-the-counter derivatives transactions actually reduces risk in the financial system. I think it’s important to have a viable resolution regime so you actually can resolve a firm or allow a firm to fail without necessarily taking down the rest of the financial system.\n\nI hope in my lifetime we will never have to have the kind of interventions that we had in 2008, with Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and AIG. Those are not interventions that were politically popular. They weren’t interventions that were comfortable to do. But it was really a question—I really viewed that officials that were making those decisions had a Hobson’s choice, and the Hobson’s choice was to rescue the firms to prevent violent failure or let the financial system collapse.\n\nAnd I think they made the right choice in preventing the violent failure of some of the major financial firms. Because I think if we hadn’t done that rescue, I think we would probably have had a Great Depression.\n\nSo I think the right choices were made. They just weren’t pleasant choices. You need the Dodd-Frank Act to never get to that situation again, where we’re forced to make such difficult choices. So hopefully, in my lifetime, we’re never going to see anything like this again.\n\nCarla Hesse:\n\nOne of the big concerns that is lingering from the way the economy has emerged from the Great Recession has to do with the labor market and employment. And even though the country is now approaching low—record low—unemployment rates, we haven’t seen wages bounce back and improve at the same rate that one might expect if you were really in a full recovery.\n\nYou touched on this a little bit earlier, but maybe you could amplify a little bit more on how much you would see that as a consequence of globalization and the way in which it’s affecting wage deflation in the United States, or changes in the structure of labor markets nationally. And where are we with discussion of the sharing economy? And we’ll continue to talk a little bit more in the next question, too, about inequality in a growing economy.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, the unemployment rate right now is 4.1%, which is a low unemployment rate relative to what we’ve had historically. We think it’s pretty much at full employment. And what we mean by that is the level of unemployment where if you go any lower, you’re actually going to have, over time, an inflation problem.\n\nBut we don’t really know precisely where full employment is. So, if inflation doesn’t go up, sitting at a 4.1% unemployment rate, that means that you can actually let the unemployment rate go lower still.\n\nA lot of people are sort of wringing their hands about, gee, where’s the inflation? We’re at a 4.1% unemployment rate and there’s no inflation. That’s not actually a bad thing. It actually is a pretty good thing, because it means that you should be able to probe, and go to an even lower unemployment rate, which is actually a good thing for all those people that could actually be employed and have jobs and develop skills and grow their human capital.\n\nSo, I’m not particularly concerned about the fact that inflation’s a little bit lower than our target. I don’t really completely understand why inflation is as low as it is right now. We would have thought that at this unemployment rate, we would be seeing more pressure on wages, and that that would be ultimately filtering into prices. It may just be that it takes some time—that you have to be at this unemployment rate for six months or a year or two years to actually see the consequences for wages and prices. But it’s not a bad place to be.\n\nI mean if you told me that you have to live in a world where the unemployment rate is 4.1% and inflation is about 1.5%, and you have to stay there for eternity—most central bankers would say “sign me up.” So, it’s important not to overstate the degree of the problem.\n\nI think what’s going to happen is that the economy is going to continue to grow at an above-trend pace. I think that’s going to continue to gradually tighten the labor market further. I think as that happens, we’ll see a little bit more wage inflation, and as that occurs, that will eventually filter into prices.\n\nWhen you look at—people talk about the so-called Phillips Curve. The Phillips Curve is the relationship between wage inflation and the unemployment rate. People saying, well, there’s no wage inflation, therefore the Phillips Curve doesn’t work. I don’t agree with that. If you look at the economy, instead of looking at the economy on a national basis, if you look at state by state, and you look at those states with a lower unemployment rate, you actually tend to have a higher wage inflation in those states with lower unemployment rates. So that’s suggesting the Phillips Curve is alive and well, it’s just not visible yet on a national basis.\n\nCarla Hesse:\n\nYou’re not overly worried about what many, many economists—including some of the most notable ones at Berkeley—are worrying a lot about, which is growing inequality?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I am worried about that. In fact, what I’m worried about— so, people having jobs doesn’t mean they necessarily have good jobs. That’s problem number one. Unfortunately, the Federal Reserve and monetary policy can’t do that much about income inequality and can’t do much about income mobility, because monetary policy is really about the business cycle and trying to keep the economy at full utilization of resources.\n\nObviously, if we keep the economy operating at a full utilization of resources, that will help people—because people will have jobs, and they’ll develop skills, and they’ll grow their human capital. But monetary policy is pretty limited on this particular front.\n\nI personally think that people talk a lot about income inequality. I actually think the bigger issue in the country is income mobility. The work that Raj Chetty and others have done basically shows that where you are born affects your lifetime earnings. Not what your family’s background is—literally, where you live as a child. That’s pretty damning. That actually seems fundamentally unfair.\n\nSo, I think there’s a lot of work we need to do to try to address creating greater opportunities for people regardless of where they’re born, who they’re born to, did their parents go to college, did their parents not go to college, were they born in the rural South, were they born in New York City. I mean, the differences are quite vast, and they don’t have anything to do with the endowment of the individual. They have to do with the native environment—where they were brought up. And I think that really tells you that we have a lot of work to do on this front.\n\nSo, I’ve been talking about this and I think the Federal Reserve is paying a lot of attention to this. We have a research institute at the Minneapolis Fed that’s looking at this issue very closely. And we in the New York Fed very much support that work. I think it’s hugely important. I mean, the whole American dream is based on the idea that anyone can be very successful if they really apply themselves. We’ve got to make that true—in fact, not just in theory.\n\nCarla Hesse:\n\nAnd so, the issue of low interest rates you don’t think intersects in any meaningful way, at least for people who rely on, for example, fixed incomes, or the elderly who are relying on pensions?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell—look, my mom is 94 years old, and she would like to have higher interest rates. But, the reality is that our job is maximum sustainable employment and price stability, and at the end of the day, I think that the country as a whole is better off having an easier monetary policy and a lower unemployment rate. I think that’s more consistent with our mission over time than to have interest rates somewhat higher today, and unemployment higher, because that will probably lead to lower interest rates in the future.\n\nIt’s not interest rates at a particular point in time. It’s interest rates over years and years and decades and decades. And I think the best way you can have the highest sustainable level of interest rates is to get the economy to full employment. And that’s really been what our goal has been over the last seven or eight years. And we’re finally in the vicinity of full employment. As a consequence of that, we’re gradually now removing monetary policy accommodation, and interest rates are going up.\n\nIt’d be really sad to tell people, “I’m really sorry, but I’m keeping you unemployed for a while longer because we need to have higher interest rates for savers.” I’m not sure that that would feel right. It certainly doesn’t feel right to me.\n\nSo, my mom has had to do without. She’s doing fine. And I just think that’s—and the mandate that Congress has given the Fed—it’s maximum sustainable employment and price stability, and so we’re following the monetary policy designed to best achieve that mandate.\n\nCarla Hesse:\n\nAnd so you don’t worry, like some people—let’s say Ben Bernanke—about interest rates falling so low that it leaves us with very little room to maneuver?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nNo, I do worry about that. I mean, this is the issue of let’s imagine that interest rates this cycle peak at a relatively low level, 4 or 5%. That would mean that in the next recession, the Federal Reserve wouldn’t have that much room to reduce interest rates before you got back to zero. And the issue there then is, OK, what would monetary policy do at that point? Would you have the tools in place to actually lift the economy out of recession?\n\nAnd that’s a legitimate issue. But two things I would say about that. Number one, we have a better toolset today to deal with the zero lower bound for interest rates than we did 10 years ago. We actually learned a bunch of things through this last episode—forward guidance, large-scale asset purchases, open-ended large-scale asset purchases until our goals were actually achieved—which means that the toolset is actually quite a bit better now than it was before.\n\nAnd it’s not as if monetary policy has to do all of the lifting. You can imagine the next recession, fiscal policy can also provide supports to the economy if you’re trapped at the zero lower bound for interest rates.\n\nI think that’s a real issue. How big an issue it is at this point, I think it’s really too early to say. We’ve only had one episode in history of being trapped at the zero lower bound for interest rates. How often this is going to happen in the future, I think it’s really, really too soon to say.\n\nCarla Hesse:\n\nI’m going to ask you one more question, then we’re going to open it up, and it’s a big question. I’m going to ask you to be brief in your response to it. But it’s such an important one, and I’d really be curious to have your thoughts about it. What do you think the work of the Fed in the last decade has had an impact on in the culture and ethics of the business community, the financial community in general? And how do you assess the state of things now? Do you think that there’s been a taking in of some of the more—let’s call them ethical or cultural questions—that were raised by the financial crisis?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nLook, I think there was a lot of bad behavior in the financial industry in the run-up to the financial crisis, and even in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The classic example I always use is the LIBOR issue, where people were calling up their treasury functions and saying, “Could you change the bid that you submit for your LIBOR submission because that will benefit me in terms of the trading positions I have outstanding?”\n\nCompletely illegal, unethical, should never have happened. The treasury function should have said, “No, I’m not going to do this.” They should have reported the person to compliance. Compliance should have done an investigation. The traders should have been fired. That’s how it should have worked. It didn’t work that way on all occasions.\n\nSo, clearly there’s a lot of work to be done in the banking industry—work on culture, in conduct, and in ethics issues. And this has been a priority for me to talk about this issue over the last number of years, and I think we’ve actually had pretty good take-up from the banking industry, that they really do understand now that this is important for them. That if they don’t address the culture and conduct issue, this could be potentially existential for them.\n\nBecause what’s happened is, number one, the reputation of the industry has been really hurt, and so it makes it hard for them to attract people, good people, into the industry.\n\nWe had a conversation with a number of deans from business schools a couple of years ago, and a number of them said that they have a number of students that won’t into the financial services industry because they don’t view it as ethical enough. And that’s not a really good self-selection process. So, if you’re not getting the people that think ethics is important, you’re only getting all the other people. That suggests that you have a lot of work to do. So I think that the banking industry now gets this—I mean obviously to different degrees, at different institutions—and I think they’re working a lot harder on this issue.\n\nSo I think we’ve made a lot of progress. I think we need to do more, though. I think there could be more industry-wide efforts, where banks actually have a valuation of their culture and ethics, a questionnaire that evaluates—they all have the same questionnaire. They get each other’s results anonymously, see how they are doing relative to their peer group, and learn where they actually need to improve.\n\nThis is being done in the U.K. There’s a Banking Standards Board that’s actually doing work on—they actually have a questionnaire and they share the results, and it really allows you to sort of benchmark yourself, “How am I doing relative to others?”\n\nWhat they’ve also found is they are getting better, more honest answers. So on the same question asked through this questionnaire that’s anonymous from the Banking Standards Board, they get slightly more pessimistic answers than when the bank has just done its internal engagement survey.\n\nSo I think that we made quite a bit of progress, but I think there’s still more to do.\n\nCarla Hesse:\n\nI’ll just circle back to the beginning, saying I think this is another area where educational institutions have to play a really big role. And one of the things that I’m very proud of at Berkeley is the liberal arts foundation. Our business majors have to start in letters and science, and they get a very broad formation before they specialize in any particular technical area. And I just think that this is going to be the long-term solution.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nCan I add just one thing? One thing on that where I think academic institutions can do even better is to embed the ethics stuff in the course material for all the different subject matters. A lot of times the ethics course is off to the side. So, you take your finance, you take your marketing, and then over here is the ethics course. I think you really need that ethics material embedded in each course so that people can see some of the tricky decisions they might be faced with.\n\nCarla Hesse:\n\nI absolutely agree with that. In fact, I wrote a sentence just like that this morning to a member of our advisory board about the need to have very broad domain-specific ethics curriculum, whether it’s in STEM or the sciences, where also so many important ethical questions are emerging.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nYou know, a lot of them are not black and white. A lot of them are gray. And so, to really draw them out by a particular example, where it’s something that’s not abstract, I think makes it much more real to people. Just to give you an example about how you can effect change: there’s always an issue with cybersecurity and phishing. And one of the things that you want to do is sensitize people to phishing.\n\nSo one of the things we did at the New York Fed to sensitize people to phishing is I sent a message to everybody in the New York Fed, with a line in the message: “New York Fed restructuring.”\n\nAnd so that really made people really curious. And so people went in to open the e-mail. And the e-mail had a lot of things that made it very clear that it wasn’t from me. For example, in the e-mail my name was signed “William.” I never sign my name “William” in an e-mail. I always sign my name “Bill.” And there was a bunch of other things. But a lot of people clicked through because they just couldn’t help themselves to find out what was on the other side of the “New York Fed restructuring.” And I think that was actually pretty effective at making people much more sensitized to the phishing. It’s no longer abstract. It’s something where they could actually see how they could get fooled.\n\nAnd so you’ve got to get people engaged, where they internalize it. It’s like the difference between taking a class and auditing a class. I audited statistics in graduate school at Berkeley. It was a prerequisite for econometrics. It was a disaster. I’d nod my head through all of the audit, and then when it came down to when they handed out the final exam, and I had to ask myself to actually answer all these questions, I couldn’t answer any questions. Because I wasn’t being forced to actually internalize it by the problem sets, and all of the hard work that it takes to understand a subject like statistics.\n\nCarla Hesse:\n\nYes, learning by doing. OK, so now we’re going to open it up, and I see this gentleman right here first. But just feel free to raise your hand. We don’t have a roving mike, so if you can, speak up.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nAre you concerned that the increase in debt-to-GDP over the last 16 years in the U.S., but also in other developed economies, is potentially an enormous problem as rates start to go up? And how are we going to get out of that problem?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI think that your question is well taken in the sense that right now, the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio is quite a bit higher than it was prior to the financial crisis, number one. Number two, our deficit is quite a bit higher now than it was at the same point in this business cycle during the last cycle. So, in 2007, our budget deficit was 1.1% of GDP. Last fiscal year, which ended September 30th, it’s 3.5% of GDP.\n\nAnd the baby boom retirements and Medicare and Social Security are right ahead. And as you point out, interest rates are rising. So, debt-service costs, which had been held down by the low level of interest rates, are going to rise as we go forward.\n\nSo, this is an issue that is going to be a significant one at some point in time. It’s really not a market focus at all right now. It’s sort of surprising to me how relaxed the financial markets are about the whole issue of fiscal sustainability. It just doesn’t seem to be an issue that people are concerned about. But ultimately, debt can’t grow faster than GDP indefinitely. So, eventually, you’re going to have to get on a more sustainable fiscal track. I have no idea when the market is really going to focus on that point, but it seems to me that that’s something that’s relevant, not just in the United States, but in a lot of other countries.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nCrypto-currencies: Is it a medium of exchange, is it a commodity, is it a roulette wheel, or is it a tool?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nTime will tell. I’m not going to fixate too much about crypto-currencies, except to say that a good medium of exchange has stable store of value. And it’s also widely accepted as a medium of exchange. I personally think the U.S. dollar has those attributes much more than the crypto-currencies that we see outstanding.\n\nI essentially feel like if the Federal Reserve does its job properly, and keeps inflation at a lowest sustainable level, confidence in the dollar as a currency will remain high. And the dollar will do just fine as a medium of exchange.\n\nIs there a possibility down the road that central banks will get more involved in offering digital currencies as a substitute for cash—for the actual physical currency? I think that’s something that could happen potentially down the road, and certainly central banks are thinking about that.\n\nSo what do digital currencies mean for—would that be a more efficient medium of exchange than cash? With cash, there’s danger that you could lose your cash. The cash could get stolen. So maybe there are other forms of currency that might be a better medium of exchange than cash. So I think that’s something that central banks should be looking at. I think it’s a legitimate question.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nYou spoke of the ethical unease among students. Do you think any of that may be linked to the fact that there was not a single prosecution that arose out of the financial crisis? Do you think one day we may look back and rue that even more than perhaps some of us do now?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I’m not a lawyer, so I don’t have a good basis for judging what was actually possible in terms of successful prosecution. The problem, of course, is that doing dumb things is not against the law. Doing illegal things is, and so the question is where is that line between just doing dumb things versus doing illegal things.\n\nBut I think that people that have broken the law should be prosecuted and held to account. I absolutely agree with that. I’m just not a lawyer, so I can’t really make a good judgment about whether the judicial branch of our government could have been more effective in that realm. I just don’t know enough to give you a really informed answer.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nI’m glad you brought up tech and disruption and potential massive unemployment due to tech disruption of the workforce. The response to this has been the idea of universal basic income. What is the feeling among policy makers of this concept, and what are your personal opinions on how it might affect both the country’s economy and the world economy?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, before we get to the question of the basic income support, I’m not that worried about technology eliminating all the jobs and us having no employment opportunity—at least not in the near term. I mean, what percent of the U.S. workforce was in agriculture 100 years ago—70, 80% of the workforce?\n\nAnd now what percentage? It’s 1 or 2% of the workforce. It seems to me that there’s always new things that come along, new things for people to, new services to provide. So I’m not convinced at all that we’re on the cusp of this new thing. We’ve been having this conversation about what’s going to come next for several hundred years now. I’m just not convinced that all of a sudden there’s going to be no job opportunities for anyone.\n\nIf there aren’t job opportunities, presumably it’s going to be because we’re just so incredibly productive and rich. And I suppose if we’re really in that environment, where all the robots are doing everything, the robots are making more robots, which are making more robots, that we’re going to actually have a pretty high standard of living.\n\nAnd so, I imagine in that regime we’re probably going to be able to afford something like a minimum income support payment. Right now, to do it would be very, very expensive, and I’m not really sure that people’s satisfaction in life would necessarily be higher if they were given minimum income as a choice versus being forced to seek out employment opportunities.\n\nThey might in the short run think it’s better to just take the income stipend, but I always wonder whether in the longer term, whether the quality of life and how they experience life would actually be better in that kind of regime.\n\nI think the big question, though, in the short run, is just the fiscal costs, which would be pretty large. This is being debated in some smaller European countries right now. I think that if it happens, they’re certainly going to go first. I think the U.S. would be quite a bit further behind. And so I think for the people who decide to go down this path, we’ll sort of see how it works, and then we’ll learn more about how feasible this is in practice. And does it generate the quality of life that the people hope it will.\n\nBecause at the end of the day, that’s what we really care about, right? It’s people having a good quality of life. And it may be that having a stipend improves your quality of life. But it may be having a stipend doesn’t improve your quality of life, because it makes your life empty and less fulfilling. So I think it’s an experiment, and we’re going to have to see.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nMy question is back on the fiscal side. This is of course an important month ahead of us, with regard to tax policy. So, it’s sort of a two-part question: Do you see a need for tax stimulus to the economy at the present moment, and if you had your druthers and could design a tax policy that would encourage a healthy growth in the U.S. economy, what would be a couple of key features of it?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI definitely am in favor of tax reform. I’d love to see the tax code simplified. I’d love to see the base broadened. I’d love to see it much easier to comply.\n\nMy spouse does our tax returns every year. We don’t send them out to an accountant or anybody. And I watch her slave through the tax returns, and I watch how much time it takes to do the tax return. That can’t be efficient, it can’t be productive. So I think a much simplified tax code with a broader tax base would be very, very desirable. And I think that also applies to the corporate taxes.\n\nSo I’m definitely in favor of tax reform. I’m not as in favor of tax stimulus at the current time because the economy, as your question implies, doesn’t really need that. So the tricky part, though, is what’s the trade-off between if I can get tax reform, but it requires a bit of fiscal stimulus to develop the consensus—is that a good thing or a bad thing?\n\nSo I think that the devil is in the details. And so I think everybody has their own view. We’ll see actually emerges from Congress. And everyone will have their own view about is that trade-off a good trade-off, or not a good trade-off, in terms of how much is done on the tax reform side versus how much is done on the fiscal stimulus side.\n\nFiscal stimulus—we don’t really need fiscal stimulus from an economic perspective. And as a question before came up, we do have to worry about the long-term fiscal sustainability of the U.S. But on the other hand, if there’s a price to pay to get tax reform, maybe that price is worth paying. So I think you sort of have to judge the whole package and whether you think those trade-offs are appropriate or not.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nThis somewhat relates to the previous question. What is your view of the movement to increase the minimum wage or the living wage—however one wants to define it—versus unemployment, versus, I don’t know, interest rates, whatever—it’s kind of a triumvirate of factors.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I’ve been very clear for a long time in what I’m for in the minimum wage. It’s very simple. I want the minimum wage set as a ratio to the median wage. And none of this, minimum wage flat for X years, and then a debate about how big an increase are we going to have.\n\nIf you actually had a minimum wage indexed to some percentage of the median wage—and what that percentage is a political decision that needs to be made by politicians—then you actually would have better plans for businesses. They’d know what the minimum wage was going to be over time—it was going to be X percent of the median wage. And it would also be better for the minimum wage earners, because rather than have a period of fallowness, where minimum wage is stuck at a very low level for a long time, then all of a sudden the minimum wage goes up a lot, they’d be compensated at a fairer proportion relative to the median wage.\n\nSo I think that’d be a much better improvement in the regime. The problem with that proposal, of course, is the legislature gets to make that decision once. And that may make it hard for people to reach agreement. I think it’s a political decision, where you set that minimum wage relative to the median wage. Different states could decide to set it at different attachment points. That’s a political decision.\n\nCongress is not very good about equity. Congress is very good about efficiencies. Telling me that minimum wage should be 50% of the median wage or 45% of the median wage, or 60% of the median wage—that’s really a political decision. Congress isn’t going to do very well at telling you one is better than the other.\n\nNow presumably, the higher the minimum wage is relative to the median wage, the more there’s going to be a consequence in terms of unemployment. And so you’re going to have to weigh how you’re going to pay that cost in terms of unemployment for having a higher minimum wage.\n\nIt’s not going to be free. There’s going to be a trade-off there, and you’re going to have to decide where you want to set that trade-off. But indexing the minimum wage to the median seems to be a definite improvement over the current regime. Better for the minimum wage earner, and better for business in terms of planning what their costs are going to be over time. It seems to me that it’s a win-win for both sides.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nBill, you’ve done an amazing job. It’s probably the system in terms of meeting the mandates of full employment and price stability. But if you were to step back as Berkeley economist and say what should the mandate be—if you had a magic wand, what should the mandate be for the central bank?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI’m not uncomfortable with the current mandate. I think the current mandate is completely reasonable. First of all, it doesn’t really matter what I say. This is something for Congress to decide, and the Federal Reserve is supposed to carry out the mandate.\n\nSo first thing is, it really doesn’t matter what I think. But I think the current mandate has been really good. You want a little bit of inflation in the system because that actually helps lubricate the wheels of the economy. It helps lead to more efficient allocation of labor resources, because otherwise you have less flexibility in the labor market.\n\nI think George Akerlof and others have done work showing that maybe about 2% inflation is probably better than zero percent inflation, just because it allocates labor resources more efficiently. You also want to have a little bit of inflation because you probably want to be a little bit off the—you want to reduce the risk of the zero lower bound problem. So, I’m very comfortable with 2% inflation as a target.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nWhat about the full employment?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI don’t think the two goals are inconsistent. I think if the Federal Reserve is doing their job properly, the two goals are actually compatible with one another. So if we go to maximum sustainable employment—and the important word there is sustainable. Yes, you could drive the unemployment rate lower for a short period of time, but that would generate inflation, and then the Federal Reserve would have to slam on the brakes, and you’d be worse off than if you actually stayed at a level of unemployment that was consistent with 2% inflation over time. I think the two goals are very compatible with one another. I don’t think there’s a huge tension between those two goals."

        "title": "Remarks at The Evolving Structure of the U.S. Treasury Market: Third Annual Conference",
        "date": "Nov 28, 2017",
        "speaker": "William C. Dudley",
        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/dud171128",
        "content": "On behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and our co-sponsors—the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission—I would like to welcome you to this year’s conference on the structure of the U.S. Treasury market.  As always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nThis is the third year the New York Fed has co-hosted the Treasury market structure conference, which provides an opportunity to deepen our understanding of the changing landscape of the Treasury market.  Many of you remember the market volatility of October 15, 2014, that precipitated the need for additional engagement between the private and public sectors about Treasury market structure.  The Joint Staff Report on the Treasury flash event, the Treasury Department’s subsequent request for information, and the work that has followed identified a number of changes that have reshaped the Treasury market over the last decade.  These include the increased electronification of trading, the changing nature of intermediation and liquidity, and the entry of new market participants.  In light of these changes, the Joint Staff Report highlighted four important priority areas for additional work.  In taking these efforts forward, we have benefited from ongoing engagement with market participants and other members of the public. \n\nThe first priority is gatherings like this one, where both private and official sector participants come together to study and share views on what the market’s evolution means for its structure and liquidity.  Understanding how the Treasury market is evolving can enable us to be good stewards of its trajectory.\n\nA second priority is improving the availability of data on activities in the cash market.  After the historic volatility that occurred on October 15, 2014, the official sector had limited access to transaction data.  This resulted in a months-long lag in the process to gather and analyze data from the event.  The introduction this year of transaction data reporting by broker-dealers to the official sector is thus a critical step forward.  While closing this data gap for the official sector is an important milestone, work remains to ensure that the scope of collection is sufficiently complete and dynamic to maintain coverage of relevant firms, as intermediaries and liquidity providers evolve.  One initiative in this direction is the Board of Governors’ plan to collect transaction data from depository institutions. \n\nLooking ahead, I expect that a continuing priority will be increasing data transparency to all market participants and to the public in a manner that supports—and does not harm—market liquidity and integrity.  Part of the successful evolution of the modern Treasury market will be adapting to the data needs of its participants. I believe transaction data reporting to the public based on careful study will ensure that the Treasury market does not fall behind other markets, will promote a robust and level playing field, and will help safeguard the liquidity characteristics that make the Treasury market the benchmark for risk-free trading around the world.\n\nThe rise of electronic trading, another market feature highlighted in the Joint Staff Report, helped to identify a third priority area: the market practices and risks associated with the Treasury market.  Market infrastructure—including the financing of Treasury transactions, as well as the clearing and settlement of those transactions—seldom merits investor attention until an element that is vital to smooth functioning of the market goes awry.  The history of financial markets is filled with examples—some recent—in which confidence in trading collapsed after market participants no longer knew or could assess the underlying risk of market engagement, leading them to disengage.  While such disengagement may be rational from the perspective of an individual participant, it is destructive to the collective market function. \n\nA major infrastructure issue for the Treasury market has been the clearing and settlement practices of the cash market.  This can be opaque, with a majority of trades cleared away from central counterparties (CCPs).  While central clearing is more uniformly used in other segments of the Treasury market—such as futures—many market participants elect to clear and settle cash Treasury transactions in a bilateral fashion.  This process includes many market participants: trading venues, clearing agents, and clearing banks.  No single participant has a view of the entire clearing and settlement system.\n\nThe Treasury Market Practices Group (TMPG), a New York Fed-sponsored group of market professionals working to support the integrity and efficiency of the Treasury market, has concentrated its recent efforts on this topic.  Preliminary findings include an increasing volume of linked trades that clear centrally on one side and bilaterally on the other. This work has also uncovered information asymmetries in clearance and settlement risk management, which potentially could lead to a mispricing of these risks.  Moreover, increased understanding about the depth, breadth, and durability of credit arrangements that support clearance and settlement seems desirable.  This would improve market integrity through greater understanding of risk throughout the clearing and settlement process and how it is affected by different conditions.\n\nSince the financial crisis, there has been an effort to strengthen the resiliency of repo market infrastructure, which is another important element of Treasury market plumbing.  Immediately after the crisis, the Federal Reserve was active in pushing reform of the tri-party repo market, which had been a locus of stress in 2008.  More recently, Treasury repo markets have undergone further changes, including market adaptations to post-financial crisis regulations, and the introduction of multiple programs expanding access to central clearing to a wider range of market participants.  These markets also have been affected by efforts to set heightened expectations for CCPs with regard to liquidity risk management, margins, and governance and recovery planning.  This is consistent with the Treasury Department’s recommendation that regulators ensure appropriate risk management at CCPs and other financial market infrastructures.  For example, earlier this month, the SEC approved the Capped Contingency Liquidity Facility—a liquidity risk management tool for the DTCC’s Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC).  This tool helps to ensure that FICC will have sufficient liquidity to cover the default of a Government Securities Division member to which FICC has the largest exposure.  This development reflects another positive step toward a safer centrally cleared repo market, and aligns well with broader official sector efforts to maintain a well-functioning and robust Treasury repo market.\n\nFinally, the Joint Staff Report identified the importance of strong interagency monitoring of the Treasury market, in close collaboration with the public.  Judging by this gathering, the commitment to this task is strong—which is good because many questions remain.  How can the Joint Member Staffs and private stakeholders best collaborate to ensure stability in the Treasury market as the market structure evolves and new technologies are applied?  How should practices and culture evolve accordingly?  Will new technology and automation in the marketplace introduce unexpected challenges or risks to Treasury market participants?  Are there opportunities to improve market transparency in a way that sheds light on risk issues that emerge as the market continues to evolve?  Are the regulatory requirements imposed upon the Treasury market appropriate in the current environment?  Has a competitive level playing field been maintained given the evolving structure?  And, are there any changes that could improve the functioning, efficiency and/or integrity of the Treasury market?\n\nAs I highlighted before, answering such questions well could require greater transparency.  It is important for officials and market participants to fully understand the range of market elements.  These include the relative size of transaction volumes by various players, the breadth and resiliency of platforms used to facilitate risk transfer, and the robustness of market infrastructure under contingent circumstances.  More broadly, interagency efforts and collaboration with the public to shed light on the evolving structure and its risks are critical to protecting Treasury market function and supporting investor confidence.  Because we benefit from the Treasury market being the deepest and most liquid market for government securities, complacency should not be an option.  We need to work together to ensure that the longstanding confidence in the Treasury market is sustained in the future.\n\nThis conference provides an excellent opportunity to continue this discussion and work on these issues.  Thank you for coming.  I look forward to today’s dialogue and the ongoing engagement between the Joint Member Staffs and the public."

        "title": "Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet: The Benefits of Moving Gradually and Predictably",
        "date": "Nov 16, 2017",
        "speaker": "Unknown",
        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/pot171116",
        "content": "Good afternoon and thank you for the kind introduction.  I would also like to add my warm welcome to the New York Fed.  We very much value the National Association of Securities Professionals' (NASP) efforts to promote professional excellence and encourage economic empowerment for people of color and women on Wall Street, and for our community, and are pleased to host this year’s kickoff to the NASP's 21st Annual Symposium.  This year’s symposium is organized around the timely theme of “Keeping Pace when Market Dynamics Shift”.  In that vein, I welcome the opportunity to discuss with you some important changes that are in train with respect to the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, and how these may impact financial markets. \n\nAs always, the views I will express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the New York Fed or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nBefore I discuss the Fed’s balance sheet I would like to briefly review some pilot programs we conducted over the last few years and their impact on our counterparty policy.  As a number of you are aware, between July 2013 and December 2015, the New York Fed conducted two counterparty pilot programs with small firms, the first focused on treasury operations and the second on mortgage operations.  As we announced at the time, we initiated these programs to explore ways to broaden access to open market operations and to determine the extent to which firms beyond the existing primary dealer community could augment the New York Fed’s operational capacity and resiliency in its monetary policy operations.  We very much appreciate the NASP’s efforts to encourage eligible firms to participate.\n\nThe experience gained through these programs informed changes in the New York Fed’s eligibility criteria for primary dealers, which were announced in November 2016.  At that time, the minimum net regulatory capital (NRC) threshold for broker dealers was reduced from $150 million to $50 million.  And to better align the capital threshold for banks with the new NRC thresholds, the minimum Tier 1 capital threshold for banks was raised from $150 million to $1 billion.  At the same time, a 0.25 percent minimum Treasury market share threshold was introduced to more directly quantify the business capabilities of firms expressing interest in becoming a primary dealer.\n\nThrough these changes, the New York Fed is seeking to expand and diversify the pool of firms eligible to apply for primary dealer status, while also recognizing that a certain scale of activity is needed in order to be able to meet the many business obligations to which primary dealers must commit, in supporting the operations of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury.  These changes offer the opportunity to increase capacity and further support competitive pricing for the Fed’s open market operations.  Going forward, the New York Fed will periodically review its counterparty policy.\n\nTurning to monetary policy, at the conclusion of its September policy meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced that it would begin to reduce the size of the Federal Reserve’s securities portfolio.2   Over the past month, the Fed took the first steps in a multiyear effort to bring the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet to its longer-run size, by not reinvesting a portion of the securities repayments it received.  In the remainder of my prepared remarks today, I will offer my views on this policy from a financial markets perspective, drawing on a fuller set of remarks I delivered last month, which can be found on the New York Fed’s website.3  \n\nThe message I’d like to leave you with today is one of confidence.  I am confident that the FOMC’s plan will reduce the size of the portfolio in a gradual and predictable, “no surprises” manner; that the FOMC’s plan will promote good market functioning in the Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities markets as the portfolio declines; and that it will not prove disruptive to the U.S. mortgage market or the U.S. Treasury’s debt management program.  And I am also confident that the plan’s design, and the FOMC’s clear communication prior to the plan’s implementation, will mitigate the risk of sharp or outsized asset price reactions to the decline in the portfolio’s size over time. \n\nOf course, we cannot and should not prevent Treasury and agency MBS prices from reacting to relevant economic and financial developments, or indeed from gradually moving over time in response to the progressive decline in the size of the Federal Reserve’s holdings and consequent increase in the amount of securities held by the private sector. \n\nIn fact, we very much want asset prices to respond appropriately and fully to economic and financial news.  Over the coming years, such news could span a wide variety of topics, such as central bank policy in this country and abroad, the ongoing debate over fiscal policy, and the evolution of expectations for the longer-run neutral rate of interest. \n\nThat said, we do seek to mitigate the risk that our operational actions contribute to unnecessary surprise, disruption, or volatility. \n\nThere is of course always a risk that events could unfold differently from expectations.  In particular, central banks have had little direct experience with the impact of such a reduction in holdings of domestic securities and in reserves.  One relevant experience, of course, was the so-called “taper tantrum,” in 2013 which showed that markets can have outsized reactions to changes in balance sheet policy even before they happen. \n\nMore generally, experience with asset purchase programs, both here and abroad, clearly demonstrates that market volatility can ensue from balance sheet policy changes that market participants perceive as surprising, unclear, or rapid, or are not adequately distinguished from short-term interest rate policy intentions.  All of this indicates to me that, at policy turning points like these, central banks should carefully and clearly communicate their intentions, provide as much transparency as possible, focus on one tool at a time, and make transitions in policy implementation as slowly as overall macroeconomic policy objectives permit.4\n\nThe rest of my remarks will go as follows.  First, I’ll provide an in-a-nutshell summary of the structure of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  Then, I will discuss why it is important that the decline in the balance sheet be gradual and predictable, and explain how the FOMC’s plan provides this gradualism and predictability.  I will then talk briefly about how the Federal Reserve is ensuring it is prepared for unexpected developments.  We will then open things up for questions you may have.\n\nThe Fed’s Balance Sheet, In a Nutshell\n\nLet’s begin by reviewing, at a high level, where the Fed’s balance sheet is today.  Panel 1 shows a summary of the Fed’s assets and liabilities, as they are today.  Substantially all of the $4.5 trillion of assets consist of Treasuries and agency MBS.  On the other side of the balance sheet, the Federal Reserve has three main categories of liabilities: $2.6 trillion of bank reserves and other deposits, $1.5 trillion of paper currency, and about $400 billion of reverse repos.\n\nBefore the crisis, the balance sheet was much smaller, at around $900 billion.  It reached its present size as a result of the FOMC’s large-scale asset purchase programs. Those programs were undertaken to support the economic recovery by easing financial conditions to a greater extent than could be achieved solely through reducing the federal funds rate, once that instrument became limited by the zero lower bound on interest rates.  These asset purchases greatly increased the size of the asset portfolio, and equally increased the size of the Federal Reserve’s liabilities, largely through growing the stock of bank reserves.5   The composition of the balance sheet also changed.  On the asset side, the most important compositional changes were the addition of agency MBS and a substantial increase in the maturity of the Fed’s Treasury holdings.\n\nFor many years, the FOMC has made it clear that it did not intend for these changes to the balance sheet to remain forever.6   Instead, through its statements and its September 2014 Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, the FOMC indicated its intention that, in the longer run, the Federal Reserve will hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively, and that it will hold primarily Treasury securities.  The FOMC also communicated its intention to reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings in a gradual and predictable manner, primarily by ceasing to reinvest repayments of principal on its securities holdings.\n\nStarting in its December 2015 statement, when the FOMC first started to raise its federal funds target range away from zero, the FOMC also indicated that it anticipated continuing reinvestment until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate was well under way.  The FOMC’s strategy of waiting to begin reducing the balance sheet until normalization of the federal funds rate was well under way has had several advantages.  Most importantly, it reduced the likelihood that an unexpected adverse shock to the economy would have necessitated a return to the zero lower bound on the federal funds rate and potentially a reversal in balance sheet normalization.  Second, the FOMC’s approach promotes the use of the federal funds rate as the active monetary policy instrument, an instrument with which the FOMC has much greater experience.  In addition, delaying balance sheet normalization allowed the FOMC to meaningfully assess the efficacy of its tools to control short-term interest rates with a large balance sheet, and thereby judge how patient it could afford to be in reducing the balance sheet to its longer-run level.7\n\nReducing the Balance Sheet’s Size\n\nOver the past year, as the FOMC came to judge that normalization of the policy rate was well under way, with another rate increase in December 2016, and further increases in March and June 2017, FOMC deliberations turned to how balance sheet normalization might best be done.\n\nAs I noted earlier, for some time the FOMC has underscored that the balance sheet will be reduced in a way that is gradual and predictable, so as to avoid risks of surprise, disruption, or volatility, and would be achieved primarily by not reinvesting maturing principal.  The FOMC’s recently initiated plan does exactly this.8   Principal reinvestment will decline in a phased manner, an approach which provides for an appropriate pace of reduction in the balance sheet, and is quite straightforward to communicate. \n\nSpecifically, principal maturities will be reinvested only to the extent that they exceed gradually increasing caps.9   For Treasuries, the cap initially will be $6 billion per month, and will increase in steps of $6 billion at three-month intervals over 12 months until the cap reaches $30 billion per month.  Agencies follow a similar pattern, with a cap starting at $4 billion and rising in three-month steps to reach $20 billion.  The FOMC also indicated that it anticipates that these caps will remain in place once they reach their respective maximums. Over time, as the Fed holds fewer securities, the private sector will gradually hold more.  At the same time, Fed liabilities held by the private sector, in particular reserve balances, will decline equivalently.\n\nPanel 2, which draws on a July 2017 update to the System Open Market Account annual report, illustrates how the caps will evolve in relation to anticipated maturities of Treasuries, on the left hand side, and agency MBS on the right.  As can be seen, once the caps are fully phased in, in many months the caps are not expected to be binding, and so there would be no reinvestments in those months.  However, the caps will be exceeded in months with large Treasury maturities, and we would reinvest the amount above the cap. For agency MBS, a change in conditions could encourage faster MBS repayments than are shown here, producing monthly paydowns larger than the 20 billion cap and thus some reinvestments—an issue I will return to later.\n\nPolicymakers have indicated that they want the portfolio’s size to decline “in the background,” and that the federal funds rate will be the primary instrument of monetary policy.  Balance sheet normalization is expected to continue until the FOMC judges that the Federal Reserve is holding no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively. \n\nThe FOMC has not specified how large the balance sheet should be at that point, other than an expectation that the level of reserve balances will be appreciably below that seen in recent years, but larger than before the financial crisis.  My colleague Lorie Logan spoke in May on the many technical drivers of this ultimate level, which include the mode of policy implementation that the FOMC chooses in the longer run, possible increases in recent years in the financial system’s demand for reserves and Federal Reserve reverse repo liabilities owing to new financial regulations and other factors, and the long-term evolution of demand for paper currency.10  \n\nLet me spend a few minutes discussing the importance of gradualism and predictability.\n\nGradualism\n\nThe case for gradualism in reducing the Fed’s securities holdings rests on evidence, as well as potential risks, that an overly fast flow of securities into private hands could be disruptive to market functioning, as well as the FOMC’s confidence that it can adjust its policy stance as needed through changes in the federal funds rate.  In particular, there is evidence that the agency MBS market, due to the nature of its trading conventions, is prone to dislocation when market participants expect large transitions in central bank agency MBS flows.11  Such concerns can be self-fulfilling: if market participants are concerned that an abrupt shift in flow might be disruptive, they might, for example, withdraw from liquidity provision.  An overly fast redemption flow of Treasuries could also create challenges in the government’s management of public debt auctions and result in communication challenges.12\n\nRapid portfolio declines also could have unforeseen impacts on overnight money markets, for example by creating significant shifts in dealers’ demand for overnight repo financing.  We have seen such impacts in the past. This sort of volatility did not, and would not now, pose a major problem to markets or policy implementation, but it is something worth avoiding if possible.  Rapid portfolio runoff could also make it more likely that bank reserves become scarce unexpectedly or more quickly than policymakers had anticipated.\n\nFinally, overly fast portfolio runoff could introduce undesired noise into financial conditions.  This could complicate policymakers’ economic forecasting and make it more challenging to determine and communicate the appropriate monetary policy stance. \n\nPredictability\n\nPredictability complements gradualism by promoting stability in market estimates for the future size of the balance sheet, and confidence that the FOMC will not unintentionally create market stress.  It involves assuring the public that the flow of balance sheet reduction remains gradual across a range of economic scenarios, including ones quite different from our central forecast.  Achieving predictability is complicated by uncertainty about agency MBS principal repayments, an issue I’ll summarize briefly.\n\nTo an extent, unexpected changes in the pace of existing home sales contribute to uncertainty about MBS repayments. But by far the greatest source of aggregate uncertainty relates to refinancing.  When homeowners get a new mortgage with a better interest rate, and pay off their old higher rate one in the process, existing agency MBS are paid off more quickly, and replaced with greater issuance of newly-minted agency MBS containing the new, lower-rate loans.\n\nThe benefit of the FOMC’s redemption cap is that it limits the pace at which securities will flow back into private hands under scenarios in which interest rates fall much more than expected.  To illustrate this, projections for agency MBS repayments under a scenario of lower interest rates are shown in Panel 3—as you can see, in this low rate scenario, the caps would still be exceeded even when fully phased in. \n\nBy providing market participants some certainty that the pace of balance sheet decline will be gradual across economic scenarios, this plan should help mitigate the risk of unexpectedly sharp shifts in asset prices, liquidity, or market functioning should markets begin to put greater weight on lower interest rate scenarios.  Indeed, by promoting greater confidence in the stability and liquidity of the Treasury and agency MBS markets across economic outcomes, the FOMC’s plan should result in lower risk and liquidity premia on these assets, relative to normalization plans that do not promote such confidence.\n\nBeing Prepared for the Unexpected\n\nWhile I am confident that the FOMC’s plan will work well, there’s always the risk that events unfold differently than expected.  In my view, we best prepare for the unexpected in two ways: we need to be operationally ready to change course when needed, and we need to remain analytically focused so we know when to recommend to policymakers that they do so.\n\nFor example, the FOMC has made it clear that it stands ready to resume reinvestment if a material deterioration in the economic outlook were to warrant a sizable reduction in the federal funds rate.  The FOMC also indicated that it would be prepared to use its full range of tools, including altering the size and composition of its balance sheet, if future economic conditions were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the federal funds rate. \n\nAlso, unexpected operational demands could emerge from technical developments within the Treasury and agency MBS markets.  Even though it is shrinking, the Federal Reserve’s portfolio is and will remain large, and market participants will look to the Federal Reserve to lend out on a collateralized basis some of its holdings of Treasuries and MBS from time to time in order to facilitate settlement, as is done by most other large fixed-income investors.13\n\nConclusion\n\nLet me conclude now by reiterating the message of confidence with which I began my remarks.  I am confident that the FOMC’s gradual and predictable plan to normalize the balance sheet will reduce the balance sheet’s size at an appropriate pace, that it will promote good market functioning, that it will not disrupt the mortgage market or Treasury debt issuance, and, importantly, that it will mitigate the risk of sharp or outsized asset price reactions.  I am also confident that the Federal Reserve is well prepared, both operationally and analytically, to identify, understand, and address unforeseen circumstances over normalization as directed by the FOMC.  Finally, by accomplishing all these things, I am confident that the FOMC’s policy normalization plan should help promote the ongoing economic expansion.\n\nEarly signs on this front are encouraging, with no to very modest financial market volatility around balance sheet announcements and the reduction in the balance sheet to date.  It’s too early to declare success.  However, should this stability continue, I believe the FOMC’s approach may offer useful lessons to other central banks which anticipate reaching a time of transition in their policy stance. Thank you for your attention.  I would welcome your comments and questions.\n\nPanels"

        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/hel171115",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nThank you to the City Bar and the members of its Administrative and Banking Law Committees. It’s a pleasure to be able to speak with you. The views I express today are my own, and not necessarily the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nI’d like to take my time here with you today to reflect a bit on the decade since the financial crisis. A decade later, while the most acute effects of the crisis have dissipated, American families and businesses—the Main Street economy—continue to feel or remember its longer term effects. Savings were depleted. Homes and businesses were lost. Many Americans’ careers were fundamentally altered. Consumer spending dropped more severely on a year-over-year basis than it had since the Second World War.2\n\nA decade later, recognition of the human element of the Great Recession motivates both the private and public sector to remain vigilant in our efforts to prevent a future crisis. Remembering the effect of the crisis on American families, business owners, and investors helps prevent personal and institutional memories from fading. And the potential for memories to fade is real. Last month, the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached an all-time high. Recent data suggest that families’ incomes have increased between 2013 and 2016, although they also suggest that the wealth gap is widening.3\n\nPeople, too, have changed. Even at the New York Fed, now, over 50 percent of staff were not with us at the time of the crisis. I suspect that the same is true at banks and law firms, where many professionals have practiced for less than a decade. These junior bankers and lawyers have not even experienced a turn of the business cycle let alone have a memory of the financial crisis.\n\nNow, I recognize that the crisis and its aftermath is well trod ground. Indeed, my boss Bill Dudley delivered a speech on this very topic last week. That said, I think it is worth traveling down this well-worn path again. In doing so, I am mindful of a few aphorisms. First, those who fail to remember history are doomed to repeat it. Second, generals (and economists and even lawyers) tend to fight the last war. The third, which I will steal from a mutual fund prospectus, is that past performance is no guarantee of future results. All of this is to say that while it is critical to remember and draw lessons from what happened in that period of 2007-2009, and the response to it, it is also equally critical to remember that the next shock to the system is likely to look quite different in material ways.\n\nToday, I’ll start by talking about the broad range of innovative responses people within the Fed and other public sector institutions devised to restore confidence in part by providing liquidity, capital, and information during the chaos of 2008. Next, I will focus on some of the fundamental changes that have been implemented in the wake of the crisis. In my opinion, those changes go a long way toward making financial institutions and the financial system overall more stable and resilient. We should also recognize that, notwithstanding their increased resiliency, one or more firms will fail at some point in the future. It is imperative for US law to have an avenue to handle such a failure, and without systemic consequences. Finally, I will address some more recent legislative proposals to amend post-crisis reforms, emphasizing proposals relating to the orderly failure of major financial institutions.\n\nDisorder and the Unprecedented Steps to Right It\n\nI will start with the obvious. The crisis caught the world off guard. Many have argued that the crisis should have, would have, and could have been predicted and averted. Others have claimed that bubbles are inevitable and that regulators should principally focus their time and attention on cleanup and mitigation rather than avoidance. I will not engage here in that debate. From my perspective, prevention and cleanup are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, in exploring how to survive a crisis, you inevitably think about how to avoid it.\n\nWhen the crisis materialized and firms began to experience material distress or even fail, US law did not have a framework for achieving an orderly resolution of a systemically important institution at the corporate level. It had tools that have proved highly effective in managing corporate restructuring and depository institution receiverships, but none tailored for a major financial group. Instead, when large financial groups began to fail, policymakers relied on ad hoc interventions.\n\nSome of the immediate interventions involved use of the Federal Reserve’s “lender of last resort” functions. It was at this point that “Section 13(3)” entered the lexicon of modern central banking. For those few who are unaware, Section 13(3) was added to the Federal Reserve Act during the Great Depression. It gave the Board of Governors broad authority to permit a Reserve Bank to lend in exigent and unusual circumstances provided that the Reserve Bank was secured to its satisfaction. Prior to the crisis, Section 13(3) loans had last been made during the Depression, to such enterprises as a typewriter manufacturer and a vegetable grower.4 Fed policy makers and their advisors pulled Section 13(3) back off the shelf, perhaps brushing some metaphorical dust off its cover. In 2008, loans made pursuant to Section 13(3) facilitated JPMorgan Chase’s purchase of Bear Stearns. Loans under 13(3) also prevented the potentially catastrophic failure of American International Group (AIG).\n\nInnovations under 13(3) also underpinned many of the Fed’s broad-based facilities to provide market liquidity. The Fed created a variety of facilities under 13(3), giving rise to an alphabet soup of new acronyms.5 Those facilities provided liquidity to different segments of our economy, ranging from primary dealers to issuers of commercial paper. Their broader purpose, however, was to facilitate the availability of credit to businesses and households through on-lending.\n\nNot all of the Fed’s responses involved lending, either under Section 13(3) or at the discount window. On the supervisory side, the Federal Reserve’s Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) (the “stress test” of the 19 largest US financial institutions) addressed uncertainty about their ability to weather additional losses. The results were disclosed publicly in a significant departure from standard practice to keep supervisory information confidential. Transparency, as well as the availability of a government backstop, encouraged confidence in US institutions.\n\nOf course, the Fed’s actions did not happen in a vacuum, but rather in the context of other actions taken by other regulators and Congress. Perhaps most notably, in October 2008, Congress passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. That statute allowed, among other things, Treasury to create the Troubled Asset Relief Program to inject capital into financial institutions. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation expanded its guarantees of bank liabilities under the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program. The Federal Housing Finance Agency placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship. Non-US authorities responded to crises in their own jurisdictions. And really this is just a sampling of the diverse and creative array of public sector responses to the crisis.\n\nMany commentators and policy makers have been deeply critical of the Fed’s actions during the crisis. I am not here to suggest that leaders during the crisis were infallible or that decisions made during the crisis were always the right ones. What I believe is difficult to dispute, however, is the importance of having the ability to be agile in times of severe economic stress. Policy makers were both able and willing to try new things, to make adjustments as circumstances evolved, and to attack the crisis from different angles. Many aspects of the crisis were unprecedented. Room to innovate allowed the staffs of public sector institutions to craft targeted responses. It also allowed them to adjust those responses on the fly—through cooperation domestically and internationally, knowledge of the financial sector and familiarity with its participants, and the ability to instill confidence through the provision of liquidity.\n\nAs a lawyer, I am perhaps a bit of a pessimist. But I’m not a cynic. If there’s one lesson I take from the crisis, it is the importance of having room to maneuver during a crisis. And, there will be future shocks to the system. When the next shock comes, regulators need to have both the legal authority to take risks and the will to act.\n\nFrom Disorder to Order (Hopefully)\n\nIn the years after the crisis, attention has been focused on mitigating the risk of another one. Legislators and other policymakers made substantial changes to the financial system to hold firms, and their managers and shareholders, more accountable. A great many of those changes have put both firms and the public sector in a better place.\n\nToday, regulators and supervisors expect systemically important financial institutions to be more resilient. They must be prepared for unanticipated losses and shocks to the financial system, including through rigorous (if not always popular) capital and liquidity standards.\n\nSupervised firms are also required to have a much greater understanding of the governance and controls supporting their critical operations. This includes, for example, governance frameworks, management information systems, and IT resiliency. This last point is particularly notable because, as many of you are now painfully aware from the data breaches at Equifax and Yahoo (and those are just the most recent ones), cybersecurity risk has increased dramatically in the last several years.\n\nResilience goes a long way. It prepares firms to be ready to fight not only the last war, but also the unanticipated stresses of the next one. It prepares them not to rely on past performance as a guaranty of future performance. But, increased preparedness should not be cause for overconfidence. Supervision and regulation should not and cannot drive all risk from the financial system, and the probability of a systemically important institution’s failure will never be zero. The largest firms must be prepared for a rapid and orderly resolution under the US Bankruptcy Code.6 Among other things, these firms must now also ensure that critical activities or services provided to the market will not be disrupted in the event they find themselves in recovery or resolution. Moreover, if an institution fails, there must be sufficient tools to manage its failure in a way that reduces the chance that its failure will cascade systemically through the financial system. In other words, if one institution gets a cold—or worse—it should not become an epidemic.\n\nThe Fed’s use of Section 13(3) during the crisis was not uncontroversial. Concerns were expressed about moral hazard—that the Fed was somehow “bailing out” troubled institutions and that this would only lead to excessive risk taking in the future.7 As a result of this concern and others, Congress amended Section 13(3) to prevent the Fed from engaging in the kind of institution-specific lending that was directed at Bear Stearns and AIG. Going forward, the Fed may only lend under Section 13(3) as a part of a broad-based program directed at providing liquidity to the financial system and not to aid an individual failing firm.\n\nAt the same time Congress constrained one potential source of liquidity in the event of a crisis—Section 13(3) —it also created a new source of liquidity in Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act8, which established the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) and the Orderly Liquidation Fund (OLF).\n\nIn the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress expressed its preference for the use of “ordinary insolvency” under the Bankruptcy Code.9 However, Congress also recognized the importance of establishing an alternative resolution mechanism with features tailored for resolving a systemically important firm, and in a way that minimizes moral hazard.10\n\nOLA includes a public sector resolution authority—the FDIC, an agency well-versed in resolving depository institutions under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) and working with other domestic and international authorities. OLA empowers the FDIC to step into the shoes of the failing institution to resolve a “financial company” at the corporate group level. The FDIC must ensure that responsible managers and directors are removed, and the FDIC or Federal Reserve Board may seek certain industry bans for culpable directors and senior executives.\n\nOLA also includes the OLF. Congress recognized that the ability of the FDIC to borrow funds from the Treasury Department to provide emergency liquidity to a failing systemically important institution is crucial to the success of its resolution. The OLF is not prefunded, and the FDIC’s capacity to borrow to fund the OLF is capped at 90 percent of the fair value of the assets of the institution that are available for repayment. The provision of OLF liquidity does not fall ultimately on the American taxpayer. Shareholders may not recover until the OLF is repaid. The FDIC is authorized to assess financial sector participants if necessary to repay the funds advanced by the Treasury to fund the OLF.\n\nReevaluate, but Don’t Forget the Disorder of the Crisis\n\nThe breadth of changes that have been made to the regulatory landscape since the onset of the financial crisis is huge. Given the scale of the changes, it is entirely appropriate to take stock of these changes and reevaluate their effectiveness. It is not surprising to think that some recalibration might be necessary. It is also worth considering what additional reforms are needed to make the financial system more resilient and resistant to future, unanticipated shocks. Sometimes I get asked the question of whether the financial sector is where it needs to be in terms of resilience. My answer is usually that things are better, but they can get even better still. And I suspect that, in even the best case scenario, that will always be my answer. Because threats and risks evolve. Financial institutions, and regulators for that matter, must recognize changing risks and ensure that their approaches evolve in kind. We need to ensure that when the next economic downturn occurs, the financial system will bend, but not break.\n\nOf course, increased resilience does not come without costs. It is important to continually reassess whether those costs are appropriately balanced with the evolving risks. There are a number of potential areas that may be worth reassessing. One place to start is with regulations pertaining to smaller banks. People of all political stripes tend to agree that Congress and regulators should reassess the effect that regulations have had on these firms and whether such regulations are commensurate with their level of risk. For these smaller banks, whose failure will not directly inflict large costs or stress on the broader financial system, the regulatory and compliance requirements should be reconsidered. Indeed, banking agencies have announced many proposals for small banks,11 including one that would simplify the capital rules for such banks consistent with their risk.12\n\nWith respect to systemically important firms, I think it would be terribly myopic to forget the crisis. There have been a number of different types of changes proposed with respect to these firms. Today, I’d like to focus on the proposals relating to resolution regimes.\n\nCongress established OLA when memories of Lehman Brothers’ failure were fresh. It bears repeating that Congress did so after facing the terrifying realization that the lack of a credible resolution mechanism for dealing with failing systemic firms left only bad choices, such as lending into a run, bailout, or the collapse of the financial system. Over the past several years, there have been efforts in Congress to repeal OLA and create a new, bespoke process for systemically important firms under the Bankruptcy Code. That process would largely mimic many of the features of the FDIC’s single point of entry strategy intended for use in an OLA proceeding. Those efforts have picked up steam this year with the passing of two different bills in the House of Representatives.13\n\nFrom my perspective, there are attractive aspects to both OLA and the Bankruptcy Code. OLA is largely an administrative process that has the benefit of agility. It is administered by the FDIC, which will already have insight into the institution though the living will process. The FDIC also communicates with foreign regulators regarding systemically important firms.\n\nOLA has particular advantages in the context of a cross-border resolution, which means in this day and age the resolution of pretty much any systemically important institution. US regulators have established relationships with their foreign counterparts, and resolution processes similar to OLA now exist in many globally important financial centers. This familiarity can facilitate cross-border cooperation and coordination in the event of a failure of a systemically important institution, and stem competing insolvency proceedings in multiple jurisdictions and the ring-fencing of assets. This last point shouldn’t be discounted. It’s worth remembering that after Lehman Brothers’ parent company initially filed for bankruptcy in the US, many foreign proceedings were initiated for Lehman affiliates around the world. It took over six months to establish a cross-border protocol among the representatives of the more significant Lehman Brothers affiliates. The protocol was meant to improve communication and cooperation among the representatives as well as minimize costs and maximize recoveries for creditors. In the case of one of the most significant Lehman Brothers affiliates, Lehman Brothers International Europe located in the UK, no agreement was ever reached.\n\nOLA also provides for backstop liquidity through the OLF, a feature not available in the ordinary bankruptcy process. During the financial crisis, lender of last resort liquidity from the Fed was critical to promoting faith in the financial sector. So, too, will backstop liquidity be important for restoring faith in a recapitalized institution in resolution under OLA and preventing a run.\n\nThe bankruptcy process also offers many positives. The US Bankruptcy Code is admired around the world and has been the model for similar regimes in other countries. The court-administered nature of bankruptcy provides transparency and predictability to parties and provides stakeholders with a meaningful opportunity to be heard. However, as many have noted, the current bankruptcy laws were not designed to resolve systemically important financial institutions. Although firms have worked within the existing bankruptcy framework for purposes of resolution planning, revisions to bankruptcy law could be a means of facilitating the orderly bankruptcy resolution of a major financial institution. However, the devil is, of course, in the details. The bills that passed the House earlier this year include many helpful changes regarding current bankruptcy law. They may help facilitate the resolution strategies of most of the systemically important financial institutions. Notably, however, these proposals do not include a credible source of backstop liquidity. Congress recognized the importance of such a facility in the OLF. Any bankruptcy regime without one may lack the scale and speed needed to bolster market confidence and may not be as effective in preventing contagion, particularly with respect to a systemically important firm.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, I believe the legislative and regulatory reforms to the financial system over the last 10 years have made the system more flexible and resilient. At the same time, it is entirely appropriate to revisit these reforms now and assess their efficacy. In doing so, though, let’s keep my aphorisms in mind and not risk history repeating itself. I say this because the American public does not deserve to have history repeated.\n\nImproved resilience should permit financial institutions to weather another shock and, if needed, fail under the Bankruptcy Code as contemplated by the living will process. Under the living will process today, firms must approach their bankruptcy using tools geared toward corporate restructuring. Any changes to the regimes under which financial institutions can and will fail should be carefully considered before enactment, particularly to the extent they retain, or not, a credible source of liquidity going forward. This isn’t abstract financial theory. This concerns the ability of people on Main Street—employees, retirees, small business owners—to persevere in times of severe financial stress. Returning to the human element of the crisis, these are the same people who suffered during the Great Recession and who expect us all to do better during the next period of stress."

        "title": "Lessons from the Financial Crisis",
        "date": "Nov 6, 2017",
        "speaker": "William C. Dudley",
        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/dud171106",
        "content": "It is a pleasure to have the opportunity today to speak again at the Economic Club of New York.  As we mark the tenth anniversary of the onset of the financial crisis, I would like to focus on some of the lessons we should draw from that harrowing experience, and the implications of those lessons for regulatory policy going forward.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and opinions and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nThe first lesson is that financial crises can have grave consequences—for the economy and the nation—that can linger for many years.  The toll from the financial crisis was severe, with nine million jobs lost and eight million housing foreclosures amid the deepest economic downturn since the Great Depression.  Moreover, the road back has been long and slow.  Despite economic policies oriented toward supporting recovery, it has taken eight years to push the unemployment rate down to a level consistent with the Federal Reserve’s employment objective.  Other residual impacts include the large size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet; significantly higher public debt; and substantial damage to public trust in the nation’s government and financial institutions.  \n\nThe second lesson follows from the first.  We need to ensure that we have a resilient financial system.  To that end, we must ensure that the safeguards put in place in response to the crisis are fully appreciated and respected.  But, it also means that we need to finish the job—for example, by building out a fully workable regime for resolving a complex, global firm if one were to become insolvent.  We need to ensure that our financial system can continue to provide critical services not just during good times, but also during periods of stress. \n\nThese objectives are particularly relevant today, when reopening the Dodd-Frank Act and modifying our regulatory framework are under consideration.  While it is appropriate to evaluate adjustments that might improve our regulatory regime, it is critical that we do not forget the hard-learned lessons of the crisis and—in the haste to reverse course—undermine the robustness and resiliency of the financial system. \n\nThe U.S. Housing Market Boom and Bust\n\nAt the heart of the crisis was the U.S. housing boom and bust.  Between 1997 and 2006, U.S. home prices nearly doubled in real terms on a national basis.  Then, when the boom turned to bust, real home prices reversed course, declining by about 40 percent on a national basis, with larger price declines in several states.2   The magnitude of the national price declines was unprecedented during the postwar period.\n\nThe evolution of the financial crisis illustrates a number of key issues, including the potential hazards of financial innovation, the procyclicality of the financial system, and the importance of confidence in sustaining effective financial intermediation.\n\nThe housing boom resulted from several factors.  Innovations in subprime mortgage lending enabled moderate-income households to purchase homes with negligible down payments.  This led to an increase in the demand for housing, which helped push up home prices.  Home price appreciation masked the potential riskiness of such lending and, in turn, sustained the wisdom of the easier underwriting standards.  As long as home values were rising, subprime borrowers could either refinance their loans or sell their homes when the initial teaser rates expired.  Thus, losses on subprime and other mortgage lending were low, reinforcing the belief that such loans were “safe.” \n\nEasier mortgage underwriting practices were also supported by the ability of mortgage originators to pool their mortgages into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), transforming low-quality assets into triple-A-rated securities.  Investors, including banks, relied too heavily on credit ratings and didn’t do sufficient due diligence on the underlying quality of the assets and the assumptions that underpinned the triple-A ratings.  Implicit in these ratings was the assumption that a large, national decline in home prices was extraordinarily unlikely. \n\nThe rise in home prices led to a surge in construction activity, which helped to sustain the housing boom for a time.  This effect was particularly powerful in states such as Arizona, California, Florida, and Nevada.  Rising home prices also bolstered the economy by supporting consumption, as households monetized these gains by cash-out refinancings and home equity lines of credit. \n\nThe housing boom was also supported by an accompanying financial boom.  The financing activity associated with the surge in mortgage originations and securitizations pushed up the earnings of the major banking and securities firms.  These strong earnings created incentives to ease underwriting standards further. \n\nBut, as housing supply responded to the increase in home prices—housing starts rose from a 1.5 million annual rate in mid-2000 to a 2.3 million annual rate in early 2006—the positive feedback loop began to run in reverse.  Home prices began to soften, subprime borrowers found it more difficult to refinance, and mortgage loan defaults and delinquencies rose.  As the bust got underway in earnest, residential investment declined and consumer spending was undercut as home equity levels fell. \n\nThe housing boom and bust underscores several important lessons.  First, the financial sector is not only a very complex system, but also one that can be inherently unstable—subject to excess, then sharp reversal.  This is especially the case when an important innovation occurs and market participants don’t fully appreciate the powerful feedback loops that first sustain a boom and then contribute to a bust when the process runs in reverse.  This means that we as regulators must continually evaluate the financial system and monitor the landscape for new developments and innovations that, if taken too far, could lead to excess and put the system at risk. \n\nSecond, when there are potential excesses that could threaten financial stability, we should look to temper them.  For example, in the run-up to the financial crisis, macroprudential tools—such as requiring larger down payments or more closely evaluating the incomes of borrowers—could have been implemented to limit the demand for housing.  If such an approach were successful, home prices would not have risen so dramatically, and the subsequent bust would have been less severe.  Another approach would have required financial intermediaries to build stronger capital and liquidity buffers as protection against a housing bust and an economic downturn. \n\nPrior to the financial crisis, the conventional wisdom was that asset bubbles could not be identified in real time—rather, they could only be cleaned up after they burst.  While there are significant challenges to identifying asset bubbles, it is clear that cleaning up only after they burst does not always work out well in practice. \n\nThird, we need to carefully monitor the incentives that govern the behavior of borrowers, savers, and financial intermediaries. \n\nDuring the crisis, some examples of bad incentives that sustained the boom included:\n\nCulmination of the Crisis\n\nOnce the housing bust got underway, stress on the financial system increased sharply as asset prices fell and bank earnings plunged.  In the spring of 2008, such pressures led to a forced sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase.  Later in the year, the government placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship.  In September, Lehman Brothers failed.  And, a day later, AIG was rescued in order to protect the rest of the financial system against further losses and even broader contagion.  With confidence in financial markets and financial intermediaries badly frayed, the Federal Reserve and the U.S. government intervened and provided a range of liquidity backstops, debt guarantees, and capital infusions to forestall a complete collapse of the financial system and the economy. \n\nThe bust exposed many structural flaws in the financial system that exacerbated its instability.  Without being exhaustive, these included the instability of the tri-party repo system, which supported the nation’s short-term funding markets; the risks of runs in the money market mutual fund industry; and the risk of contagion caused by the huge volume of outstanding bilateral (non-centrally cleared) over-the-counter (OTC) derivative obligations between the major financial intermediaries. \n\nThe tri-party repo system was centered on two of the major U.S. banks.  The system matched investors and borrowers each day—with the investors lending cash, secured by Treasuries and other collateral, to the major securities firms.  But, the system was unstable.  In times of stress, clearing banks could be faced with very large single-firm exposures—of potentially hundreds of billions of dollars.  Not surprisingly, when such counterparties became troubled, the clearing banks were less willing to take on these large intraday exposures.  As a result, repo investors, who were primarily worried about getting repaid each morning, were motivated to simply withdraw from the market.  As short-term investors withdrew funding, the liquidity buffer of the troubled securities firm was quickly exhausted, particularly as other counterparties to that firm demanded additional collateral to secure their own exposures. \n\nStructural weaknesses in the money market mutual fund industry—which was a major source of short-term wholesale funding to the securities industry and various non-bank financial corporations—also exacerbated the crisis.  When Lehman Brothers failed, the value of its outstanding short-term obligations collapsed.  The Reserve Primary Fund “broke the buck,” and investors rushed to withdraw their funds from prime institutional money market mutual funds in a modern version of a classic “bank run.”  The funds generally did not have sufficient cash available to meet these runs because they offered overnight liquidity at par value against a portfolio of assets with weighted average maturities that were considerably longer. \n\nAnother important source of instability was the large volume of bilateral OTC derivatives positions outstanding among the major firms and the right of a firm to immediately close out such positions if their counterparty became insolvent.  For example, when Lehman Brothers failed in September 2008, counterparties to Lehman terminated OTC derivatives in which the contract was in the money (i.e., Lehman owed money to the counterparty) and liquidated the collateral held against those obligations, but kept open obligations in which the exposure went the other way, from them to Lehman.  Not only did this create an imbalance in the risk exposures of the failed firm, but it also generated significant market churn and risk as firms scrambled to rebalance their own risk exposures.  The contagion generated by the complex web of outstanding bilateral OTC derivative exposures significantly worsened the crisis and was responsible for much of the losses Lehman incurred in its bankruptcy.3  \n\nThe near-collapse of the U.S. financial system underscores three critical lessons. \n\nFirst, financial institutions must be robust to stress.  In particular, they need to have enough capital to be considered solvent even after sustaining significant losses, so that they can maintain the market access needed to recapitalize.  They also need sufficient liquidity buffers so that they can respond to shocks without having to sell illiquid assets.  The forced sale of illiquid assets can push asset valuations far below their fundamental value, which can increase insolvency risk.  And, it is important that they not be overly reliant on short-term wholesale funding, which can evaporate during times of stress. \n\nSecond, when we identify potential sources of instability that could amplify shocks, we need to make structural changes to the financial system to reduce or eliminate them.  For example, the financial crisis made it clear that changes were needed in how tri-party repo transactions were unwound each day, net asset values were calculated for prime money market mutual funds, and OTC derivative obligations were cleared, settled, and risk-managed. \n\nThird, there should be a viable and predictable resolution regime.  We need to be able to resolve a large, systemically important bank or securities firm in a way that limits contagion and stress on the rest of the financial system, while at the same time protecting the taxpayer against loss. \n\nMeanwhile, central counterparties (CCPs)—through which most standardized OTC derivatives must now be cleared—need to be open for business for the financial system to operate effectively.  Here, the emphasis should be on ensuring that these financial market utilities can open for business the day after the failure of one or more of their participants.  Credible resolution regimes for large banks and securities firms—and credible recovery regimes for CCPs and other critical financial market utilities—should help support confidence during times of stress. \n\nThese measures would make the financial system less prone to booms and busts.  Financial intermediaries would be more robust to stress when busts inevitably occur, and contagion to the broader system would be reduced when a systemically important firm fails.  Such changes should reduce the likelihood of the failure of a large, systemically important firm and the negative consequences of such a failure on the broader financial system.  These steps should help to ensure that credit flows can be sustained throughout the business cycle.\n\nConsiderable Progress\n\nSo, where are we relative to what is needed?  As I see it, there has been considerable progress.  The nation’s largest banks are much safer as a result of substantially higher capital and liquidity requirements, as well as robust stress tests.  This enhanced resiliency has been achieved without a significant negative impact on the broad availability of credit—recognizing that it is now more difficult for households with low credit scores to obtain a mortgage.  Most importantly, improving the capacity of such firms to continue to lend during times of stress should make the overall economy more stable. \n\nWe have also made significant progress in addressing many of the structural weaknesses uncovered by the financial crisis.  Money market reform has made the prime money market mutual fund industry smaller and safer.  The elimination of the net asset value convention for institutional prime money market mutual funds has made these funds smaller and less prone to runs during times of crisis.4   The tri-party repo system has been made more stable as intraday exposures of the large clearing banks have been dramatically reduced.5   This means that they have less reason to back away from a firm if it were to become troubled.  And, firms are much less reliant on short-term wholesale funding. \n\nWe have also reduced the amount of risk in the system by requiring that most standardized OTC derivatives be cleared through CCPs, where multilateral netting occurs.6   In a centrally cleared regime, major intermediaries have net exposures to individual CCPs that replace much larger bilateral exposures to other financial intermediaries.  Of course, this means putting more eggs in the CCP basket.  So, it is particularly important now to closely watch that basket.7 Greater oversight of CCPs is necessary to ensure that they have good governance, sound risk management, robust technological infrastructures, and adequate liquidity support.  In addition, we have made considerable progress in developing a viable resolution regime for large, systemically important banks and securities firms. \n\nMore Work Is Still Needed\n\nYet, we should not be complacent, as there are important areas where our work is not complete.8   Relative to other countries, the United States has limited ability to implement effective macroprudential tools.  That is because oversight is shared by several different entities, and the power to implement macroprudential tools is constrained.  Another challenge is the diverse structure of the U.S. financial system, in which non-banks and capital markets play a substantial role in credit intermediation.  Although the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) could conceivably play a greater role here, whether it will be able to do so effectively remains uncertain. \n\nAnother issue that needs attention is the ability to resolve large, complex financial firms that operate on a global basis.  The framework of requiring such firms to hold a large buffer of debt that could be converted into equity at the time of non-viability is an important step forward.  But, the task of operationalizing this on a global basis in a way that is fully credible to these firms’ customers and counterparties has not been completed.  Achieving clarity about the roles and responsibilities of home and host country authorities is still a work in progress. \n\nThe Federal Reserve’s lack of authority to lend to a major securities dealer that gets into difficulty is another outstanding issue.  The Dodd-Frank Act narrowed the Federal Reserve’s authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act.  No longer can the Federal Reserve lend to an individual securities firm or non-bank financial intermediary.  Such authority may not be as necessary now that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has the power to lend under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act and firms are required to have sufficient resources to support their resolution plans.  But, I would prefer having such a tool available in extremis given the potential need to buy time for coordination and critical decision-making.  I think it is important to ensure that one can “get to the weekend.”  Finally, the work needed to ensure that CCPs can always recover has not yet been completed.  This is an issue of increased importance given that their role in the financial system has become more prominent.\n\nWhere the Pendulum May Have Swung Too Far\n\nAt the same time, there are some areas where the pendulum may have swung too far, where the costs of regulation—including compliance costs and the potential impact on the provision of services—are likely to exceed the benefits.  In this vein, I favor regulatory relief for smaller banking organizations.  First, such firms individually are not systemically important, and therefore do not pose a significant risk to the viability of the U.S. financial system.  Second, the regulatory burdens on smaller firms can be heavy because they don’t have the scale over which compliance and other regulatory costs can be spread.  Regulatory requirements should be appropriately calibrated to avoid inadvertently creating a competitive advantage for larger financial firms. \n\nI also think that the Volcker rule could be modified so that its implementation would be less burdensome.  As I see it, regulators could review the criteria for permissible market-making.  Trading activity should be viewed as market-making when it is customer-facing and inventories are not excessively large or stale.  Market-making serves an important function, and it is important that trading desks can intervene and buy during flash crashes or sell during flash surges.  Permitting this could provide greater liquidity and stability to financial markets.  I would also exempt smaller banking institutions from the Volcker rule since they rarely, if ever, engage in proprietary trading. \n\nDo No Harm\n\nMany speculate that Congress will make changes to the Dodd-Frank Act.  If the scope is confined mainly to small bank relief and adjusting how the Volcker rule is applied, I have no objection.  But, because the Dodd-Frank Act addresses many of the key lessons of the crisis, I think it appropriate that changes be made carefully—with a paring knife, rather than with a meat cleaver.  Here, I would underscore the importance of preserving higher capital and liquidity requirements for systemically important banks; Title VII, which mandates the central clearing of standardized OTC derivatives; and Title VIII, which gives the Federal Reserve an oversight role for financial market utilities that are systemically important, and which helps promote more uniform risk management standards. \n\nWhile Title II gives the FDIC the authority to resolve a large, complex financial firm by converting its debt into equity and establishing a new holding company, I do not think this is necessarily the only way to have a viable resolution regime.  However, if Title II were to be eliminated, then the Bankruptcy Code would need to be bolstered.  There are two essential requirements: the ability to initiate an effective resolution strategy over the weekend, and a government entity—be it the Federal Reserve or the FDIC—that can provide a credible liquidity backstop to the recapitalized entity when it opens for business on Monday morning.  If resolution cannot be accomplished in this timeframe, confidence would suffer and there would be contagion.  Without a credible liquidity backstop, clients and counterparties would run, making it much more difficult for the recapitalized firm to conduct its business. \n\nI would also preserve the authority of the FSOC to designate non-banking firms as systemically important and subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve.  As I see it, the designations of GE Capital and AIG were successful in two important respects.  First, Federal Reserve supervision resulted in improved corporate governance and risk management. Second, it created incentives for the firms to alter their operations to become less systemically important in order to be de-designated.  We should also retain this designation tool because we cannot predict which firms and activities may emerge and become systemically important in the future.  After all, I do not think many were focused on or worried about the activities of AIG’s Financial Products Group several years before the financial crisis, though in retrospect those activities proved to be systemically important.  That part of the firm should have been better supervised and regulated. \n\nSumming Up\n\nIn conclusion, as we reflect on potential changes to the U.S. regulatory regime, we should not lose sight of the horrific damage caused by the financial crisis, including the worst recession of our lifetimes and millions of people losing their jobs and homes.  We had a woefully inadequate regulatory regime in place, and while it is much better now, there is still work to do.  We should finish the job as quickly as possible, and we should do no harm as we adjust our regulatory regime to make it more efficient. \n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions."

        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/pot171106",
        "content": "I’d like to thank the European Central Bank (ECB), both for inviting me to give this keynote address and for organizing this conference on money markets, monetary policy implementation, and central bank balance sheets. I’d also like to congratulate all of the presenters and discussants, whose engaging research and critiques help to foster a deeper understanding of some of the many policy implementation issues central bankers face as we digest past challenges and prepare for future ones.\n\nThis conference comes as several major central banks reached milestones using their balance sheets as active tools for providing monetary policy accommodation. The ECB just announced it will extend its bond purchasing program but scale back the pace of purchases starting next year. The Bank of England completed purchases under its Gilts and Corporate Bond Purchases schemes and confirmed an upcoming close to the drawdown period for its Term Funding Scheme. And the Federal Reserve has begun to reduce its sizable holdings of securities, built up through large-scale asset purchase programs (LSAPs) over the past decade.\n\nMy comments today will focus on the role that asset purchases may play in a central bank’s toolkit for implementing monetary policy. I will briefly review how the Federal Reserve successfully adapted its operating framework to be able to achieve interest rate control with a large balance sheet and began its gradual and predictable balance sheet normalization program. Then, in thinking about the prospective use of asset purchases in providing additional monetary policy accommodation at the zero lower bound in the future, I will reflect on some lessons from the Fed’s experience. Among other lessons, we have learned that asset purchases have clear benefits at the zero lower bound, perhaps with more limited costs than initially raised; that we had greater-than-expected capacity to conduct large purchases without harming market functioning; and that credible communications about use of the balance sheet and expectations for short-term interest rates support adjustments in market pricing and smooth monetary policy transmission. As always, the views presented here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s Asset Purchases and Operating Regime\n\nThe severity of the global financial crisis that began in 2007 challenged central banks to use both conventional and unconventional measures to address the economic effects of the crisis and the sluggish recovery that followed. Using its conventional tool for easing the stance of monetary policy, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC or Committee) lowered its target for the federal funds rate in a series of steps from 5¼ percent in mid-2007 to a range of zero to ¼ percent in December 2008. With short-term interest rates effectively constrained at their lower bound, the FOMC provided further monetary policy easing with two unconventional tools: Forward guidance on the expected future path of overnight interest rates and asset purchase programs aimed at putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, supporting mortgage markets, and making broader financial conditions more accommodative.2 Purchases of longer-term Treasury securities, agency debt, and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) expanded the size, duration, and interest rate and prepayment risk profile of the Fed’s domestic securities portfolio.3\n\nIn total, from 2008 through 2014, the FOMC undertook three rounds of LSAPs, resulting in an extraordinary expansion in the size of the Fed’s balance sheet—from around $900 billion (6 percent of U.S. nominal GDP) before the crisis, to $4.5 trillion (23 percent of GDP) today.4 For all but a brief period of that time and until last month, the FOMC maintained the face value of its securities holdings by reinvesting principal payments received on securities held in its portfolio. I will discuss reinvestments more specifically later.\n\nThese purchases were funded primarily by increasing the stock of reserve balances in the banking system, which compelled changes in the operating framework the Fed uses to achieve interest rate control.5 With an abundant supply of reserve balances, variations in their supply—the mechanism through which the Fed implemented monetary policy before the crisis—would no longer cause meaningful changes in federal funds rates or other money market rates. Implementation of monetary policy therefore required a new operational approach.\n\nThe Fed’s current policy implementation framework uses a system of rates that it directly administers to influence the level of short-term interest rates, without needing to actively adjust the supply of reserves. Specifically, the Fed uses the rate of interest paid on excess reserves (IOER) held by depository institutions as its primary tool for keeping the federal funds rate in its target range. It supplements this tool by offering overnight reverse repos (ON RRPs) at a specified offering rate to a broad set of counterparties, including eligible money market funds, government-sponsored enterprises, primary dealers, and banks.6 Together, IOER and ON RRPs set a floor on rates, beneath which bank and nonbank financial institutions with access to these facilities should be unwilling to lend funds.7\n\nThis framework has been working very well. Since December 16, 2015, when the FOMC began the process of normalizing the stance of monetary policy, it has raised its federal funds target range four times to a current range of 1 to 1¼ percent. The effective federal funds rate (EFFR) has been within the FOMC’s prevailing target range on all but one day, and changes in the federal funds rate continue to transmit in a predictable and effective way to other money market rates.8\n\nBalance Sheet Normalization Commences…\n\nWith normalization of the level of the federal funds rate well underway and interest rate control effectively established, the FOMC has now begun the process of normalizing the Fed’s balance sheet, using a program described this past June in an addendum to its Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.9 Specifically, as of last month, the FOMC is gradually reducing the Fed’s securities holdings by decreasing its reinvestment of principal payments received from those securities, with payments being reinvested only to the extent that they exceed gradually rising caps.10\n\nThis process for reducing the balance sheet will run in the background, while changes in the target range for the federal funds rate are the FOMC’s primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. However, the FOMC said it would be prepared to resume reinvestments if a “material deterioration in the economic outlook were to warrant a sizable reduction in the Committee’s target for the federal funds rate,” and it would be prepared to use its “full range of tools, including altering the size and composition of its balance sheet, if future economic conditions were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the federal fund rate.” These conditions help identify the types of circumstances that might lead to some adjustments in the balance sheet normalization process, although Chair Yellen has noted there is a high bar for altering the balance sheet’s current course.11\n\nThe FOMC’s balance sheet reduction strategy lays out a gradual and predictable path for portfolio runoff, which should reduce the risk that balance sheet normalization will generate undesirably large asset price reactions, volatility, or disruptions to financial markets or Treasury debt issuance.12 That strategy—together with the FOMC’s steady communications throughout 2017 as the Committee developed it well in advance of implementing any change in policy—has helped to keep market expectations closely aligned with the FOMC’s intentions. The market response to the commencement of the Fed’s balance sheet reduction has been calm. The removal of policy accommodation associated with the Fed’s securities portfolio reductions should over time be expected to put some upward pressure on longer-term interest rates.13 However, the relatively muted increase in term premiums seen so far may in part reflect the non-zero probability that market participants assign to the FOMC deploying the balance sheet again if future economic conditions were to warrant more monetary easing than could be achieved solely through reductions in the federal funds rate, consistent with the FOMC’s normalization plan guidance.14\n\n… But where is it Headed?\n\nThe FOMC has started the process of normalizing the Fed’s balance sheet and has provided some general guideposts. The Policy Normalization Principles and Plans state that the Committee intends for the Federal Reserve, in the longer run, to hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy “efficiently and effectively,” and that it will hold primarily Treasury securities. In the June addendum, the FOMC noted that reducing the Fed’s securities holdings will result in a declining supply of reserve balances, and that it anticipates reducing the quantity of reserve balances to a level “appreciably below that seen in recent years but larger than before the financial crisis.”\n\nNew York Fed staff projections for possible paths of the Fed’s securities portfolio—constructed using a distribution of market participants’ surveyed expectations for the future size of the Fed’s balance sheet (conditional on not moving to the zero lower bound at any point between now and 2025), along with some staff modeling to fill in details—suggest it will take at least several years for the balance sheet to reach its “normal” size.15 Uncertainty about the time of normalization arises from numerous sources, including future levels and variability of demand for different types of Fed liabilities, the pace at which the agency MBS portfolio will pay down, and of course the economic outlook.\n\nAssuming that balance sheet normalization continues uninterrupted, it seems likely that the future balance sheet size will be driven largely by changes in longer-run demand for Fed liabilities—in contrast to the asset-driven balance sheet of the past decade. The FOMC explains in the June addendum that reserve balances will be driven by the banking system’s demand for reserves and the Committee’s decisions about how to implement monetary policy in the future. Banks’ experiences during the crisis, structural changes in the banking system, and post-crisis changes in financial regulations will likely increase the level and variability of the demand for reserves relative to before the crisis, but we don’t currently know the precise shape and position of banks’ demand curves. The FOMC has said that it expects to learn more about the underlying demand for reserves during the process of balance sheet normalization. In addition, the FOMC will need to decide what type of operating regime it wishes to run in the future—namely, whether it believes it will be efficient and effective continuing to use a reserve-abundant operating system (albeit with less abundance than seen at present) or returning to a reserve-scarce system, as the Fed used before the crisis. In sizing up the balance sheet, policymakers will also need to take into account several important non-reserve liabilities that are largely outside the immediate direct control of the Fed.16\n\nOn the asset side of the balance sheet, the normalized size of the securities portfolio is one whose level is consistent with the balance sheet’s longer-run trend. However, even once the Fed normalizes the size of its balance sheet and securities portfolio, the composition of its securities portfolio will not yet be “normal.” The projections I mentioned earlier—which assume ongoing implementation of the FOMC's capped portfolio reduction strategy—estimate that the domestic securities portfolio could contain more than $1 trillion in agency MBS at the time the balance sheet reaches a normalized size, even though the FOMC has indicated a preference to hold primarily Treasury securities in the longer run. Meanwhile, the maturity profile of the Treasury portfolio at that time is projected to be more skewed towards longer-term holdings than it was before the crisis, when the Fed held one-third of its portfolio in Treasury bills, and about two-thirds of its holdings matured in less than three years.17\n\nA Role for Asset Purchases at the Zero Lower Bound\n\nAs they digest the experience of the past decade, policymakers, academics, and market participants are engaged in an active dialogue on appropriate monetary policy strategies and the role of unconventional policy tools in future zero lower bound episodes.18 Amid widespread concerns of a secular decline in nominal interest rates, this is not just a theoretical discourse. The median of FOMC participants’ projections for the longer-run value of the nominal federal funds rate is currently 2¾ percent, leaving little room to ease the stance of policy through changes in overnight rates. As a result, the likelihood of a return to the zero lower bound is, in Chair Yellen’s words, “uncomfortably high, even in the absence of a major financial or economic crisis.”19\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Chair Yellen has expressed her views on the Fed’s monetary policy implementation tools. She suggests that whenever possible, influencing short-term interest rates should be the Fed’s primary policy lever, but that enhanced forward rate guidance and asset purchases should be considered again if that conventional tool reaches its limit, as would be the case if a future economic downturn drove short-term rates back to the zero lower bound. This view is consistent with her 2016 Jackson Hole remarks, where she presented analysis making the case that the Fed’s use of forward guidance and asset purchases could improve macroeconomic outcomes on average in zero lower bound episodes, and indicated that she expected these tools to remain “important components” of the Fed’s policy toolkit.20\n\nThe FOMC itself has not made any formal decisions about the Fed’s long-run monetary policy implementation framework. However, minutes from a November 2016 discussion about potential choices of policy rates, operating regimes, and balance sheet policies indicate that a number of policymakers viewed expansion of the balance sheet as an “important tool” to provide macroeconomic stimulus in situations in which overnight interest rates were at their effective lower bound.21 This approach is consistent with the balance sheet reaction function described in the June addendum to the FOMC's Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nOf course, whether and under what circumstances the FOMC would again activate large-scale asset purchases are ultimately decisions for future policymakers. But, to the extent they remain a possible tool for providing additional monetary easing when overnight interest rates fall to the zero lower bound, it is worth considering some lessons about their use. Some personal observations follow.\n\nLesson 1: LSAPs Had Clear Benefits at the Zero Lower Bound\n\nEstimates of the magnitude and persistence of the effects of the Fed’s purchase programs vary, as do assessments of the relative importance of the possible channels through which such programs are believed to work. However, research largely provides evidence that the Fed’s asset purchases put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and eased broader financial conditions, helping to improve macroeconomic outcomes.22 Studies of asset purchase programs conducted by other advanced economy central banks also show positive results. In his survey of the range of research results, Joe Gagnon finds roughly similar median results for studies focusing on programs in the United States, United Kingdom, and euro area—citing a median effect of about a 50-basis-point reduction in 10-year yields for a purchase equal to 10 percent of GDP.23\n\nRegarding costs, in a recent exploration of strategies for defeating the zero lower bound, former Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke dispels some of the common critiques of balance sheet programs (which he calls quantitative easing).24 He points to unrealized worries about an upsurge in inflation, collapse of the dollar, currency war, and rise in household leverage, and he questions the effects in promoting asset bubbles and inequality. He notes that fiscal risks associated with quantitative easing must be balanced against benefits of tools that enhance policymakers’ ability to meet their policy objectives in the face of a serious economic downturn or disinflation.\n\nLesson 2: The Fed Could Control Interest Rates Even with a Large Balance Sheet\n\nAn additional concern—that the Fed would not be able to control interest rates with a large balance sheet—proved to be surmountable. As I described earlier, the Fed successfully introduced new tools and counterparty relationships into a new operating regime that delivers interest rate control irrespective of the level of reserve balances in the banking system. In the event policymakers contemplate asset purchases again in the future, they should be able to undertake them with confidence that balance sheet expansion will not compromise the Fed’s ability to effectively implement monetary policy when the time comes to lift rates from the zero lower bound.\n\nLesson 3: The Fed Could Purchase Large Amounts of Securities without Damaging the Market\n\nAbsent a conflicting policy objective, a central bank should aim to promote good market functioning in its operations to help ensure effective transmission to the rest of the financial system. This objective is a vital one for the Fed because of the importance of the U.S. Treasury market as a global benchmark. As such, the staff of the New York Fed’s Open Market Trading Desk considered how to execute asset purchase programs in ways that avoided harming market structures and activity.25 If the Fed became too dominant a buyer or holder, it could have reduced the tradeable supply of targeted securities and discouraged trading among market participants, leading to diminished liquidity and price discovery. A significant deterioration in liquidity could lead investors to demand a premium for transacting in these markets, ultimately raising borrowing costs and undermining the program’s policy goal.\n\nI do not believe the Fed’s purchase programs had any unintended adverse effects on market functioning. In fact, over time, we learned that we were able to purchase in larger sizes and faster paces than perhaps initially expected. Secondary market purchases of Treasury securities reached about $100 billion per month during the second LSAP program (a time when proceeds from agency debt and MBS were being reinvested in Treasuries), and we doubled our per-issue concentration limit from 35 percent to 70 percent. Meanwhile, monthly purchases of agency MBS were successfully ramped up from a pace of $25 billion per month for just reinvestments in the first half of 2012 to more than $70 billion per month later that year when additional purchases under the third LSAP program were also conducted. This volume represented a substantial share of monthly gross issuance.26 Staff actively monitored indicators of market functioning available in the broader market and through our own operations for signs of any material deterioration.27 As necessary, we modified our operational schedules (while still meeting the policy directive we were given) to ensure smooth functioning, such as periods of ramping up or winding down purchase programs.\n\nThe Fed also put in place active policies to help prevent market dysfunction as a result of its operations. Preventive measures included concentration limits on holdings of individual Treasury securities and prohibitions against purchasing some specific, highly-demanded securities. Agency MBS purchases were eventually targeted at newly issued, to-be-announced (TBA) securities, which tend to be the most liquid and readily available.28 Further, we spread our agency MBS purchases out across multiple settlement months and used dollar rolls to facilitate the orderly settlement of unsettled purchases.29 As a more general practice, the Fed actively promotes market functioning by running a securities lending program through which primary dealers can borrow Treasury and agency debt securities held in the Fed’s portfolio.\n\nLesson 4: Reinvestments Matter\n\nRelatively quickly, the Fed came to learn that the reinvestment of principal payments received from securities held in its portfolio represented a distinct balance sheet tool that could help to maintain the FOMC’s desired level of monetary policy accommodation. The FOMC initially allowed agency debt and agency MBS acquired in the first LSAP program to run off as principal was repaid. However, as purchases ended, a decline in mortgage rates generated increased refinancing activity that accelerated repayments of principal on agency MBS held by the Fed. The resultant reduction in the Fed’s agency MBS holdings pushed a large supply of securities into the hands of private investors, putting upward pressure on longer-term interest rates. In August 2010, after considering the implications for financial conditions and the economic outlook of not reinvesting these repayments, the FOMC announced it would reinvest principal payments from these securities in longer-term Treasury securities. Then, in September 2011, the FOMC announced that repayments from these securities would instead be reinvested in agency MBS to help support conditions in mortgage markets.30 The FOMC then maintained reinvestments, including Treasury rollovers, until commencing balance sheet normalization last month.31\n\nKeeping the Fed’s holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels helped to maintain accommodative financial conditions as economic conditions strengthened. This is because, in addition to the acquisition of securities through asset purchases, the period over which the central bank intends to hold its securities helps to shape market participants’ expectations about the size and duration of assets available to the public. Extending the holding period through reinvestments prolongs this so-called stock effect. The 2010 episode when the Fed was not reinvesting agency-related principal payments demonstrated both term premium effects that might have been expected to be associated with a reduction in the Fed’s securities holdings and the risks associated with an unexpected increase in the publicly-held stock of agency MBS. As we normalize the size of the balance sheet, maintaining redemption caps throughout the process (and continuing to reinvest any principal payments received in excess of those caps) provides an insurance mechanism that limits the amount of variation in the pace at which securities, particularly mortgages, will flow back into private hands.\n\nLesson 5: Credible Communications Influence the Effectiveness of Asset Purchase Programs\n\nAs a general matter, monetary policy transmits more smoothly when market participants are able to understand and anticipate central bank actions. Managing market expectations about monetary policy implementation takes on even more importance in the challenging environment posed by the zero lower bound. Both in shifting into a regime that uses the balance sheet as an active tool for policy implementation and then shifting away from such use, there is an important interaction that the settings of overnight rates, forward guidance on those rates, and balance sheet configurations have on overall financial conditions. Having clear and credible communications that help market participants understand the central bank’s intended use of these tools can thus affect overall program effectiveness. Indeed, a central bank’s clarity around how it would pursue its goals at the zero lower bound can, in itself, produce a more stable environment with fewer and shorter trips to the zero lower bound.32 And even at the zero lower bound, the speed and accuracy with which market participants understand the central bank’s reaction function could contribute to better macroeconomic outcomes.33\n\nMy analysis takes its cue from the framework proposed by Chair Yellen, where unconventional policy tools are deployed to provide additional policy accommodation at the zero lower bound, and a supposition that balance sheet expansion would be introduced if the zero bound is viewed to be more restrictive than can be mitigated by forward guidance alone, just as they were during the financial crisis and subsequent recession.\n\nCommunications are central to the two primary channels through which balance sheet policies are believed to work. First, balance sheet policies can serve as a signaling device that strengthens forward guidance and reduces expectations for the path of short-term interest rates. Putting actions behind its words—either through new asset purchases or by maintaining reinvestments—helps the central bank to establish a credible commitment to maintaining monetary easing.34 Second, balance sheet actions transmit through a portfolio balance channel, which—through the stock effect I described earlier—reduces term and risk premiums embedded in bond yields by reducing the supply of long-term bonds in the market. Many studies conclude that this channel is likely the dominant one.\n\nWith this in mind, the central bank should provide clear guidance at the start of its purchase program about its intended purchase and reinvestment plans—either in quantitative or qualitative, state-contingent terms—and then follow through on this commitment.35 It seems sensible for the central bank to buy assets as quickly as possible, contingent on economic developments and no disruption to market functioning.36 Once purchases have been completed, the central bank should then hold the assets for as long as it says it plans to—including maintaining its holdings through reinvestments, as appropriate—to align realized actions with market participants’ expectations, again contingent on economic developments.37\n\nBy making purchases state-contingent—that is, tying their size or pace explicitly to the achievement of broader macroeconomic objectives or other conditions—like the Fed did in its third LSAP program and with reinvestments following liftoff, the central bank can help market participants understand its balance sheet reaction function and expected changes in the public stock of assets.38 However, policymakers must also consider how market participants understand the central bank’s approach to its balance sheet in conjunction with its guidance on the overnight policy rate. Failure to adequately distinguish between the two tools can lead to spillovers and undesirable outcomes. A cautionary example is the 2013 “taper tantrum,” when Chairman Bernanke’s announcement of an eventual cessation in asset purchases was interpreted by market participants as signaling a sooner-than-expected increase in short-term interest rates, prompting sharp and unexpected declines in asset prices. Guidance that provides clarity around both short-term interest rates and the balance sheet might help to anchor interest rate expectations—for example by indicating while purchases continue that the central bank intends to maintain overnight interest rates at low levels even after the completion of asset purchases.39\n\nLesson 6: Focus on One Tool during Normalization\n\nUncertainty associated with managing multiple tools and the degree of substitutability between them poses possible challenges in removing policy accommodation after a zero lower bound episode, as the central bank switches from conducting policy with one lever to another. It therefore seems prudent to take a gradual approach to normalization, emphasizing one tool at a time.\n\nThe Fed’s adopted normalization approach has thus far been an effective one. Starting to raise rates first, and waiting to start reducing the balance sheet until normalization in the level of overnight rates is well underway, has helped to ensure that the economic recovery is sufficiently advanced before making changes to the balance sheet.40 This strategy has reduced the likelihood that an unexpected adverse shock to the economy not long after the start of policy tightening would have necessitated a return to the zero lower bound on the federal funds rate and potentially a reversal in balance sheet normalization. Instead, the FOMC’s approach promotes the use of the federal funds rate as the active monetary policy instrument—an instrument with which it has much greater experience, likely helping to minimize the risk of an error in the early and still-vulnerable stages of the economy’s recovery.41\n\nRunning down the balance sheet passively, in a gradual and predictable manner, once normalization of short-term interest rates is well underway puts the balance sheet’s normalization in the background. The stock view of central bank purchase programs holds that given an expected path of the portfolio, the pace of actual changes in the portfolio should have little direct effect on asset prices. Assuming markets anticipate a gradual unwind in the portfolio, asset prices would adjust gradually over time. Nevertheless, central banks may wish to mitigate any possible risk that flow effects associated with overly fast flows of securities into private hands interfere with monetary policy implementation or disrupt market functioning. A conservative feature in the Fed’s approach is therefore a one-year transition period during which gradually rising redemption caps are phased in, thus allowing financial markets and the U.S. Treasury time to adjust to the Fed’s declining market presence.\n\nThese design features likely enhance overall program effectiveness. However, this outcome is traded off against a more rapid achievement of balance sheet normalization—something some policymakers might hold as a desirable objective. For example, they might see a smaller balance sheet as one that offers greater capacity for using asset purchases more fully again in the future. Such capacity may be a concern given the risk that a more normal portfolio size and composition may not be reached before an adverse shock brings short-term rates back to their effective lower bound, perhaps warranting renewed balance sheet expansion.42 This risk may be particularly pronounced in a low neutral rate environment. In principle, asset sales could accelerate normalization of the size and composition of the balance sheet, but the market effects of long-duration asset sales could be uncertain, and sales could affect the path of short-term rates.43 Moreover, a central bank that does not hold the assets it has purchased as long as market participants anticipate could lose credibility, making future asset purchases less effective.\n\nThe central bank must therefore consider the effects of its balance sheet actions in the context of the overall monetary policy setting, including the interplay between changes in the balance sheet and changes in interest rates. Uncertainties related to this relationship help to explain the FOMC’s choice to make changes in overnight rates its main tool for adjusting the stance of monetary policy in the normalization process while balance sheet normalization runs in the background. Still, having both instruments in the central bank’s toolkit raises the importance of clear and cohesive communications about their respective use.\n\nLesson 7: Operational Flexibility is Important\n\nAs I noted earlier, the Fed successfully adapted its operating regime to be able to control interest rates even with a large balance sheet. The FOMC has not decided what kind of operating regime it wishes to run in the long run, but one lesson from the crisis is that not all operating frameworks may be robust to a wide range of circumstances, such as implementing policy at the zero lower bound. If one wished to retain the option that the balance sheet could be deployed as an active tool for policy implementation at this threshold and then gradually revert to a passive role when conditions normalize, then one needs to consider how to transition into and out of different operational modalities. This requires operational flexibility.\n\nA byproduct of a central bank’s portfolio-expanding asset purchase programs is an increased supply of reserve balances in the banking system.44 Thus, once balance sheet tools are deployed, the central bank will find itself operating in a system with reserve abundance if it wasn’t already, and will need to adopt instruments and arrangements that can deliver interest rate control accordingly. This imperative could imply switching operating regimes—from a corridor regime to a floor regime, or from a liability-driven floor to an asset-driven floor—and staying in the new regime for an extended period. Some central banks, such as the ECB, have monetary policy implementation frameworks in which this transition happens relatively seamlessly, while others, such as the Fed before the crisis, required significant changes to tools and operations.\n\nTimeliness of the transition is important, and overly complex transitions —especially if there is little time to prepare—could potentially restrain a central bank’s ability to respond aggressively to rapidly changing economic and financial conditions in a crisis. Perhaps more importantly, delayed transitions could interfere with market expectations about any change in the policy stance, even though appropriately-calibrated expectations, through their effect on market pricing, could be stabilizing and lower the risk of a crisis. Additionally, if a central bank chose to employ a framework that would need to be transitioned, it would need to make sure that the necessary tools were available to facilitate that transition. New tools and practices could potentially require new operational procedures, legal approvals, governance processes, counterparty administration, technological systems, and learning curves for both central bank staff and market participants. Such switching may also be costly for money market participants if resource needs, infrastructure, and expertise dedicated to certain activities change over time.\n\nA separate challenge for the central bank to consider is how to maintain operational and analytical readiness, both to be able to implement monetary policy in different types of operating regimes and to be able to transact in potential markets targeted for asset purchases. For example, the Fed had no operational experience transacting in the agency MBS market prior to the crisis. It initially relied on outside investment advisors to support its first purchase program, before eventually bringing trading operations in house, and then later developing capabilities to conduct auctions on its proprietary auction platform.45\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Federal Reserve and other central banks initially proceeded with asset purchases in a cautious way given that the tool was new. However, I believe we have learned that the benefits are notable and the costs likely less than feared. Moreover, U.S. fixed income markets were able to withstand more sizable purchase operations than we initially anticipated, and we now know that we can successfully maintain interest rate control with a large balance sheet as we raise rates. This experience could give policymakers greater confidence in using this tool to provide additional monetary policy accommodation in future zero lower bound episodes, and give market participants greater confidence in the effectiveness of the tool in mitigating the zero lower bound. With evidence suggesting the neutral fed funds rate has fallen notably, we should continue to absorb lessons from our and other central banks’ experiences. In particular, we will need to consider the importance of communications, how to organize an operating regime that transitions smoothly, and how to maintain operational readiness. As we normalize the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, we continue to proceed cautiously given our lack of experience with this process. I think the gradual and predictable approach the FOMC has adopted has been successful so far, but we will learn more as we proceed and as other central banks reach those milestones as well."

        "content": "Introduction\n\nIt is an honor to join you at the Risk USA 2017 Conference. Thank you for inviting me. As always, the views I will express today are my own. They are not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nI will focus my remarks today on how regulators, supervisors, and market participants, collectively, can come together to address systemic risks. I’m not talking about the risks you manage within your own firm on a day-to-day basis, I’m talking about the risks that we share across the industry, risks that are amplified because of the complexity and interconnectedness of the industry. These risks should be just as important to you as your more typical credit, market, and liquidity risks. Using examples, I hope to illustrate how we reach a better outcome when we are willing to collaborate on identifying, acknowledging, and addressing risks that are beyond our four walls—risks that are systemic in nature and have the potential to negatively impact individual firms, as well as the broader financial sector.\n\nTo illustrate my point, I will use three examples of systemic risks that are in various stages of resolution and the collaboration process. All, you will find, are multi-year, multi-party, and incredibly complex.\n\nExamples\nT+2\n\nI will start with the T+2 initiative to shorten the standard settlement cycle for most U.S. equity trades from three business days after the trade date, known as T+3, to two business days after the trade date, known as T+2. The idea gained momentum after the 2008 global financial crisis as a way for firms to limit the risk associated with a counterparty default. The shorter settlement cycle reduces credit, market and liquidity risk, and as a result, reduces systemic risk for U.S. market participants. Simply put, there is less time for events to disrupt the settlement of securities transactions when they occur faster. It has been said nothing good happens between trade date and settlement date. According to the analysis Boston Consulting Group did for the industry, moving to T+2 settlement produces a net savings of $195 million annually that could be realized through better operational efficiency and direct cost reductions related to NSCC margin charges and liquidity requirements. The change took effect just last month. It was the culmination of a lot of work from various parties—many represented in this room.\n\nThe effort began in earnest in early 2012 when Depository Trust Clearing Corporation (DTCC) published a paper showing its preliminary analysis of shortening the settlement cycle for U.S. equity trades from T+3 to T+2, or even T+1. DTCC was seeking further input from the industry to serve as the basis for a more comprehensive cost-benefit analysis to explore the case for making this change. In December 2013, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) studied the feasibility of moving to T+2. In February of the following year Investment Company Institute (ICI) endorsed the idea, and then in April, SIFMA too supported the move to T+2. A lot of talk was going on at that time to build consensus, but not a lot of action, yet.\n\nIn October 2014 the Industry Steering Committee and Working Group was formed to drive the implementation of T+2. The proposed implementation timeline was recommended after thorough input from more than 600 industry participants across 12 market segments2. By June of 2015, the industry made a formal announcement to move to T+2 and by October, the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Chair, Mary Jo White, publicly supported the move to a two-day settlement cycle.3\n\nFrom the beginning, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has been working integrally with SIFMA and our colleagues at the SEC to help move the industry to pursue this change. All banking and securities markets regulators have been involved, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC),Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), just to name a few. Supervisors monitored various firms’ progress in meeting these objectives by having several outreach meetings over the past two years. Several agencies needed to make some rule changes to facilitate this move, and in March 2017 the SEC finalized its rule changes to, “establish a standard settlement timeframe of two days for U.S. equity, corporate and municipal bond, and unit investment trust (UIT) trades.” This provided regulatory certainty to promote a coordinated and effective industry transition to T+2 in September.\n\nAs a result of this multi-year, highly coordinated effort, we have modernized the U.S. equity market and have eliminated the need for margin to be collected against the millions of trades for a third day. In fact, some estimate that the margin collection by NSCC is approximately 15%-20% lower with T+2 settlement than with T+3 settlement.\n\nMargin Rules\n\nMy second example, which is still ongoing and a work in progress, again takes us back to 2007, when the financial crisis highlighted significant weaknesses in the over-the-counter or OTC derivative markets. These weaknesses include the build-up of large counterparty exposures between market participants that were not appropriately risk-managed; operational weaknesses resulting from a lack of standardization and automation; and limited transparency of the levels of activity and overall size of counterparty credit exposures leading to a loss of confidence in the market.\n\nThese weaknesses led to several key reforms aimed at reducing systemic risk in the OTC derivative markets, as outlined by the G20 leaders. Beginning in 2009 the G20 called for data reporting, electronic trading, and clearing of standardized transactions through central counterparties (or CCPs). In order to achieve full, consistent implementation of the reforms as outlined by the G20, coordination was necessary across dealers, end-users and regulators given the complexity and scope of the effort.\n\nLet me begin with the role of the regulators. The G20 recognized that the reforms should also include margin for all OTC derivative transactions. Given that there were not consistent or widespread practices associated with initial margin, the G20 asked the supervisors and markets regulators to work together to develop standards for margin for non-cleared trades. Following the completion of the principles, regulators needed to work together on a national level to finalize related rules and regulations and globally to ensure consistent implementation timing.\n\nNow let me turn to industry collaboration. Many would agree that the implementation of the margin rules for the market participants is the most complex of the OTC derivatives reforms because it significantly changes each financial institution’s front-to-back office infrastructure, has significant external dependencies and affects all asset classes. I will spend some time on the “significant external dependencies” as these were the most critical for coordination, both for market participants themselves as well as with authorities.\n\nFirst of all, as I noted earlier, the derivatives trades subject to these new rules are bilateral, and governed by a set of legal documents which need to be updated in order to reflect the new rules. In addition, new models to calculate the required amount of margin are needed and must be approved by regulators prior to their use. Finally, external infrastructure, including third-party custodians, are critical to ensure that the collateral would be segregated, as required under the rules.\n\nSo you are probably beginning to see the extent to which coordination has been needed and continues as implementation moves forward. For the legal documentation, market participants worked together through the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) to develop a standard template for the collateral support agreements. Also, the dealers used ISDA as they collaborated to develop an industry model for initial margin. Working together to develop the model allowed the dealers to be able to more consistently calculate the initial margin requirements so that they wouldn’t have disputes associated with every margin call. This model was discussed on an ongoing basis with U.S. regulators, which was particularly instrumental when it came time for the regulators to approve the use of it—they could then focus their time on the firm specific implementation.\n\nRegulators were actively engaged in dialogue with the firms as they worked through these efforts, as well as ongoing coordination amongst themselves, particularly on the model approvals. The nature and extent of the coordination necessary to achieve the exchange of initial and variation margin for non-cleared trades sometimes caused slow decision making either with regard to interpretations of the rules, or signed legal agreements. However without the involvement of all of the parties, the end-result would not have been possible. One of the key lessons was that external dependencies were often the source of the key sticking points that led to missed deadlines as it is difficult to predict perfectly the actions of one’s counterparty, vendor or service provider. That, however, should not be cause to cease coordination which would have certainly led to a demonstrably negative outcome in this case. What did happen, was that market participants acknowledged these uncertainties and worked together to set collective deadlines and earlier deadlines. That meant that this year, when Phase Two went live just last month, firms were ready and trading continued seamlessly.\n\nAs a result of the extensive work undertaken by regulators and market participants, it is estimated that among the largest dealers there is now more than $90 billion of margin held in segregated accounts. Broadly, the system is less leveraged and the margin held protects individual participants against potential systemic effects and risk transmission in the case of an unanticipated market shock.\n\nOpportunities\n\nI discussed one completed effort (T+2) and one that has two completed phases (OTC reforms). Now I want to talk about a potential systemic risk that is still in the early days in terms of coordinated efforts to eliminate or mitigate the issue on an industry-wide basis. It is the area I believe is most in need of our collective attention and collaborative initiatives: cybersecurity. As evidenced in the news over the past few years, and particularly recently, the cyber risk landscape is increasingly complex and continuously evolving. Threat actors, such as cyber criminals and a handful of nation states, have clearly targeted the banking and financial services sector, and are increasing the sophistication of their tools and methods at a breakneck speed. Cybersecurity risks, more so than other risks, extend beyond the confines of each of our organizations. The threats are global, and the impact of attacks can quickly cascade across systems and institutions.\n\nWhile the high degree of interconnectedness of our systems and processes creates a set of distinct risks, I argue that it also lends itself well to collaborative efforts to address these cybersecurity risks.\n\nConsortiums such as FS-ISAC (Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center), a private sector originated organization created in 1999, illustrate the value of collaborative efforts to combat cybersecurity risks. Examples include “Sheltered Harbor,” a data recovery mechanism, and FSARC (Financial Systemic Analysis & Resilience Center) that are currently working on the recovery of wholesale payment activity in the event of a significant data breach.\n\nThe public sector work in this area has proven to be similarly effective and illustrative of the value of collaboration in addressing cybersecurity risks. The FBIIC (Financial & Banking Information Infrastructure Committee) which is chaired by Treasury and includes U.S. financial regulators was formed after the events of 9/11. It is charged with ensuring that there is sufficient protection for our most critical infrastructures and works on solutions with our intelligence agencies to provide the sector with the most up-to-date information on cybersecurity threats.\n\nAs evidenced by the increasing frequency of high profile breaches across the financial services industry, we need to accept that, despite our best efforts to prevent attacks from succeeding, it is unlikely we will be entirely successful in doing so. Improving the resiliency and ability to recover our core and critical systems from a cyber event is now of paramount importance. Cyber breaches bring unique challenges such as determining the integrity of affected systems, and the potential for breaches to cascade as attackers leverage the high degree of interconnectedness within the financial services sector. Going forward, topics such as resiliency and resumption will necessitate our collective focus and collaboration. The previously mentioned Sheltered Harbor initiative is a good step in the right direction and shows that the industry acknowledges the need for these efforts to address the challenges of resiliency and resumption from a cyber-attack against core financial systems. In addition, the table-top exercises many of your firms participate in throughout the year are another example where working together can have beneficial outcomes.\n\nAs an industry, we need to continue to actively support these collaborative initiatives while seeking to foster new ones, as necessary, to address the evolving threat landscape. Industry-wide response and recovery to a cybersecurity incident is an area of particular concern, and one that requires more comprehensive planning, discussion, and of course, collaboration. Typically supervisors, regulators and firms have collaborated to remove or manage risk across the system and ‘response and recovery’ to a cybersecurity incident seems to fit that mold well.\n\nRegulators can do more to better harmonize cybersecurity regulations and frameworks and work is well underway as a result. This will streamline and help clarify regulatory expectations and allow the industry to concentrate more resources on addressing cybersecurity risks. However, harmonizing regulations should not be taken to mean expectations will be lowered.\n\nGiven the threats facing our industry and the types of cyber-attacks we have all seen in the news, now is the time for increased vigilance and attention on key topics that we have not yet fully addressed, such as risks due to interconnectedness, endpoint security, and most importantly cybersecurity incident response and recovery of critical systems and functions.\n\nAll three of these topics (T+2, margin rules, and cybersecurity) can only be addressed via a collaborative approach. There is a lot more work to be done here.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn my last few minutes, I want to leave you with some thoughts and a challenge.\n\nFirst, there are no quick fixes or one-size fits all solutions. Each of the risks we face are complex in their own way and require a commitment to spending the time needed to understand the risk and impact, explore options, and then work together on building and implementing solutions that are in the best interest of all of us—our firms, the financial system, and the real economy.\n\nSecond, I only mentioned three systemic risks that benefited, or can benefit, from collaborative efforts, but there are many more. I want us all to remember that when we address one risk, we can’t put our pencils down and congratulate ourselves on a success. We have to be constantly aware, constantly vigilant, constantly searching for the next systemic risk.\n\nSo, my challenge to you is to continue to work together to identify instances where we need to address shared risks – in other words, where can we do more to make the financial system more resilient by removing or mitigating systemic risks that arise from financial markets? Question the status quo and look beyond the current state to identify future risks that can benefit from greater collaboration.\n\nI look forward to hearing your questions and reactions."

        "content": "Thank you very much.1  I appreciate the invitation to speak to you as part of today’s SUERF conference on “Globalization Dynamics: EU and US Perspectives.”  With events like these, the SUERF aims to foster an active network between professional economists, financial practitioners, central bankers and supervisors.2  Ongoing dialogue between these groups is important to the efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy, and I am glad to have the opportunity to make a small contribution to that dialogue.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced that it would begin to passively reduce the size of its securities portfolio.  This announcement marks the beginning of a multiyear effort to bring the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet to its longer-run size.  In my remarks today, I’d like to offer my views on this policy from a financial markets perspective.\n\nThe message I’d like to leave you with today is one of confidence.  I am confident that the FOMC’s plan will reduce the size of the portfolio in a gradual and predictable, “no surprises” manner.  I am confident that the FOMC’s plan will promote good market functioning in the Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities markets as the portfolio declines, and that it will not prove disruptive to the U.S. mortgage market or the U.S. Treasury’s debt management program. And I am also confident that the plan’s design, and the FOMC’s clear communication prior to the plan’s implementation, will mitigate the risk of sharp or outsized asset price reactions to the decline in the portfolio’s size over time. \n\nI want to expand on this last point.  We cannot and should not prevent Treasury and MBS prices from reacting to relevant economic and financial developments, or indeed from gradually moving over time in response to the progressive decline in the size of the Federal Reserve’s holdings and consequent increase in the amount of securities held by the private sector.  In fact, we actively want asset prices to respond appropriately and fully to economic and financial news.  Over the coming years, such news could span a wide variety of topics, such as central bank policy in this country and abroad, the ongoing debate over fiscal policy, and the evolution of expectations for the longer-run neutral rate of interest.  That said, we do seek to mitigate the risk that our operational actions contribute to unnecessary surprise, disruption, or volatility.  I am confident that the FOMC’s plan appropriately manages this risk.\n\nNow, confidence doesn’t mean certainty: there is always a risk that events could unfold differently from expectations.  In particular, central banks have had little directly relevant past experience with the impact of such a reduction in holdings of domestic securities and in reserves.  One relevant experience, of course, was the 2013 “taper tantrum,” which shows that markets can have outsized reactions to changes in balance sheet policy even before they happen.  Moreover, experience with asset purchase programs, both here and abroad, clearly demonstrates that market volatility can ensue from balance sheet policy changes that market participants perceive as surprising, unclear, or rapid.  All of this indicates to me that, at policy turning points like these, central banks should carefully and clearly communicate their intentions, provide as much transparency as possible, and make transitions in policy implementation as slowly as overall macroeconomic policy objectives permit.\n\nPolicymakers have made it clear that balance sheet normalization is intended to operate in the background, and that the bar is high to making changes to the FOMC’s normalization plan.  That said, the future is uncertain, and as a result the Desk will maintain an appropriate set of capacities should the FOMC deem something different be required to promote the Federal Reserve’s objectives.  We will also continue to gather market intelligence, including through surveys of primary dealers and market participants and through a robust set of statistical data collections, to further policymakers’ understanding of market participants’ expectations for the balance sheet and to monitor market functioning.\n\nThe rest of my speech will go as follows.  First, I’ll provide an in-a-nutshell summary of the structure of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  Then, I will discuss why it is important that the decline in the balance sheet be gradual and predictable, and explain how the FOMC’s plan provides this gradualism and predictability.  I will then talk briefly about how the Federal Reserve is ensuring it is operationally prepared for unexpected developments.  And then I’ll conclude on a slightly different note:  I’ll offer my thoughts on why financial markets seem to have reacted much more calmly to balance sheet news this year than they did during the 2013 “taper tantrum” period.\n\nAs always, these views are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the New York Fed or the Federal Reserve System. \n\nThe Fed’s Balance Sheet, In a Nutshell\n\nLet’s begin by reviewing, at a high level, where the Fed’s balance sheet is today, and where it is likely to go in the coming years.  Although many things about monetary policy are very complex, the basic structure of the balance sheet is actually fairly simple, as is the program of balance sheet normalization.\n\nPanel 1 shows a summary of the Fed’s assets and liabilities, as they are today.  Substantially all of the $4.5 trillion of assets consist of Treasuries and agency MBS.3 On the other side of the balance sheet, the Federal Reserve has three main categories of liabilities: $2.6 trillion of bank reserves and other deposits, $1.5 trillion of paper currency, and about $400 billion of reverse repos.\n\nBefore the crisis, the balance sheet was much smaller.  It reached its present size as a result of the FOMC’s large-scale asset purchase programs, which were undertaken to support the economic recovery by easing financial conditions to a greater extent than could be achieved solely through reducing the federal funds rate, as the FOMC’s ability to provide further monetary accommodation through this instrument was limited by the zero lower bound on interest rates.  These asset purchases had two effects on the balance sheet: they increased the size of the asset portfolio, and they equally increased the size of the Federal Reserve’s liabilities, largely through growing the stock of bank reserves.4\n\nIn addition to being larger than it was before, the balance sheet has a significantly different composition than before the crisis.  On the asset side, the most important change has been the addition of agency MBS.\n\nFor many years, the FOMC has made it clear that it did not intend for the balance sheet to remain at this size forever.5  Instead, through its statements and its Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, it has indicated its intention that the Federal Reserve will, in the longer run, hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively, and that in the longer run it will hold primarily Treasury securities.  Starting in its December 2015 statement, the FOMC also indicated that it anticipated continuing reinvestment until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate was well under way.  The FOMC also indicated, starting in its September 2014 Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, that it intended to reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings in a gradual and predictable manner primarily by ceasing to reinvest repayments of principal on its securities holdings.\n\nThe FOMC’s strategy of waiting to begin normalizing the balance sheet until normalization of the federal funds rate was well under way had several advantages.  Most importantly, it reduced the likelihood that an unexpected adverse shock to the economy not long after the start of policy tightening would have necessitated a return to the zero lower bound on the federal funds rate and potentially a reversal in balance sheet normalization.  Instead, the FOMC’s approach promotes the use of the federal funds rate as the active monetary policy instrument, an instrument with which the FOMC has much greater experience.  In addition, delaying balance sheet normalization allowed the FOMC to meaningfully assess the efficacy of its tools to control short-term interest rates with a large balance sheet, and thereby judge how patient it could afford to be in reducing the balance sheet to its longer-run level.6\n\nFrom an accounting perspective, the decline in the balance sheet will, at a high level, resemble a mirror image of its earlier increase.  We should of course expect to see the amount of assets decline, and this will be matched by a decline in the overall stock of liabilities.  Most of this decline in liabilities will likely take place as a decline in bank reserves.  The size of the balance sheet will be “normalized,” in Federal Reserve parlance, when the FOMC judges that the Federal Reserve is holding no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.\n\nAt that point, the size of the balance sheet might well be “normalized,” but its composition will probably not be. Panel 2 shows a stylized summary presentation of how the Federal Reserve’s assets and liabilities might look when the size of the balance sheet is normalized, drawn from the “median scenario” included in the July 2017 update to our annual report, “Open Market Operations During 2016.”  This presentation is largely based on the median of market participants’ surveyed expectations collected in June, along with some staff modeling to fill in the details, and as such is not an FOMC projection or forecast.  That said, it provides a useful way to illustrate my point. \n\nOn the asset side, in this median scenario, the portfolio would still contain a substantial allocation to agency MBS at the time of normalization, even though the FOMC has, as I noted earlier, indicated a preference to hold primarily Treasury securities in the longer run.  The maturity composition of the Treasury portfolio, not shown in the figure, would be different from what it was before the financial crisis.  On the liability side, at normalization, non-reserve liabilities in the median scenario would be considerably larger than they were pre-crisis.  Some of the growth in the reverse repo programs we have observed since the crisis might be a second-round effect stemming from the growth in reserves, and therefore some decline in this category is possible as the overall balance sheet size declines.  However, my overall read is that much of the increased demand for non-reserve liabilities, particularly currency in circulation, is likely to be persistent past normalization, and indeed demand for reserves is also likely to be higher.7\n\nBut what is the longer-run appropriate size for the balance sheet?  Other than the qualitative guidance I mentioned earlier, and an expectation that the level of reserve balances will be appreciably below that seen in recent years but larger than before the financial crisis, the FOMC has not specified how large the balance sheet should be.8  My colleague Lorie Logan spoke recently on the many technical drivers of this level, which include the mode of policy implementation that the FOMC chooses in the longer run, possible increases in recent years in the financial system’s demand for reserves and Federal Reserve reverse repo liabilities owing to new financial regulations and other factors, and the long-term evolution of demand for paper currency.9 \n\nConsiderations in Reducing the Balance Sheet Size\n\nIn theory, reducing the size of the balance sheet is quite simple.  There are two ways to go about it.10 One approach is to simply let securities holdings mature.  Principal matures on the Fed’s securities holdings all the time:  Treasury bonds mature at specified dates, and agency MBS principal is repaid over time as home loans are paid back.11 For the past several years, the securities portfolio has been maintained at a steady level by reinvesting these principal repayments.12  This activity can be reduced or stopped.  A second approach is to simply sell securities on the open market, using a similar procedure to the way the securities were purchased to begin with.\n\nEither way, the securities end up back in private hands.  This is obvious in the case of sales.  When we don’t reinvest principal repayments on Treasuries, the securities the Federal Reserve would otherwise have bought end up in private hands instead.  And when we don’t reinvest agency MBS principal repayments, this means that any new mortgage that was taken out to fund those repayments ends up being sold to private investors.  While the mechanism varies, the end result, in theory, is largely the same.\n\nSo how should the Fed implement a reduction in the balance sheet size?  The approach should underscore that the balance sheet will be reduced in a way that is gradual and predictable, so as to credibly assure market participants that the balance sheet will decline in a way that avoids surprise, disruption, or volatility.  As part of this, it should be simple, and easy to communicate to the public.\n\nThe FOMC’s plan for normalizing the balance sheet does exactly this.13  It decreases principal reinvestment, an approach which provides for an appropriate pace of reduction in the balance sheet and is quite straightforward to communicate.  It accomplishes this by reinvesting principal maturities only to the extent that they exceed gradually increasing caps.14  For Treasuries, the cap will be $6 billion per month initially and will increase in steps of $6 billion at three-month intervals over 12 months until it reaches $30 billion per month.  Agencies follow a similar pattern, starting at $4 billion and rising in three-month steps to $20 billion.  The FOMC also indicated that it anticipates that these caps will remain in place once they reach their respective maximums.\n\nLet me spend a few minutes discussing the importance of gradualism and predictability, and how the FOMC’s plan achieves these things.\n\nGradualism\n\nTo examine the importance of gradualism, we will need to open, once again, the theoretical debate about “stock” and “flow” effects of central bank asset purchases and sales.15  Under the “stock view,” transitions in the pace of central banks’ asset flows should have little direct effect on asset prices.  Instead, what matters to asset prices is the present and expected future stock of assets the central bank holds, or is anticipated to hold.  The “flow view” suggests instead that the effect on asset prices relates to the pace at which assets are being added or removed from the balance sheet at that time. \n\nMany speeches have been given, and journal articles published, about the relative importance of these effects with respect to their impact on financial conditions and the broader economy, a topic that I do not intend to wade into today.16  Instead, I think it’s important to make a few points on “flow effects” relevant to policy implementation, and in particular related to possible “flow effects” associated with an overly rapid pace. \n\nOverly fast flows of securities into private hands can be disruptive to market functioning.  In particular, there is evidence that the agency MBS market, due to the nature of its trading conventions, is prone to dislocation when market participants expect large transitions in central bank agency MBS flows.17 Such concerns can be self-fulfilling: if market participants are concerned that an abrupt shift in flow might be disruptive, they might, for example, withdraw from liquidity provision.  An overly fast redemption flow of Treasuries could also create challenges in the government’s management of public debt auctions and result in communications challenges.18\n\nA sustained portfolio runoff at an overly fast pace could also shrink the balance sheet so quickly that it impacts other aspects of monetary policy implementation.  Rapid portfolio declines could have unforeseen impacts on overnight money markets, for example by creating significant shifts in dealers’ demand for overnight repo financing.  We have seen such impacts in the past. During the Maturity Extension Program, the Federal Reserve sold substantial amounts of shorter-dated Treasuries.  Some of these securities accumulated in dealers’ inventories, and secured financing rates rose a bit as dealers sought to finance these holdings.  This sort of volatility did not, and would not now, pose a major problem to markets or policy implementation, but it is something worth avoiding if possible.  Rapid portfolio runoff could also make it more likely that bank reserves become scarce unexpectedly or more quickly than policymakers had anticipated.\n\nFinally, overly fast portfolio runoff could introduce undesired noise into financial conditions.  Policymakers have indicated that they want the portfolio’s size to decline “in the background,” and that the federal funds rate be the primary instrument of monetary policy.  Rapid portfolio runoff could lead market participants to overestimate the total decline that will occur in the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings, and thereby accelerate the rise in term or mortgage risk premia associated with balance sheet normalization.  This could complicate policymakers’ economic forecasting and make it more challenging to determine and communicate the appropriate monetary policy stance. \n\nThe FOMC’s plan addresses these concerns about gradualism in two ways.  First, it begins at a low rate of redemption, increases this slowly and in small amounts, and then continues at a specified maximal rate of runoff. These amounts should result in transitions that are within the market’s capability to absorb.  Second, because the plan explicitly and numerically communicated the FOMC’s plans, it should promote stability in market estimates for the future size of the balance sheet, and confidence that the FOMC will not unintentionally create market stress. \n\nPredictability\n\nThe second goal is to provide the public with a degree of certainty that, as the Federal Reserve reduces reinvestment, the market will not be asked to absorb securities at a speed that unexpectedly changes in a significant way.  I’ve already discussed why it is important that the flow of securities back into the market be gradual.  Predictability is about ensuring that the flow is gradual across economic scenarios, including scenarios that are quite different from our central forecast.  Achieving this predictability is complicated by uncertainty about agency MBS principal repayments, an issue I’ll summarize briefly.\n\nTo an extent, mortgage payoffs are driven by the white noise of life, such as homeowners selling their homes as they find new jobs in different areas of the country, have children, or retire, and in the process pay off the mortgage on their old house.  There is some uncertainty about how social and demographic factors like these will impact the housing market over the long term, and this therefore creates uncertainty in long-term MBS prepayment forecasts.  Over the short term, however, by far the greatest source of aggregate uncertainty in mortgage principal repayments relates to refinancing, the process by which homeowners get a new mortgage with a better interest rate, and pay off their old one in the process.  Refinancing results in existing agency MBS, containing the old higher-rate loans, being paid off more quickly, along with greater issuance of newly-minted agency MBS containing the new, lower-rate loans.\n\nHomeowners are incentivized to refinance when mortgage rates decline below the rate on their current loan.  In contrast, most market participants expect longer-term interest rates, including primary mortgage rates, to rise over policy normalization, and that therefore mortgage refinancing activity will be modest.  As a result, most expect mortgage principal repayments to run below the level of the redemption cap set by the FOMC.  Projections for these repayments, drawn from the July 2017 update to our annual report that I discussed earlier, are shown in left-hand side of Panel 3.\n\nThe benefit of the cap, even though it is unlikely to bind, is that it limits the amount of variation in the pace at which securities, and particularly mortgages, will flow back into private hands.  Recall that the left-hand figure in Panel 3 is based on rising interest rates over an ongoing economic expansion.  For comparison, the right-hand figure in Panel 3 shows the projected MBS principal repayments for a scenario in which interest rates come in two percentage points below market participants’ expectations.  In this scenario, the cap operates to constrain the flow of securities into the market.  While such a lower-rate outcome is not a central expectation, it is certainly possible.\n\nBy providing market participants some certainty that the pace of balance sheet decline will be gradual across economic scenarios, this plan should help mitigate the risk of unexpectedly sharp shifts in asset prices, liquidity, or market functioning should markets begin to put greater weight on lower interest rate scenarios.  Indeed, by promoting greater confidence in the stability and liquidity of the Treasury and agency MBS markets across economic outcomes, the FOMC’s plan should result in lower risk and liquidity premia on these assets relative to normalization plans that do not promote such confidence.\n\nThe importance of predictability is underscored when one considers that in recent years, adverse economic shocks have generally been associated with sharp falls in longer-term interest rates.  Such declines would tend to bring about faster MBS repayments and, if the outflow from the Federal Reserve’s portfolio were not constrained by a cap, an unforeseen tightening effect on financial conditions, amplifying the adverse shock.\n\nPrepared for the Unexpected\n\nWhile I am confident that the FOMC’s plan will work well, there’s always the risk that events unfold differently than expected.  In my view, we best prepare for the unexpected in two ways: we need to be operationally ready to change course when needed, and we need to remain analytically focused so we know when to recommend to policymakers that they do so.\n\nSo long as the plan I’ve described to you proceeds uninterrupted and as expected toward normalization, it is likely that policymakers’ operational demands on the Desk will be considerably lighter than they have been over the last decade.  However, it is possible that unexpected developments in the economy may require a change of plans.  For example, the FOMC has made it clear in its addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans that it stands ready to resume reinvestment if a material deterioration in the economic outlook were to warrant a sizable reduction in the federal funds rate.  The FOMC also indicated that it would be prepared to use its full range of tools, including altering the size and composition of its balance sheet, if future economic conditions were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the federal funds rate.  You may recall that Chair Yellen reiterated these points in her press conference following last month’s FOMC meeting.  Likewise, while the principles and plans do not indicate an expected role for asset sales in portfolio normalization, except in that limited sales might be warranted in the longer run to reduce or eliminate residual holdings of agency MBS, the operational capability remains, even though we do not expect it will be needed. \n\nUnexpected operational demands could also emerge from technical developments within the Treasury and agency MBS markets.  Even though it is shrinking, the Federal Reserve’s portfolio is and will remain large, and market participants will look to the Federal Reserve to lend out on a collateralized basis some of its holdings from time to time in order to facilitate settlement, as is done by most other large fixed-income investors.  The Desk does this in the Treasury market via its decades-old securities lending program, and performs an analogous role in the agency MBS market by conducting so-called “dollar roll” and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.  The Desk always welcomes discussion with market participants on ways in which it can support market functioning.19\n\nPreventing Tantrums\n\nI noted earlier that my confidence that the FOMC’s plan for balance sheet normalization was in part due to its clear communication: the gradual and predictable nature of the balance sheet decline should help ensure that market participants’ expectations remain well aligned with what eventually transpires.  In my view, a “trust, but verify” approach is called for to ensure that this confidence is appropriate.   While I trust that the program design will keep expectations for the portfolio realistic, I believe that a robust analytical mechanism to verify this, underpinned through continuous market monitoring, broad-based surveys of primary dealers and market participants, and a diverse suite of statistical data collections, will help ensure that policymakers can detect early and respond promptly to situations where market participants expect the portfolio to evolve significantly differently from policymakers’ expectations.\n\nThe idea is simple: keeping these two sets of expectations aligned should help prevent the risk that they get very far apart, an adjustment has to take place, and there is large move in asset prices.  But the experience of the 2013 “taper tantrum,” when asset prices moved sharply and unexpectedly following former Chairman Bernanke’s announcement of an eventual cessation in asset purchases, poses some questions about doing this in practice.  What might have caused the taper tantrum, and why have financial markets been so much more stable in comparison this time around?\n\nFirst, there are limitations to what one can learn from market intelligence, whether it is done with a survey, through analytical modeling, or market monitoring.  The Federal Reserve’s market intelligence-gathering is among the best there is when it comes to breadth, detail, and rigor.  For example, we are the only central bank that conducts market surveys directly on balance sheet policy.  That said, the 2013 taper tantrum would not have been anticipated based on market surveys conducted at the time, as the median surveyed market participants’ projection for the end of asset purchases was similar to the plan Chairman Bernanke outlined in his announcement.20 In his book “The Courage to Act: A Memoir of the Crisis and Its Aftermath,” Bernanke attributed the failure of surveys to anticipate the taper tantrum to the fact that, at the time, they reached only primary dealer economists, a homogenous and insular group that he felt was unrepresentative of investors generally.21\n\nI think there is truth to this, but I wonder if there is more to the story.  We now survey a broad community of investors in addition to the primary dealers in a bid to gather a more diverse and inclusive perspective, partly in response to this concern.  While this makes our surveys more robust, since we started doing this we haven’t observed large differences in median responses between the dealers and the buy-side community.  As an example, Panel 4 shows a time series of the expected level of the federal funds rate at the end of 2017 for dealers and for buy-side firms; these two track each other closely.22  On the other hand, both the dealers and buy-side community responses exhibit substantial dispersion around these medians. One explanation for the adverse reactions to Federal Reserve communications in the spring of 2013 is that the marginal investor is not the same as the median respondent to our surveys.\n\nLooking past the survey, I think there are a few key factors that differ between now and 2013 that might explain why the market reaction has been so much calmer this time.  The macroeconomic environment is markedly better.  Market participants have a better sense for the FOMC’s approach to increasing the federal funds rate, and there is much greater clarity on the respective roles of the balance sheet and the overnight policy rate.  The normalization plan is more clearly gradual and predictable.  And the balance sheet news this time around may just not have been all that surprising.  I’ll talk briefly about each of these.\n\nOne important difference between now and 2013 is that the labor market is very healthy, with unemployment close to levels most associate with full employment.  Recall that FOMC statements around the time of the taper tantrum stated that asset purchases would continue “until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in the context of price stability,” and it is possible that many market participants took the signal from an impending taper that the FOMC was less committed to the goal of a substantial improvement in the labor market than they had thought.  Not only could this have affected some investors’ expectations for the balance sheet going forward, but it could have also affected views on the FOMC’s other policy tool: the overnight interest rate.23\n\nA related possibility is that in the current situation expectations for a very gradual program of increases in the federal funds rate are relatively well entrenched, with liftoff more than a year and a half behind us.  In 2013 market participants were focused on policies that would add more accommodation.  Under the “recruitment effect” proposed by former Governor Jeremy Stein and Sam Hanson of Harvard Business School, yield-oriented investors react to lower short-term rates by “reaching for yield” into longer-dated maturities, and reverse this effect when short-term rates rise.  These effects can be even larger when balance sheet policies are in active use.24  As a result, a shock to expectations of the central bank’s reaction function can lead to outsized movements in longer-term rates.  The FOMC’s current approach entails a much clearer delineation of the roles of the federal funds rate and the balance sheet, breaking the link that appeared in the spring of 2013: the association between a reduction in the balance sheet and a shock to expectations for the federal funds rate.  As shown on Panel 5, even with the active discussion of balance sheet normalization in the March and May 2017 FOMC meeting minutes, market participants attributed very little of the movement in longer-term rates to communication from the FOMC regarding potential changes in their reinvestment policy.\n\nIt’s also possible that it is especially important for the FOMC to act in a gradual and predictable way at times when investor response to Federal Reserve announcements might not be expected to follow predictions that come from economic models that assume rationality, perfect information, expectations for continuously optimal policymaking, and so on.  George Soros’s theory of reflexivity might be instructive here.  Soros’s framework is based on two propositions: fallibility, which means that market participants’ views of the world can never perfectly correspond to the actual state of affairs; and reflexivity, which means that these imperfect views can influence the situation through the actions of those who hold those views.25  In other words, perception might not correspond to reality, but perception can influence reality.  Taking this to the monetary policy context, expectations for disruption or volatility from an substantial change in the Federal Reserve’s operational posture, even if totally unfounded, could bring about disruption, as the holders of those expectations act to protect themselves or profit from what they believe is likely to come.  The solution is to try to avoid generating such expectations for disruption to begin with, by acting gradually and predictably. \n\nAnother potential explanation for the relative stability of longer-term rates this time around is that balance sheet news this year, taken together, just hasn’t been all that surprising to market participants.  Panel 6 shows market participants’ expectation for the level of the federal funds rate that would prevail when the reinvestment policy first changes, as well as expectations for the date of that change.  As can be seen, balance sheet normalization started slightly earlier than expected, both in rate terms – it began with the federal funds rate at 1.16 percent – and, more notably, in terms of the absolute date.  But at the same time, earlier in the year, many market participants had seen decent odds that the Federal Reserve would reduce its balance sheet more quickly with a full-stop end to reinvestment.  Panel 7 shows the decline in expectations for both no change in Treasury reinvestments and a hard-stop in them.  It seems likely that these shifts in expectations came as the FOMC’s communications became increasingly granular, particularly after the June meeting at which the FOMC provided detail on its balance sheet normalization plan. \n\nOn net, it seems likely that expectations for the Federal Reserve’s overall stock of asset holdings were fairly stable over this time, despite variation in expectations for the timing and pace of eventual declines.  Under the “stock view,” this stability in expected future asset holdings should result in limited changes in asset prices, as has been observed.  Of course, as the balance sheet shrinks, some upward pressure on rates should be realized.  Market participants’ estimate of this effect over two years is shown in Panel 8.\n\nOne last possible explanation for the stability of longer-term interest rates amid the movement toward balance sheet normalization has been the FOMC’s clear message that it would be prepared to use its full range of tools, including altering the size and composition of its balance sheet, if future economic conditions were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the federal funds rate.  Panel 9 shows the average of survey respondents’ probability distributions for the balance sheet; the left side shows this for the scenario where overnight rates remain away from zero, and the right side shows the adverse scenario in which they do return to zero.  The right side shows a significant expansion in the balance sheet.  As shown in Panel 10, market participants assign about one chance in four to such a scenario unfolding, so communications about how the FOMC might respond to such an outcome in the future might have the effect of bolstering confidence even today.\n\nReturning to Panel 9, it is notable how much uncertainty there is about the size of the balance sheet, even in the no-zero-lower-bound scenario shown on the left.  This likely reflects a few factors: MBS repayments remain uncertain up to the cap; future demand for currency, bank reserves, and non-reserve liabilities is hard to know precisely; and the FOMC has not yet decided on a longer-run framework for the implementation of policy.  As a result, it seems appropriate to me that there should be an appreciable amount of uncertainty, which should decline over time as these matters become clearer so long as normalization continues uninterrupted. \n\nConclusion\n\nLet me conclude now by reiterating the message of confidence with which I began my remarks.  I am confident that the FOMC’s gradual and predictable plan to normalize the balance sheet will reduce the balance sheet’s size at an appropriate pace, that it will promote good market functioning, that it will not disrupt the mortgage market or Treasury debt issuance, and, importantly, that it will mitigate the risk of sharp or outsized asset price reactions.  I am also confident that the Federal Reserve is well prepared, both operationally and analytically, to identify, understand, and address unforeseen circumstances over normalization as directed by the FOMC.  Finally, by accomplishing all these things, I am confident that the FOMC’s policy normalization plan should help promote the ongoing economic expansion.\n\nClearly, the 2013 taper tantrum should leave any observer cautious in assessing a central bank’s ability to normalize its balance sheet smoothly.  Those of us who work at the Federal Reserve certainly were.  I believe the FOMC’s plan carefully takes into account the range of potential explanations for the taper tantrum, in particular through its emphasis on gradualism and predictability. \n\nEarly signs on this front are encouraging, with financial market volatility around recent balance sheet announcements quite modest relative to what we saw in 2013.  It’s much too early to declare success.  However, should this stability continue, I believe the FOMC’s approach may offer useful lessons to other central banks which anticipate reaching a time of transition in their policy stance.  In particular, the FOMC has aimed to provide as much transparency as it can in an effort to underscore its intent to achieve an uneventful normalization of the balance sheet.  I believe that this level of transparency has been of great importance.\n\nPanels"

        "content": "Good afternoon.  It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak at this Council for Economic Education (CEE) event, marking the CEE’s 56th Annual Financial Literacy and Economic Education Conference.  Given the hard lessons of the financial crisis—and the economic challenges still facing many Americans—there are few goals more worthy than promoting greater financial and economic literacy.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nPersonal Educational Experience\n\nBefore discussing the economic outlook and the role of education in income mobility, I will offer a few remarks on my own educational experience.  While it may not be surprising that I have a Ph.D. in economics, the path that led me to the University of California, Berkeley, is a bit unusual. \n\nI started college in the 1970s at Columbia University.  On the positive side, the professors were engaging, and I had the opportunity to read the great books of the university’s core contemporary civilization curriculum.  But, I was troubled by the emphasis on grades and test taking.  I wanted something that was more free-form.  The idea was to find an environment that fostered learning for learning’s sake.  So, in a small act of rebellion—after all, it was the early 1970s and I was a teenager—I decided to transfer to New College in Sarasota, Florida.  New College provided a strong liberal arts, cross-disciplinary, and flexible education program that relied—as it does today—on an unstructured format of evaluations, study programs with individual professors, and contracts rather than grades.  I like to call it “graduate school for undergraduates,” because it really is a place that encourages students to engage intellectually, read and think critically, and communicate effectively. \n\nThis experience made me a strong advocate of a liberal arts education, which I believe is now more valuable than ever, given the greater importance of synthesizing and evaluating the vast array of information we have at our fingertips.  The cross-disciplinary approach of a liberal arts program is also vital to understanding and solving complex problems.  I believe that training—combined with the excellent education in economics I got at Berkeley—helped me to better diagnose what was going wrong in 2007 and 2008, and how the Federal Reserve could be most effective in our response to the crisis. \n\nEconomic and Monetary Policy Outlook\n\nTurning to the economic outlook, the damage wrought by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria has imposed immeasurable hardship on many.  And, the damage will undoubtedly disrupt commerce for some time.  However, these effects are likely to be relatively modest in the context of the national economy.  Natural disasters tend to depress economic activity initially, but once the recovery and reconstruction efforts get underway in earnest, such disasters actually serve to lift economic activity. \n\nLooking beyond the storm effects—which will make interpreting near-term economic data releases more difficult—the economy remains on a trajectory of slightly above-trend growth at about 2 percent, and the fundamentals supporting continued expansion are generally quite favorable. Low unemployment, sturdy job gains (recognizing the near-term negative impact of the storms), and rising wages (even at a pace below previous expansions) are lifting personal income.  Household wealth has been boosted by rising home and equity prices, and household debt has been growing relatively slowly, contributing to a healthy household balance sheet.  Thus, consumer spending should continue to advance in coming quarters. \n\nBusiness fixed investment outlays are also likely to continue to rise.  With the supply of labor tightening, there are greater incentives for businesses to invest in labor-saving technologies.  Investment spending should also benefit from a better international outlook and the improvement in U.S. trade competitiveness caused by the dollar’s recent weakness.  The softer dollar and solid growth abroad also suggest that the trade sector will no longer be a significant drag on economic growth. \n\nTurning to the outlook for inflation, I have been surprised by the persistence of the shortfall from the FOMC’s 2 percent long-run objective.  While some of this year’s shortfall can be explained by one-off factors—such as the sharp fall in prices for cellular phone service—its persistence suggests that more fundamental structural changes may also be playing a role.  These include the increased ability of prospective buyers to compare prices across different sellers quickly and easily, the shift in retail sales to online channels of distribution from traditional brick-and-mortar stores, and the consequences of these changes on brand loyalty and business pricing power.\n\nOver the coming months, I hope that we will be better able to differentiate between these competing explanations.  If it turns out that structural changes have played a significant role, I would generally view this as a positive, rather than negative, development.  It would imply that the U.S. economy could operate at a higher level of labor resource utilization without generating a troublesome large rise in inflation.  More people could be put to work on a sustainable basis, enabling them to gain opportunities not just to earn greater income, but also to develop their skills and grow their human capital.\n\nSlightly above-trend growth is gradually tightening the U.S. labor market, which should support a rise in wage growth over time.  When combined with a firmer import price trend—partly reflecting recent depreciation of the dollar—and the fading of effects from a number of temporary, idiosyncratic factors, I expect inflation will rise and stabilize around the FOMC’s 2 percent objective over the medium term.  Thus, even though inflation is currently somewhat below our longer-run objective, I judge that it is still appropriate to continue to remove monetary policy accommodation gradually.  This judgment is supported by the fact that financial conditions have eased, rather than tightened, even as the FOMC has raised its short-term interest rate target range by 75 basis points since last December. \n\nBut, the upward trajectory of the policy rate path should continue to be shallow, in part because the level of short-term interest rates consistent with keeping the economy on a sustainable long-run growth path is likely to be considerably lower than it was in prior business cycles. \n\nThe FOMC recently launched the process of balance sheet normalization—in which an increasing proportion of maturing Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) repayments are allowed to run off the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  While this process also should exert some monetary policy restraint over time, I believe the impact will be quite modest.  Not only was this shift in policy widely anticipated, but we also have seen that the impact on the level of long-term interest rates has been small as expectations have adjusted. \n\nThe economy has made great strides in recovering from the Great Recession, as the unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent to 4.2 percent, aided by accommodative monetary policy.  Measures of underemployment have also improved considerably and are near pre-crisis levels.  Stronger labor market conditions are perhaps the best means to improve the economic well-being of most Americans, particularly those who have been struggling and are most vulnerable to economic downturns. \n\nAnd, as discussed in the Federal Reserve’s July Monetary Policy Report and in Chair Yellen’s accompanying testimony before Congress, it is encouraging that unemployment rates continue to fall for most demographic groups, including African-Americans and Hispanics.2  At the same time, we should remain concerned that the jobless rates for those groups remain above the unemployment rate for the nation. \n\nRecent U.S. Census Bureau estimates of household income growth also provide some reason for optimism.  Median real household income rose 3.2 percent in 2016, after strong gains the prior year.  Gains were particularly notable among African-American and Hispanic households, and the poverty rate fell to near pre-crisis levels.  While this is good news, I think we can all agree that we have a long way to go to improve income inequality and mobility in the United States.  As I see it, these are among the most important issues we face as a nation.\n\nIncome Mobility and Education\n\nNow, it is clearly the case that, given differences in individuals’ abilities, a free-market society will generate some level of inequality.  However, there are persistent trends toward growing inequality and diminished economic mobility—and in my view, these are problematic.3  First, income inequality has widened notably since about 1980.4  Second, and more distressing, is a relatively low rate of economic mobility, or the degree to which individuals or families can move up or down in the income distribution over time.  For example, the fraction of children who earn more than their parents has fallen from 90 percent to 50 percent over the past half century, and only 37 percent of parents believe that their children will be better off financially than they are, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey.5\n\nHigh inequality combined with a low rate of mobility is particularly problematic in a democratic society. In short, it means that being born into a low-income family is likely to severely limit an individual’s opportunities and well-being over his or her lifetime.  The United States fares notably weaker on both dimensions relative to its OECD peers.6  That is concerning, and something we should be working to address.\n\nOne significant initiative we have taken within the Federal Reserve System is the establishment of the Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute at the Minneapolis Fed, which conducts research and makes recommendations on the structural barriers to economic advancement in the nation.  The New York Fed has been, and will continue to be, an active participant and supporter of this initiative. \n\nLet me now turn to the primary routes of economic mobility and the impediments that too often block them.  The primary avenue to higher incomes for most people is investment in their human capital, namely through education.  Indeed, the income returns on education are very high, and they continue to rise in spite of very significant increases in the supply of highly educated workers during much of the 20th century.  Since the 1980s, however, increases in the supply of well-educated workers in the United States have slowed, while demand for these workers has accelerated due to technological change.  These forces have been a major contributor to the increase in the college wage premium.7  While college graduation rates in the U.S. have stagnated, those in many other OECD countries have continued to rise.  As a result, only one-quarter of those in the 25-to-34 age bracket in the United States have more education than their parents, compared with an OECD average of one-third.8  This represents a dramatic decline in college education’s influence as an engine of upward mobility.  So, part of a solution to the increase in inequality and the reduction in social mobility is to increase the level of educational attainment in the population.\n\nThere are many barriers to expanding post-secondary education, however. From the potential student’s perspective, a lack of information, low college preparedness, and high costs are all substantial barriers to college attendance and completion, and these barriers restrict social mobility.  Let me discuss each of these in turn. \n\nBy lack of information, I mean the recognition that in spite of its high price tag, a college degree typically offers an even larger payoff in terms of future earnings.  Many aspects of the college attendance decision are complex and hard to predict, especially for students from families without much experience with higher education.  For example, research indicates that decisions about college attendance are highly correlated with an understanding of the future payoffs from attendance and particular majors.9  New York Fed research shows evidence of systematic underestimation of the average benefits—and overestimation of the costs—of a college education, with larger biases among lower-income and non-college households.10  Families may not realize that listed tuition prices may not be what a particular student actually pays.  Moreover, misperceptions about the net return from a college degree can be consequential, influencing parents’ expectations and intentions for their children’s college attendance. \n\nImportantly, however, these expectations are not hardwired.  Evidence from an information experiment indicates that students do respond to new information by revising their expectations and their education choices.11  This suggests that making information about higher education decisions more available to families—particularly those with less experience with higher education—is a promising way to expand economic mobility.  I was fortunate as a child that I didn’t face this problem.  Both my parents went to college and there was no doubt among us about the payoff from higher education. \n\nAnother concern is the lack of college preparedness among new college entrants.  Nearly seven out of 10 students entering public two-year institutions and four out of 10 students entering four-year public institutions take remedial courses in college.12 Generally, these are courses they should have taken in high school. The costs of taking these courses in college are high, especially because they do not count for college credit.  Low readiness contributes to persistently low college completion rates, with only 55 percent of first-time undergraduates completing a degree within six years.13  College dropout rates are especially high among lower-income, part-time, and nontraditional students, with high costs, low perceived ability to pay, and a lack of information about the returns to degree completion also contributing to the high dropout rate.\n\nThe importance of college readiness underscores the value of high-quality K-12 schooling.  But, research indicates that fewer than half of five-year-olds from low-income families possess the math and reading skills, behaviors, and overall health required for learning success, compared to 75 percent of children from middle- and high-income families.14 These differences are important because they have long-lasting effects on academic achievement and future careers.  A substantial body of evidence, including research by economists at the Minneapolis Fed, points to very large economic returns to high-quality preschool and early-childhood development programs.15  Clearly, such programs can play an important role in improving economic mobility. \n\nI benefited from nursery school and kindergarten and a mother who taught me to read before I entered elementary school.  And, when my junior high school tried to move me out of an accelerated math program, my mom intervened and got me back in. \n\nPaying for college is another major impediment to college attendance and completion.  While college is generally a good investment, it has become increasingly expensive over the last several decades to attend a four-year program, as costs have risen considerably faster than wages—especially wages for all but the very top of the income distribution.  This means that college has become increasingly unaffordable for those families who need it most, if we are to increase social and economic mobility.  Of course, one result of the increasing unaffordability of college education is that fewer people get a college degree, which could help account for the slowdown in the growth rate of the college-educated workforce that I discussed earlier.  However, recent research by my colleagues at the New York Fed shows that young Americans have mostly adjusted to rising tuition and fees not by foregoing college education, but rather by amassing more debt.  \n\nOver the past few decades, funding for higher education has shifted from state and local sources to students and their families. While the federal student loan program has helped ease that transition, the result has been that more students are leaving college with significantly higher amounts of debt.  In fact, student loan debt has grown 170 percent over the last decade and now totals over $1.3 trillion.16 \n\nTo be clear, I don’t want to downplay the importance of student loans. When accompanied by college completion, they allow students to make what generally turns out to be a very worthwhile investment.  I personally benefited from student loans while at Berkeley.  But, compared to alternative ways of financing higher education—such as greater government support for public universities and increased federal education grants—student loans can have adverse consequences.  This is especially true when loans are taken on by those who don’t complete their education.  For borrowers with large student loan balances, such consequences include slow or late repayment, serious delinquency, and default.17  New York Fed researchers have shown that such unfavorable outcomes are related to family background.  Thus, at times, student loans can have the perverse effect of limiting social mobility.\n\nIn addition, our research indicates that, for any given level of educational attainment, workers who have student debts are less likely to own homes than those who got their education without incurring debts.  Certainly, for those who have difficulty repaying their student loans, the resulting damage to credit scores will make obtaining a mortgage very difficult, especially under today’s lending standards.  A student loan default, which is unhappily common, means that borrowing to buy a home is essentially impossible.  And, we know that these factors—slow repayment, delinquency, and default—are most prevalent among those from modest family circumstances.\n\nThis connection between rising college costs, increased student borrowing, and reduced homeownership is important for inequality and social mobility because, for the great majority of American families, increasing home equity is the major form of wealth accumulation.18  Thus, changes over the last few decades in the way that college is financed mean higher education is less able to lift people from poverty into the middle class.\n\nI should note here that economic education has an important role to play in mitigating these challenges, which increasingly arise as debt becomes a more common part of the college experience.  For example, financial literacy and the skills taught by educators have been demonstrated to better prepare young people for the management of their finances, enhancing their well-being.  Financial literacy allows people to better understand the terms of student loans and the consequences of missed payments, and how to accumulate wealth.19  I strongly support the CEE’s efforts to bring economic knowledge to young people, as I believe that it is increasingly vital for everyone, and has an especially important role in fostering social and economic mobility.\n\nOther factors that can foster or inhibit social mobility are the practices of universities themselves.  In some very recent work, Raj Chetty and his co-authors have documented the role that different universities play in fostering economic mobility.20  From my perspective, the most important findings are that access to the best universities is very closely related to parent income—children from wealthier families are more likely to go to Ivy League schools, for example.  Yet, those students from poorer families who actually are admitted to the best universities do just as well in their future earnings as those from more advantaged backgrounds.\n\nPart of the problem, aside from cost, is the legacy admission policies of elite schools—where children of alumni receive preferential access.  This is patently unfair, and scrapping such policies would help increase economic mobility.21I really don’t see how our best universities can continue to justify this practice.  Yes, fund-raising might suffer slightly over time—but I suspect the impact would be very small.  More importantly, do we really want to encourage what is essentially a “donate to admit” policy at our major universities?  Such an approach only preserves the status quo and constrains economic mobility.\n\nThe research shows that upward mobility differs substantially across colleges.  Ivy League schools are good at producing top earners, but, as I noted, they accept very few lower-income students, so their impact on income mobility is small.  Meanwhile, other schools with economically diverse student bodies produce few high earners, and their impact is likewise small. Then there are certain schools—some of which can be found in the CUNY and California state systems—that manage to produce a large number of high earners from economically diverse student bodies.  Learning exactly how they do it and how it can be replicated strikes me as a first-order question for further study.\n\nWhile I am distressed by the high and increasing levels of inequality and diminished mobility that our economy has delivered over the last several decades, I remain optimistic about the future.  There is more attention now to inequality and low intergenerational mobility than I can recall at any time during my professional life.  Organizations like the CEE and the National Association of Economic Educators exist to improve awareness of economic concepts.  This enhances the ability of young people to make better financial decisions and helps to close the gaps in knowledge that contribute to inequality.  Top-tier researchers in both academia and the Federal Reserve System are focusing their attention on the causes, consequences, and solutions of this social problem, using better data, methods, and means of communicating their results.  Even more importantly, policymakers are also paying close attention.  Ultimately, I believe we will identify and implement policies that can make the dream of a better life a reality for more of our fellow citizens.\n\nThank you again for your kind attention. I would be happy to take your questions."

        "content": "Good morning. It is a pleasure to be here with you in Syracuse, and I want to thank Onondaga Community College for hosting us. This is my fourth visit to Central New York as president of the New York Fed, and I always look forward to coming back as part of our regular visits to different parts of our district. These trips and our meetings with stakeholders in the region give me and my colleagues important insight into what’s happening in the economy.\n\nToday, I will briefly discuss my outlook for the U.S. economy and what we are seeing at the regional level, and offer some reflections on the challenges and importance of workforce development in the region and across the nation. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nTwo years ago, I spoke in nearby Rochester on the topic of workforce development.2 Since then, the need for effective workforce development has become no less pressing, and both the New York Fed and the Federal Reserve System have focused greater efforts on this critical issue. This morning, I will return to some of the themes from that speech and look at lessons we have learned.\n\nThe U.S. Economic Outlook\n\nAlthough the damage wrought by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria has imposed immeasurable hardship on many and will undoubtedly disrupt commerce for a time, these effects are likely to be relatively short-lived in the context of the overall economic outlook. Natural disasters tend to depress economic activity initially, but once the recovery and reconstruction efforts get underway in earnest, such disasters actually serve to lift economic activity.\n\nLooking beyond the storm effects—which will make interpreting near-term economic data releases more difficult—the U.S. economy remains on a trajectory of slightly above-trend growth, which is gradually tightening the U.S. labor market. Over time, this should support a rise in wage growth. The fundamentals supporting continued expansion are generally quite favorable. Low unemployment, sturdy job gains, and rising wages—even at a pace below previous expansions—are lifting personal income. Household wealth has been boosted by rising home and equity prices, and household debt has been growing relatively slowly, contributing to a healthy household balance sheet. Thus, consumer spending should continue to advance in coming quarters.\n\nBusiness fixed investment outlays are also likely to continue to rise. With the supply of labor tightening, there are greater incentives for businesses to invest in labor-saving technologies. Investment spending should also benefit from a better international outlook and improvement in U.S. trade competitiveness caused by the dollar’s recent weakness. The softer dollar and solid growth abroad also suggest that the trade sector will no longer be a significant drag on economic growth.\n\nWith a firmer import price trend and the fading of effects from a number of temporary, idiosyncratic factors, I expect inflation will rise and stabilize around the FOMC’s 2 percent objective over the medium term. In response, the Federal Reserve will likely continue to remove monetary policy accommodation gradually.\n\nThe Regional Economy\n\nWhile the national economy has been growing steadily since the end of the Great Recession, the economies of Upstate New York have lagged behind, with job growth running at only about half the national pace through much of the expansion. And, over the past year, job growth in Upstate New York has slowed considerably, particularly in Rochester and Buffalo.\n\nHere in Syracuse, job growth has also been disappointing through most of the expansion, with an even slower pace of growth than many other upstate areas. In fact, today, almost 10 years after the Great Recession, Syracuse has still not fully recovered all of the jobs that were lost—a benchmark most of Upstate New York passed some time ago.\n\nHowever, this slow growth does not imply that the region is standing still. Indeed, there is a lot of activity going on beneath the surface. The Syracuse economy and labor force are evolving and becoming better positioned for the future. But, more needs to be done to help workers adapt to change, a theme I will return to in a moment.\n\nAs is the case in much of the country, Syracuse has experienced a dramatic decrease in manufacturing jobs, reflecting the dual forces of technological change and globalization. These were well-paying jobs that supported a vibrant middle class. Now, I am a firm believer in the overall positive effect that open trade has had on the United States, but I also recognize that its benefits and costs are distributed unevenly, and the positive and negative consequences can be geographically concentrated.3 On the whole, we have not done enough to recognize the vast consequences of these changes and to help those hurt by technological change and globalization.\n\nThe Syracuse economy has changed considerably from 25 years ago, when manufacturing was the dominant source of jobs and income. The number of manufacturing workers has been cut in half since then, reducing the sector’s share of employment from 15 percent to 8 percent—a share that is now on par with the nation. This transition has been painful, but has resulted in a more diversified and stable regional economy.\n\nIn manufacturing’s place, the healthcare and education sectors have picked up the slack, and have been a stabilizing force for the Syracuse economy. Offsetting the 20,000 manufacturing jobs that were lost over the past 25 years are around 25,000 jobs added in education and healthcare. Those two sectors now employ almost 20 percent of the workers in the region. Other sectors, like business services and leisure and hospitality, have also been creating new job opportunities that differ from the ones the region previously relied on.\n\nIn addition, jobs are being created in innovative hot spots in the region. For example, start-up companies rising from the Syracuse Tech Garden, as well as a new global center for unmanned aerial systems, are providing exciting new opportunities. While these particular efforts are still relatively small in scale, they have the potential to change the trajectory of the regional economy over time. However, Syracuse will need workers with deep skill sets to fill such jobs.\n\nTo that end, it can be difficult for workers to adapt to these changes, and they may need help to get there. Taking a broader view, the good jobs being created in today’s economy require more education, training, and, ultimately, skill than ever before. The skill requirements for virtually all jobs are increasing, and workers will need to rise to the occasion to thrive in today’s economy.\n\nThe challenge facing all of us is how to best help workers develop the skills necessary to land a good job, and how to enhance those skills over time as work requirements evolve. Workers with years of experience in jobs that are no longer in demand have it especially hard, as their skills may not be sufficient or match current opportunities—an all-too-familiar story for workers in the Syracuse area.\n\nWorkforce Development\n\nWorkforce development must, therefore, be a top priority for everyone involved: workers, employers, communities, government, and educational and training institutions. There is no silver bullet or one-size-fits-all solution. This is a complex challenge that requires a combination of strategies. But one thing is clear: it requires a holistic approach encompassing the “three P’s” I described two years ago—Partnerships, Programs, and Placement—and then some. Before delving deeper into these, let me first explain why we, as the nation’s central bank, care about workforce development.\n\nAs many of you know, the Federal Reserve is tasked by Congress with a dual mandate: maximum employment in the context of price stability. Clearly, we cannot declare success if we have people who want to work but lack the skills to fill available jobs. A skilled workforce that is matched to the needs of employers is necessary for the economy to grow and prosper, and for individuals to reach their potential. Monetary policy can help labor markets recover by providing incentives for firms to invest and grow. However, monetary policy cannot by itself solve skill mismatches and gaps that exist in the economy.\n\nSo, what can we do? The Federal Reserve provides research and analysis, and leverages its convening ability to bring together diverse stakeholders to better understand the issues and identify practices that work. For example, we run the Leading the Way video campaign with P-TECH schools and employer partnerships.4 This competition challenges teams of high school students in the Rochester area to create public service announcements detailing skills required to work in industries that are currently hiring. We also participate in the New York City Data Science Task Force to increase the number and diversity of students in the metropolitan area prepared to enter graduate school or the workforce with data science skills. And, we are finalizing the results of a survey of community colleges across New York State that looks at their engagement with employers for the purposes of workforce development. I will talk a bit more about the survey’s preliminary results shortly.\n\nIn addition, we are working with the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and our fellow regional Reserve Banks on broader initiatives to promote investment in workforce development and encourage partnerships, including next month’s Investing in America’s Workforce Conference in Austin, Texas. The conference is a joint effort by the Federal Reserve System and several leading institutions in the field5 intended to connect businesses, government agencies, non-profits, academics, and philanthropic organizations. The goal is to reframe workforce development as an investment, attract new resources, and leverage existing ones to improve economic mobility and job opportunities for potential workers.\n\nThe Three P’s of Workforce Development\n\nThe core of any workforce development effort is the need to help workers build the skills necessary to adapt to change, meet the challenges of an evolving economy, and find good-paying jobs. We have been hearing from business owners across our district, on our advisory councils, and through surveys for several years about the skills gaps they face, in areas as diverse as engineering, long-haul trucking, welding, and metalworking. What they all have in common is that they require specific skills and training, whether through a certification program, a two- or four-year degree, or a formal apprenticeship—an approach that has been very successful in countries such as Germany and the UK, but has not been as widely used here.\n\nThis is where the partnership concept comes into play. Partnerships entail cooperative efforts between local employers and educational institutions to determine the best strategies to help workers develop the skills employers need. The good news is that New York State seems to be ahead of the curve in this area.\n\nAs I mentioned, we are in the process of completing a survey of community colleges in New York State. The early results are encouraging: we have found that all community colleges in the state offer some workforce development programming, and partnerships with employers are the norm. In fact, the median number of employer-partners among community colleges is over 100, and there are partnerships in every industry, from healthcare to utilities to agriculture. Such partnerships are growing in importance and fill a need for both local workers and employers. This goes to my second P: Programs. Community colleges in New York are becoming very adept at creating programs tailored to the current skills required by local employers.\n\nLocally, I’d like to highlight Onondaga Community College’s partnership with Madison County manufacturers, which trains workers through the Apprentice Career Training program. This program provides paid training for students that can lead to four-year apprenticeships in participating businesses in advanced manufacturing, where they will develop skills necessary for jobs that are in high demand, including maintenance mechanics, tool makers, and machine operators.\n\nI would also like to call attention to Work Train’s job training and industry collaboration,6 as well as the work of the Onondaga Citizens League to quantify the types of jobs that are in Central New York, what job opportunities will likely exist in the future, and other critical workforce-related questions. I anticipate that the Citizens League’s report on how Central New York works will serve as an important resource for shaping workforce development programs in the area.7\n\nHowever, while training and skill-building are foundational, they are not enough. Placement into good jobs—my third P—is a critical component of effective workforce development, especially for those currently unemployed. Recent work by Federal Reserve economists highlights some of the hurdles to job placement that will need to be overcome. This research leveraged the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations to examine how people find work.8 The difference between those looking for work while employed versus those who are unemployed is stark. Relative to the unemployed, employed workers spend less time searching for jobs but have three times higher contact rates and two times as many job offers. Furthermore, workers hired from another job do better than those who are unemployed, receiving 28 percent higher wages and twice the level of benefits. While we have always known how difficult it is for recent high school or college graduates to find their first job, it seems that those currently unemployed face an even greater hurdle, and this is an issue that we need to address.\n\nAnother finding from this work is the importance of networking and references for those seeking employment. Referrals accounted for 40 percent of total job offers, and while 60 percent of all job applications were the result of job board searches, these accounted for only 24 percent of offers. This all suggests that workforce development providers need to build relationships and trust with employers as a way to help their job-seekers find available opportunities and successfully apply for them.\n\nHaving covered the three P’s, I’d like to now focus briefly on the “and then some,” which refers to addressing a number of social and structural factors that work against even the best workforce development efforts.\n\nIn my travels throughout the region and my interactions with workers, business leaders, workforce development practitioners, and others, I regularly hear how access to transportation and childcare are preventing able and willing workers from actually working. People’s inability to get to jobs relatively far from where they live—either because they can’t afford a car or there is no viable and reliable public transportation. This is a challenge we are seeing both in sparsely populated areas, like the North Country, and in cities, where jobs may be available in the surrounding suburbs and exurbs with no easy public access. With regard to childcare, cost and access are what we hear most as hindering people’s ability to fill jobs. And, even for those who can afford childcare, irregular scheduling by employers makes it very difficult to plan effectively. Additional adverse factors include a decline in geographic mobility—that is, people’s ability or willingness to relocate to where the jobs are—and the opioid epidemic, which Chair Yellen recently spoke about as having a significant negative impact on our workforce.9\n\nWhile I am not an expert on these subjects, I can say that the inefficiencies these impediments create are keeping us from realizing our full potential individually and as a country, and that addressing them as part of a comprehensive workforce development solution is essential.\n\nI would like to conclude by saying that Syracuse, as well as Upstate New York more generally, has been dealing head-on with the consequences of economic change for a long time. Perhaps because of this, the region has developed a deep understanding of the importance of helping its people adapt through workforce development programs. The issue of workforce development is a complex one that requires a holistic approach and close collaboration among all interested parties. The good news is that many great organizations in the area are trying different approaches to discover what works best. Our region is in many ways leading the way, and we at the New York Fed will continue to support these efforts.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I would now be happy to take a few questions."

        "content": "Good evening.  It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak at this Money Marketeers event.  In my remarks, I will focus on two topics:  1) The economic outlook and the implications for monetary policy, and 2) the Fed’s balance sheet normalization process, which is likely to begin relatively soon.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nOverall, the economy remains on a trajectory of slightly above-trend growth, which is gradually tightening the U.S. labor market.  Over time, this should support a rise in wage growth.  When combined with a firmer import price trend—partly reflecting recent depreciation of the dollar—and the fading of effects from a number of temporary, idiosyncratic factors, that causes me to expect inflation will rise and stabilize around the FOMC’s 2 percent objective over the medium term.  In response, the Fed will likely continue to remove monetary policy accommodation gradually.  But, the upward trajectory of the policy rate path should continue to be shallow, in part because the level of short-term interest rates consistent with keeping the economy on a sustainable long-run growth path is likely to be considerably lower than it was in prior business cycles. \n\nThe process of balance sheet normalization—in which an increasing proportion of maturing Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) repayments are allowed to run off the Fed’s balance sheet—should also exert some monetary policy restraint over time.  But, I believe this impact will be quite modest.  Not only is this shift in policy now widely anticipated, but we have also seen that the impact on the level of long-term interest rates has been small as expectations have adjusted. \n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nSo, why do I anticipate that the economy will likely continue to grow at a slightly above-trend pace?   The fundamentals supporting continued expansion are generally quite favorable.  Low unemployment, sturdy job gains, and rising wages—even at a pace below previous expansions—are lifting personal income.  Household wealth has been boosted by rising home and equity prices, and household debt has been growing relatively slowly, contributing to a healthy household balance sheet.  Thus, consumer spending should continue to advance in coming quarters.  \n\nBusiness fixed investment outlays are also likely to continue to rise.  With the supply of labor tightening, there are greater incentives for businesses to invest in labor-saving technologies.  Investment spending should also benefit from a better international outlook and the improvement in U.S. trade competitiveness caused by the dollar’s recent weakness.  The softer dollar and solid growth abroad also suggest that the trade sector will no longer be a significant drag on economic growth.  \n\nTurning to the outlook for inflation, I have been surprised by the persistence of the shortfall from the FOMC’s 2 percent long-run objective.  While some of this year’s shortfall can be explained by one-off factors, such as the sharp fall in prices for cellular phone service, its persistence suggests that more fundamental structural changes may also be playing a role.  These include the increased ability of prospective buyers to compare prices across different sellers quickly and easily, the shift in retail sales to online channels of distribution from traditional brick-and-mortar stores, and the consequences of these changes on brand loyalty and business pricing power. \n\nOver the coming months, I hope that we will be better able to differentiate between these competing explanations. \n\nIf it turns out that structural changes have played a significant role, I would generally view this as a positive, rather than negative, development.  It would imply that the U.S. economy could operate at a higher level of labor resource utilization without generating a troublesome large rise in inflation.  More people could be put to work on a sustainable basis, enabling them to gain opportunities not just to earn greater income, but also to develop their skills and grow their human capital.\n\nBefore I go further, let me say a few words about the impact of Hurricane Harvey.  The massive flooding in Texas has been a tragedy for countless people.  My heart goes out to all who have suffered and face a long and difficult recovery. \n\nWhile the human toll of such a storm is immense, past disasters such as Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy have shown that the impact on the national economy tends to be modest and transitory.  At first, activity dips as normal commerce is disrupted.  But later, when rebuilding gets underway in earnest, economic activity receives a modest boost. \n\nAlthough I expect that the Texas floods will make it more difficult to assess the economic data in the months ahead, I do not expect it to fundamentally alter the underlying trajectory of the national economy.  Of course, for parts of Texas, sadly, the consequences will be immeasurably greater.\n\nMonetary Policy Outlook\n\nAs I noted earlier, I still anticipate that above-trend growth will lead to higher utilization of the economy’s resources, and that, over time, this will help push inflation higher.  Thus, even though inflation is currently somewhat below our longer-run objective, I judge that it is still appropriate to continue to remove monetary policy accommodation gradually. \n\nThis judgment is supported by the fact that financial conditions have eased, rather than tightened, even as the Fed has raised its short-term interest rate target range by 75 basis points since last December.  For example, equity prices have risen, credit spreads have narrowed modestly, longer-term interest rates have declined, and the dollar has weakened.  On balance, these movements have been large relative to the upward drift in short-term interest rates.  The easing in financial conditions is important because monetary policy does not directly influence the trajectory of economic growth and inflation.  Instead, as I have noted in previous remarks, short-term interest rate changes are an important factor that affects broad financial market conditions.2 Financial conditions, in turn, influence the demand for goods and services by households and businesses.  But, if financial conditions ease even as we are removing monetary policy accommodation, this may have implications for further policy adjustments.  All else equal, an easing of financial conditions may warrant a somewhat steeper policy rate path.  Conversely, if financial conditions were to tighten unduly, then this might necessitate a shallower rate path to temper that tightening. \n\nTo be clear, this does not mean that the Fed should mechanically target a particular set of financial conditions.  That is because the set of financial conditions appropriate to achieving the Fed’s statutory objectives of maximum employment and price stability will evolve over time as the economic outlook changes.  Financial conditions are just a means to an end—the achievement of the Fed’s employment and inflation objectives. \n\nWith that background, I would like to comment on some of the criticism of Fed policy decisions.\n\nSome of the commentary surrounding the FOMC’s June decision to raise the federal funds rate target by 25 basis points illustrates the current tension between “too low” inflation and “too buoyant” financial conditions.  On one hand, some observers question the decision to reduce policy accommodation given that inflation has fallen somewhat further below our objective.  I would respond to these concerns by noting that monetary policy is still accommodative and that financial conditions have eased.  In addition, the long and variable lags between monetary policy adjustments and their impact on the economy imply that the FOMC may need to remove accommodation even when inflation is below its goal.  In particular, if the unemployment rate were already below its longer-run natural rate, as may be the case currently, the impact on wage growth and price inflation would still likely take some time to become evident.  This would be particularly true if inflation expectations were well-anchored at or slightly below our 2 percent objective, as is the case currently. \n\nOn the other hand, some Fed watchers have argued that we are helping to create financial asset bubbles by not removing accommodation more quickly.  My view is that asset valuations are not particularly troublesome given the economic environment in which we’ve been—that is, a long period of moderate growth, low inflation, low interest rates, and low recession risks.  I would be much more concerned about asset valuations if financial market performance were disconnected from the economy’s performance—for example, if market volatility were very low and asset valuations elevated at a time when the economy was performing poorly and the outlook was highly uncertain.  Stretched valuations would also be of greater concern if credit growth were unusually strong and financial institutions were becoming more leveraged and dependent on wholesale funding.  The good news is that the substantially higher capital and liquidity requirements enacted in response to the financial crisis have helped to reduce the risks to financial stability. \n\nRelatedly, some critics have argued that our asset purchases have unduly distorted financial asset prices.  My response to this critique is that monetary policy—including large-scale asset purchase programs—works through its influence on financial conditions.  We turned to asset purchases to provide additional monetary policy stimulus when the federal funds rate was constrained by the effective zero lower bound.  In buying longer-maturity Treasuries and agency MBS, we sought to reduce risk premia to provide additional support to economic growth at a time when the economy was operating far from full employment.  The argument that monetary policy should avoid affecting asset prices—that it be somehow “neutral”—is not one that I find compelling.  Such an argument essentially implies that monetary policy should not be utilized to achieve the Fed’s dual mandate objectives. \n\nAnother recent critique is that the Fed has contributed to the low volatility of financial markets by making monetary policy too predictable.  Some argue that we should surprise market participants in order to manufacture greater uncertainty and generate more market volatility.  The notion is that if the Fed were more unpredictable, market participants would be less complacent.  And, if markets were perceived as riskier, this might hinder the development of financial asset bubbles. \n\nI am not supportive of such a strategy for several reasons.  First, I don’t think it is necessary to be unpredictable to keep financial market participants “on their toes.”  There are plenty of potential surprises from the economic environment without the Fed seeking to deliberately generate its own.  Changes in the economic outlook affect financial asset prices and market participants’ expectations for future monetary policy actions.  I don’t see a significant benefit to artificially adding “noise” to this process.  Developments in early 2016 provide a good example.  As the economic environment changed and financial conditions tightened, we responded by raising short-term interest rates much more slowly than had been anticipated. \n\nSecond, deliberately degrading the signal of how we are likely to react to changes in economic circumstances would likely lead to higher risk premia.  This would represent a real cost that would have to be borne by households and businesses.  Third, a less reliable Fed would also presumably loosen the linkage between the stance of monetary policy and financial conditions.  Because the monetary policy impulse works through its impact on financial market conditions, I don’t see why the Fed would want to act in a way that deliberately made this linkage less predictable.  In actuality, I have been pushing in the opposite direction.  By explaining the importance of financial conditions as part of our monetary policy decisions, I am trying to tighten the linkage.   \n\nBalance Sheet Normalization\n\nI’d like to wrap up my comments tonight by discussing the likely next step in the monetary policy normalization process: beginning to allow maturing Treasuries and agency MBS paydowns to run off the Fed’s balance sheet, in contrast to our current practice of reinvesting all of the proceeds.  As you are aware, following the June FOMC meeting we issued an addendum to our Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.3   In that addendum, the FOMC outlined how it planned to gradually reduce the Fed’s securities holdings over time.  Namely, when that program is implemented, the FOMC will decrease its reinvestments in an orderly way, with repayments reinvested only to the extent they exceed gradually rising caps.  For maturing Treasury securities, the FOMC anticipates that the monthly cap will be $6 billion initially and will increase in steps of $6 billion at three-month intervals over 12 months until it reaches $30 billion.  For repayments of agency MBS, the monthly cap will be $4 billion initially and will increase in steps of $4 billion at three-month intervals over 12 months until it reaches $20 billion.  \n\nFor Treasury securities, when the caps are fully phased in, they will generally only be binding during the middle month of each quarter, when there is typically a spike in maturing Treasuries in the Fed’s portfolio.  For agency MBS, as long as long-term interest rates are steady or rising, we expect that the fully-phased-in caps will not be binding.  However, if long-term interest rates were to fall sharply—provoking a surge in refinancing and mortgage repayments—the caps would likely bind, limiting the amount of agency MBS that would have to be absorbed by the private market.\n\nAs currently anticipated, once we start the balance sheet normalization program, we expect it to continue in the background until the FOMC judges that the Fed’s securities holdings are no larger than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.  Adjustments to the target range of the federal funds rate will remain the primary tool of monetary policy.  However, if economic circumstances were to change during the normalization process in a way that would warrant a sizable reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate, the FOMC would be prepared to resume reinvestment. \n\nThe program has been designed to be implemented gradually and predictably so that market participants and the U.S. Treasury can anticipate when and at what pace the portfolio is likely to run off over the course of normalization.  This should keep expectations more stable and reduce the risk that a sharp shift in expectations could generate undesirably large movements in interest rates and asset prices. \n\nAs I see it, a few questions about this program remain and are worth addressing.  The first question is why do this at all.  After all, the Fed has had a large balance sheet for many years now.  In my view, the balance sheet expansion was undertaken in response to an extraordinary set of circumstances—a deep recession, short-term interest rates at the zero lower bound, and the economy far away from our dual mandate objectives.  Now that these circumstances no longer hold, it seems appropriate to begin to reduce the size of the Fed’s balance sheet.  \n\nIn thinking about the decision to reduce the size of the Fed’s balance sheet, I see two important, opposing factors.  One is that a large balance sheet could conceivably make further asset purchases less attractive.  This factor suggests that we should use the opportunity to shrink the balance sheet during good economic times so that this tool will be fully available to us in the future if necessary.  However, on the other side, reducing the size of the balance sheet is another form of monetary tightening, one with which we have little experience.  This suggests we should proceed with caution.  The FOMC has judged that a gradual, predictable approach to normalization is the best way to appropriately balance these two factors.  \n\nAnother question is how long the normalization process will take.  Assuming that this process begins later this year and continues uninterrupted, the balance sheet size would likely normalize in the early part of the next decade.4 There is uncertainty about the exact timing for several reasons.  We don’t know how fast our agency MBS holdings will pre-pay, how quickly currency outstanding will grow, how many bank reserves will be required for the efficient execution of monetary policy, or the evolution of other liability items on the Fed’s balance sheet that affect the amount of bank reserves. \n\nAgainst that backdrop, one major issue that remains outstanding is whether the Fed will continue to operate with a “floor” system, in which the Fed maintains a relatively abundant supply of reserves and the effective federal funds rate is managed by periodic adjustments to the interest rate the Fed pays on bank reserves.  Or, whether the Fed will move back to a “corridor” system, in which reserves are relatively scarce and the effective federal funds rate is managed by frequently adjusting the supply of reserves to meet demand at the desired federal funds rate level.  In this type of regime, it is the quantity of reserves, rather than the interest rate the Fed pays on reserves, that is the primary driver of the federal funds rate.5    \n\nHaving managed the System Open Market Account during the financial crisis—a period during which the demand for reserves was very volatile—I very much favor a floor-type system.  It is much easier to manage on a day-to-day basis.  It also eliminates the need for a lot of interbank trading activity to move reserves to banks that would otherwise find themselves short of reserves on a particular day.  In my view, this type of intermediation activity does not have much social value.\n\nWhile the FOMC has discussed these issues, it has made no decision about its choice of long-term monetary policy operating framework.  This seems appropriate to me because over the next few years we will gain considerable further experience about operating with a floor-type system.  Nevertheless, my expectation is that the FOMC will ultimately favor maintaining a floor-type system similar to what is in place today.  As support, I would point to the minutes of the November 2016 FOMC meeting, in which participants observed that the current framework had been working well. \n\nThis leads us to the next question:  Assuming that a floor system is retained, what amount of reserves will be needed in the banking system so that day-to-day open market operations are not necessary to keep the federal funds rate within its target range?   In other words, how small can the amount of excess reserves be before banks begin to compete and bid for such reserves, introducing unwanted volatility to the federal funds rate?  First, there will need to be sufficient excess reserves to accommodate day-to-day fluctuations in the “autonomous factors” that influence the amount of reserves in the banking system.  These include shifts in the Treasury’s cash balance, the foreign repo pool, and overnight reverse repo facility usage.  Second, there will have to be an additional buffer to meet banks’ underlying demand for reserves.  We expect that the demand for reserves will be considerably higher than it was prior to the financial crisis because reserves can be used to satisfy the more stringent liquidity requirements that are in place today, and because the opportunity cost of holding reserves is much lower now since the Fed pays interest on reserves. \n\nTogether, as a rough starting point, we have suggested that the necessary amount of excess reserves could be in a range of $400 billion to $1 trillion.6   Coupled with uncertainty about the likely growth in other factors, such as currency outstanding, this implies a normalized balance sheet size of, perhaps, $2.4 trillion to $3.5 trillion in the early 2020s.  \n\nAfter reaching that level, one should anticipate that the Fed would resume purchases of Treasury securities.  These purchases would allow the balance sheet to expand to accommodate the growth in currency outstanding and in banks’ demand for reserves as the economy grows.  They also would make up for ongoing paydowns of the agency MBS that remain in our portfolio. \n\nAlthough there is considerable uncertainty about the long-run size of the Fed’s balance sheet, I would stress that the balance sheet is likely to shrink by much less than it grew between 2007 and 2014.  Based on New York Fed staff projections, I would expect the Fed’s balance sheet, which currently stands at $4.5 trillion, to shrink by roughly $1 trillion to $2 trillion.  This compares to an increase of about $3.7 trillion in the wake of the financial crisis.  This is another reason why I anticipate that the impact of balance sheet normalization on financial markets is likely to be quite mild.  This view is supported by empirical research carried out within the Fed7 and is consistent with the results of surveys of private sector economists, including the Survey of Primary Dealers and the Survey of Market Participants conducted by the New York Fed’s Markets Group.8  \n\nConclusion\n\nTo sum up, I expect that the U.S. economy will continue to perform quite well, with slightly above-trend growth leading to further gradual tightening of the U.S. labor market.  As this occurs, I would anticipate that wage growth will firm and that price inflation will gradually rise.  In response, I expect that we will continue to gradually remove monetary policy accommodation.  Balance sheet normalization will likely be part of this process.  But, we expect this to have only a mild impact and to run passively in the background.  Short-term interest rates will remain the primary tool of monetary policy. \n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions."

        "date": "Aug 16, 2017",
        "speaker": "Unknown",
        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/pot170816",
        "content": "Mr. Chairman, Mr. Vice-Chairman, and honorable governors and heads of delegation, I appreciate this opportunity for me and my colleagues from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to speak before the Assembly of Governors of the Association of African Central Banks (AACB). Since its establishment in 1963, the AACB has played a vital role in fostering cooperation among central banks in Africa, and between central banks inside and outside of Africa. Through my participation in the Symposium yesterday, I got a sense of the challenges and purpose that drives your agenda in this diverse and dynamic region. The AACB is an important forum for exchanging views within the region and with international partners on these shared challenges and opportunities.\n\nMy colleagues and I have joined your meetings to seek enhanced dialogue with each of your institutions to strengthen our relationships and channels of communication. We view this engagement as an initial step in our long-term commitment to strengthen our ties with African central banks, and we are pleased to have already met bilaterally with many of you.\n\nSeveral factors underpin why strengthening relations with African central banks is a high priority for the New York Fed at this time, as demonstrated by the range and seniority of our delegation.  \n\nFirst, in the increasingly interconnected global economy and financial markets, the need to better appreciate dynamics in cross border flows of capital and goods has never been greater in order to better understand developments in one’s own economy.  This is true in the U.S. as it is in all of your countries.  As Africa has become an increasingly important contributor to global output, with some of the fastest growing economies in the world over the past two decades, a better shared grasp of the dynamics in both our economies is very much in all of our interests. Additionally, with the U.S. dollar serving as the world’s primary reserve currency, we at the Fed have a very natural and symbiotic relationship with many central banks around the world including those in Africa.  This is the broader context behind our efforts to enhance our cooperation with African central banks, building on existing people-to-people exchanges exemplified by the long-standing participation of African central bankers in the New York Fed’s annual central bank seminar and specialized training courses, and other Federal Reserve cooperative training arrangements with African central banks on bank supervision topics.  Participation in this gathering will hopefully only strengthen and deepen these relationships.\n\nSecond, the Federal Reserve and African central banks maintain direct operational ties through the U.S. dollar correspondent and custody accounts that many central banks in this room hold at the New York Fed.  African countries represent approximately one-quarter of the total number of the Federal Reserve’s foreign official accountholders, the second largest regional representation, with some very long-standing account relationships.\n\nLet me speak for a moment about the role of our services to the global central banking community.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s provision of U.S. dollar account services to the global official community stems from our recognition that central banks around the world have a mutual need for correspondent banking and custody services to execute on core central banking functions  in which the safety, confidentiality, and reliability of service provision is essential. Given the global role of the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, we recognize the special role that our account infrastructure plays in supporting policy implementation by central banks around the world. As such, we devote significant attention and resources to maintaining a robust operational and risk management culture. This allows us to continue to provide these services for the benefit of the global central banking community.\n\nThis brings me to the third reason why enhancing relationships with African central banks is a high priority for us, and that is the need for stronger dialogue on the evolving risk environment in cross-border payments. Undoubtedly, there has been a significant shift in global perceptions of the seriousness of cyber threats across the board, be they in the realm of politics, business, finance, or the media. For financial institutions, while cyber threats at one point may have been regarded as a relatively minor cost of doing business, it is not an exaggeration to say that they are now viewed as potential existential threats, not just to individual firms but also to the broader financial system and critical infrastructures that support it. As central banks with broad mandates for financial stability, this is certainly a concern for us all.\n\nFor the Federal Reserve, a cyber breach at one of our central bank customers last year led to authenticated yet fraudulent SWIFT messages being sent to us to wire out substantial sums of money. While neither SWIFT nor Federal Reserve systems were breached, this incident was a strong reminder that the robustness of our customers’ internal control environment is a matter that concerns the entire central bank community.\n\nWe recognize the challenges and complexities in strengthening prevention, detection, and incident response regimes around processing of fraudulent payment instructions. SWIFT users span the full range of IT sophistication and capacity, and remediating deficiencies in prevention and detection may require a substantial re-orientation of priorities and resources for some institutions. Overcoming these obstacles will be no easy task, but so long as there is a weak link in the cybersecurity chain cybercriminals will seek to exploit it.\n\nReflecting the complex, systemic, and cross-national nature of the threats, recent global initiatives have been undertaken at multiple levels.  At the international level, SWIFT has taken the lead through its Customer Security Program (CSP). At the core of the CSP is promoting increased transparency concerning the adherence of SWIFT users to best practices on internal controls, with a related attestation required by the end of this year. At the global standard-setting level, the BIS Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) initiated last year a Task Force on Wholesale Payments Security. The Task Force was established to look into the security of wholesale payments that involve banks, financial market infrastructures and other financial institutions.  This effort builds on previous work by the CPMI on cyber security and operational risk and is working to make sure there are adequate checks and balances in place at each stage of the payments process.\n\nWhile these international efforts are important and necessary, they are in themselves inadequate unless there is buy-in at the institutional level for strengthening internal risk frameworks, controls, and cultures. For some, this may require investing in expanded technical capabilities. But for all, this is represented by “going back to basics” by continuously reinforcing strong risk management policies and practices in your work environments. Cyber incidents often originate from an initial breakdown at the human level, be it inserting an unauthorized USB drive, leaving a token inserted overnight, clicking on an improper link, or falling prey to social engineering.\n\nAs we all move forward to strengthen the global financial system, we stand ready to cooperate with African central banks, a critical component of which is building strong relationships of trust and understanding. Our participation in these meetings are an important part of furthering our partnership  and we look forward to a more comprehensive and sustained engagement going forward."

        "title": "Remarks at the Economic Press Briefing on the Regional Economy",
        "date": "Aug 10, 2017",
        "speaker": "William C. Dudley",
        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/dud170810",
        "content": "Good morning, and welcome to the New York Fed’s Regional Economic Press Briefing.  Today, we will provide an update on economic conditions in the region, and then discuss the issue of regional wage inequality.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nCurrent Economic Conditions\n\nThe Federal Reserve has pursued an accommodative monetary policy since the Great Recession to facilitate achieving our dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment and price stability.  This policy stance has provided support to the economy and helped lower the unemployment rate from 10 percent at the depths of the Great Recession to 4.3 percent currently.  Measures of underemployment have also improved considerably and are near pre-crisis levels. \n\nStronger labor market conditions are perhaps the best means to improve the economic well-being of most Americans, particularly those who have been struggling and are most vulnerable to economic downturns.  Improved job opportunities have helped to support household income growth, consumption, and saving, as well as the housing market.  And, as discussed in the Fed’s recent Monetary Policy Report and in Chair Yellen’s testimony before Congress, it is encouraging that unemployment rates continue to fall for most major demographic groups, including African-Americans and Hispanics.  At the same time, we should remain concerned about those groups, for which the jobless rates remain above the unemployment rate for the nation.  Our outlook anticipates a continued moderate growth trend, with some further strengthening in the labor market and an increase in inflation over the medium term toward our objective of 2 percent. \n\nAlthough job growth in our region has slowed somewhat in recent months, economic activity continues to expand.  After outpacing the United States as a whole for a number of years, job growth in New York City is now running a bit below the national average.  And, as has been the case for some time, job growth in Northern New Jersey remains a little below New York City’s pace.  Over the past year, job growth has flattened out in much of upstate New York, with Albany remaining a bright spot in the region.  Unfortunately, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands both remain mired in economic difficulties with no clear signs of a revival.\n\nWhile the post-crisis expansion is now the third-longest on record, by historical standards it has been marked by a relatively weak pace of growth, with annual GDP growth averaging just 2.1 percent since mid-2009.  Wage growth has also been comparatively modest even as unemployment has declined.  In part, this likely reflects the fact that productivity growth has been sluggish compared to historical experience.  Relative income differences are likely to get more attention when economic growth is weak and people do not see significant improvement in their absolute income levels.  With that in mind, as we consider how to address the issues of income inequality and mobility, we should also consider how to improve flagging productivity growth, because that would help raise the level of household income.\n\nWage Inequality\n\nToday’s briefing will focus on labor market inequality, including wage inequality in our region.\n\nCurrently, we see comparatively high levels of inequality in the labor market in terms of differences in the wages workers earn.  This situation has been in the making for several decades.  Since the early 1980s, wages have increased more rapidly for workers toward the top of the income distribution than for the median worker, and much more rapidly than for workers toward the bottom of the distribution.  Further, this increase in inequality can be seen throughout the entire distribution of wages.\n\nIn my view, two main factors are responsible for this pattern of differential wage growth and the resulting increase in wage inequality.  First, advances in technology have dramatically changed the nature of work, increasing the skill requirements for many jobs while displacing others.  Second, the pace of globalization has accelerated in recent decades, with increased cross-border trade, investment, immigration, and the emergence of global supply chains.  Together, these economic forces have contributed to significant job losses in certain sectors, most notably manufacturing.  The resulting decline in demand for middle- and lower-skilled workers has resulted in fewer jobs and has depressed wages for many in those industries.  Other, less important factors behind the rise in inequality include the decline in private sector labor unions and the falling real value of the minimum wage. \n\nAt the same time, technological change and globalization have created jobs in areas such as engineering and software development.  Demand has been particularly high for knowledge workers, resulting in strong wage growth in certain sectors.  All told, the forces of technological change and globalization have contributed to wage inequality by pushing up wages for those toward the top, and stifling wage growth for workers toward the middle and bottom of the wage distribution.  As I have said in previous remarks, we need to do a better job of helping those hurt by globalization.2\n\nMonetary policy can help support economic growth, but it is much less powerful in addressing the structural factors that underpin inequality in the labor market.  That said, understanding the causes and consequences of economic inequality is important to the Fed.  We are working hard at producing research, information, data, and analysis so that we can better understand inequality and participate in an informed debate on how to best address it.  One significant initiative within the Federal Reserve System is the creation of the Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute at the Minneapolis Fed.  The Institute conducts research to measure, analyze, and make recommendations to improve the economic well-being of all Americans, with a particular focus on structural barriers that limit full participation in economic opportunity and advancement.\n\nLagging Economic Mobility\n\nIn a free market economy, some wage inequality is inevitable given variability in individuals’ endowments, skill sets, and education levels.  These attributes influence the demand for their services and the wages they are paid. We don’t expect those just starting out to have the skills of more experienced workers. \n\nBut, the access and opportunity needed to attain the attributes associated with higher wages may not be uniform—and that is concerning.  Inequality reflects impediments to people reaching their potential.  These include limits on access to education, credit, transportation, and housing.  Such impediments may discourage workers from investing in themselves, and may lead some to drop out of the labor force.  We should all work to ensure that people have opportunities to develop their skills, build human capital, and improve their job prospects. \n\nTo me, inequality is especially problematic when it reflects and reinforces barriers to economic mobility.  Too many parents are increasingly pessimistic about their children’s economic future.  According to a recent Pew Research Center survey, only 37 percent of American parents think their children will be better off financially than they are.3   This is a deeply troubling finding.  I believe that income inequality is generally less problematic when it does not impede economic mobility and when economic mobility is high.  While the “rags to riches” story has been a popular theme in U.S. history, income mobility in the United States is now notably lower than in many other advanced economies.\n\nUnfortunately, substantial differences in economic mobility exist within the United States.  Important research by Raj Chetty and his co-authors suggests that upward mobility strongly depends on where one grew up.4   That is, places themselves seem to have a measureable effect on economic outcomes for children as they reach adulthood.  In particular, this research indicates that higher upward mobility is associated with areas that are less residentially segregated by race or income, and that have higher-quality schools, stronger social networks, greater community involvement, and stable family structures.  Significantly, they find that places with greater upward economic mobility tend to have lower income inequality.  This evidence suggests that there is a fundamental inequality of opportunity for advancement that is tied to where people live.  Reducing inequality of opportunity is something we should all work toward. \n\nDirections for Policy\n\nSo, what are some specific ways policy can address inequality and improve economic mobility?  While this is a difficult and complex set of issues with no easy answers, I do have a few thoughts.  First and foremost, we can improve the quality of education for our most vulnerable citizens.  Children who attend better schools and attain higher levels of education have more favorable long-term outcomes, including better job prospects and higher earnings.  There are large disparities in the quality of education a student receives, which are highly correlated with where that student lives.  We need to look for ways to provide higher-quality education regardless of where people live. Reducing the role of local property taxes in school financing to better equalize school quality across locations is one example.5    \n\nIn addition, education’s benefits start very early in life and are cumulative.  While we need to further strengthen primary and secondary education, there is convincing evidence that educational investments in early childhood have especially high rates of return in terms of lifetime earnings and are associated with many other positive outcomes.6\n\nWorkforce development is another key policy area that can improve economic mobility and reduce inequality.  Because of the swift pace of economic change driven by advances in technology and globalization, we ought to step up efforts to help workers build the skills necessary to adapt to change.  This means providing these types of services at the local level.  These efforts should include innovative workforce development programs, coursework and certifications in key skills that are in demand, and fostering partnerships between higher education institutions and local employers.  Here, I would point to Monroe Community College in Rochester as a model of successful collaboration with employers to create job-training programs that align with current employment opportunities.7\n\nConclusion\n\nThe issues of economic inequality and income mobility are among the most important that we face as a nation and as a region.  These issues are particularly relevant for our region because the Second District is home to some of the highest and lowest levels of wage inequality in the country.  Next, Research Officer Jaison Abel will discuss regional economic conditions and wage inequality.\n\nThank you for your kind attention."

        "title": "The Foreign Exchange Global Code: Lessons Learned and Next Steps",
        "date": "Jul 12, 2017",
        "speaker": "Unknown",
        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/pot170712",
        "content": "Good morning.  It is a pleasure to return to FX Week USA, and I would like to thank FX Week for the invitation.  Foreign exchange (FX) market participants play important roles in their interactions with the New York Fed. They act as FX trading counterparties of the New York Fed and they provide information on market conditions to support the Desk’s monitoring of financial markets and transmission of policy. I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak with you today.  Before I begin, I would also like to note that my comments today reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.1 However, remarks on the expectations for FX counterparties reflect the policies of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nAt this event two years ago, I highlighted the important role the FX market plays in facilitating the flow of capital across the globe in support of international trade and investment. It is a critical market that is relied upon by households, corporations, financial institutions, asset managers, sovereigns and many others. In 2015, I called on the industry to help strengthen the foundation of the market and to uphold its integrity.  Today, I am pleased to say that the industry answered that call and there has since been significant industry engagement on work to promote the integrity and effective functioning of the FX market. After more than two years of work, the FX Global Code2 (the Code or Global Code) has been published to serve as a single, global set of principles for the FX market.  The Code is accompanied by a set of adherence principles to promote its widespread adoption, and includes a set of illustrative examples to further describe various practices.  In addition, a new, formalized Global Foreign Exchange Committee (GFXC) was launched to engage an even broader set of regions than past efforts and to continue a more defined work program across jurisdictions for upholding the Global Code.\n\nIn my remarks today, I will share reflections on the Global Code, including some lessons learned in its development and the various steps underway to help promote and support its adoption. I will then discuss the Global Foreign Exchange Committee’s (GFXC) objectives, which include the ongoing evolution and maintenance of the Code.  Finally, I will spend some time discussing particular areas where the market is evolving and where the GFXC is currently soliciting additional input, including on “last look.”\n\nDevelopment of the Code and its Principles\n\nThe Foreign Exchange Working Group (FXWG), led by Guy Debelle of the Reserve Bank of Australia, was established under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Markets Committee in July 2015.3 It was tasked with facilitating the development of a single, global set of principles for the FX market and accompanying tools to promote adherence to those principles.  I had the pleasure of leading the work stream to write the Code, while Chris Salmon of the Bank of England led the effort to create tools to promote adherence. The work of the FXWG was supported by the Market Participants Group (MPG), led by David Puth of CLS, which included members from all corners of the FX industry. \n\nAs made clear in the foreword, the Code is not regulation—it is a set of voluntary, global best practices.  The development of successful best practices requires active engagement from a diverse spectrum of market participants, which we were fortunate to have throughout this effort.  The FX Global Code is intended for all FX market participants engaged in the global wholesale market. This includes sell-side institutions, certain market infrastructures, and buyside institutions as well.   The spectrum of buy side institutions active in FX is particularly complex and varied, encompassing hedge funds, high frequency trading firms, asset managers and corporates among others.  The size and complexity of their FX market activities and the nature of those activities may differ significantly. Hearing the viewpoints of many different institutions was critical to delivering a relevant Code for this diverse landscape, recognizing that while the Code applies to all, the details of precisely how it applies may differ.  I found that the series of frank debates and discussions that we—market participants and central bankers alike—had over the past two years was an important process in itself, and not just a means to an end.  The result was multiple drafts of the Code and, ultimately, a product that more clearly articulated principles and defined terminology.  \n\nThe 55 principles within the Global Code focus on promoting transparency,  fairness and mitigating risk across six primary areas–Ethics, Governance, Execution, Information Sharing, Risk Management and Compliance, and Confirmation and Settlement.  I would like to highlight a few of these principles to provide a sense of the Code’s content, and use these examples to illustrate some of the fundamental building blocks of a fair, transparent, and efficient market. \n\nThe Code begins with principles on ethics. The very first principle states that Market Participants should strive for the highest ethical standards. While this is a basic concept, the principle is fundamental and underpins each and every principle that follows.  Market participants should both have the right tools to make the right choices and want to make the right choices.  The various principles on governance then build upon that ethical foundation. They highlight some of the key structures that a firm should have in place to support responsible behavior by its individual employees and as an organization overall. \n\nThe principles within the execution section were those that occupied the most hours of focus during the last two years.  Principle 8, for example, is the first execution principle and is quite short: “Market Participants should be clear about the capacities in which they act.”  Although short, this principle generated very active discussion.  Reaching consensus on how to describe various roles in the market was unexpectedly challenging. Terms relating to these roles, like principal and agent, may be used differently across different regions and by different entities. Moreover, they may have legal definitions, and the Code is not intended to interfere with legal definitions.\n\nWithin the Code, acting as an ‘agent’ is described roughly as executing orders on behalf of a client without taking on market risk in connection with that order.  Acting as a ‘principal’ is described as taking on one or more risks in executing a client order.  In doing so, a principal may have discretion in the execution of a trade and, if so, that discretion should be communicated clearly and exercised fairly and in such a way that is not designed or intended to disadvantage the client.  These concepts are echoed in the various principles that follow, which highlight more specific recommendations based upon the roles market participants take on and the types of transactions in which they engage.  Labels aside, the fundamental recommendations regarding roles recognize the importance of clear communication of roles, the importance of fairness and the strong expectation that discretion not be used in a manner designed to disadvantage a client.\n\nClarity of terminology was again important during the development of Principle 11 on pre-hedging.  The Code is very specific in how it describes pre-hedging. It is defined as “the management of the risk associated with one or more anticipated client orders, designed to benefit the client in connection with such orders and any resulting transactions.”  The principle then lays out circumstances in which such pre-hedging may or may not be appropriate.\n\nThe principles on information sharing cover topics where there had seemed to be a lack of clarity within the market.  The principles emphasize the importance of appropriately identifying and managing confidential information.  They describe what may constitute confidential information and when such information should or should not be shared and with whom. They also provide guidance as to how market participants might communicate market color appropriately and, critically, without compromising confidential information. \n\nIt is important to recognize that the FX market is not entirely about trading and execution—risk management, compliance, and confirmation and settlement are central to FX transactions, and they comprise the final two sections of the Code. \n\nWithin the section on risk management and compliance, principles focus on recognizing and understanding the risks faced and employing tools to mitigate those risks where possible.  In this context, the Code highlights that it is important for each institution to evaluate these risks based on the role it plays in the market.  Two areas we focused significant time on during the development of the Code were prime brokerage and electronic trading platforms.  The Code notes that market participants who provide credit intermediation and/or market access to other market participants should (a) take that activity into account in their risk assessment and (b) engage in dialogue with the participants they are providing access to about responsible behavior in the market.  \n\nFinally, the last section includes various confirmation and settlement principles that reduce operational risk related to FX transactions where possible.  These principles encourage smooth, efficient, and timely settlement of FX trades and highlight various steps to help support that aim.\n\nAdoption of the Code\n\nThe FXWG central banks had a clear mandate from the BIS governors to not just develop the Code, but to also develop means to promote its adherence and ultimate effectiveness.  Central banks and the industry can take steps to support the Code’s widespread adoption in the market across all types of market participants—from FX dealers, regional banks, asset managers, and corporations, to hedge funds, high frequency trading firms and others, such as FX trading platforms and algorithmic service providers.  As I noted earlier, while the Code is not a set of rules, nor is it regulation, support for the Code and its principles is central to achieving its goals.  With that in mind, I would like to turn now to the Statement of Commitment that was developed alongside the Code, talk about steps the New York Fed itself is taking, and then touch upon some of the industry measures underway to support adoption.\n\nThe Statement of Commitment was developed and appended to the Code to provide a standard tool by which an institution may—on a voluntary basis—demonstrate its commitment to the principles of the Code.  The Statement of Commitment provides that an institution is an FX market participant and has reviewed the Code. By using it, an institution acknowledges the principles as reflecting good practice and exhibits a commitment to conducting that institution’s activities in a manner consistent with the Code.  The Statement, like the Code itself, acknowledges that market participants vary by size, complexity and nature of activities, and that diversity should be reflected in the steps they may need to take for adoption and adherence.\n\nCentral banks, similar to FX market participants, are committed to the Code’s adoption as well.  Following its publication, BIS central bank governors expressed their support for the Code by noting that central banks “are strongly committed to supporting and promoting adherence to the Code. They confirm that they intend to adhere to the principles of the Code, and will expect the same of their regular FX counterparties, except where this would inhibit the discharge of their policy functions. Additionally, members of central bank sponsored foreign exchange committees will be expected to adhere to the Code.”  \n\nConsistent with this support, and in light of our interest in the integrity and effective function of the FX market, the New York Fed will be focusing on adherence to these best practices.  We are currently assessing our own FX market activities relative to the Code and evaluating what steps, if any, we must take to be able to make our own Statement of Commitment.  In addition, we have revisited our own counterparty policy in light of the Code. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York policy on counterparties for market operations had already noted that counterparties were expected to operate in accordance with best practices promulgated by the New York Fed-sponsored Treasury Market Practices Group and the Foreign Exchange Committee.  However, that policy was recently revised to emphasize adherence to the Code in light of its publication.  Finally, adherence to the Code is also being integrated into the membership framework for our sponsored Foreign Exchange Committee. These steps illustrate our desire to transact and engage with entities that are behaving with integrity.\n\nCentral banks have an important role to play in supporting best practices, such as the Global Code.  It is, however, ultimately incumbent upon the industry to support and promote adoption of the Code across the marketplace.  I’d like to highlight a variety of initiatives underway to support this adoption.\n\nFirst, outreach and education regarding the Code is critical and has been underway via events like this and ongoing engagement with industry associations.  Central bank colleagues and industry market participants here and abroad have been active in reaching out locally to raise awareness of the Code.  New and updated education tools are already in development to help further promote the Code.  As awareness permeates the market, these efforts will support better understanding and adoption of the Code.\n\nSecond, industry market participants have expressed a desire for a mechanism, such as a public register, to make public their Statements of Commitment. Discussions with industry suggest that multiple public registers may likely be established over time. I look forward to seeing how this work evolves. \n\nIt will be important to understand how the Code is being adopted across the industry.  To this end, the GFXC is also developing a survey to help assess how the Code is being applied following its publication.  This survey can provide a baseline that we can measure against over time, and can help to assess how the Code is filtering into the market, going forward. \n\nGFXC, Evolution of the Code and Last Look\n\nOver the past two years, the industry has been very heavily engaged in Global Code efforts through the MPG and the regional foreign exchange committees (FXCs). The past two years have shown that the work of central banks and industry in partnership, at a global level, is productive in developing and supporting best practices.  As such, while both the FXWG and MPG have fulfilled their mandate to develop the Code, this spirit of central bank-industry partnership will be maintained, as will the Code itself, in the future by the newly formalized GFXC. \n\nThe GFXC reflects a significant expansion of cross-border and public-private sector efforts. It is a forum that brings together central banks and market participants via the FXCs—currently representing sixteen regions—to encourage collaboration and communication on FX-related issues, to exchange views on trends and developments in the FX market, and to promote and maintain the FX Global Code.  In addition, the work to develop the Code has led to the development of central bank-sponsored FXCs in new regions, some of which have already launched and others that are forthcoming.  FXCs, including the one sponsored by the New York Fed, will play important roles both within their own region and in their global engagement via the GFXC.\n\nOne of the key objectives of the GFXC is to keep abreast of the evolution of the market, and work to ensure that the Code’s principles remain relevant.  One area of evolution is electronic trading.  Before concluding, I want to spend some time discussing the GFXC’s request for feedback on particular aspects related to the use of last look in electronic FX trading.\n\nAs you might suspect, Principle 17 on last look likely consumed the most time and energy of any of the principles in the Code.  In many areas within the last look principle there was broad consensus as to what constitutes good practice. What was clear from this process was that market participants seemed to define last look in different ways and apply it in different ways as well.  Last look is described in the Code as a practice in which a market participant receives a trade request and has the opportunity to accept or reject that trade request against its quoted price.  The Code notes that if utilized, last look should be used as a risk mechanism to verify validity and/or price.  The principle focuses on the importance of transparency and fairness.  Market participants should be clear about whether and, if so, how last look might apply to their client trade requests to allow clients to make an informed choice regarding their execution.\n\nIn one particular area—that of trading during the last look “window”—there was a definite diversity of views.  On the one hand, some market participants argued that such trading activity would always be detrimental to the client as it could move the market in a direction that is not to the client’s advantage.  On the other hand, some market participants felt that such trading activity could increase their ability and willingness to conduct client trades presented by clients without necessarily placing the clients at a disadvantage.  Some expressed the view that they prefer only to use dealers that don’t trade during the last look window, while others preferred having different options. \n\nGiven this range of input, the principle highlights that last look should not be used for the purposes of information gathering without an intention to accept the trade request.  Further, it notes the risk associated with trading activity during the last look window. The principle provides that “trading activity that utilizes the information from a Client’s trade request, included any related hedging activity, is likely inconsistent with good market practice because it may signal to other Market Participants the Client’s trading intent, skewing market prices against the Client, which (1) is not likely to benefit the Client, and (2) in the event that the Market Participant rejects the Client’s request to trade, constitutes use of Confidential Information in a manner not specified by the Client.”  \n\nIn light of the breadth of opinions expressed during the development of this principle, the GFXC has decided to reach out to the broader market for further input on this narrow topic of trading during the last look window.  The GFXC poses two questions. First, it asks whether respondents agree with the characterization of trading activity during the last look window and whether there are examples where such activity can benefit the client within the context of how last look is described in the Code.  Second, it asks whether respondents believe the language related to trading during the last look window should be modified.\n\nMany of you are very knowledgeable about these topics and we hope you will take the opportunity to share your insights on these questions.  The GFXC is not only seeking views at the tails, but also those more in the middle of the spectrum as well. Importantly, all perspectives are welcome.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe request for feedback is an opportunity to engage at an industry level in supporting the resilience of this critical and fundamental market—one that represents far more than the sum of its parts and players.  As I said in 2015,4 “the transactions that take place [in the FX market] are the lifeblood of a global economy that comprises many different national currencies.”  At that time, I called upon the industry to take action and I am impressed by what I have seen through the work in developing the Code and in the spirit in which it has been received so far.  But that work isn’t over—it never is. \n\nBest practices do not work without the ongoing commitment of those in the industry, those making the choices each day.  No Code, and in fact no law or regulation, can force all participants in a market as broad and diverse as FX to maintain a marketplace that values openness, resilience, high ethical standards, and competition. But, that fact is no reason to forego striving for such a marketplace. Developing the Code has been one way of working toward that goal. I hope that you all continue your focus on these issues and do your part to support a resilient global, wholesale FX market.  I encourage you to adopt the Code as a benchmark for your firm’s activities in the wholesale FX market and use the Statement of Commitment to demonstrate that adoption to your fellow participants.  As we state in the foreword of the Code, the goal is an FX market that is a “robust, fair, liquid, open and appropriately transparent market in which a diverse set of Market Participants, supported by resilient infrastructure, are able to confidently and effectively transact at competitive process that reflect available market information and in a manner that conforms to acceptable standards of behaviour.”\n\nMany thanks for your time and continued active engagement."

        "speaker": "William C. Dudley",
        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/dud170626",
        "content": "Let me start by thanking Jens Weidmann and the Bank for International Settlements for the opportunity to respond and comment on Professor Hélène Rey’s thoughtful remarks and on the issue of international spillovers associated with U.S. monetary policy.  As always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nAs is characteristic of her work, what Hélène has to say is well-argued and provocative.  It is also very relevant to the conduct of monetary policy and the functioning of the international monetary system.  I mostly agree with the major points she makes. \n\nFirst, I wholeheartedly agree with her on the hazards of financial booms.  Rapid increases in credit and capital flows, asset prices, and leverage can lead to potentially severe corrections that can impose great stress on financial systems.  As we have seen repeatedly, this stress can impair the ability of the financial system to perform well in intermediating credit between savers and borrowers, and in helping households and businesses manage their financial risks.  When a financial system becomes impaired, there can be dire consequences for economic activity and the ability of central banks to achieve their macroeconomic objectives.\n\nHélène’s work highlights an important global dimension to financial cycles, showing that gross capital flows, asset prices and credit often move in a synchronized way across countries as perceptions of risk change.  As we now know all too well, the global financial crisis dramatically underscored the fact that instability in the U.S. financial system and those of other advanced economies imposed extraordinarily high costs on the entire global economy. \n\nMaking the global financial system more resilient and less procyclical has been a key focus of policymakers since the financial crisis, and most countries have made substantial progress on this front.  This is evident in stronger capital and liquidity buffers for banks, lower reliance on wholesale short-term funding, reforms of over-the-counter derivatives markets, and the development of resolution and recovery regimes for banks and key financial market infrastructures, among other efforts.  Nonetheless, we must continue to work on these issues.\n\nIn particular, the U.S. financial system—the epicenter of the crisis—has been considerably strengthened.  Here, I would highlight additional reforms such as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) regime, which imposes annual capital stress tests on systemically important banks; tri-party repo reform; and money market mutual fund reform.  Policymakers globally have also made good progress on strengthening supervisory oversight, and are making headway—albeit more slowly—in developing effective macroprudential frameworks and toolkits. \n\nBut, more work remains to be done in several areas.  I would put particular emphasis on the tasks of completing the creation of a credible bank resolution regime that will work on a cross-border basis, and developing effective recovery regimes for key financial market infrastructures. \n\nI also agree with Hélène that monetary policy in the United States—given the size of its financial markets and the U.S. dollar’s status as a reserve currency—can have a significant impact on global financial conditions, including exchange rates, and that shifts in U.S. monetary policy can lead to consequential shifts in global capital flows.  However, it is also important to note that the impact of U.S. monetary policy restraint on emerging market economies (EMEs) has varied widely across tightening cycles.  The impact depends on many factors, including EME fundamentals, asset valuations, and the extent and composition of prior capital inflows to those economies.  Importantly, the impact has tended to be more benign when U.S. yields rise in response to good U.S. growth prospects.  In contrast, spillovers have tended to be more adverse when increased monetary policy stringency is associated with a deteriorating U.S. economic outlook.2  \n\nThese observations point to the need for the United States to keep its own house in order.  Promoting economic growth and financial stability in the United States, I believe, is the most important contribution we can make to promoting growth and stability worldwide.\n\nLike nearly all central banks, the Federal Reserve has a domestic mandate set for it—in our case, by the U.S. Congress.  It cannot subordinate its legal mandate of maximum employment and price stability in the United States to alternative international goals.  But, given the role of the United States and the U.S. dollar in the global economy and financial system, the Federal Reserve is—and indeed, needs to be—mindful of the international effects of its policy.  That is because those consequences can have important potential spillbacks to the U.S. economy and financial markets. \n\nThe bond market “taper tantrum” of 2013 highlighted that prospective changes in U.S. monetary policy could affect the EMEs—particularly those with existing vulnerabilities—and how those consequences, in turn, could spill back to the United States.  This episode underscored the need for clear communication and transparency around U.S. policy so that expectations can adjust smoothly and be appropriately calibrated to what is likely to occur. \n\nAs you know, the Federal Reserve has become increasingly transparent in recent years, in part to mitigate such risks.  Good communication and transparency is always important during periods of conventional policy normalization.  But, good communication and transparency may be even more important when one begins to unwind unconventional monetary policy actions, such as balance sheet policies with which we have little prior experience.  Moreover, I would surmise that adjustments to balance sheet policies undoubtedly affect asset prices in ways that differ from changes in short-term interest rates. \n\nEarlier this month, we announced an addendum to the FOMC’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.3   In this addendum, we spelled out how the balance sheet normalization program would work.  This was another step in a long chain of communications about the balance sheet—incremental steps that highlight the evolution of our communication practices. \n\nI hope you would agree that we have taken a very measured and careful approach. \n\nThis process started with the initial release of the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans in September 2014, which indicated that the FOMC planned to reduce securities in a gradual and predictable manner.  Related comments followed in the minutes of the July 2015 FOMC meeting and the December 2015 FOMC statement.  Subsequently, FOMC participants discussed potential long-run frameworks for monetary policy implementation as detailed in the November 2016 FOMC minutes. \n\nNext, the March 2017 FOMC minutes reaffirmed that a change in balance sheet policy would be gradual and predictable, and achieved primarily by changing the reinvestment policy.  These minutes also noted that most participants judged a change in reinvestment policy would likely be appropriate this year, should economic data develop as they expected.  Then, in the May 2017 minutes, it was noted that nearly all participants had a favorable view of a phased-in, cap approach whereby reinvestments would be decreased gradually.  Participants favored this strategy because a preannounced schedule would be gradual and predictable, limiting the magnitude of the runoff could help mitigate any adverse market effects, and the strategy would be relatively easy and straightforward to communicate. \n\nFinally, as I noted earlier, we followed up in our last FOMC meeting with the release of an addendum to our Policy Normalization Principles and Plans that outlined how our balance sheet normalization plan will work when it is implemented.  We also said clearly in the FOMC statement that if the economy evolves in line with our expectations, we expect to begin this process this year. \n\nIn response, market participants have progressively increased the probability assigned to a change in reinvestment policy this year.  Yet, Treasury and agency MBS markets have responded little at the time of these announcements—including those undertaken most recently.  To me, this suggests that these communications have generally been effective in fostering an orderly adjustment in expectations about how we are likely to normalize our balance sheet. \n\nI also agree with Hélène about the important role of financial conditions in influencing economic activity.  As I see it, financial conditions are a key transmission channel of monetary policy because they affect households’ and firms’ saving and investment plans and thus influence economic activity and the economic outlook.  If the response of financial conditions to changes in short-term interest rates were rigid and predictable, then there would be no need to pay such close attention to financial conditions.  But, as we all know, the linkage is in fact quite loose and variable. \n\nFor example, during the mid-2000s, financial conditions failed to tighten even as the Federal Reserve pushed its federal funds rate target up from 1 percent to 5¼ percent.  Conversely, at the height of the crisis, financial conditions tightened sharply even as the Federal Reserve aggressively pushed its federal funds rate target down toward zero.  As a result, monetary policymakers need to take the evolution of financial conditions into consideration.  For example, when financial conditions tighten sharply, this may mean that monetary policy may need to be tightened by less or even loosened.  On the other hand, when financial conditions ease—as has been the case recently—this can provide additional impetus for the decision to continue to remove monetary policy accommodation. \n\nWhile I agree with Hélène in most respects, there are a few points where I am less convinced.  While the global financial cycle complicates policymakers’ ability to guide financial conditions in their own economies, I’m not persuaded that the trilemma has been replaced by a dilemma—that is, essentially an “either/or” choice between an independent monetary policy versus an open capital account. \n\nWhile there is no panacea to insulate countries from financial spillovers—particularly when policy in some areas is constrained by the effective lower bound on interest rates—I think a combination of exchange rate flexibility, a credible monetary policy framework, sufficient foreign exchange reserves, and a strong financial system can help mitigate the effects of such spillovers.  Moreover, it strikes me that market participants have become more discriminating over time about the circumstances of different countries, rather than painting all EMEs with a similar broad brush. \n\nThat said, I accept Hélène’s suggestion that there may be other good alternatives, such as operating with less financial leverage and the increased use of macroprudential policy, including more aggressive stress testing.  Also, the current regime—in which countries mostly have to self-insure against external shocks—seems inefficient.  I believe that a regime with more risk-sharing across countries could be beneficial for the global economy. \n\nThank you for your kind attention. \n\nThe Andrew Crockett Memorial Lecture, 2017"

        "title": "The Launch of the FX Global Code",
        "date": "May 25, 2017",
        "speaker": "James P. Bergin",
        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/ber170525",
        "content": "Thank you, Colin, for the introduction.\n\nAs you know, trading in the FX market follows the sun. And today, so does the launch of the FX Global Code. This morning, London time, marked the official launch of the Code and the Global Foreign Exchange Committee (GFXC), a group that will maintain the Code over time. My colleague, Simon Potter, the head of our Markets Group at the New York Fed, was the leader of the workstream charged with developing the Code text. He is participating in launch events there in London, together with the two other central bank project leads, Guy Debelle of the Reserve Bank of Australia and Chris Salmon of the Bank of England, as well as David Puth of CLS, the chair of the Market Participants Group for the project, and other contributors from the public and private sectors. Now, here in New York, I am pleased to continue the launch on this side of the Atlantic.\n\nIn May 2015, central bank governors from around the world challenged staffs from a group of central banks “to strengthen code of conduct standards and principles in foreign exchange markets . . . by facilitating the establishment of a single global code of conduct standards and principles [and] promoting greater adherence to these standards and principles . . . .”2 The publication of the Code is an important milestone for both those central banks and members of the private sector who have invested considerable time and effort into its development over the past two years.\n\nToday, I would like share with you how staff from central banks took on the governors’ challenge, and in turn challenged the industry to think critically about conduct in the wholesale FX market, restore trust in an FX market marred by misconduct, and affirm practices “intended to promote a robust, fair, liquid, open, and appropriately transparent market.”3 I will also share some observations on how the challenge continues, which hopefully will set the stage for the panel discussion to follow.\n\nBefore continuing, however, I would like to note that the views expressed today are my own, and do not represent those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nDevelopment of the FX Global Code\n\nThe formal call to create the Code came from the central bank governors in May 2015, but the beginnings of the Code can be traced to best practices that have long existed in the wholesale FX space. Foreign exchange committees (FXCs) sponsored by central banks, such as the FXC sponsored by the New York Fed, have produced best practice recommendations for decades. Generally composed of private sector market participants, these committees advise central banks on developments in the FX markets and engage on matters regarding the effective functioning of the market. As is probably obvious to people here, central banks have a strong interest in the fair and effective functioning of the FX market. Collaboration among the FXCs from various regions has increased over the years, and that collaboration has resulted in global work product, such as the 2015 “Global Preamble.”4\n\nThe May 2015 call by central bank governors for a single, global set of best practices presented a new opportunity. Although no voluntary Code, and in fact not even law or regulation, can or will guarantee that a financial market as big and varied as FX will proceed without events that reflect poorly on market participants, the call to develop the Code was a chance to articulate principles that will hopefully make those events rarer.\n\nAs my colleague Simon Potter, the head of our Markets Group, has pointed out, best practices “can identify risks, solve ‘first-mover’ problems, challenge long-established practices, improve market function, and assist control functions.”5 They hold opportunity, in that they represent a mechanism for market participants to articulate and embrace better standards of behavior for themselves. But the realization of that opportunity depends upon the will of market participants to engage and implement changes that are appropriate for their businesses.\n\nAs a single, global code, the Code has been drafted to be applicable to market participants from across the wholesale FX market: the “buy side,” including corporates and asset managers; the “sell side”; and trading platforms, ECNs, and non-bank participants. A Code applicable to a broad array of market participants requires input from a broad array of market participants.\n\nThat imperative to seek broad input is both a challenge and an attribute of the Code. It has certainly been a logistical challenge, one that has involved staff from over a dozen central banks; the membership of various regional FXCs sponsored by central banks; a private sector Market Participants Group;6 contact with other central banks and official sector entities interested in good market conduct; and outreach to many industry groups and other stakeholders.\n\nBut, as I noted, it has been an attribute as well as a challenge. It has required market participants to think critically about their individual roles in the market and about what practices will support the Code’s goals. It has also encouraged them to debate issues and work to articulate principles in plain language that market participants can easily read and understand, and which affirm standards applicable across the many places and ways in which FX is transacted.\n\nThe collaborative process has resulted in 55 principles in the areas of ethics, governance, execution, information sharing, risk management and compliance, and confirmation and settlement. The first phase of the Code, released in May of last year, addressed principles on ethics, information sharing, confirmation and settlement, and certain execution topics. The second phase, being released today as part of the final Code, focuses on principles for governance, risk management and compliance, and further aspects of execution, including e-trading, trading on venues, and prime brokerage. Also, published alongside the full Code text is a set of illustrative examples, the aim of which is to provide additional color regarding certain of the principles.\n\nAs I mentioned, the Code is written as principles. The reasons for this are twofold. First, the Code is not regulation. The text is quite clear about the status of the Code as a set of good practice recommendations, a document that is not intended to supplant or modify applicable law or to act as a safe harbor for behavior that contravenes applicable law. In doing so, it recognizes the importance of compliance with the law and the role of authorities in enforcing the law.\n\nSecond, the focus on principles encourages each market participant to think about how concepts from the Code translate to its activities. In implementing the Code, it is incumbent upon wholesale market participants to think about whether their activities are consistent with the Code and how they can use the Code as a benchmark for their internal procedures and control functions.\n\nPerhaps no topic is more illustrative of the challenge of producing the Code than last look. Broadly speaking, last look is described by the Code as “a practice utilised in Electronic Trading Activities whereby a Market Participant receiving a trade request has a final opportunity to accept or reject the request against its quoted price.”7 It is a topic that generates debate, both with respect to whether last look is an appropriate practice at all and with respect to specific practices surrounding the use of last look. It is, thus, no surprise that the central banks and private sector participants involved in drafting and providing feedback on the Code engaged in considerable discussion regarding last look.\n\nThese discussions were useful to advancing the understanding of a relatively new form of execution. They helped identify issues that are central to the Code’s mission of fostering an FX market in which market participants are able to confidently and effectively transact at competitive prices that reflect available information and in a manner that conforms to acceptable standards of behavior.\n\nOne such issue was that of engaging in trading activity during the last look window that uses information from a client’s request to trade. The Code text provides that such trading activity is “likely inconsistent with good market practice because it may signal to other Market Participants the Client’s trading intent, skewing market prices against the Client . . . .” This text recognizes input that expressed concern that hedging activity during the last look window could be to a client’s detriment.\n\nLast look is obviously a topic of great interest, and it exists in the rapidly evolving electronic trading space. I will go into additional detail in a few moments on what will be done to maintain the Code as a relevant document, with respect to last look and the Code’s 54 other principles.\n\nAdherence\n\nBefore I get to the future of the Code text, however, I would like to address the second part of the challenge set by the central bank governors in May 2015: encouraging widespread adoption of a voluntary Code.\n\nAlongside the publication of the Code today, the central bank staffs involved in the Code process have also published a document outlining the approach to adherence.8 Broadly speaking, the work of the central bank staffs has focused on four core aspects to encouraging widespread adoption of what is, essentially, a voluntary code.\n\nFirst, the Code itself should be high quality. It should be clear and relevant and reflect good practice. In other words, market participants should want to use the Code as a benchmarking tool. While this might seem like an obvious point, it is a foundational one.\n\nSecond, market participants have a role to play in encouraging widespread use of the Code. Market participants must know about the Code. In that regard, both official sector and private sector stakeholders have contacted more than 120 industry associations and key market infrastructure providers globally. Market participants can also be public about their support for the Code if they so choose. An annex to the Code provides a model “Statement of Commitment”—a statement that market participants can use on a voluntary basis to express their commitment to conduct their wholesale FX activity in a manner consistent with the Code’s principles.\n\nThird, central banks have an interest in the Code and in fair and effective FX markets. Central banks act as market participants and the FX market plays an important role in the implementation of monetary policy in many countries.9 The central bank governors who challenged their staff and the industry to create the Code have affirmed through a statement, published today, that their institutions intend to adopt the Code when they act as market participants, except where doing so would inhibit the discharge of their legal duties or policy functions. Through the same statement, they have stated that they will expect their institutions’ regular FX trading counterparties to adhere to the Code, so that central banks can have confidence that their counterparties adhere to the high standards of ethics and behavior.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, certain central banks also sponsor FXCs. FXCs from important financial centers across the globe, through the GFXC, have expressed their support for the publication of the Code. In addition, certain central banks (such as the New York Fed with respect to the New York FXC), or the FXCs they sponsor, have determined to link membership on their committees with adherence to the Code.\n\nFinally, the official and private sector participants in the Code process, having addressed the initial challenges set by the central bank governors, must be prepared for the challenge ahead. They must maintain active engagement with the Code and have a means to keep it relevant.\n\nThe Code Going Forward\n\nAs I noted toward the beginning of my remarks, the Code has its roots in regular, but informal, contact between regional FXCs. Moving forward, the Code will be maintained by a more formal GFXC, the creation of which was announced earlier this morning.10 Through the GFXC, the Code will remain a single, global Code. The GFXC plans to assess periodically whether there are developments in the wholesale FX market that should be reflected in the Code. Less frequently, the GFXC plans to oversee a more comprehensive review of the Code through a process similar to the one developed during the drafting of the Code. In addition, the GFXC plans to monitor the success of the Code by looking at such indicators as awareness of the Code, commitments to adopt the Code, implementation, and views on the effect of the Code on market practices and transparency.\n\nThe GFXC has hit the ground running. Given the diversity of views on last look in the market, the GFXC today is requesting feedback, specifically on trading in the last look window in FX markets. That request is open to any interested members of the public, and can be accessed through the new globalfxc.org website.\n\nConclusion\n\nTwo years of collaborative effort have resulted in the publication of the Code, and in that sense the challenge set by the central bank governors in May 2015 has been met. However, the true challenge—the real-world success of the Code—lies ahead, and it lies in the behavior of market participants."

        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/hel170518",
        "content": "It is an honor to join you at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. Thank you for inviting me. As always, the views I will express are my own. They are not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.1 “Federal Reserve Bank of New York” is a lot to say. From now on, I’ll just call it the “New York Fed.”\n\nMy topic today is the role of lawyers in what is called “risk management.” I am not sure how familiar the term will be to you. We certainly did not cover it in law school—although, in retrospect, many of the principles I learned might be rephrased in the language of risk. Risk management is, however, a daily feature of my practice as a lawyer at the New York Fed.\n\n“Risk” is the possibility of injury or failure. It is a component of most decisions in life—big or small. Opportunities for growth or gain tend to entail some risk of failure.\n\n“Risk management,” therefore, does not always mean eliminating all risk. To do so would mean that one is also eliminating all opportunity. Instead, risk management is the art of distinguishing the risks you accept from the risks you deem unacceptable, and deciding how best to avoid, reduce, or eliminate those risks. Prudent risk management also includes plans for recovering from risks that materialize.\n\nYour characterization and assessment of risk—acceptable or unacceptable, large or small—and your strategy for dealing with risk will depend on your broader purpose and goals. This is what is called a “risk appetite.” How much risk is, for you, too much risk? Or, perhaps more important, what type of risks should you avoid?\n\nIn this talk, I will share my own experience in helping to manage risks at the New York Fed. I will also offer some thoughts on the role lawyers should play in any financial institution’s risk management. I will focus on lawyers for two reasons—it’s what I know, and it’s what many of you are studying at the University of International Business and Economics.\n\nFirst, though, a caveat: I understand that the issues surrounding risk management in the financial system are of great interest in China today as well as in the United States. But I am not an expert on Chinese law, culture, or history. My experiences may not fully resemble your own, and the lessons I share today may have only partial relevance to your lives and careers. At the very least, I hope there may be value in learning about someone else’s experience and perspective. And, at the end of these remarks, I hope you will share your perspectives with me. After all, the primary purpose of my visit to China is to listen.\n\nBackground on the Federal Reserve System\n\nSome of you may be familiar already with the Federal Reserve System and the New York Fed. For those of you who are not, I would like to provide some background.\n\nThe central bank of the United States is known as the Federal Reserve System. There is, however, no single entity that goes by that name. The central bank comprises, instead, three key components: the Board of Governors, which is an independent government agency; twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks, which operate under the supervision of the Board of Governors; and the Federal Open Market Committee. The United States Congress ultimately oversees the Federal Reserve System and its entities.\n\nYou may be familiar with the names Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke, and Alan Greenspan. Dr. Yellen is the chair of the Board of Governors and the Federal Open Market Committee. Her predecessors in those roles were Dr. Bernanke and Dr. Greenspan. You may also be familiar with the name Bill Dudley. He is the president and chief executive officer of the New York Fed—in other words, my boss. He visited China earlier this month.\n\nBroadly speaking, the responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System include setting and implementing monetary policy, regulating and supervising certain financial institutions, acting as fiscal agent for the United States Treasury, and helping to maintain financial stability. Not every responsibility is shared by each component of the Federal Reserve System. For example, the Board of Governors regulates financial institutions. The Federal Open Market Committee sets monetary policy. And the New York Fed serves as a fiscal agent for the United States Treasury. But, collectively, these are the functions of the central bank of the United States.\n\nThe New York Fed, where I serve as general counsel, is one of the twelve regional banks. Its district includes New York City—the financial center of the United States.\n\nThe New York Fed implements monetary policy pursuant to the directives of the Federal Open Market Committee. Monetary policy refers to the actions taken by the Federal Reserve to influence the availability and cost of money and credit to help promote economic goals. The New York Fed helps to accomplish these goals by, among other things, purchasing and selling securities. And, like other Federal Reserve Banks, we make loans to commercial banks and pay interest on deposits by commercial banks.\n\nIn addition, the New York Fed manages the operation of wholesale payment services—known as Fedwire® Services—on behalf of the other Federal Reserve Banks. The New York Fed also participates in the regional and international distribution of United States currency and coins.\n\nPursuant to authority delegated by the Board of Governors, the New York Fed plays a significant role in the supervision of some of the largest financial institutions in the United States and most of the foreign banks that do business in the United States. Supervision means the monitoring, inspecting, and examining of financial institutions to ensure that they comply with rules and regulations, and that they operate in a safe and sound manner. Supervision of financial institutions is tailored based on the size and complexity of the institution.\n\nThe New York Fed also participates in much of the Federal Reserve’s work in the international arena. We manage the foreign reserves of the Federal Reserve System and the United States Treasury. We offer deposit and custody accounts, and provide related services, to foreign official institutions, including other central banks. And we maintain a current understanding of foreign markets and laws. Our analysis helps us to carry out our responsibilities and to assess the risks posed by an increasingly interconnected global financial system.\n\nRisk in banking\n\nNow that you have some idea of what the New York Fed does, I will share some thoughts on the roles of risk in banking.\n\nFor starters, and to state the obvious, risk is inherent in banking. Economic growth requires taking chances. Taking risks is part of what banks do.\n\nWhen depositors leave their money in a bank, they are actually lending it to the bank. There is a risk the bank will fail and be unable to repay its debts to depositors. Similarly, when a bank lends money to buy a home or start a business, there is a risk that the borrower will default.\n\nIn the United States, these risks are mitigated through a combination of public laws and internal controls, including deposit insurance and lending guidelines that, since the financial crisis, have become more stringent.\n\nThose are simple examples of risks taken by banks, and there are relatively straightforward ways to mitigate those risks. But the more complex banking activity becomes, the more difficult it is to identify and manage risks. And the more connections exist in a global financial system, the more risk can be distributed or amplified, and the greater the opportunity for new systemic risks to emerge.2\n\nBanks can face risks from employees, some of whom are located in offices in financial centers around the world. Some risks are, again, inherent. We are all human, which means we sometimes make honest mistakes. There is also a risk from intentional employee misconduct. For example, a trader may seek personal gain by taking undue risks in investing someone else’s money. An analyst may disclose confidential information without permission. Or, more simply, in an institution that deals with money, some people may decide to take some for themselves.\n\nIn some of these cases, the bank may be the victim of the crime. In other cases, the laws in the United States will treat a bank as the perpetrator. That is because, as an employer, the bank may be legally responsible for the actions of its employees. So a bank could risk losing money in two ways: theft or fines. And, more important, a bank may risk losing its good name or reputation for trustworthiness. Now consider, hypothetically, a bank that employs 100,000 people. That bank may have a 99.9 percent record of good conduct—almost perfect. Even then, there will still be 100 employees whose misconduct could, under the right circumstances, damage the bank’s reputation or balance sheet or harm its customers.\n\nBanks face risks from third parties too. Vendors or other service providers may expose a bank to additional risk. For example, if a bank gives a software vendor access to its network, the bank may take on risks in the vendor’s cyber security. Cyber risk is not limited to software vendors. It actually could be any vendor. The vendor that opened the gate for a cyber attack on a chain of retail stores in the United States was an air conditioning contractor using an electronic vendor invoicing system.\n\nHere is another example of risk from third parties. A newer, faster means of executing or settling transactions may draw such a significant share of a market that it creates a concentration risk that previously did not exist. If that connection fails, an entire market could shut down.\n\nBanks can also face risks from their customers. I mentioned one example earlier. A borrower may not repay a loan. Prudent lending standards—like securing good collateral and identifying credit-worthy borrowers—can help mitigate that risk. Here is another example. A depositor may use a bank account to hold, transfer, or obscure the proceeds of a crime. This is more difficult to determine, especially when deposits are received from half way around the world.\n\nThird-party service providers and customers are examples of risks from outside the bank that are unavoidable in the ordinary course of business. These third-party risks are not purely hypothetical. They featured in recent cases of attacks on the global correspondent banking network. My colleague Richard Dzina runs Fedwire®, the payments system that I mentioned earlier. Here is how he described some of the risk that he faces:\n\nHistorically, and understandably, market infrastructures have operated on the presumption that endpoint security is principally the responsibility of the endpoint, and infrastructure security is principally the responsibility of the operator. Increasingly, reflecting the elevated cyber threat landscape, this distinction is not so clear, especially as endpoint security breaches can potentially have implications for public confidence in the network as a whole, even in circumstances when the operator’s infrastructure, applications, and security perimeter have not been compromised.3\n\nI also worry that some risk management practices can themselves create risk. Advances in technology have enabled more sophisticated economic modeling, on which many financial institutions rely to assess and manage their risk. This can, unfortunately, lead a bank to conclude that it has reduced one set of risks and can therefore afford to take on an additional set of risks. But what if the technology was imperfect, and the sophisticated models were flawed? Overconfidence in risk models can itself become a significant risk.\n\nRisk and responsibility\n\nThere is a popular phrase in the United States among risk management professionals who want to be clear about accountability for risk. We often say that a person, or division, or firm “owns the risk.”\n\nLet me explain what I think that phrase means, at least in some contexts. When a business line manager understands that she “owns the risk”—and not, say, the lawyers, compliance professionals, or anyone else—it means that she is accountable to a more senior manager and to the firm for the risk. Presumably, that means she will bring an appropriate focus and attention to issues of risk management. She will not assume that risk management is somebody else’s problem.\n\nSometimes I worry, however, that this phrase—“own the risk”—has become overused and can itself give rise to risk.\n\nTo be clear, clarity of roles and responsibilities with respect to risk management is critical. Business managers should not be able to outsource accountability for risk management to others. Still, I wonder if it is time to retire the phrase “own the risk” or at least be more thoughtful about its use.\n\nIf a business manager is told that she “owns the risk,” she may feel empowered to ignore or otherwise shut out other key stakeholders and control functions. After all, if she truly owns the risk, then why does she have to listen to anyone else? This is obviously wrong. Lawyers and compliance professionals, for example, should be part of an ongoing conversation about risk management. Or, conversely, if those lawyers and compliance professionals do not themselves share some stake in the risk, they may not feel that speaking up or challenging a position by the business line is worth it. After all, the business line “owns the risk” and they (the lawyers or compliance officers) do not.\n\nWhat’s more, certain types of risks, in certain types of contexts, do not fit neatly into the “own the risk” model. Reputational risk is an example. Firms often discover, to their dismay, that reputational risk cannot be neatly contained within one business line, or even within one organization. In a sense, it would be better to think of certain types of risks as shared, with shared accountability, rather than owned.\n\nIn short, it is important to remember that risk management is a means to an end. Who “owns the risk” is not as important as clearly understanding how that risk may inhibit an organization from fulfilling its purpose or achieving its goals, and clearly understanding how that risk is being managed. That does not mean that responsibility should be unattributed or entirely diffuse. Rather, responsibility for risk should not be parsed so finely that employees forget the purpose of managing risk in the first place.\n\nUnderstanding the client\n\nI promised at the outset that I would talk about the role of lawyers in risk management. First and foremost, lawyers must advise on the law. A colleague of mine likes to say that lawyers must always remember the reason why they are in the room—to advise on the law. To do so, of course, lawyers must know what the law says.\n\nBut that advice is most effective if it is formulated with an understanding of the client’s objectives and challenges, and in light of the broader business context or market in which the client operates.\n\nSo, when I speak with my colleagues about the New York Fed’s risk, I try to think first, but not only, about legal risk. The Federal Reserve System exists because the public trusts it to serve the national interest. So, I also consider how decisions will affect the public’s trust, and how the New York Fed can best demonstrate that it is worthy of that trust. Managing legal risk is one aspect of trustworthiness, and it is my specialty. But, as an officer of the New York Fed, I have a responsibility to think more broadly about its good name. I want to avoid the mistakes of lawyers for other organizations who “saw their role in very narrow terms, as an implementer, not a counselor.” 4\n\nI also take steps to improve my understanding of the New York Fed’s operations—even after nearly twenty years working there. In my current role, I try to maintain regular communication and strong relationships with the heads of other groups within the New York Fed. I don’t just talk to them about legal risk. I do an awful lot of listening too, with the hope of better understanding the work they are doing and the issues that concern them. And I think about ways that input from lawyers might help. In those unfortunate instances when legal disputes arise, I look for lessons that I might report back to those colleagues—insights relevant to their primary concerns. This type of information sharing is essential to an organization that seeks to maintain a high degree of public trust in an increasingly complex field of coexisting and interrelated risks.\n\nI also believe that lawyers need to reign in their tendency to want to reduce risk—especially legal risk—to zero at the expense of potentially more important goals. Lawyers are worriers. We tend to see what can go wrong. This is a product of training and disposition. And it is part of the value that we contribute to an organization. We must remember, though, that the point of reducing risk must be to aid some broader corporate purpose. And so, if the reduction of risk starts to impede a more fundamental reason for being, risk management has gone too far.\n\nLawyers have to point out legal risks and other risks to their clients. That is our job. But if all we ever tell our clients is “no,” they will at some point stop asking for our advice. So it is important that lawyers consider why a client is facing a decision, what they want to achieve in the near term and in the long term, and how their decision may affect others. Lawyers serve their clients well by pointing out assumptions, gaps in reasoning, and unforeseen, collateral consequences. We should help our clients see the range of issues confronting them and options available to them.\n\nMoreover, how a lawyer gives this advice is often as important as the content of that advice. A lawyer must not only be right, he must also be persuasive. My advice is worthless if no one listens to it. We are judged by our results not how hard we try. Let me share with you, as law students, some advice on how to be heard.\n\nAdvice to law students\n\nFirst, speak up! This is part of a lawyer’s training in the United States. We are called on in class to explain cases in front of our peers. We participate in appellate and trial advocacy competitions. And we are required to study not only the court opinions that decide a case, but the dissenting opinions that did not. We read and study and admire the great dissenters: John Marshall Harlan, Harry Blackmun, and Antonin Scalia, among others—even though we may not always agree with their views.\n\nThis training is important because speaking up is not always easy. Every lawyer will likely encounter a situation in which you simply need to be courageous in stating a divergent or unpopular viewpoint. In these circumstances, remember that you are part of a profession, not just part of a firm or a company. Professional courage is expected of you by your fellow lawyers, and you should count on their support. The New York City Bar has called professional courage “the indispensable element” of lawyering. “The essential need is for lawyers . . . not to waver when the advice is unwelcome, no matter how important the client or how powerful the officer or director resisting the advice.”5\n\nSecond, be on the lookout for what is not being considered. Ask yourself, “What are we missing?” This is a critical question in good risk management. In-house lawyers are often well-positioned to spot problems that others might miss. These issues become apparent only with a certain perspective—one that looks across an organization with both independent judgment and inside knowledge. Lawyers can offer both.\n\nThird and finally, try to promote diversity and inclusiveness in the organizations where you work. I have seen too many examples of supervised banks that managed their risks poorly because they approached decisions with limited experience, insight, and perspective.\n\nIn my few months so far as General Counsel at the New York Fed, I am increasingly mindful of the value of cognitive diversity and inclusiveness within the Bank’s Legal Group. Former prosecutors may view an enforcement matter differently than former defense lawyers. A regulatory lawyer who studied economics might not have the same insight as a lawyer whose background is in political science. A compliance officer may spot a problem in our policy that a regulatory lawyer would not have considered. Managers—myself included—whose tenure at the Bank spans decades, may not see shortcomings in communication or organization that are glaring to newer arrivals.\n\nWhen different views are brought to the table, risks are better understood and better decisions get made. As you progress in your careers, I encourage you to seek out other views. One way to do this is to expand your professional network to lawyers in other countries. We are likely to face similar problems and it can be enlightening, as my meetings this week in Beijing have been, to learn from each other about possible solutions.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe circumstances of modern corporate practice demand increased attention to risk and professionals mindful of managing risk with a view to promoting broader organizational and public purposes. Whether or not you practice law, the virtues of issue spotting, listening to your clients, and speaking up will serve you well in your professional careers. They are invaluable tools for the task of risk management—a shared task of corporate officers, and one that extends beyond professional bailiwicks. I wish you all the very best of luck as you embark on your careers.\n\nI would be happy to take a few questions."

For years I have had the privilege to be a part of the audience at these events, and it’s an honor to be asked to address the group.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s Monetary Policy Implementation Framework Is Working Well\n\nThe Federal Reserve has successfully raised the overnight federal funds rate three times since December 2015 in the gradual process of normalizing the stance of monetary policy. During this time, the effective federal funds rate has printed within the prevailing target range set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). These results have been achieved with an abundant supply of reserve balances created in the banking system by large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs) from 2008 through 2014 and amid significant changes in U.S. money markets.2\n\nA central bank’s operational framework for implementing monetary policy is designed to control policymakers’ selected target, typically a short-term interest rate. Since December 2015, the Federal Reserve has been using a floor-style framework that allows us to change short-term interest rates while maintaining an abundant supply of reserve balances that has fluctuated in a wide range, mostly above $2 trillion. We can illustrate this framework with a stylized graph showing the relationship between the interest rate and banks’ demand for reserves (Figure 1). When reserves are scarce, the curve slopes steeply downward, and small variations in the supply of reserve balances produce sharp moves in interest rates. But when reserves become plentiful enough, banks’ demand flattens out, and interest rates become effectively insensitive to shifts in reserve supply. The interest rate at which the curve levels out reflects the return that banks receive on reserves held at the central bank. Thus, in a floor system, undesired upward movements in rates are prevented by making the supply of reserves abundant enough to intersect the flat part of the demand curve, while undesired downward movements are prevented by establishing the rate of interest paid on reserves held at the central bank.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s implementation of a floor regime is unique in featuring two tools that help prevent the effective federal funds rate from falling appreciably below the FOMC’s target range. The primary tool—interest on reserves (IOR)—applies to the reserve balances held by banks in their accounts with the Federal Reserve.3 In principle, the federal funds rate should not fall below IOR, because depository institutions have no incentive to lend federal funds at interest rates below what they could earn simply by leaving the funds in their reserve accounts. However, a number of frictions have caused the effective federal funds rate to print moderately below IOR, leading the Federal Reserve to use a supplementary tool—a facility that offers overnight reverse repurchase agreements (ON RRPs) at a specified offering rate to a wide range of counterparties.4\n\nThe ON RRP facility helps to reinforce the floor under market interest rates by providing an outside investment option to a broad group of nonbank market participants that are not eligible to earn IOR.5 We’ve observed that a high volume of actual ON RRP usage has not been necessary to achieve interest rate control. In the first half of 2016, for example, average daily usage of the facility was $63 billion. In principle, even with zero usage, the ON RRP facility can support market rates by ensuring that counterparties demand rates on other investments at least as attractive as the rate offered on the Federal Reserve’s ON RRPs.\n\nThe ON RRP facility also serves as a flexible shock absorber that helps to maintain interest rate control when transitory shifts occur in the supply and demand for short-term market instruments. For example, around key month- and quarter-end reporting dates, some financial institutions shrink their balance sheets, a measure that reduces the availability of private money market investments, puts downward pressure on money market rates, and produces higher ON RRP take-up. Last fall, the ON RRP facility also helped to maintain rate control during the implementation of money market fund reform by temporarily absorbing heightened demand for safe, overnight investments by government money market funds.\n\nThus, with almost a year and a half of experience with a federal funds target above the zero lower bound, our current approach has so far proved to be both effective and resilient to structural changes in the market. The new framework is also quite simple and efficient from an operational perspective. To fully appreciate this, it’s useful to look back at the conduct of open market operations before the global financial crisis.\n\nOpen Market Operations in Money Markets Pre-Crisis\n\nPrior to the crisis, the Federal Reserve’s operational framework was similar to a corridor system based on reserve scarcity.6 At that time, the Federal Reserve did not pay interest on reserves. Banks’ demand for reserves balanced the costs of falling short of their reserve requirements against the opportunity cost of holding too many non-interest-bearing reserves or of borrowing reserves at a penalty rate. This trade-off created a steeply downward-sloping demand curve for reserves (Figure 2). Facing that demand curve, the Desk conducted daily open market operations to bring the system’s aggregate supply of reserves to a level where it would meet the estimated demand at or near the FOMC’s target federal funds rate.7 Active interbank trading distributed these reserves within the system, between banks with a surplus of reserves and those with a deficit.\n\nManaging the supply of reserves at levels that kept the federal funds rate from moving too high or too low was a technically challenging exercise that required both market knowledge and expert judgment.8 Reserve forecasters on the Desk and at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors projected various elements that could affect the supply of and demand for reserves over multiple days ahead. Anticipating changes in the supply of reserves required a detailed understanding of numerous factors, many of which were driven by forces outside the control of the Federal Reserve—so-called “autonomous factors,” such as balances held by the Treasury in its account at the Federal Reserve or physical U.S. currency held by the public. To determine the demand for reserves, staff gathered information to estimate banks’ reserve needs and plans for meeting them over each two-week reserve maintenance period.9 Using this information, staff planned open market operations—specifically, overnight and term repurchase agreements, and purchases of Treasury securities—to affect reserve conditions throughout each maintenance period. Uncertainty about various factors, such as swings in banks’ clearing needs, meant that fluctuations in banks’ demand for reserves could not be completely forecasted, especially on a daily basis, but even predictable variations resulted in the need for open market operations on most days.\n\nIn normal times, we were reliably proficient in hitting the FOMC’s target rate. However, interest rate control was more challenging at times when autonomous factors or the demand for reserves was harder to predict. These challenges were particularly acute during the early stages of the financial crisis, when large changes in reserve demand caused significant intraday swings in federal funds rates.10 A framework based on actively managing the supply of reserves was, from an operational perspective, also a discretionary and interventionist approach, albeit one that required only small adjustments on most days. Moreover, the pre-crisis framework created costly cash management regimes for banks, which had to meet reserve requirements and avoid overnight overdrafts in an environment with reserve scarcity and the high opportunity costs entailed by holding reserves.\n\nOpen Market Operations in Money Markets Today\nThe Desk’s role now is quite different. With reserve balances far in excess of banks’ reserve requirements, the Desk cannot meaningfully influence the federal funds rate by changing the supply of reserves, so the Federal Reserve achieves control over the federal funds rate by setting rates on various central bank liabilities.\n\nThe Desk’s operational charge for maintaining the federal funds rate in the FOMC’s target range is now centered on running the ON RRP facility. On a daily basis, the Desk auctions ON RRPs at an offering rate and aggregate offering limit set by the FOMC. The operation is based on price, not quantity, so there is nothing to forecast ahead of time.11 Market forces then keep the federal funds rate within the FOMC’s target range by pricing private trades against the alternative option of investing with the Federal Reserve, rather than by having interbank trading redistribute reserves throughout the system, as it did before the crisis. However, this approach relies on the Desk maintaining a larger and more heterogeneous set of counterparty relationships than before the crisis.\n\nWe support this framework with substantial market analysis, but the nature of the analysis has changed. The current framework does not require high-frequency forecasts of factors affecting the supply of and demand for reserves. Instead, we analyze trading dynamics and relationships among a broad set of market participants to build knowledge about how our tools affect private sector trading incentives and how market developments might affect policy implementation. This knowledge helps us to better understand the first steps in the transmission of the monetary policy stance, to assess the efficacy of policy implementation, and to provide advice on how the Federal Reserve could adjust the framework and tools if needed to ensure they remain effective.12\n\nWhat Could the Monetary Policy Implementation Framework Look Like in the Future?\n\nThe current framework was developed as a means for the Federal Reserve to normalize the stance of monetary policy after the extraordinary balance sheet expansion that was undertaken in the aftermath of the crisis, but policymakers have begun to consider what framework to use in the longer run.13 In a preliminary discussion about the long-run monetary policy implementation framework held in November 2016, FOMC participants commented on the advantages of an approach to policy implementation similar to the one currently in use, in which active management of the supply of reserves would not be required. They noted that such an approach could be compatible with a balance sheet that was much smaller than the current one, though likely at least somewhat larger than the pre-crisis balance sheet. Such an approach was seen as “likely to be relatively simple and efficient to administer, relatively straightforward to communicate, and effective in enabling interest rate control across a wide range of circumstances.”14 However, policymakers made no decisions on these issues and acknowledged that they expected to learn from additional experience before making such judgments.\n\nIn the meantime, I believe it is important that we continue to consider what a “new normal” might look like in order to ensure operational and analytical readiness—just as we spent several years preparing to raise the federal funds rate away from zero by expanding counterparties, developing and testing ON RRPs and various types of term reserve-draining operations, and enhancing our collection of data on money market activity.\n\nWhat Might the Balance Sheet and Open Market Operations Look Like in the Future?\n\nThe FOMC’s statement on Policy Normalization Principles and Plans notes that in the long-run, the FOMC intends to “hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.” It is challenging to determine far in advance what balance sheet size would accomplish this objective. However, it is probable that the normalized balance sheet will be considerably larger than its pre-crisis level, even before considering the volume of reserves that the FOMC would decide to supply. The reason is that recent growth trends in the Federal Reserve’s non-reserve liabilities will augment the necessary size of the normalized balance sheet independent of the operational framework adopted by the FOMC in the long run. To understand this point, it’s useful to consider the liability side of the Federal Reserve’s current balance sheet (Figure 3).\n\nFirst, currency in circulation—a central bank’s traditional liability—remains a large and growing balance sheet item. Federal Reserve notes outstanding have nearly doubled since the start of the crisis, with a current level of about $1.5 trillion, implying that currency demand alone requires a much larger balance sheet than before the crisis. A simple assumption is that U.S. currency in circulation will grow in line with nominal U.S. GDP growth. However, it is easy to imagine shocks that could materially affect currency growth, either positively or negatively. For example, with heavy usage of U.S. paper currency overseas, demand for dollars appears sensitive to changes in global growth and financial and geopolitical stability.15 In addition, it is hard to know what longer-term implications financial technology will have for currency demand.\n\nSecond, the U.S. Treasury holds cash balances at the Federal Reserve in the Treasury General Account (TGA), its primary “checking account.” Before the crisis, Treasury targeted a TGA balance of $5 billion on most days; those balances increased during the global financial crisis. In May 2015, the Treasury announced plans to hold a level of cash generally sufficient to cover one week of outflows to help protect against a potential interruption in market access.16 Since that cash management policy went into effect, TGA balances have averaged around $250 billion, reaching as high as $440 billion.\n\nThird, designated financial market utilities (DFMUs) can now establish and hold cash deposits in Reserve Bank accounts.17 The buildup of DFMU balances has prompted “other deposits” on the Federal Reserve's balance sheet to grow steadily over recent years to a current level of about $85 billion, compared to a pre-crisis average of less than $1 billion. The other deposits category also includes balances held by GSEs and international and multilateral organizations.18\n\nFourth, the Federal Reserve has long offered an overnight repurchase agreement investment to foreign official and international account holders—a service known as the foreign repo pool. The foreign repo pool has grown from an average level of around $30 billion before the crisis to an average of about $250 billion now. The rise reflects foreign central banks’ preferences to maintain robust dollar liquidity buffers, reduced availability of alternative low-risk investment options with private counterparties, and the New York Fed’s removal of constraints on account holders’ ability to vary the size of their investments.\n\nIn projecting the size of the normalized balance sheet, one can make assumptions about the long-run trends that will determine future levels for each of these non-reserve liabilities, subject to various kinds of uncertainty. Even taken at today’s levels, the TGA, other deposits, and the foreign repo pool alone account for about $600 billion of the Federal Reserve’s current balance sheet size. Adding on currency outstanding brings this set of non-reserve liabilities to $2.1 trillion today, and this set is likely to grow as the economy continues to expand. This sum does not yet consider reserves or ON RRPs.\n\nThe ON RRP facility, which has averaged around $165 billion this year, is another non-reserve liability that one might need to factor into balance sheet projections. The FOMC has said that it plans to phase out the ON RRP facility when it is no longer needed to help control the federal funds rate. However, as mentioned earlier, the facility has been a useful shock absorber amid structural changes in money markets, and it may be that some such facility would be helpful in maintaining effective interest rate control should the FOMC decide to remain in a floor system in the longer run. Of course, a decision to maintain an ON RRP facility would require longer-term choices about counterparty relationships and consideration of possible financial stability risks.19\n\nFinally, to complete projections for the normalized size of the balance sheet, we must consider reserve balances, currently the Federal Reserve’s largest liability. Two components will help shape the long-run level of reserve balances: banks’ demand for reserves and what, if any, additional supply of reserves might be deemed appropriate for the efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy.\n\nThe precise shape and position of banks’ demand curve is not currently known, but we generally understand the key forces that are likely to influence it. Changes in bank liquidity regulation and supervision since the crisis will be particularly important.20 In this new environment, we will need to consider the relative attractiveness of rates paid on reserves and close substitutes, such as Treasury securities, as well as banks’ propensity to substitute between these assets in meeting their liquidity requirements. Other characteristics of reserves may boost their inherent appeal—for example, intraday liquidity that supports clearing and settlement activities, or perceptions that holding reserves makes an institution safer. These factors are likely to contribute to higher and more variable demand for reserves than banks had before the crisis. If the demand curve for reserve balances has indeed shifted out, then a greater supply of reserves will be needed to attain a given interest rate target.\n\nMoreover, it is important to take into account how uncertainty and increased variability in the non-reserve liabilities I’ve discussed could warrant an additional supply of reserves (Figure 4). For example, TGA balances exhibit significant day-to-day variation stemming from the settlement of securities and the receipt of tax payments. All else equal, changes in non-reserve liabilities have the opposite effect on the supply of reserves. What these variations will mean for the amount of reserves the Federal Reserve decides to supply—and also for the size of the normalized balance sheet and the types of open market operations that will be employed—will depend heavily on the operational framework the FOMC chooses in the longer run.\n\nTo remain in a floor system, the Federal Reserve would need to supply enough reserves to satisfy bank demand along the flat portion of the reserves demand curve. It would also need to ensure that even amid shocks to non-reserve liabilities, the supply of reserves would stay on the flat part of the demand curve. There are essentially three ways to accomplish that objective. First, as in the past, the Federal Reserve could establish limits for the overall size of or daily variations in non-reserve account balances. Second, the Desk could carry out open market operations to offset fluctuations in reserve-absorbing factors, similar to what we did in our pre-crisis framework but at a lower frequency. Third, the balance sheet could include an additional buffer of excess reserves sufficient to ensure that most shocks would still leave us safely to the right of the steep part of the demand curve. Providing this additional buffer would require that the Federal Reserve retain a corresponding amount of assets.\n\nAn important trade-off in a floor system arises between the size of that additional buffer and the frequency and size of open market operations. In the current floor framework, the buffer is more than large enough to absorb shocks without the need to conduct offsetting open market operations. In fact, the level of reserve balances has fluctuated by as much as $700 billion since the start of 2016 with no material impact on federal funds market dynamics. To project the balance sheet’s long-run size, one could try to estimate the size of a conservative buffer by examining the distribution of changes in currency, the TGA, other deposits, and the foreign repo pool. Data since January 2016 suggest an additional buffer of reserves of about $145 billion would absorb 99 percent of changes in the daily average holdings of these liabilities from week to week (Figure 4). Accounting for variability in ON RRPs could add another $215 billion to the buffer.21\n\nIn a floor system with a buffer that would sufficiently accommodate swings in non-reserve liabilities, IOR would continue to be the primary tool to maintain interest rate control, perhaps supported by ON RRPs if needed. In addition, the Federal Reserve would still need to conduct some reserve-adding open market operations, but only periodically, to accommodate trend growth of balance sheet items like currency; otherwise, the quantity of reserves would eventually be smaller than that needed for efficient and effective policy implementation.\n\nHowever, if the FOMC wanted to maintain a somewhat smaller balance sheet, it might prefer to operate a floor system with a smaller buffer. In this case, the Desk would have to use regular reserve-adding open market operations to offset transitory shocks to reserve-absorbing factors in addition to secular trends. The smaller the buffer, the more the Desk’s operational schedule and supporting analysis would need to focus on short-run changes in demand for the Federal Reserve’s liabilities.\n\nReturning to a corridor system, in which we operate on the steep part of the demand curve, would mean an even smaller balance sheet. Daily forecasting and frequent open market operations would once again be required to manage the supply of reserves in the face of either reserve-adding or reserve-absorbing shocks in order to maintain interest rate control.\n\nOne could put together all of these elements—one’s projected levels for the range of non-reserve liabilities and assumptions about the supply of reserves—to arrive at some rough estimates of the range of balance sheet sizes that would be required under these different operational frameworks.22 However, the uncertainties surrounding these factors at this stage are very large. Furthermore, the variability of these factors over time suggests that the size of the balance sheet that best balances the trade-offs will evolve as the structure of money markets and other factors change. In practice, it will likely be necessary for the Federal Reserve to closely monitor the behavior of money markets as its balance sheet shrinks, and to use that information to enhance our understanding of the evolution of the demand for reserves and the other, non-reserve liabilities.\n\nHow Might We Know When We Are Getting Close to a Normalized Balance Sheet Size?\n\nThe FOMC is currently maintaining the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet by reinvesting payments of principal on its securities holdings and has said that it anticipates continuing to do so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well underway. When the FOMC reduces its securities holdings, the supply of reserves will also shrink. As that process occurs, understanding evolving money market dynamics and the structure of the reserves market will be a central component of the Desk’s analytical agenda—regardless of whether the FOMC decides to remain in a floor system or return to a corridor system. A key focus for interest rate control will be assessing the shape and position of the reserve demand curve and interpreting financial market conditions to gauge how far we are from the steep portion of it. Our thinking on this is still evolving, but let me offer a few thoughts.\n\nUpward pressure on overnight interest rates is the most direct indicator that reserves are becoming scarce. If the FOMC were to return to a corridor system, this would be the main indicator we would need. An increase in rates would likely suggest that reserve supply had moved onto the steep part of the demand curve, exhibiting the desired reserve scarcity that is associated with this type of operational framework. In assessing when to stop reducing the balance sheet to remain in a floor system, however, upward pressure on rates might not be as useful an indicator. Although brief increases in rates might not be materially adverse, a longer-lasting rise in rates would be a sign that reserves had already become scarcer than needed to maintain interest rate control. Thus, for a floor system, it will be important to develop and assess more forward-looking indicators to signal impending reserve scarcity.\n\nData from the Federal Reserve’s Report of Selected Money Market Rates (FR 2420) provide visibility into transactions in a range of unsecured funding markets and could be leveraged to develop some such indicators. Changes in the distribution of traded funding rates or in the nature of trading in the federal funds market might be signs that conditions in money markets were becoming more directly influenced by the amount of reserves. For example, most market activity today is characterized by banks borrowing from nonbanks to earn IOR. As reserves are reduced, a shift towards banks borrowing reserves to cover unexpected shortfalls could be a sign of mounting reserve scarcity. Banks needing to cover shortfalls might borrow from nonbanks at rates closer to IOR or from banks, likely at rates above IOR (since banks are unlikely to lend reserves at a rate below what they could earn if they left the funds in their reserve account).23\n\nMonitoring correlations between trade volumes and rates might also be informative. Higher volumes accompanied by lower rates—a negative correlation—could suggest an increase in arbitrage activity as banks try to earn the spread between market rates and IOR, while a positive correlation between volumes and rates could indicate that banks need to borrow reserves at relatively high rates at the end of the day to cover reserve shortfalls.24\n\nConclusion\n\nTo sum up: The Federal Reserve’s framework for implementing monetary policy has evolved quite substantially since the financial crisis. The unique floor system we’ve adopted to influence short-term interest rates, which uses interest on reserves and overnight reverse repos as support, has given the FOMC excellent control of the federal funds rate and supported efficient transmission to other money market rates.\n\nIn the longer run, the Federal Reserve could choose to retain the floor system to implement monetary policy or shift back to a corridor system. Under either operational framework, the balance sheet would decline significantly from its current size, but remain substantially larger than it was pre-crisis in order to accommodate its non-reserve liabilities and to supply an appropriate quantity of reserves. Moreover, the balance sheet’s size will change over time, driven by changes in longer-run demand for various Federal Reserve liabilities.\n\nIf the Committee remains in a floor system, the Federal Reserve will need to supply enough reserves to satisfy demand along the flat portion of the reserve demand curve plus, perhaps, an additional buffer to absorb variability in demand for non-reserve liabilities. These considerations would contribute to a larger balance sheet than in a corridor system. The size of the buffer would influence the need to conduct open market operations to offset temporary shocks, so policymakers would need to consider a trade-off between a larger balance sheet that accommodates this buffer and the complexity associated with more active forecasting and open market operations.\n\nOnce the Committee begins to reduce the balance sheet, we will track market dynamics to gauge the impact of declining reserve balances. Given the uniqueness of the current operational framework and the substantial ongoing changes in money markets, this task will present an interesting challenge for the staff, and one that we are preparing for as we carry out our operational and analytical responsibilities.\n\nThank you. I would be happy to answer any questions.\n\nFigures"

        "date": "May 11, 2017",
        "speaker": "William C. Dudley",
        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/dud170511",
        "content": "Thanks, Ashish, and thanks to the U.S.-India Business Council, the Confederation of Indian Industry, and the Bombay Stock Exchange for organizing this event.  As always, what I have to say reflects my views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nIt is a pleasure to have the opportunity today to talk about the issue of globalization.  Although the debate about the benefits and challenges of globalization is not new, it has recently come into sharper focus.  This debate is important to all of us, and I think it is particularly relevant to India given its growing role in the global economy. \n\nGlobalization means different things to different people.  In my remarks today, I will focus on the role of globalization as a force for international economic integration and economic development.  I will highlight three themes:\n\nFirst, the important role that trade plays in promoting higher standards of living globally. \n\nSecond, how changes in trade can create challenges for industries that become less competitive.  We have not adequately considered and remedied the very large costs this can impose on certain communities and households. \n\nThird, the answer to those challenges is not greater protectionism.  Instead, we need to provide greater support to displaced workers so they can obtain the skills needed to find new well-paying jobs.  We need to do better in preparing workers to deal with the challenges of globalization and technological change.  \n\nThese issues are important to me as a central banker, as they affect the long-term health and productivity of the economy, and the economic opportunities available to our people. \n\nThe debate around globalization, particularly in advanced economies, reflects a range of factors.  Undoubtedly, the global financial crisis and subsequent slow recovery have been significant.  But, just as important have been longer-term trends, such as growing income inequality, the loss of middle-income jobs, and the rise of large emerging market economies such as China and India. \n\nAlthough the debate about globalization is not new, I believe we are at a particularly important juncture.  If support for liberalized trade and an integrated global economy were to suffer a significant setback, the consequence could be slower economic growth and lower living standards around the world. \n\nWhile considerable effort has gone into liberalizing trade and developing the existing set of trade agreements, that does not mean they cannot be improved upon.  I have no doubt some trade agreements could be enhanced or updated.  Some may not adequately address recent changes in the global economy—such as the rise of digital trade—and may need to be refreshed.  And, important trade barriers still remain and should be addressed.  In particular, from a U.S. perspective, the access of U.S. firms to some foreign markets and the protection of intellectual property rights are issues that deserve close attention.  But, in addressing these issues, we should take care to preserve the vital benefits of trade to higher standards of living in both advanced and emerging market economies.  Our focus should be on further strengthening an open trade regime, and, as appropriate, amending and improving these agreements.\n\nThe Pace of Globalization\n\nTo begin, let me briefly describe the pace of globalization as a reminder of what is at stake.  Global economic integration has increased dramatically in recent decades.  Trade, for example, has grown from nearly 40 percent of global GDP in 1990 to 57 percent in 2015.  Over the same period, the stock of foreign direct investment has increased from roughly 10 percent of global GDP to 34 percent.  Ultimately, economies have become more integrated and interdependent.2\n\nThis rapid growth in trade reflects falling trade barriers, declining transport costs, and improved information and communication technology.  These trends have enabled the development of complex global supply chains that allow companies to manage their production more efficiently.\n\nEmerging market economies now make up a much larger share of global trade, the global economy and global growth.  As an illustration, emerging market economies have accounted for 70 percent of global output growth since the crisis—double their share from two decades ago.3   This growth has provided much-needed support to world economic activity, as advanced economies have recovered slowly from the crisis. \n\nRising economic integration is also very evident when we examine the trade relationship between India and the United States.  Bilateral trade flows have risen tenfold, from $11 billion in 1995 to almost $110 billion in 2015.  In particular, half of U.S. imports of computer services are now sourced from India.  In 2015, the stock of bilateral foreign direct investment in both countries was $37 billion, up from $4 billion in 2002.4 The potential for further increases has been reinforced by the liberalization measures India announced last year to encourage greater foreign direct investment. \n\nBenefits of Open Trade\n\nIncreased trade, through its longer-term impact on productivity, has been a key contributor to global growth and prosperity since the Second World War.  Openness to trade brings many benefits to the supply side of the economy.  These include:\n\nCollectively, these forces lead to a more efficient allocation of a country’s scarce resources—one that is more closely aligned to its international comparative advantage. \n\nAs a consequence, consumers can benefit from lower prices, higher real incomes, and greater variety and quality of goods and services.  Increased openness may also reduce wasteful rent-seeking behavior on the part of protected industries and the related costs of corruption.\n\nThese benefits from open trade are very evident in India.  Academic research has found substantial gains for India following its dramatic trade reforms in the 1990s, which benefited consumers via lower prices and firms via higher markups.  These higher profit margins spurred innovation and provided funds for the development of new products. Looking ahead, the upcoming implementation of the goods and services tax in India—which will create a common market internally—is expected to provide many of the same benefits as trade liberalization does internationally. \n\nOpenness to trade has certainly played a large role in the economic ascent of Asia.  Following the rise of Japan, Korea, Taiwan and others, fast growth in China and India has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of extreme poverty—an unprecedented feat in human history.  The benefits of economic integration and other reforms are exemplified in India’s higher growth rate since the introduction of market reforms in 1991.  Growth has averaged 6.5 percent annually in the post-reform period, compared to about 4 percent annually over the prior 40 years.  Indeed, India is the fastest-growing major economy in the world today.  Reflecting these gains, a number of emerging market countries have been strong supporters of open trade, a sign of how much the world has changed in recent years. \n\nA few examples can help to illustrate some of the benefits of globalization. India’s green revolution—which helped to greatly increase its agricultural productivity and food security—was facilitated by U.S. technology and scientists working with their Indian counterparts.  Similarly, as is well known, Indian engineers and entrepreneurs have played a key role in the technology sector’s tremendous achievements in recent decades and now lead some of America’s largest companies, including Google and Microsoft.  This success, in turn, has had important benefits for India as well, including increased foreign investment flows and employment opportunities that have helped develop a vibrant information technology ecosystem. \n\nBut, increased openness to trade is not a panacea in and of itself.  Actual benefits depend on a range of other critical factors, including macroeconomic policy, the business and regulatory environment, the legal regime, the quality of infrastructure, and the quality of public services, including education.  While the gains from a liberalized trade regime are not guaranteed, the alternative of trying to achieve a high standard of living by following a policy of economic isolationism will fail.  Trade has played a key role in nearly all of the high-growth success stories since the middle of the last century.\n\nChallenges of Open Trade\n\nIt is important to recognize that while trade and international integration tend to increase the overall economic pie, the distribution of the larger pie may be very uneven.  In fact, slices for individual groups may shrink.  Some workers—particularly those in industries that are less able to compete and whose skills have become less relevant—can be hurt and find it difficult to adjust.  This often requires individuals to change industries and to relocate to different regions.  So, while trade is almost always a win for a country’s economy, not everyone within that economy will be a winner.  This is especially the case where there are no policies to cushion the negative consequences of trade and to facilitate adjustment. \n\nEffects are also country- and industry-specific, and depend on initial endowments and conditions.  Low-income workers in emerging markets, for example, may find it more difficult to adapt given weaker safety nets and less financial resources available to deal with adverse economic shocks.  The bigger the adjustment process, the more the gains from trade will tend to be eroded. \n\nWhile the rise in the skill premium from trade liberalization has been well established for both developed and developing countries, determining the aggregate impact of trade on jobs has been more challenging.  To date, the evidence has been mixed.  We need further research in this area to determine with more confidence a reasonable range of estimates for these employment effects.  Although evidence on the extent to which jobs have been lost due to global trade is inconclusive, job losses that are attributed to trade tend to be viewed differently.  That is, they are seen as having been “lost to foreigners” and are often viewed as a consequence of the policy decision to liberalize trade in the first place.\n\nHaving said that, the challenge of adjusting to open trade is a serious issue that has not received the degree of attention it fully deserves.  This may partly reflect the fact that the burden has been borne unequally and spread out over a long time period.  It also may reflect the fact that the winners from trade have often tended to have a stronger voice than those who have been the losers. \n\nResearch has documented that the effects on individuals of job dislocation—including those resulting from trade—can be significant and long lasting.  Older workers tend to suffer larger earnings losses, and may face larger transition costs.  Displaced workers may not have the appropriate skills to find good jobs in other areas of the economy, including in growing export sectors.  When the affected industry represents a large share of the local economy, the damage is often magnified.  In this case, the burden is more widespread because wages across the community are likely to be hit as well.  And, this doesn’t begin to capture the full human toll—including the impact on workers who have lost confidence in the future and the poorer health outcomes that occur because of increased stress.  For too many individuals in the United States, for instance, the American dream has been put at risk, with parents increasingly pessimistic about whether their children will have the opportunity to do better than they did. \n\nWe should find better ways to help communities that are struggling because of the effects of free trade.  In the United States, we have historically experienced a high degree of geographic labor mobility—much higher than in other advanced economies.  The ability to move in search of better opportunities, when possible, has helped to mitigate some of the adverse effects of trade.  But, mobility has declined in the United States in recent years, implying that the adjustment costs to trade may have increased.\n\nProtectionism Is Not the Answer\n\nGiven these costs of global integration and more liberalized trade, what is the best path forward?  Protectionism can have a siren-like appeal.  Viewed narrowly, it may be potentially rewarding to particular segments of the economy in the short term.  Viewed more broadly, it would almost certainly be destructive to the economy overall in the long term. \n\nCountries need to compete better, not compete less.  Trade barriers are a very expensive way to preserve jobs in less competitive or declining industries.  They blunt opportunities in export industries and they reduce the affordability of goods and services to households.  Indeed, such measures often backfire, resulting in harm to workers and diminished growth. \n\nA better course is to learn from our experience.  From a U.S. standpoint, we should work to reduce remaining foreign trade restrictions that impair our ability to capitalize on our comparative advantages.  For example, market access restrictions can mean that certain U.S. industries cannot realize their full potential.  Similarly, weaknesses in the protection of intellectual property rights limit the ability of U.S. producers to realize the full returns from their investments.  This lowers profits and diminishes incentives to grow the business and employ more workers. \n\nIf we are going to enhance the benefits of free trade and better manage its costs, it is critical that we continue to strengthen the global rules-based system.  On the positive side, I would point to the WTO’s recent Trade Facilitation Agreement, which addresses customs procedures and could reduce global trade costs by almost 15 percent.  But, at a broader level, the momentum behind global trade reform has clearly waned in recent years.  This has occurred notwithstanding the fact that there are substantial areas in need of further reform, such as agriculture, services and non-tariff barriers.  That momentum needs to be rekindled and reaffirmed.  Although advanced economies historically have tended to lead the way, it is important that large emerging market countries now play a greater role.  This is appropriate given their growing prominence in the global economy. \n\nThere are many approaches to dealing with the costs of globalization, but protectionism is a dead end.  Trade restrictions address the symptoms and not the underlying problems, and they introduce other costs and distortions.  While such measures might generate temporary boosts to growth from greater domestic production and consumption, these would likely be offset by a range of other costs.  Over time, such measures would retard productivity growth and thereby shrink the economic pie.  As an illustration, import substitution models that were pursued by many emerging market economies following the Second World War eventually led to lower long-term growth outcomes.  This was the experience in India, which helped trigger the reforms of the early 1990s. \n\nIn assessing the benefits and costs of trade, it is important to understand that a nation’s trade balance reflects much more than its trade policy.  Just as important are the country’s saving and investment spending proclivities, which are affected by many factors, including tax and fiscal policies.  For example, in the United States, we have a chronic trade deficit because domestic investment spending exceeds our domestic saving.  Foreign capital inflows make up the gap.  In this process, the foreign exchange value of the dollar plays an important equilibrating mechanism.  If the domestic saving/investment imbalance is unchanged, then any reduction in the trade balance from higher trade barriers will be offset by lower exports.  The domestic currency will appreciate to cause the trade deficit to widen to accommodate the desired capital inflows.  Thus, trade restrictions affect the composition of trade but not the gap between exports and imports, which is determined by the difference between domestic savings and investment.  At the end of the day, the protectionist country would produce more goods in sectors protected by higher trade barriers but also fewer goods for export.\n\nThe expectation that higher trade barriers would save jobs ignores these critical second-round effects.  Moreover, the story may not end there.  What happens if another country that now faces higher trade barriers responds by raising its own barriers?  That would push production even further out of high-value-added exports that are now deterred by the higher foreign trade barriers and into those exports that face lower trade barriers, or into the goods protected by the higher domestic trade barriers.  Raising trade barriers would risk setting off a trade war, which could damage economic growth prospects around the world. \n\nMeasures that raise trade barriers typically would protect lower-wage, import-competing jobs, but would also weigh on the prospects for jobs in the more efficient export sector, which tend to be higher-paying.  The outcome would be countries producing more where they have a competitive disadvantage, and less where they have a competitive advantage—the exact opposite of what we should be aiming for.  For example, in the United States, one of our largest manufacturing exports is aerospace parts (which requires skilled labor) and one of our largest imports is apparel (which requires less skilled labor). \n\nThese second-round effects would also likely hurt productivity growth.  Scarce resources would be used less efficiently and trade protection would likely lessen the level of competitive pressure that helps drive innovation.  Moreover, lower productivity growth would likely lead to a slower improvement in a nation’s living standards over time. \n\nThis negative consequence of higher trade barriers can be illustrated most starkly by the estimates of the costs per job saved through protectionist measures.  Researchers that have studied this closely estimate that the costs per job saved from protectionist measures in the United States typically run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars per year.  To illustrate, consider the case of import restrictions on Chinese tires.  The cost of a job saved was estimated at $900,000 per year while the measures were in place, or more than 20 times the average worker’s compensation.5\n\nBetter Approaches to Deal With Globalization\n\nRather than protectionism, a better policy would be to help domestic workers and companies compete more effectively, rather than compete less.  We need additional mechanisms that allow us to more fully capture the benefits from liberalized trade and to more proactively mitigate its costs.  Ideally, policy should also better address job losses and income inequality from automation and other technological advances.\n\nHow we respond should depend on regional and industry circumstances.  These include the nature of trade impacts, the skill sets and location of the workers that have been affected, and the amount of resources that can be mobilized to facilitate adjustment. \n\nIncreasing specialization brings real economic benefits, but can also leave workers more exposed to shifts in demand for their services, potentially on short notice.  These issues are not going away, especially as emerging market economies take on a larger role in the global economy and automation continues apace.  If we are to maintain a more open trade regime, globalization must be socially and politically sustainable.  For that to be the case, we have to provide greater support to those who are hurt by trade. \n\nPolicies should include more assistance with job retraining, help with job search and mobility, and broader unemployment support.  We need to do more research into what measures have been effective in economies around the world, and we should encourage greater experimentation with new approaches.  Getting the balance right between providing assistance and making sure that individuals hurt by trade can get back on their feet and achieve their earning potential will be a challenge, and we need a better understanding of what actually works. \n\nMore generally, we need to do a better job positioning our workforce to cope with globalization and technological change.  This will involve improvements across a range of areas, including not only education and training, but also the business regulatory environment and infrastructure investment that could support greater worker mobility.  These measures would also promote higher productivity growth.  While the scope and scale of issues differ substantially by country, many of these policy areas may also be relevant in India. \n\nLastly, there are various measures available in current trade agreements, such as antidumping measures and countervailing duties for dealing with “unfair” trade, as well as escape clauses that provide safeguards for industries that face a sudden surge of imports.  Again, the challenge is to ensure that such measures are effective, that they help facilitate rather than retard adjustment, and that they are not abused so as to avoid foreign competition.  But, both sanctions and temporary relief have been provided for in global trade rules.  We should be willing to use them when their use would lead to more equitable outcomes and would help sustain political support for a more open trade regime. \n\nConclusion\n\nFree trade is a concept that remains compelling but periodically will be tested by economic change.  That is an inescapable fact of life and is a good thing because it requires the economics profession to articulate anew the value of a liberalized world trade regime.  While the value from trade is very high, the associated adjustment costs can be significant and will require greater attention if globalization is to work for all of us.\n\nThank you for your time. I would be happy to take some questions."

        "date": "May 9, 2017",
        "speaker": "Richard Dzina",
        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/dzi170509",
        "content": "Thank you and good morning. In leading the Federal Reserve’s wholesale services I am continually reminded that my stewardship responsibilities for this extraordinary business run in at least three directions. Organizationally, I am accountable to principals across the Federal Reserve System and to the Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Managerially, I am accountable to the men and women who make this business function, as capable and as dedicated a cadre of public servants as has served our nation anytime, anywhere. Operationally, and the sensation I feel most keenly standing before this audience of industry leaders, I am accountable to our depository institution customers, and their end users, which rely upon our services to send and receive time critical payments; to transfer, maintain, and provide safekeeping for Fedwire-eligible securities; and to settle positions derived from transactions in other markets. I’d like to thank SIFMA for the opportunity to participate in today’s program, and for the visceral reminder of accountability that comes with this invitation.\n\nI have long maintained that the Federal Reserve’s wholesale services represent the franchise when it comes to our nation’s financial market infrastructure. It is a bold assertion, but not necessarily an unreasonable one, reflecting the dollar value of transactions processed across the Fedwire Funds, Fedwire Securities, and National Settlement Services; the inter-connectedness and dependencies between these services and other systemically important infrastructures; our role as central securities depository and as fiscal agent for the issuance, maintenance, and redemption of all Fedwire-eligible securities; and as the platform across which the Federal Reserve ultimately settles its monetary policy operations. Any one of these elements would likely qualify the wholesale services as “systemic”; in the aggregate they represent a staggering portfolio on which the execution of both our nation’s fiscal and monetary policies ultimately depends.\n\nIn recognition that a wholesale service outage risks a significant shock to the United States, and in light of the escalating threat landscape in which collectively we operate, last year before this audience I shared a series of reflections endeavoring to advance a new paradigm for resiliency and security for financial market infrastructures. This year I’d like to provide an update on our progress on this front, and then to elaborate on the portfolio of wholesale service initiatives that we are endeavoring to advance to add value for customers and end users. As always, my remarks reflect my own views and do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe anchor premise of my remarks last year was an appeal for greater technological diversity in our third level resiliency and security schemes, representing an impregnable firebreak, and a platform for recovery, should the core of an infrastructure become corrupted. This work complements our traditional focus on geographic dispersion of infrastructure and human capital, but recognizes a fundamental distinction between cyber resiliency and traditional resiliency: what works for us in conventional resiliency scenarios, namely the automatic and instantaneous replication of data, works against us in cyber scenarios, reflecting risks that a pernicious malware, or a severe data corruption, or even an application failure propagates itself across primary, secondary, and tertiary operating sites, rendering a systemic infrastructure functionally inoperable.\n\nExamples of technological diversity may take many forms, from the application code to middleware components to the operating platform, and may canvass physical, distributed, hosted, or cloud-based solutions. Reflecting their unique circumstances and assessments of the threat, financial market infrastructures will likely respond differently to the present challenge. Without prescribing any particular solution, I will merely suggest that in the event of severe disruption efforts to enhance technological diversity represent an infrastructure’s best chance to achieve the two hour recovery objective promulgated by the Committee on Payment and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the Board of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).\n\nBeyond measures to enhance technological diversity in our core infrastructure, we continue to make meaningful progress developing manual contingency procedures in the event of a protracted wholesale service disruption from which we cannot recover on a same day basis, our best efforts to ensure resiliency notwithstanding. Recognizing the constraints on operating capacity in such a scenario, this work seeks to maintain critical functionality and to identify and support systemically important payments in our transaction flow to mitigate customer and market impacts.\n\nIncreasingly, this work extends beyond the Federal Reserve to include infrastructure peers and other systemically important market participants to test our protracted outage hypotheses and manual contingency procedures. It also complements a number of industry initiatives, including the work of the Payments Risk Committee and the newly established Financial Systemic Analysis and Resilience Center, to consider systemic risk mitigants in the event of a major outage of a large payments processing financial institution. Notwithstanding progress advancing these important initiatives, and in recognition of their enormous complexity, the message for policy makers, boards of directors, and senior management of systemically important institutions is to invest sufficiently in resiliency and security such that we never find ourselves reliant on manual contingency measures whose invocation is likely to produce profound, and unpredictable, consequences.\n\nOne sphere of resiliency that has grown in prominence for payment and market infrastructures over the past year has been the focus on endpoint security, a theme that has also captured the attention of global policy makers. Work in support of this collective interest proceeds across multiple fronts, including efforts to enhance end-to-end understanding of the links and relationships within a network; initiatives to enhance assurance that external endpoints are operating in adherence with an operator’s security requirements; and the development of centralized information services and application tools to enhance a participant’s management of fraud risk. Examples of these services and tools might include features that restrict transfers beyond a maximum dollar threshold, or to foreign beneficiaries, or outside of specified hours.\n\nHistorically, and understandably, market infrastructures have operated on the presumption that endpoint security is principally the responsibility of the endpoint, and infrastructure security is principally the responsibility of the operator. Increasingly, reflecting the elevated cyber threat landscape, this distinction is not so clear, especially as endpoint security breaches can potentially have implications for public confidence in the network as a whole, even in circumstances when the operator’s infrastructure, applications, and security perimeter have not been compromised.\n\nArguably, the collective industry focus on resiliency and security represents the challenge of our generation, with direct implications not merely for the functioning of financial markets but, even more fundamentally, for the commercial and economic activity they support. At the same time, and notwithstanding their consuming focus, security and resiliency do not represent ends, but means to an end. I’d therefore like to spend the balance of my valuable time with you reviewing a series of initiatives we are undertaking to enhance the value proposition of the Federal Reserve’s wholesale service suite.\n\nThe industry environment is complex far beyond the security and resiliency domain. Financial market infrastructures face an unprecedented volume of technological change, market developments, and regulatory scrutiny. For the Fedwire Funds Service, at least two market developments promise to have major strategic implications over a 3-5 year horizon: the advent of real time retail payments, which the Federal Reserve is actively promoting as a desired outcome in its Strategies for Improving the Payments System; and the trend toward global adoption of ISO 20022 payment message standards. For the Fedwire Securities Service, the successful modernization in November 2015 of the application suite and hardware platform supporting this critical business presents an historic opportunity to articulate a future vision that responds to customer and stakeholder needs. Straddling both domains, the emergence of new technologies such as distributed ledgers presents both challenge and opportunity.\n\nA key desired outcome identified in the Federal Reserve’s Strategies for Improving the Payment System (SIPS) is to increase the speed of retail payments. An unmistakable global trend toward real time retail payments has emerged reflecting the advent of new technologies, the rapid pace of private sector innovation, the proliferation of mobile payment devices, and the recognition that a world of 24x7 commerce requires a payment system that can keep pace. As this trend inevitably accelerates, the question of interbank settlement to address credit exposures that may accumulate outside of conventional banking hours must be addressed.\n\nReflecting the Federal Reserve’s historical interest in the mitigation of settlement risk, and in anticipation of the emergence of real time retail payments in the United States, we are currently exploring an expansion in operating hours of the National Settlement Service to support the final and irrevocable settlement of interbank positions in central bank money. We are pursuing this interest in three phases. In 2015, we expanded the NSS operating window modestly, opening an hour earlier at 7:30am and closing a half hour later at 5:30p.m. Subsequently, we announced our readiness to open NSS as early as 9:00 p.m. on the prior calendar date, consistent with the operating window of the Fedwire Funds Service, if requested. Finally, we are currently evaluating prospects for weekend settlement hours, perhaps encompassing a 24x7 operating window for NSS, for which we are validating demand prior to finalizing our direction. It is critical to consider these matters in advance of the advent of real time retail payments to anticipate the needs of customers and to respond to the interests of policy makers.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s Strategies for Improving the Payment System also aspire to achieve greater end-to-end efficiency in cross-border payments, an historical pain point for end users. In support of this interest, and following an exhaustive season of consultation with industry leaders, we are currently in the midst of a multi-year effort to adopt the ISO 20022 payment message formats for the Fedwire Funds Service. This body of work reflects the emergence of ISO 20022 as the global standard in payment systems, and seeks to achieve greater efficiency and interoperability in cross border payments for financial institutions and end users. Moreover, the structured and robust nature of the ISO 20022 message format provides an opportunity to enhance the information content carried in a payment message, including remittance information to support straight through processing of corporate payments, and to promote greater innovation across a common message suite. Finally, for both the long term competitiveness of our financial institutions and end users, and for the primacy of the dollar as a global settlement currency, it is imperative that the anchor element of our nation’s payment system remains well integrated in an increasingly global marketplace. With detailed planning well underway, by the end of 2017 we expect to announce ISO 20022 message format specifications and an implementation timeline.\n\nWhile I recognize that I am speaking principally to an audience of securities professionals, I appreciate your indulgence of these critically important and strategic payment themes, especially given the inter-connectedness and mutual dependencies that exist across payment, clearing, and settlement infrastructures.\n\nCloser to your world, and as previously mentioned, we migrated the Fedwire Securities Service in November 2015 to a new hardware and software platform. This undertaking was, by far, the largest element of the Fedwire Modernization Program and the most significant change to the Federal Reserve’s wholesale services in a generation. If you heard nothing of it, or have subsequently forgotten, that is the greatest affirmation of success. Notwithstanding the significance of this accomplishment, the conversion was “like for like”, meaning no new service enhancements for customers or in support of policy interests. In parallel to System-wide efforts to advance Strategies for Improving the Payments System, we have therefore embarked on a corresponding set of Strategies for Improving the Fedwire Securities Service (SIFSS).\n\nThe formation of these strategies actually commenced before the modernization even concluded in consultation with a range of stakeholders including securities issuers, depository institutions, financial market infrastructures, and policy makers. Prospective service enhancements were identified and assessed based upon their capacity to increase operational efficiency, mitigate risk, and reduce costs, among other factors, and were subsequently categorized in four main strategies:\n\nAs a final reflection, and to the surprise of no one in this room, we are experiencing an unprecedented period of innovation in financial services, with nascent technologies such as distributed ledger garnering substantial attention. These emerging technologies possess the potential to revolutionize financial services, making them faster, more efficient, and more secure. Notwithstanding this promise, challenges remain in their application to critical financial market infrastructures whose operational integrity represent a non-negotiable pre-requisite for our financial system. As we enhance existing services or develop new ones, our consideration of new technologies must strike an appropriate balance to ensure the risks are thoroughly understood before their transformative potential is realized.\n\nIn pursuing this suite of initiatives straddling the wholesale services, we seek to advance both the interests of customers and policy makers during this era of unprecedented challenge and change. Standing before you today convicts me that our success as stewards of this business depends absolutely upon our active engagement with the depository institutions and end users to which we are operationally accountable. Across this sphere and all others, either intentionally we are progressing or inevitably we are regressing; there is no idleness.\n\nThank you for your generous attention today. I’d be pleased to respond to a few questions."

        "speaker": "Unknown",
        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/hel170509",
        "content": "Thank you for your kind words. And thank you to SIFMA’s Compliance and Legal Society for inviting me. I’m grateful for the opportunity to speak with you. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nI have been a lawyer in the Legal Group at the New York Fed for almost twenty years. In my current role as General Counsel, I also oversee the Bank’s compliance function. Martin Grant, whom some of you may know, is our Chief Compliance Officer. Martin has been an advisor and role model for me throughout my tenure at the New York Fed. So much of what I have learned about compliance, I have learned from Martin. It’s not every day you get to thank a mentor publicly, so I don’t want to let this opportunity pass without saying thank you to Martin.\n\nI will offer some observations today as a fellow traveler in the legal and compliance fields. But I also hope to share some lessons learned from when our institutions may have been on opposite sides of the table. I do not aim to break any new ground today. This is, after all, a luncheon. I am worried about your digestion. Instead, I want to offer some high-level reflections. I will then share with you a few of the questions that are on my mind.\n\nLet’s begin with some high level observations about the state of play in compliance. The role of compliance within supervised financial institutions has grown dramatically—in size, scope, and relevance. It’s the relevance of compliance that stands out to me. In day-to-day interactions with supervised financial firms, I sense that risk and compliance functions have grown in respect and stature across the financial services industry. That’s a good thing.\n\nI am further encouraged by what may be on the horizon for compliance. In the same way that social psychology has altered the fields of economics and other social sciences, compliance is beginning to learn from academic research about human behavior.2 Again, this is a good thing. I am particularly fond of a description of one method, coined by Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler: the “nudge.” I believe compliance will, in the near future, supplement an existing framework that restricts poor choices with new ways to encourage good choices.\n\nHere is a classic example of the type of change I have in mind. When employers recommend that their employees “opt in” to retirement plans, they achieve a far lower rate of participation than when employees are automatically enrolled, but may “opt out.” What accounts for this? The economics of the plan work either way. And the incentives have not changed. Employees are not promised more money if they choose not to “opt out” than if they choose to “opt in.” But a better result is achieved by “nudging” employees simply by changing the starting point.3\n\nCompliance programs may be more likely to achieve their desired effects if they are based on studies of how people actually behave. Here are three ideas that would benefit from continued empirical study.\n\nFirst, can we increase participation in voluntary training and education programs by pre-populating enrollment? That is, can we rely on the same type of inertia that keeps employees from opting out of retirement savings programs? I’m speaking here of programs above and beyond the minimum training firms already require. These might explore in greater depth the ethical decisions that come up in corporate life—in particular, times when the corporation’s interest and a client’s interest appear to diverge.\n\nSecond, I am interested in the potential for certain employees to serve as carriers for social norms. Their identification is not always based on rank in a corporate hierarchy. Step one is to find out who these people are. We might, for example, attempt to map electronic communication within an organization. We might then ask how these can people become living, breathing “nudges” in favor of better behavior.\n\nThird, and more generally, I wonder whether our approach to compliance is, at times, too rules-based. This is a classic “rules versus standards” debate, that is familiar to many lawyers.4 A surfeit of rules may cause employees to believe that they are not trusted. This could create the misimpression that it is someone else’s job to consider long-term consequences or what is the right thing to do. Now, I am not suggesting that there should be a wholesale elimination of rules. But, in some areas, compliance programs may be more effective if some rules were redeployed as standards. That way, front line businesses would have to exercise good judgment in interpreting and applying those standards. Simply put, some empirical basis for evaluating the right balance of rules and standards would be helpful.\n\nSo, there is room for improvement and creative thinking in compliance—even in ways that challenge basic assumptions on how compliance should work. You are familiar, no doubt, with the phrase, “Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.” My first message to you is, “Don’t let the good be the enemy of the better.”\n\nCompliance and Influence\n\nProgress aside, I still see confusion about the basic roles and responsibilities of compliance functions within supervised financial institutions. Or, perhaps, there is a degree of entrenched resistance.\n\nBefore I tell you what I mean by that, here is what I don’t mean. I am not advocating for a vast expansion of the role of the compliance function. It is tempting to think that vesting compliance officers with greater and greater authority over business will lead to better outcomes—at least in terms of the safety and soundness of the financial institution. But, I am very sensitive to the risk that as compliance becomes more involved in business decisions, it loses its independence. That independence is critical to effective governance and, ultimately, to the safety and soundness of an institution. What’s more, there is some point at which compliance becomes an end in itself, detracting from broader corporate and social purposes. I will return to this thought later.\n\nHere is my point: Most if not all firms could use greater clarity about who is responsible for what within their organization. I offer this observation based, in part, on the compliance enhancements required in many Federal Reserve enforcement actions. Many compliance professionals have a very clear understanding of their own role—in terms of both duties and limitations—and strive to maintain their independence. I am less confident about the degree to which others in an institution are aware of what the role of compliance is, and what it is not. A shared understanding between business and compliance about this is critical. A misunderstanding of roles can lead to confusion of responsibility (or diffusion of responsibility), laying the groundwork for control failures.\n\nLet me explain how confusion about rules might play out. The more that the compliance function is perceived to be certifying or validating the business’s actions, the less the business sees itself as responsible for adhering to the firm’s policies, and even to the law. Because the compliance function often has the power to block business decisions, as a practical matter, it can also be viewed as giving its approval by not blocking decisions. That tacit approval can work like a license to take increased risks.\n\nWhen those increased risks become a control failure, government investigators start asking questions about what went wrong. Witnesses then start pointing fingers. Compliance is quick to say that the business owns the risk. Bankers say it is not their fault because compliance gave its blessing—often inferred from silence.\n\nNeither side has it quite right. For one thing, I do not buy the excuse “if it was really a problem our compliance people should have stopped us.” This kind of scapegoating can sacrifice credibility with a regulator. It can also damage the morale within the compliance group. On the other hand, I wonder why compliance personnel did not look for and identify a gap in understanding and escalate the issue. It is not enough for compliance to lob its advice over the wall and then move on. Compliance is not simply an advisory function. It bears a certain responsibility to safeguard the organization. When risks are not being addressed, senior management—or, if necessary, the board—must be alerted.\n\nThe role of the compliance officer is often divided into two categories—serving as a control function and serving as an advisor. In many respects, this framing works just fine. Compliance sometimes needs to control. And sometimes it needs to advise. Indeed, for in-house counsel, this dual-hatted approach is not unfamiliar. I have discussed in previous remarks the “partner-guardian” model espoused by the former general counsel of General Electric, Ben Heineman. He argues that a lawyer serves as both a partner to the business unit and a guardian of the organization.5 I am a big fan of this model and think it serves in-house lawyers well.\n\nBut, this binary approach—advisor versus controller—also misses something. I think we would be well served to keep in mind that the mark of a strong compliance function—at least, from my perspective—is that it is influential within the organization. Compliance functions, like in-house counsel, need to adeptly use all the tools in our respective toolkit to influence behavior within an institution. Some of these tools are more advisory; others, are more controlling.\n\nPolicies and procedures that reinforce clear roles for the first and second lines of defense, along with clearly defined escalation paths, can help compliance exert appropriate influence over business decisions. When a senior manager understands that she has responsibility for control failures that occur on her watch, and sees that her responsibility cannot be deflected or redistributed, then her view of the compliance function shifts. What was once something that was inhibiting her business line is now something that is helping her protect it. She may find that compliance as a constructive and independent partner can offer ways to avoid problems .\n\nGreater clarity about roles is a good starting point. Here are some additional ways in which compliance may strengthen its influence while preserving its independence.\n\nFirst, compliance should insist on getting involved earlier. Influence delayed is influence denied. If a firm is considering restructuring a unit or designing a new product, compliance should be at the drafting table with an opportunity to hear and to be heard. If a new trading strategy is to be implemented, compliance should review sooner than on the eve of execution. I understand that time is money, but investing time early in a compliance review may save years of investigation later.\n\nSecond, compliance should keep an eye out for larger, more systemic compliance risks and issues. As a centralized function, compliance is well-situated to connect the dots and identify broad issues that are not always visible to management. The compliance function typically serves the entire organization, and can use that enterprise-wide view to spot systemic problems.\n\nOne type of systemic compliance risk that I think about is what Gillian Tett of the Financial Times has called The Silo Effect. Silos can result from the specialization common in hierarchical organizations working in highly technical fields. Silos are at risk of breaking away from the main. They may develop aberrant norms that can undermine standard oversight and controls. Compliance can and should leverage its independence to spot silos—or any form of “groupthink”—before undue risks mature.\n\nThird, compliance can increase its influence through careful stewardship of its people. This means attracting and retaining talented compliance professionals, and, whenever possible, insisting on getting to know the business area. The role of a compliance officer should include building relationships and becoming a trusted resource. Such relationships can yield a deeper understanding of, among other things, the motivations and pressures that are affecting the business. These insights can inform and help improve policies, procedures, testing and monitoring. As I mentioned earlier, compliance can become more effective if it calibrates processes to actual circumstances and behaviors.\n\nFinding and retaining talented people for compliance roles is a major challenge facing firms across the industry right now. After all, compliance can be a nearly impossible job. And well-trained, experienced compliance personnel are scarce. Those are but two of the many challenges that compliance functions in financial institutions face. I certainly do not have solutions to every compliance challenge. But, having to manage the attraction, retention, and development of the New York Fed’s compliance staff, I am sympathetic.\n\nI am optimistic, too. As I mentioned earlier, I think the broad trends in compliance are heading in the right direction. Compliance functions are gaining influence. Greater clarity about roles can help. Compliance will always be a difficult job, but does not have to be a seemingly impossible one.\n\nAnother cause for optimism is the attention compliance now receives in law schools and other graduate programs. Two examples are NYU Law School’s Program on Corporate Compliance and Enforcement, and Fordham Law School’s LLM program in Corporate Compliance. These programs engage key leaders in the field in important public discussions, and train students who, in terms of their understanding of corporate governance, are well ahead of where many of us were when we began our careers. These programs will contribute to a bright future for the compliance profession.\n\nCompliance, Enforcement, and Accountability\n\nI also want to say a few words about enforcement and accountability. I believe, of course, that past misconduct should be punished. I also believe that we who play a role in bringing wrongdoers to account should also require forward-looking reforms under the mantra of “Never again.” For those forward-looking reforms to be successful, firms and enforcement attorneys need to pay attention to root causes of misconduct.\n\nThere is a vigorous and important debate in academic and regulatory circles about the prosecution of individuals in cases of corporate misconduct. Virtually everyone agrees that individual prosecutions can have deterrent effect on future misconduct if people believe they will get caught. I follow the debate with great interest. Suffice it to say, I agree that individuals must be held accountable for misconduct. If the misconduct is criminal, criminal prosecution is warranted.\n\nI also believe what science teaches about behavior: Our actions are a product of both individual disposition or volition and the situation in which we function. And, the situation might be more potent than we might think.6 So, I wonder, for example, whether the thought of “getting caught” even crosses someone’s mind if a prohibition is so routinely disregarded that violating that rule is normal. In the LIBOR and FX cases, for example, traders discussed openly their manipulation of reference rates in electronic chat rooms that they knew were recorded and monitored. The fact that those traders used a back channel to communicate evidences an awareness of wrongdoing—not to mention the brazen content of their communication. I have to conclude that the risk of getting caught either never crossed their minds or was massively discounted.\n\nOn behalf of their firms, compliance personnel can help identify the root causes—especially the situational factors—that contribute to control failures. A thorough and honest exploration of those factors can help inform structural and governance changes mandated in enforcement actions. It is in everyone’s interest for those reforms to succeed, to fulfill the mantra of “Never again.”\n\nI do not think this type of inquiry is easy—not because the root causes are unknowable. Rather, it may be uncomfortable to ask the right questions. Here are some examples. There are sure to be others.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\n\nI want to raise one final topic with you today, which, to my mind, is related to the question of accountability. It is the risk that control groups in large institutions can evolve to a place where they are driven by their own self-preservation or immediate concerns.\n\nIf the compliance regime—inclusive of policies, procedures, testing, monitoring, etc.—is geared toward shielding the compliance function itself from blame or responsibility, then it has failed to serve the institution. It also risks becoming irrelevant. Compliance has to resist adopting a “check the box” mentality—slavishly adhering to formal rules while ignoring standards of suitability, integrity, and fairness. Compliance personnel are professionals. As such, they are entrusted to exercise judgment. They are expected to make conscious choices, not merely to rely on the outcome of a particular process.7\n\nLawyers are not immune from a similar criticism: permitting the avoidance of legal risk to become a goal in itself, rather than a tool for advancing the purposes of the organization. When an acutely litigious mindset prevents a company from launching a cross-organizational review, or writing a self-critical report, the near-term goal of managing discovery has overrun the broader interests of the company in honest self-assessment and improvement.\n\nA legal group should not automatically veer toward shutting down self-reflection for the sake of being able to rest easy about litigation. Similarly, compliance cannot rest easy when its processes succeed in building a paper trail, but do little to uncover and resolve problematic behavior. In short, some risks are worth taking.\n\nThank you for listening to my remarks today. I am happy to take any questions."

        "title": "The Future of Supervision: Lessons from Tocqueville",
        "date": "Apr 7, 2017",
        "speaker": "F. Christopher Calabia",
        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/cal170407",
        "content": "At the Federal Reserve, we believe strongly in the future of community banking.  We understand that, when you lend to individuals or small businesses, you aren’t simply extending credit: you are building the future.  You are creating homes for families.  You are investing in budding businesses.  Your credit decisions may influence the shape of the local economy, from where people live to the kinds of businesses and even jobs that exist.  When you do your jobs well, your communities flourish.1\n\nIn that regard, we know that our supervision influences your actions.  Certainly our regulations must ensure that individual firms are managed prudently so that, collectively, the banking system serves as a source of credit to all sectors of the economy.  But when rules are excessive—or when they no longer serve the purpose we intend—we must revisit them. \n\nAs Kevin Stiroh explained earlier, the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 (EGRPRA) requires us to identify rules that are outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome.  The report2 released by the agencies last month outlined a number of changes that we have already made. Many of those changes are meant to tailor our regulations more appropriately to the risk profiles that community banks present.\n\nYet burdens can stem not just from statutes or regulations, but also from the way we conduct our work.  We need to look carefully at how we plan and conduct our examinations; how we communicate our findings; and how we monitor your responses.  Where our processes and approaches are inefficient, ineffective, or unnecessarily burdensome for you, we need to make changes so that we, too, remain relevant in the future. \n\nAnd while it is difficult to predict the future, I’m reminded of one man who believed that he saw the future—and traveled there to experience it. \n\nAlexis de Tocqueville was a twenty-five-year-old Frenchman when he came to the United States in 1831.  He believed that the old political and social order rooted in aristocracy was giving way to a more egalitarian order—and he felt that this potential future was nowhere else more evident than in the then 50-year-old United States of America.\n\nTocqueville wanted to experience America so that he could advise his own country on its journey toward democracy.  He attended a Fourth of July celebration in Albany. He visited prisons and churches. For nine months, he spoke with countless Americans, from President Andrew Jackson to ordinary citizens in communities and along the roads and rivers across the country. From these personal experiences, Tocqueville drafted Democracy in America—one of the greatest books on our country and on democracy, with insights that remain valid to this day.\n\nOne characteristic that Tocqueville found fascinating about Americans is our ability to adapt our work to meet the changing demands of the time.  He described meeting individuals “who have successively been barristers, farmers, merchants, ministers of the gospel, and physicians.” Tocqueville said that our ability to “job hop,” as we might say today, helped make America “a land of wonders, in which everything is in constant motion, and every movement seems an improvement.”3\n\nWe supervisors must likewise keep up with the constant motion of our economy and make continuous improvements to our work.  I want to take just a few of the remaining minutes this afternoon to share how we’re changing our approach to onsite supervision so that we are efficient and effective—and so that we minimize burden.  These thoughts represent my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nTwo years ago at this conference, I shared with you some of the practical things we were adopting at the New York Fed to keep our supervision up to date, to tailor our approach to supervision to fit the risk profiles of community banks more closely, and to reduce the time we spend onsite at your firms so that we minimize disruptions to your business.4 \n\nAs I noted then, taken together we were able to reduce time spent onsite by up to almost 50 percent at some firms that did not have serious supervisory issues.  We’re continuing to enhance these practices.\n\nOne experiment that the Federal Reserve proposed in 2015 was to make greater use of electronic loan files so that our examiners could review the files offsite.  When I discussed this idea at our community bankers’ conference in 2015, we did not have any community banks in our District that had scanned enough loan files for us to try this approach.  However, I’m pleased to note that, last year, one firm did propose that we conduct our loan review offsite.  I won’t mention the name of the firm, but I do want to share with you our experience, because it was quite promising. \n\nHow does an offsite loan review work?\n\nThe bank had already imaged for its own use a sufficient volume of loan files such that we could conduct an offsite review.  First, the bank sent electronic images of loan files to us online via a secure portal; however, banks can propose other means to deliver loan files to us in a secure manner.  In this case, the online portal automatically transferred the loan file images to the internal repository that our examiners use when conducting examinations. \n\nSecond, our examiners reviewed the files at our office here in downtown Manhattan. They remained in touch with bank management and loan officers via telephone calls and conference calls to discuss the performance of certain credits and any issues arising from our review. \n\nFinally, after completing the review of loans and all discussions with management offsite, we communicated our findings to the management team.\n\nFrom our observations and discussions with the bank, we believe that the bank experienced three sets of benefits.\n\nFrom our perspective, we experienced three sets of benefits as well.\n\nOverall, we felt that this pilot of offsite loan review in our District was effective and a success.  In this particular case, it did save some time. But the main goal of offsite loan review is to minimize disruptions to your business by having a smaller footprint at your offices during annual examinations.\n\nI should acknowledge that the bank’s management and staff helped to make this a success through their willingness to respond to questions and requests for additional information by telephone, from the bank president to the lending officers. \n\nCommunity banks are not required to scan loan files, and so conducting an offsite loan review requires your consent, cooperation, and coordination.  If you do begin using electronic loan files, we are happy to consult with you on whether we can conduct offsite loan reviews. You can read more about this process and how to make a request along these lines in our Supervision and Regulation Letter 16-8, “Offsite Review of Loans.”5\n\nI would note as well that while we would like to move toward doing more aspects of examinations offsite, we do continue to see value in conducting some work onsite.  Onsite visits are likely to remain an important part of our supervisory approach in the future, if perhaps for shorter periods of time. \n\nMoreover, some of you have told us that you prefer to have us visit in person—and some of you sounded sincere!  It’s often been said that the strength of the community banking model lies in the energy and time you spend getting to know your customers and building close working relationships with them.  The same should be true for those who supervise smaller firms.\n\nIn certain instances it may be necessary for us to be onsite to evaluate the quality of processes and to get better insight into the staff, the management, and the communities that you serve.  That kind of understanding is difficult to develop without being there ourselves.  Tocqueville, for example, could have conducted “offsite research” for Democracy in America—but I would bet his writing would have lacked the sense of wonder he found in his travels. \n\nIn that regard, more than most other staff at the New York Fed, the Regional, Community, Foreign Institution Supervision and Consumer Compliance function has a unique connection to the rest of the District given the amount of time that our staff spend traveling and working in communities across New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Puerto Rico.  We’ve celebrated that connection this year through our second “Postcards from the District” staff photography contest that you saw projected earlier on screens.\n\nSo let me close by thanking you for traveling to our office to engage us in dialogue today and throughout the year.  We need to hear your views on business conditions, on your performance, and on our work and our approach to supervision.  Like the Americans that Tocqueville encountered, we’re constantly looking for ways to improve.  We welcome your ideas and suggestions.  Through this dialogue, we can work together to ensure that the future remains bright for community banking in America."

        "title": "Principles for Financial Regulatory Reform",
        "date": "Apr 7, 2017",
        "speaker": "William C. Dudley",
        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/dud170407",
        "content": "It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak here today on the important topic of financial regulatory reform.  As always, what I have to say reflects my views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nA robust financial system is central to our economic well-being.  The financial crisis and the Great Recession wreaked havoc on millions of American households and businesses, and much of this damage was due to a flawed regulatory framework.  In particular, many large banks and securities firms had inadequate capital and liquidity buffers, and the financial system had a number of important structural weaknesses that made it vulnerable to stress.  In response, legislators and regulators made significant changes to strengthen our regulatory framework.  Importantly, as we consider further changes, we must avoid throwing the baby out with the bathwater. \n\nAs I see it, an effective regulatory regime for the financial system must do three things: \n\nIn contemplating changes to the regulatory regime, the good news is that the U.S. financial system is much sounder today than it was on the eve of the financial crisis.  The quantity and quality of capital and liquidity for U.S. banks have markedly improved, meaning that the banking industry can support the economy even under considerably more adverse economic conditions.  And, although returns on equity have dropped as balance sheet leverage has declined, banks remain profitable enough to cover their cost of capital and continue to serve their household and business customers.\n\nMuch of this progress is due to regulatory changes enacted since the crisis.  In addition to buttressing the capital and liquidity standards for major banks, the regulatory community has made significant strides in many other areas.  We developed a resolution framework for systemically important banks that better enables a failing bank to recapitalize with less risk to the rest of the financial system, and in a way that should not require taxpayer assistance.  We reformed key segments of the financial system such as the money market mutual fund industry.  We reduced the aggregate risk in the system by mandating the centralized clearing of OTC derivatives.  And, we strengthened the prudential oversight of those systemically important financial market utilities (FMUs) that clear such activity.  Collectively, these reforms make the system more robust and resilient to the failure of a large, systemically important institution.  Thus, we have made considerable progress toward ending a regime in which some financial firms were “too big to fail.”  We want to avoid the unfortunate situation where authorities are faced with a Hobson’s choice: save a failing firm to prevent it from taking down the entire financial system, or allow the firm to fail but risk the collapse of the financial system.\n\nNearly a decade ago, we suffered the worst financial and economic crisis since the Great Depression.  In fact, we were perilously close to experiencing another depression.  The harm the crisis caused Americans can only be described as catastrophic.  From November 2008 to April 2009, the economy lost an average of 700,000 jobs per month.  Total employment in the United States fell by nine million jobs, and the unemployment rate rose to more than 10 percent.  There was also a broad-based decline in home prices—about 30 percent on average, nationally.  As a result, nearly 8 million foreclosures occurred, and the homeownership rate declined to levels not seen since the late 1980s. \n\nThe crisis exposed many significant structural weaknesses in the U.S. and global financial systems.  Among them:\n\nWe should never forget how close we came to a full-blown depression, and we must resolve to never allow a return to conditions like those that existed prior to the financial crisis.\n\nThat said, it is entirely appropriate to take a critical look at the changes that were made to the regulatory regime.  While we do not yet have evidence of how these reforms will hold up during the next economic downturn, many have been in place long enough that we can begin to evaluate their efficacy.\n\nIn such an evaluation, we should keep in mind the three goals I mentioned in my introduction.  First, we must ensure that the probability of failure for a systemically important firm is exceedingly low.  Such a failure can lead to contagion that can damage a broad set of financial market participants, and impede the ability of the financial system to support the economy.  The failure of a single systemically important firm—because of its size and interconnectedness—can significantly weaken the entire financial system.  We saw this firsthand following the failure of Lehman Brothers.\n\nSecond, if a systemically important firm does fail, we must have mechanisms in place to minimize the damage to the rest of the financial system.  While we can make individual firms stronger, more robust and less prone to failure, I expect that there will still inevitably be failures in the future.  In principle, we could make individual institutions completely bulletproof in all possible environments. However, this would require such high levels of capital and liquidity that it would likely make them uncompetitive in their ability to provide financial services to their customers.\n\nThird, we must keep in place the structural changes that have made the global financial system less vulnerable to adverse shocks.\n\nSo, what does this imply when we consider revisions to the Dodd-Frank Act and other aspects of reform? \n\nCapital and Liquidity Standards\n\nIt is important to maintain appropriate capital and liquidity standards for large, complex firms to mitigate external shocks and the risks they pose to the economy.  In particular, we need to maintain our focus on firms whose impairment would have significant negative consequences for the rest of the financial system.  Effective capital and liquidity standards help to limit these adverse consequences.  At the same time, they work against conferring a competitive advantage to large banks from a perception that they may be too big to fail.  Accordingly, large financial firms have had to more than double their stock of high-quality capital since the crisis. \n\nPrior to the financial crisis, large financial firms were not required to hold sufficient high-quality liquid assets to protect against runs, and, as a result, several would have failed if not for extraordinary government intervention.  Today, the liquidity buffers for large financial firms have dramatically improved in terms of both their size and quality.  This is due in part to investors’ demands, but also to the efforts by regulators and supervisors in the United States and abroad to develop appropriate liquidity standards for large banking institutions. \n\nSome have argued that capital standards alone would be sufficient to mitigate the risks of failure.  I am not convinced.  As I just noted, the crisis clearly demonstrated the added importance of liquidity, as the firms that failed appeared to have been appropriately capitalized based on traditional regulatory metrics at the time.\n\nMoreover, I strongly favor a system of capital and liquidity requirements that is harmonized on a global basis.  Some believe that the United States should no longer participate in international forums—such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision—that discuss and recommend minimum capital and liquidity standards for global banking institutions.  The argument is made that these international bodies are dictating to and constraining the choices of the United States.  That is simply not the case.  The Basel standards and other international efforts actually benefit the United States and its banks.  In the preponderance of cases, agreements struck in these forums raise international standards closer to existing U.S. standards.  Establishing a more level playing field enhances the competitiveness of internationally active U.S. firms.  It also makes the global financial system safer by ensuring that foreign banks are subject to appropriate standards that cover their global operations.  This protects the U.S. households and businesses that transact with these banks in the United States and abroad.2 \n\nAlso, it is important to note that the recommendations of these international standard-setters are not automatically legally binding in the United States.  They do not go into effect unless they are adopted by a U.S. authority acting under U.S. laws following an administrative process. They are also subject to a period of public notice and comment.  When appropriate, U.S. authorities have adopted different standards than those proposed in international forums. \n\nFinally, following the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve developed a capital stress testing supervisory program—known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR).  CCAR has become an integral part of ensuring appropriate capital levels.  By imposing a discipline of forward-looking capital assessment on our largest firms, CCAR helps protect the safety and soundness of the largest financial institutions—and therefore the stability of the entire financial system.\n\nThe CCAR process consists of two parts.  First, the quantitative assessment evaluates whether a firm holds a sufficiently large capital buffer so that it can continue to be a viable financial intermediary even in a stressed market and macroeconomic environment.  Second, the qualitative assessment evaluates whether the firm’s risk management and capital planning processes are well-developed and well-governed.  CCAR has helped to strengthen the capital levels of the largest financial institutions, and has pushed these firms to steadily improve their risk management and capital planning processes.\n\nResolution\n\nWe also must have an effective resolution mechanism that allows a firm to fail without threatening to bring down the entire financial system.  We are not quite there yet—given some of the challenges in executing resolution on a cross-border basis—but we have made significant progress.  In particular, I would point to two developments that are especially important.\n\nThe FDIC and the Federal Reserve have used the authority provided by Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act to oversee the so-called “living will” process—the resolution planning that large financial firms must do as a contingency for their potential failure.  Developing living wills necessitates that firms and regulators consider, in advance, how bankruptcy can serve as the basis for resolution, and take actions to address any obstacles to an orderly resolution under the bankruptcy code.  This effort has helped to reduce the complexity of large financial firms and has made them better positioned to enter bankruptcy without imposing large costs on society.\n\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve recently finalized a rule that requires systemically important bank holding companies to have minimum levels of total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC). Firms are expected to meet this requirement mainly via the issuance of long-term debt by the holding company parent. In bankruptcy, this debt could be used to recapitalize these firms and would be available to absorb any additional losses. \n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also created a “last resort” option for the resolution of a large financial firm—Title II Orderly Liquidation Authority.  This authority can be triggered only in special circumstances, and requires the action of a number of regulatory and fiscal authorities. \n\nThere is an understandable reluctance for the government to be directly involved in resolving a large firm.  It creates the perception that the largest firms get special advantages.  This is why many would prefer to eliminate Title II and rely exclusively on a bankruptcy process.3\n\nBut, if we were to rely on ordinary bankruptcy rather than Title II for the resolution of a systemically important financial firm, we would need to ensure that the bankruptcy regime would work in a way that does not destabilize the financial system.  First, such a regime would need to enable a systemically important firm to initiate a resolution strategy over a weekend while markets are closed so that the firm’s subsidiaries could continue to operate.  Otherwise, the remaining franchise value of the troubled firm would quickly evaporate and we would experience significant contagion across the financial system.  Second, there would need to be a credible liquidity backstop for the restructured firm in place by Sunday evening when Asian markets open.  Many of the troubled firm’s counterparties would undoubtedly initially run because the cost of doing so would be very small.  They would be especially likely to do so if there were no credible liquidity backstop.  Debtor-in-possession financing would not be not a viable option because it simply would not likely be available in a timely manner and on the scale—potentially hundreds of billions of dollars—needed to fill the hole created when counterparties run away from a systemically important financial institution. \n\nThere is also another difficulty.  In the event of a financial holding company’s bankruptcy restructuring, there are limits on the Federal Reserve’s ability to lend to subsidiaries that continue to operate.  The Federal Reserve has the legal authority to lend through the discount window against a subsidiary bank’s high-quality collateral, with appropriate haircuts.  But, under existing laws and regulations, the Federal Reserve cannot lend to the securities affiliates.  Moreover, Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act restricts the commercial bank subsidiary of a systemically important firm from on-lending the funds borrowed from the Fed to its broker-dealer—even if the broker-dealer has good collateral to pledge against the loan. \n\nPut simply, in today’s legal and regulatory regime, there is a large potential liquidity gap.  There is not a credible liquidity backstop for a broker-dealer in bankruptcy.  In contrast, Title II provides for temporary funding through the Orderly Liquidation Fund, which can support the resolution of the recapitalized entity, including the broker-dealer.  This means that if one were to eliminate Title II, one should develop an alternative means to provide a temporary, comprehensive liquidity backstop to the restructured firm.\n\nReforms to Market Structure\n\nWe should also keep in place the key structural reforms of financial markets that are making the financial system safer.  In my mind, the most important of these include money market mutual fund reform, tri-party repo reform, and the mandate for the centralized clearing of OTC derivatives.  In each case, the post-crisis structural reforms have made the system more resilient to the potential insolvency of a major financial institution.  As a result, the level of stress placed upon the entire financial system by the failure of a single firm should be considerably lessened.\n\nAs part of this, we must maintain the capability for robust oversight of key FMUs.  Centralized clearing is a beneficial development for financial markets.  It reduces the amount of risk in the system by facilitating the netting of exposures to the central clearing party.  As a result, centralized clearing makes the financial system more resilient and enables greater efficiency and transparency for trading counterparties.  However, the trade-off for these benefits is that more residual risk is now concentrated in the FMUs.  Consequently, it is important to retain the protections contained in the regulatory framework provided by Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act.  We must ensure that FMUs are appropriately supervised and can withstand the failure of one or two of their largest counterparties and continue to operate.\n\nWorth Another Look\n\nSo, what hasn’t worked as well as we might have expected, or might be less crucial in light of the principles that I discussed earlier? \n\nFirst, I would start with regulations for small and medium-sized banking institutions.  As I discussed earlier, we must ensure that the firms whose failure could impose the greatest costs on ordinary borrowers and savers have the capital, liquidity and risk management standards appropriate to that risk.  But, the majority of banks in the United States do not come close to falling into this category.  For smaller institutions, the regulatory and compliance burdens can be considerably lighter because the failure of such a firm will not impose large costs or stress on the broader financial system. \n\nAlso, we must recognize that smaller firms have less ability to spread added compliance costs across their business.  All else equal, an increase in compliance burden can create an unintended competitive advantage for larger institutions.  We should also recognize the important role that smaller banking institutions have in supporting local communities around the country.  The ability to lend to local businesses often depends on close bank-customer relationships, and on knowledge that is often difficult to develop when the home office is very distant.\n\nThere have been efforts by regulators at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere to reduce the regulatory requirements for such institutions, and that is something that we should continue to work on.  Lawmakers could also evaluate statutory thresholds to see if they should be raised to apply to fewer, larger institutions.  For example, the Dodd-Frank Act sets a higher prudential regime for those firms with $50 billion or more in assets.  I believe that this threshold could be raised significantly without unduly increasing the risk to the broader financial system.\n\nSecond, policymakers might reexamine the implementation of the Volcker Rule to ensure that it is efficiently achieving its policy objectives.  The fact is that most market-making activity has an element of proprietary trading.  The market maker that bids successfully often does so based on a view on which way the market might be headed in the near term.  Thus, the line between market-making and proprietary trading is not always clear-cut, which makes regulation in this space difficult. \n\nSome market participants have argued that the Volcker Rule has contributed to the decline in market liquidity of corporate bonds.  Although I view the evidence on this point as inconclusive, it may be worth considering giving greater discretion to trading desks that facilitate client business to intervene when markets are illiquid and volatile.  Also, community banks are subject to the Volcker Rule even though they typically do not engage in proprietary trading, or sponsor or retain ownership interests in hedge funds or private equity funds.  This seems like an unnecessary burden that drives up compliance costs without a significant corresponding public benefit, so we also should exempt community banks from the Volcker Rule.\n\nThird, although CCAR is a vital part of our bank regulatory toolkit, I believe that we should consider changes that might lessen the burden it places on banks.  In this vein, the Federal Reserve recently removed the CCAR qualitative assessment for large, non-complex firms.  This is a good example of identifying regulatory burdens that are not worth the cost.  We are also considering the implementation of a stress capital buffer that would better align the dynamic stress capital requirements of CCAR with our more static, point-in-time regulatory capital rules.  Other potential adjustments include changes to the assumptions about the pace of a firm’s planned dividend and share repurchases, and how a firm in a stressed environment would likely manage its balance sheet and business footprint.\n\nThe financial crisis provided a vivid reminder that a well-functioning financial system is a necessary condition for a vibrant economy.  The efficient intermediation of funding from savers to borrowers supports economic activity and, over time, raises living standards.  This means that we need a financial system that is robust and resilient to shocks.  Most of the changes that have been implemented since the financial crisis have moved us in this direction, and it is important that any new changes to laws and regulations be grounded in what we have learned.  Our central purpose must be to ensure a safe and sound financial system that efficiently provides financing to households and businesses through the ups and downs of the business cycle.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions."

        "date": "Apr 6, 2017",
        "speaker": "Kevin J. Stiroh",
        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/sti170406",
        "content": "Introduction\n\nGood morning. I'd like to welcome you to the 2017 Community Bankers Conference. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is pleased to once again host this conference and to continue to foster a robust dialogue on key industry trends and supervisory issues affecting community banks.\n\nIn addition to about 130 representatives of community and smaller regional banks in the Second District of the Federal Reserve System, we are happy to welcome fellow supervisors from the states of New York, Connecticut and New Jersey; representatives of the FDIC and the OCC; and colleagues from the Board of Governors and Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago and Atlanta Federal Reserve Banks. In all, we have record attendance with 178 participants.\n\nAs in past years, our goal for this conference is to promote a constructive dialogue between senior managers and directors of smaller financial organizations in our District and federal and state supervisors. This type of constructive engagement helps us reach our shared objective of resilient financial institutions operating in a safe and sound financial system that supports the growth and stability of the U.S. economy.\n\nDuring my brief remarks this morning, I'd like to highlight three related topics that I believe are relevant to you as community bankers: the critical role that community banks play in the U.S. economy, particularly at the local level; trends in small business lending; and recent efforts to enhance the efficiency of the regulatory and supervisory framework.\n\nMy comments today are my own and do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Critical Role of Community Banks\n\nLet me begin with some thoughts on what we seek to achieve through supervision. A core objective for safety and soundness supervision is to ensure that supervised entities are resilient. That is, a firm should be able to continue to operate and provide financial services across a wide range of economic and financial conditions. Supervisors and regulators can support this objective through our focus on stronger capital and liquidity, comprehensive risk management and robust governance and controls.\n\nAll of this makes firms resilient to unexpected shocks and allows them to continue to serve their customers and communities. Resilience, however, is not the end objective. Rather, we seek to ensure that banks of all sizes contribute to the sustained and efficient provision of credit and other financial services to consumers and businesses that support the growth and stability of the economy.\n\nCommunity banks play a distinctive role in the provision of financial services, offering a wide range of products and serving specific segments. Community banks often use a unique \"relationship-based\" approach that, for example, leverages personal knowledge of their customers' creditworthiness and local business conditions to customize lending decisions and meet demand for credit and other financial services. This allows both consumers and small businesses to contribute to economic activity.\n\nCommunity banks also provide important financial services to key – often underserved – sectors of the economy. For example, a study from a few years ago found that almost one out of five U.S. counties has no other physical banking offices except those operated by community banks.1 As a second example, in the typical county in the Second District (excluding Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands), community banks account for about half of all banking deposits. It is the ability of smaller institutions to leverage \"soft information\" in important ways and reach underserved sectors that gives community banks a unique and critical role in driving sustainable economic growth.\n\nSupervisors are also keenly aware of the potential unintended consequences of the supervisory and regulatory framework. One of our goals as supervisors is to ensure that our efforts are not having an adverse effect on the ability of firms to provide credit and financial services that supports economic growth at businesses of all sizes. As I said in an earlier talk, in my view, it is entirely appropriate to continuously evaluate and rigorously debate whether the supervisory and regulatory framework is meeting its objectives efficiently.2 I'll return to this topic shortly.\n\nTrends in Small Bank and Small Business Lending\n\nAs we evaluate the financial system and the broader economy, we regularly examine firms from a horizontal and aggregate perspective to gain insight on the trends in the provision of financial services in the Second District. Today, I'll say a few words on trends in small business lending. Of course, looking at trends is not sufficient to identify causal relationships, but it does provide one perspective on these developments and identifies areas for future inquiry.\n\nThe overall level of commercial and industrial (C&I) lending at Second District firms with under $50 billion in total assets has grown steadily in recent years (Chart 1). Since the financial crisis, these loans have increased by just over 80 percent, which is somewhat faster than growth at the national level of 64 percent over the same period.\n\nWithin commercial and industrial (C&I) lending for these banks, small business lending is particularly important, given the traditional role of small businesses in job creation. While data are not immediately available on borrower size, we can look at a simple proxy for small business lending by isolating individual C&I loans to commercial borrowers that are each under $1 million. These data show that while the dollar value of small C&I loans has grown since 2010, the pace of growth has not been as high as overall C&I lending growth. As a result, small C&I loans now constitute a smaller portion of total C&I lending, both in the Second District and nationally (Chart 2). This is likely due, in part, to nominal factors, but could also reflect underlying economic conditions.\n\nTurning to community banks, they have historically held a disproportionate amount of small commercial loans, and this is a trend that has continued post-crisis. Among all Second District firms with less than $50 billion in total assets, community banking organizations (CBOs) hold 54 percent of total assets, but 66 percent of total small commercial loans. This share has declined somewhat since 2011 (Chart 3). Within small commercial lending, CBOs are especially important when it comes to small commercial real estate (CRE) loans, providing 79 percent of total CRE loans under $1 million.\n\nGiven the importance of small businesses to employment and growth in so many communities around our District, we welcome hearing your views on what might be driving these trends. More generally, we are interested in your assessment of business and lending conditions in the communities that you serve. What are the key challenges and opportunities that community banks face? Your insight will provide a key supplement to our quantitative research, and combining these two perspectives will support our efforts to understand what we are seeing in small business lending. Our supervisory teams are interested in your insights when we visit your organizations to conduct examinations and in venues like this conference.\n\nEnhancing the Framework\n\nAs I’ve said earlier, supervisors recognize it is important to ensure that the oversight framework continues to function efficiently. In that regard, the Federal Reserve recently participated in a review, as mandated by the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 (EGRPRA), to identify rules that are outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome. The full report covers 430 pages, so I'd like to highlight three of the recommendations that may be of interest to Second District community bankers. They relate to simplifying capital requirements; reducing regulatory reporting; and reducing the frequency of examinations for certain qualifying, smaller firms.\n\nCapital is in many ways the foundation of the health of the banking system. It's important to note that more than 500 banks failed during and after the financial crisis because they lacked sufficient capital, and many of them were community banks. Nonetheless, we have consistently heard since then that some of the capital rules are too complex for community banks and not commensurate with their size and risk profile. This link with the risk profile is critical and an important part of our efforts to \"tailor\" our supervisory approaches.\n\nAs part of the EGRPRA process, we are continuing to think about ways to simplify the capital rules. The agencies are developing a proposal and are planning to seek industry comments on certain proposed amendments to the capital rules. Such amendments could include (1) replacing the framework's complex treatment of high volatility commercial real estate exposures, (2) simplifying the current regulatory capital treatment for mortgage servicing assets and regulatory capital instruments issued by financial institutions; and (3) simplifying the current limitations on minority interests in regulatory capital.\n\nI should note that, in April 2015, the Board approved a final rule that raised the asset threshold of the Small Bank Holding Company (BHC) Policy Statement from less than $500 million in total consolidated assets to less than $1 billion in total consolidated assets and expanded the application of the policy statement to savings and loan holding companies (SLHCs). After the issuance of the final rule, 89 percent of all BHCs and 81 percent of all savings and loan holding companies were covered by the policy statement and were excluded from certain consolidated capital requirements.\n\nA second relevant topic reflects the challenges and burdens for smaller firms to file Call Reports. In response to industry concerns, the agencies began in 2014 the process to streamline the Call Report for community banks and subsequently published a series of proposals for comment. The result is that, effective March 31, 2017, Call Report requirements have been streamlined for community banks. This new Call Report will reduce the number of report pages from 85 to 61 pages and will remove approximately 40 percent of the data items currently included in the capital schedule.\n\nA third example concerns the frequency of examinations. Some firms proposed lengthening the period of time between examinations, including increasing the asset size limit for community banks to qualify for the 18-month cycle. In response, the agencies supported a change to statutes that govern examination frequency. Subsequent legislation enacted in 2015 permitted qualifying firms under $1 billion in total asset size to be subject to an 18-month examination cycle for safety and soundness examinations. The final rule for this legislation was issued at the end of last year and is now in force.\n\nI should emphasize that a longer exam cycle does not mean we are neglecting our supervisory responsibilities and we will remain focused on the core drivers of safety and soundness. That is our responsibility as supervisors. While it was some time ago, it is useful to recall the FDIC study of the financial crisis in the 1980s that highlighted how quickly financial health can deteriorate and concluded that delayed recognition via less-frequent examinations contributed to the scale of losses and failures in the 1980s.3\n\nIn addition to our review of regulations, supervisors periodically review existing supervisory guidance to evaluate relevance and effectiveness. The Board completed a policy review of the supervision programs for community and regional banking organizations to make sure that these programs and related supervisory guidance appropriately align with current banking practices and risks. As a result of this review, the Board eliminated 78 guidance letters that are no longer relevant.\n\nAs I mentioned, one of the core objectives of supervision and regulation is to support resilience in supervised firms so that they can contribute to the sustained provision of credit and other financial services. We strive to do that in the most effective and efficient manner possible. I mentioned just a few examples of our work in this area, and I look forward to continued dialogue on this key topic.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Federal Reserve System have a strong interest in understanding the issues facing community banks and ensuring that they continue to play their critical role in the U.S. financial system. We hope that today's conference sparks an informative discussion around many of those issues.\n\nI'll conclude by noting that this conference is just one of several initiatives to encourage communication and outreach with the industry. The Federal Reserve Board also has initiated numerous industry outreach opportunities to provide resources on key supervisory policies, including the development of two programs—\"Outlook Live\" and \"Ask the Fed\"—as well as the publication of three newsletters—Community Banking Connections, Consumer Compliance Outlook, and FedLinks. We hope you are able to utilize these resources, and our team will be happy to provide instructions on how you can subscribe to them.\n\nThank you for joining our conference today; I hope you will find today's presentations useful and informative."

        "title": "Money Markets at a Crossroads: Policy Implementation at a Time of Structural Change",
        "date": "Apr 5, 2017",
        "speaker": "Unknown",
        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/pot170405",
        "content": "Thank you very much. I’m very pleased to be back at UCLA, where I enjoyed eight years in the 1990s as an assistant professor of economics. I’d like to thank my hosts for their gracious invitation to have, once again, the experience of speaking to a classroom of future leaders in finance, business, economics, and—just perhaps—central banking as well.1\n\nDue to the large size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, we are employing a new and innovative framework to control money market rates. Since late 2015, we have seen several significant developments in money markets that have tested this new framework. These include a profound reshaping of the money market fund industry as a result of new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules, significant shifts in cash management practices at the Treasury and large foreign reserve managers, and continued pressure on bank balance sheets due to the ongoing implementation of Basel III capital requirements. Also since that time, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has directed three 25 basis point increases in its target range for the federal funds rate.\n\nToday I will discuss these structural developments, and evaluate the continued efficacy of the Federal Reserve’s policy implementation framework in light of their effects on money market competition and integration. I’ll briefly review the means by which we implement policy, and the reasons why we do so differently now from before the financial crisis. I’ll explain why changes in money market structure could conceivably impair the transmission of monetary policy. We will see that the impact of many of the recent structural developments were smoothed by the presence of the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repurchase facility. Then, I will take you through some data about money market dispersion to see what effect these developments had in practice.\n\nThe takeaway from all this is clear: our framework remains highly effective, and has proved quite resilient, even to these significant shifts in market structure. It continues to provide the FOMC with excellent control over money market rates. Indeed, the effective federal funds rate remained within the FOMC’s target range 100 percent of the time in 2016 and this has continued so far this year, as shown in (Figure 1). Changes in the federal funds rate continue to transmit in a predictable way to other money market rates, thereby affecting, as intended, the broad financial conditions upon which the price and quantity of private sector credit depend. However, recent evidence on dispersion in overnight and term rates suggests that we should continue to monitor the transmission of the FOMC’s policy stance into money market rates carefully.\n\nAs always, these views are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the New York Fed or the Federal Reserve System. My comments today are, in part, a condensed version of Domestic Open Market Operations During 2016, a report prepared by the Markets Group of the New York Fed for the FOMC. This annual report provides extensive and illuminating detail on the Federal Reserve’s operations and balance sheet. It is published as part of our mission to make monetary policy transparent and accessible to the public. The report will be published tomorrow on the New York Fed’s website and I encourage you to read it.\n\nOur New Policy Framework: A Review\n\nLet me start out by reviewing two basic questions: what is our framework for implementing monetary policy, and why has it changed so much?\n\nBefore the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve followed a well-worn playbook for monetary policy implementation that was based on keeping reserve balances scarce.2 Even though the Federal Reserve paid zero percent interest on reserves, banks still needed to hold small amounts of them, mainly to satisfy their reserve requirement but also for operational liquidity. The demand for reserves by banks was downward sloping (and steep). The Federal Reserve was therefore able to achieve the desired level of the federal funds rate, its policy target, by making slight adjustments in the supply of reserves in the system, so that it intersected the demand at that rate.3 On a typical day, implementing monetary policy entailed forecasting the level of reserves that would achieve the targeted level of the federal funds rate, and then, if necessary, conducting open-market operations to add or remove reserves.\n\nNowadays, however, reserves are no longer scarce. The supply of reserves now fluctuates widely around roughly two trillion dollars, compared to remaining tightly around ten billion dollars in mid-2007. This largely reflects the effect of the large-scale asset purchase programs, the last of which concluded in 2014, and the FOMC’s subsequent direction to maintain the size of the balance sheet by reinvesting principal repayments. Because the stock of reserves is so large, it is impractical to use open market operations to quickly reduce reserves back to the point where the federal funds rate can be controlled with scarcity, at least for now.4\n\nOur current framework relies, instead, on providing the market with two overnight investment opportunities to help steer money market rates: interest on reserves (IOR) and the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility.5 By law, IOR is available only to depository institutions.6 Absent frictions, IOR should provide a floor on interest rates, since competition between banks that can acquire funds in the wholesale market at rates below IOR and earn the spread should bring these rates very close to that paid on reserves. In practice, a number of frictions have led money market rates to trade moderately below IOR. ON RRP, which is offered to a broad selection of counterparties that includes money market funds, is intended to intensify competition in money markets and enhance the transmission of IOR into other overnight money market rates. It also has proved useful as a shock absorber. I will get back to that in a moment.\n\nThe transmission of monetary policy relies on competition within, and integration across, money markets. The FOMC’s policy target is the federal funds rate, which is a measure of what banks pay to take out unsecured overnight loans from other banks and from government-sponsored entities. However, the Federal Reserve does not transact in the federal funds market, and therefore cannot directly impact the federal funds rate.7 Instead, it relies on a predictable relationship between rates in the markets in which it does operate, and rates on federal funds borrowings. Moreover, while the FOMC’s goals for monetary policy are maximum employment and price stability, the economic decisions of households and firms generally don’t depend directly on the federal funds rate, since they don’t participate in that market.8 Instead, their decisions depend on broader financial conditions, including the interest rates on home mortgages and corporate bonds, the performance of the stock market, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar.9 As a result, for monetary policy to achieve its objectives, markets must function well enough to transmit the stance of policy, both from the markets in which the Federal Reserve directly transacts to its policy target, and then onward from that target to other money markets, and eventually to those asset prices which directly affect real activity.\n\nIt’s helpful to think through how shocks to the structure of money markets could impair monetary control and transmission. I think about this in three steps: control of conditions within the markets in which we operate, control over the FOMC’s target—the federal funds rate, and transmission into broader financial conditions.\n\nSome structural changes could reduce the ability of our operations to affect rates on other transactions within those same markets. For example, our ON RRP operations provide a floor on the repo rate offered by dealers to cash investors because of the competitive pressure the Fed’s offer rate places on borrowers of funds in the repo market.10 If this competitive pressure were less effective, perhaps because of greater constraints on lenders’ switching counterparties, changes in the ON RRP rate could become less effective in influencing repo market rates.\n\nOther shocks could affect the transmission of rates from our operations to the federal funds rate. In the absence of strong financial intermediation between the federal funds market, interest on reserves, and the repo market, changes in rates the Federal Reserve controls—like the IOR rate and the ON RRP offering rate—might not affect the federal funds rate as intended. Shocks to intermediation could result in permanently weaker integration between markets. The effects could also prove temporary, for example if intermediation weakens initially but then recovers over time as market participants adjust to the shock.\n\nFinally, changes to the federal funds rate might not affect other interest rates and asset prices that are relevant to the cost of credit in the real economy. And also, even if changes in the federal funds rate do affect those other rates, if the linkage between them were to become particularly noisy or hard to predict, it could become harder for policymakers, as well as the public, to forecast what level of the federal funds rate will best achieve maximum employment and price stability.\n\nRecent Developments in Money Market Structure\n\nSince 2015, my staff and I have focused on four changes in money market structure that some observers believed could have had an impact on the implementation or transmission of monetary policy. I’ll discuss each of these in turn.\n\nTo begin with, we are now firmly off the zero lower bound. After seven years at very low levels, the federal funds rate is now trading at 91 basis points. As shown in (Figure 2), the distribution of overnight federal funds activity is now quite distant from zero, in comparison to the period before liftoff. (Figure 3) shows a similar presentation for the triparty repo market, similarly revealing that traded rates are now consistently well above the zero bound and largely above or at the ON RRP offer rate.\n\nCertain features of the financial system likely provide support to interest rates near zero. These include the availability of physical cash and a behavioral aversion by some money market investors to investing at negative rates. They also encompass certain unique features of money markets in the United States, such as legal and regulatory incentives applicable to money market funds and the inability of the Federal Reserve to remunerate deposits held by government-sponsored enterprises.\n\nAccordingly, when we were at the zero lower bound, we weren’t able to rule out the possibility that initial increases in the policy target might not translate one-for-one into increases in money market rates, as reduced uplift from the zero lower bound could have offset some of the policy tightening. In addition, one might have also worried that various money markets might not move together as rates rise, meaning that, for example, a larger spread might emerge between secured and unsecured rates, or between overnight and term instruments, than had historically been the case. I will discuss some evidence on these issues later on.\n\nThe second development, in October 2016, was the entry into force of new SEC rules for money market funds. These new rules require, among other things, a floating net asset value for institutional prime money market funds, provide for liquidity fees and redemption gates for prime funds, and establish more stringent rules for portfolio diversification and financial reporting for all money market funds.11 Many of these reforms are aimed at least in part at enhancing financial stability, and in particular at addressing the potential for runs on prime funds to intensify financial stress. They could also make prime funds, which can hold a broad spectrum of money market assets, less attractive to investors who desire an investment opportunity with a fixed net asset value or who are concerned about redemption fees or gates.\n\nOur contacts in the money market fund industry could foresee, based on their own business plans and discussions with their clients, that these reforms would lead to a substantial shift in money market fund assets. Substantial amounts were expected to come out of prime funds and into government-only funds, which generally hold Treasury securities, repo against Treasury collateral, or similar ultra-low-risk assets. As a result, this reallocation was expected to bring about somewhat lower rates on Treasury bills and repo backed by Treasury collateral, and somewhat higher unsecured rates.\n\nIt is important that the monetary policy implementation framework take note of changes to the broader financial market landscape, including its regulatory structure, and adapt as necessary in response to such changes. Ahead of the reforms, our focus, which I discussed in a speech in early 2016, was on whether the reforms would have an impact on the transmission of monetary policy that might require such adaptation. In particular, we wanted to observe whether markets remained sufficiently competitive to allow for robust control of rates, and see whether the shifts in volume—particularly the anticipated upswing in demand for government-fund-eligible assets—would impair competition.12 We also wanted to see whether linkages across markets remained strong enough to ensure that policy was transmitted in accordance with the FOMC’s forecasts, especially given prime funds’ broad investment scope, and their ability to reallocate across markets according to relative value.13\n\nThe size of the reallocation ended up being quite a bit larger than most had expected. As shown in (Figure 4), about $1 trillion of assets had migrated from prime to government funds by late 2016. This resulted in a major reallocation of the investments held by the money market fund industry, shown in (Figure 5). This reallocation had far-reaching effects on the structure of money markets, as described in a recent blog by some of my New York Fed colleagues.14 For example, banks that were relying on the funding by prime funds had to find other institutions that would be willing to lend to them. Government funds, which received large inflows, had to place the additional funds they had received, for example into Treasury or agency securities or into repo. Such a large change in funding flows could have created significant movements in money market interest rates.\n\nThe good news is that the ON RRP facility served as a shock absorber for overnight rates. As shown in (Figure 6), money market funds, particularly government funds, increased their use of ON RRP during the transition. Because of the availability of ON RRP, government funds knew they would be able to temporarily place some of the new funding they received at the ON RRP facility while they were looking for new investment opportunities, and prime funds knew they would have access to a very secure and liquid overnight investment as they increased their liquidity to meet an uncertain level of redemptions. As a result of this elastic provision of a risk-free investment opportunity, overnight secured and unsecured rates were only modestly affected by these large flows, and overnight markets continued to move as intended following changes in the FOMC’s target for the federal funds rate. That said, the runoff in prime fund assets did leave an imprint on term unsecured rates, although some of this has retraced recently as markets have adapted. I will return to this later.\n\nThird, for some time now we have been keenly focused on the impact on the structure of money markets that ensues from higher balance sheet costs for financial institutions.15\n\nWhen I refer to balance sheet costs, I mean costs that are primarily related to the size, but not the composition, of a financial institution’s balance sheets. One example of such a cost is the leverage ratio, which is a requirement that a bank has, at minimum, capital of certain percentage of its overall assets.16\n\nThe leverage ratio was introduced as a simple non-risk-based backstop to the risk-based capital requirements and sets an amount of required capital that depends exclusively on the size of the balance sheet, plus off-balance sheet exposures for the largest U.S. banks, and does not depend on the composition of the balance sheet or the risk of those exposures. The use of explicit, numerical minimum leverage ratios as part of the capital regulation of insured depository institutions and bank holding companies (BHCs) and their broker-dealer subsidiaries has a long history in the United States, dating back to 1981, but in recent years the scope of their use has broadened considerably as many large broker-dealers were not subsidiaries of BHCs prior to the financial crisis.17 The U.S. intermediate holding company (IHC) operations of foreign banking organizations including their broker-dealers will also be subject to the leverage ratio requirements starting on January 1, 2018. Finally, reflecting the lessons learned during the financial crisis and recognizing that excessive leverage could be built up from off-balance-sheet exposures, the leverage exposure definition was expanded to include off-balance sheet exposures. This new leverage ratio is called the supplementary leverage ratio and applies to the largest U.S. institutions.18\n\nBalance sheet costs tend to make it more expensive for financial institutions to act as intermediaries in money markets.19 If these costs are economically large in the context of the ultra-low-risk, ultra-low-margin world of money markets, this could operate to reduce dealers’ incentive to make markets and act as financial intermediaries, so long as the leverage ratio is the binding capital requirement relative to the risk-based capital requirement for such firms.20,21\n\nIn calculating the leverage ratio, all assets, including cash held at the central bank, are included. Because of the large outstanding stock of reserves in the system, this might have the effect of making the leverage ratio more binding for some firms. In addition, the effect of the leverage ratio is further magnified by dealers’ inability to “net” across similar transactions on a bilateral basis with different counterparties for accounting and capital purposes. Netting is generally allowed so long as the transactions have the same counterparty and settlement date.22 The “same counterparty” requirement could in theory be met via the implementation of a central counterparty (CCP). However, for several money markets that are important to the transmission of monetary policy, no CCP has been implemented to date. For example, there is still no CCP in the United States for the repo market, and there is also no CCP for foreign exchange swaps. The regulatory capital benefit from the implementation of a CCP for the repo market might be reduced by regulatory requirements for some arrangements, such as those associated with the provision of committed liquidity to the CCP. The implementation of a CCP raises other important policy issues that would need to be carefully considered.\n\nThe fourth and final development: money markets have been impacted by increasingly large shifts in the Treasury’s cash management practices, as well as the cash management of a number of foreign official holders of dollar reserves. (Figure 7) and (Figure 8) show the behavior of the Treasury General Account—the Treasury’s “checking account” at the New York Fed—and balances in the New York Fed’s foreign repo pool, which is an overnight investment opportunity made available at market rates as a service to eligible foreign official and international account holders.23\n\nLarge shifts in these cash management practices can impact monetary transmission in a couple of ways. First, although we are not now conducting monetary policy via a reserves-scarcity framework, in the assessment of some analysts, changes in the stock of reserve balances still matter to pricing in money markets over a medium-term horizon.24 Largely as a result of fluctuations in these balances and in ON RRP take-up, reserves have ranged widely since the start of 2016: from as low as $1.85 trillion on January 4, 2017, to as high as $2.5 trillion on March 9, 2016.25 If the shifts in reserves are large enough, they can affect money market rates. In addition, changes in Federal Reserve balances of the Treasury and of foreign official accounts are often associated with offsetting shifts in other components of their cash management programs. For example, recent shifts in the Treasury’s cash holdings have coincided with efforts to expand the issuance of Treasury bills, and foreign reserve holders might in some cases use the foreign repo pool as a substitute for Treasury bills. Greater and more elastic supply of ultra-low-risk assets through these channels likely helped smooth out the effects of the expansion of government money market funds that I noted earlier.\n\nEvidence of the Efficacy of Policy Transmission: Views from Duffie and Krishnamurthy\n\nRecently, numerous academic papers have explored the functioning of money markets in the post-crisis environment, and have sought to investigate—both theoretically and empirically—how structural shifts like those I have discussed will affect the Federal Reserve’s approach to policy implementation. Darrell Duffie and Arvind Krishnamurthy presented a particularly notable empirical and theoretical study at last year’s Jackson Hole conference.26\n\nDarrell and Arvind’s central empirical observation was that money rates have become more dispersed. (Figure 9), which shows a selection of overnight money market rates, illustrates some of this dispersion. Darrell and Arvind use a broad selection of market rates, assembled from various sources and adjusted in a number of ways to make them comparable to each other, to construct what they call a “dispersion index” of money market rates, shown in (Figure 10). This series is calculated as a weighted mean absolute deviation across these rates. This metric shows that, according to their measure, dispersion across money markets has risen since late 2015, around the time the FOMC began the process of policy normalization and money market funds started to change their business models in anticipation of the new SEC rules.\n\nBased on these data and on theoretical modeling, Darrell and Arvind conclude that monetary transmission may be less efficient than it was before the crisis. As a result, they expect that, as the FOMC increases the federal funds rate over time, other interest rates might not rise one-for-one with it. As one consequence of this, they express a concern that the Federal Reserve might see greater use of its ON RRP operations over time as monetary policy is tightened, because the rates offered on these operations—presumably rising one-for-one with changes in the target federal funds rate range—will become increasingly attractive relative to other market rates, which they expect to rise more slowly. To date, at least, this does not appear to be happening.\n\nI think this paper makes an important point about transmission: monetary control does not stop at the effective federal funds rate, and our framework must ensure that the stance of monetary policy is passed through into other money market rates. However, I am less persuaded that the data supports Darrell and Arvind’s concern about the present efficacy of the framework.\n\nFirst, I think the recent pickup in dispersion we see in money markets might not tell us much about what will happen going forward. A lot of what has happened in money markets in recent years may relate to one-off factors associated with money market fund reform and with liftoff from the zero lower bound.\n\nSecond, there are significant challenges associated with the construction of the data in the index, especially related to the measure they call “jumbo deposits.”27 Virtually the entire rise in their measure of dispersion in late 2015 comes from this one series, but this rise is largely eliminated if the series is instead constructed as done in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)’s Main Economic Indicators for the United States.\n\nThird, it isn’t obvious to me that higher or lower levels of this index correspond to “better” or “worse” monetary transmission. Absent frictions and risk premia, dispersion would be zero. In practice, there is quite a bit of dispersion. These spreads are driven by liquidity, credit, term and other fundamental risk premia that vary over time. Effective monetary transmission does not require zero dispersion—instead, it requires that market rates respond appropriately to changes in the federal funds rate, and that the relationships among market rates be reasonably predictable. Put another way: if some change in market structure causes rates across markets to be more dispersed, but every traded rate within each money market moves up by exactly 25 basis points following a 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate, is transmission really worse than it was before the structural change?\n\nFinally, if we are to use dispersion as a yardstick for the efficacy of monetary policy implementation, we should make use of individual transaction-level data to see how effective our tools are at uniformly affecting traded rates within each money market. Because transaction-level data are not publicly available, Darrell and Arvind’s index is based on “average” or “market” rates for each asset class. This means that they can assess only dispersion across money markets, rather than both across them and within them.\n\nEvaluating Efficacy using Transaction Level Data\n\nIn my view, the difference between dispersion within markets, and dispersion across markets, is revealing about the nature of underlying changes in money markets. If competition were to become impaired, I might expect to see greater dispersion in rates within each individual market, as the decline in competition might allow for greater market power by individual borrowers and lenders, and therefore permit more price discrimination. In contrast, if intermediation were to be impaired, I would expect to see higher dispersion across money market rates, and more variable dispersion over time, even for very similar investments. This is because impairments to intermediation could result in greater market segmentation.\n\nOf course, such changes in dispersion either within or across markets could also result from other changes, such as movements in risk premia. One way of reducing the impact of movements in risk premia is to focus on overnight transactions only. This has the further advantage of not requiring a complex adjustment to term rates to take account of market expectations for changes in overnight rates.\n\nTo get a sense for dispersion within money markets, we can use overnight transaction-level data in the unsecured market (federal funds and Eurodollars) collected by the Federal Reserve on form FR 2420, and in the customer-to-dealer triparty repo market collected from the triparty clearing banks. (Figure 11) and (Figure 12) show dispersion indices for activity within each of these markets, calculated the same way as done by Darrell and Arvind. (Figure 13) combines all this activity into a single combined transaction level dispersion index.\n\nWhen I look at these figures, I see three things.\n\nFirst, I don’t see a pronounced move upward in dispersion within either the secured or unsecured markets individually, either in general or around FOMC meetings at which monetary policy was tightened. This suggests to me that recent increases in the federal funds rate have passed through, immediately and one-for-one, to virtually all activity in these markets.\n\nIn fact, within the secured market, we see dispersion ticking down. This appears to relate to the general decline in secured rates after money market fund reform, which caused trading in the repo market to become more concentrated at or around the ON RRP offered rate. Interestingly, there is a small amount of trading in the repo market that takes place slightly below the ON RRP offered rate; this largely reflects lending by firms that are not New York Fed counterparties and therefore cannot participate in our operations.\n\nSecond, within each market, I see periodic, transitory jumps in dispersion. In the unsecured market, these typically occur on month- and quarter-end dates.28 We don’t typically observe this pattern in the customer-to-dealer repo market, but did see a spike in dispersion on June 24, 2016, the day after voters in the United Kingdom chose to leave the European Union.29 This spike might reflect the pricing-in, for a brief moment, of a modest increase in counterparty-level risk related to this development.\n\nThese shifts in unsecured market activity around period-end dates are consistent with the incentive provided by the leverage ratio requirement. The frequency of the leverage exposure calculation differs by jurisdiction: the U.S. and UK require a daily or weekly average calculation for on-balance-sheet exposures for their supervised banks, while some other jurisdictions only require a quarter-end calculation or average of the three month ends within the quarter. As discussed earlier, the leverage ratio requirements in the U.S. apply to insured depository institutions, BHCs and IHCs operations of foreign banking organizations. While these period-end approaches may be less administratively burdensome to implement than daily or weekly averages, they can incentivize firms to temporarily adjust their balance sheets around quarter-end to report higher ratios: balance sheet growth incurs no cost on most days, but incurs a significant capital cost on one or three days a quarter. Much activity in unsecured markets is low-margin intermediation in which banks borrow funds from non-banks and deposit them at the Federal Reserve to earn IOR; this activity can be less economic for leverage-ratio-constrained foreign banks on the few days when the ratio is calculated.\n\nThird, since liftoff in December 2015, I see a modest and gradual uptick in dispersion in the index that combines both secured and unsecured markets. This increase seems to have occurred in two stages: once at liftoff, and again in autumn 2016. In contrast, there was nearly no change in dispersion following the FOMC’s two additional policy rate increases in December 2016 and March 2017. This rise in dispersion in the combined measure reflects the fact that the spread between unsecured and secured overnight rates rose around those times.\n\nMuch of the fairly modest pick-up in that rate spread seems tied to individual, one-off factors. To begin with, the dispersion in money market rates was compressed to some extent by the zero lower bound, and as rates moved into positive territory, they were able to “unpack” to an extent. In addition, at liftoff, the FOMC decided to widen the spread between IOR and the ON RRP offered rate by 5 basis points, which acted to slightly reduce secured rates relative to unsecured rates.30 These two factors explain why dispersion rose around the first tightening, but not at the following two tightenings: reduced uplift from the zero lower bound and the lower relative setting of the ON RRP offered rate had some effect on the outcome of the first tightening, but had no effect on the subsequent two. Finally, the new SEC money market fund rules brought about a pickup in demand for ultra-low-risk investments, and a corresponding decline in demand for unsecured investments. If these one-off factors were the primary reasons that this spread widened, we would expect to see essentially one-for-one passthrough of future monetary tightening into both markets.\n\nTransmission to Broader Money Markets\n\nThis evidence on control and transmission is encouraging. However, there have been some recent signs of more volatile transmission of interest rates into broader money markets.\n\nThe most notable of these has been the rise in LIBOR rates relative to like-maturity overnight index swaps, shown for a 3-month maturity in (Figure 14). This figure suggests that banks’ cost to obtain funding for three months has risen relative to the cost of borrowing that funding overnight—for example in the federal funds or Eurodollar market—and hedging the overnight interest rate risk of such borrowing with a swap. During the financial crisis, this spread rose and fell with changes in investors’ perception of bank credit risk. In contrast, its recent moves are related to money market fund reform: term rates rose considerably as prime money market funds both shrunk in size and reduced their maturities to remain highly liquid, and have recently come back a bit as the market has stabilized and markets have adapted to the new industry structure.\n\nShown in (Figure 15) are customer-to-dealer versus dealer-to-dealer Treasury repo rates. The customer-to-dealer market consists primarily of cash investors like money market funds lending to dealers, while the dealer-to-dealer market reflects dealers lending amongst themselves.31 The spread between these two rates is thus a proxy for the cost dealers with ready access to cash-investor financing charge to act as intermediaries between these two markets. Since all the lending is secured by Treasuries, this intermediation entails very modest risk.\n\nAs I’ve mentioned, a certain amount of dispersion across markets is normal and to be expected, due to liquidity, credit and other types of risk premia.33 Spreads have also declined considerably in recent months. This could be due to the market adapting to the changes I have described. However, the data indicate that spreads have become more variable, have increased to high values at times, and in the case of repo and foreign exchange swaps have become especially volatile around month-end, and, especially, quarter-end dates.\n\nThe increase in spreads in the repo and FX swap markets relate to the confluence of two factors:34 constraints to intermediation ensuing from the leverage ratio pressures I mentioned earlier, combined with limited access to dollar money markets by some financial as well as non-financial institutions.35 Pressures to reduce balance sheet size at period-end dates affect domestic money market integration, and integration across different global money markets, just as they affect the link between unsecured markets and IOR that I discussed earlier. These pressures are made more acute by inelastic demand for wholesale dollar funding from some firms that hold large dollar loan and securities portfolios but lack access to dollar deposits or to direct funding from money market funds.36\n\nPrognosis\n\nOn the whole, these shifts in broad money market spreads do not pose a problem for monetary policy formulation or implementation. Although LIBOR and some other spreads are wider, they are, on average over time, generally stable and slow-moving, and as a result forecasters are able to incorporate any effect these spreads might have when formulating their projections for monetary policy. Changes in the policy rate continue to be passed through predictably into all these markets, as recently observed. Transitory, predictable and non-disruptive increases in period-end volatility are unlikely to meaningfully affect the real economy. And finally, there is evidence that the wider spreads among market rates that came out of money market fund reform are gradually closing over time, as firms adapt to the new structure of money markets by adjusting their portfolios and identifying new counterparties.\n\nHowever, if market dispersion were to increase too much, this could cause a variety of challenges. Such dispersion could affect monetary transmission, altering the price of credit made available to certain borrowers. This could complicate the formulation of monetary policy if it were to become harder for policymakers to anticipate the impact on the economy that would ensue from future changes to the federal funds rate. Such dispersion could also affect the use of our operations.37\n\nAs I have noted, it seems that much of the recent shift in money market dispersion has arisen as a byproduct of important regulatory improvements to improve the safety and soundness of the global financial system. Money market fund reform is now in place, and while the leverage ratio and many other Basel III rules are not fully in force, in practice most banks are complying with them. As a result, what we have observed in money markets might simply have reflected a one-off realignment of asset prices to the new enhanced regulatory structure.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude: I continue to be greatly encouraged by the performance of our framework for policy implementation, which has provided the FOMC with excellent control over the federal funds rate and predictable pass-through of the monetary policy stance into broader money market conditions. Transaction-level dispersion measures demonstrate markets that are competitive, and suggest that the effects of policy tightening are realized as expected and intended. These markets, and our framework, have proved resilient to major shocks to the structure of money markets, including the reshaping of the money market fund industry.\n\nI remain highly confident that our framework will continue to perform very well. Nevertheless, we should continue to monitor the possibility of a growth in dispersion in broader money market rates. Gathering more and better data about money markets is a useful step in this direction, and one at which my colleagues and I are actively engaged. Learning more about policy transmission through theoretical and empirical modeling is another useful endeavor.\n\nAs stated in a recent Bank for International Settlements report, “Financial regulation aims to influence the behavior of banks and other financial intermediaries to enhance their resilience and support financial stability. Given that those same intermediaries interact with central banks in the context of monetary policy implementation, changes to the regulatory environment are bound to have effects that central banks will need to take into account.”38 Economic and financial stability are closely interconnected; for example, monetary transmission was reliably effective in 2007, but in 2008 became quite impaired as a result of systemic financial stress. In navigating these issues, my colleagues and I are aided by the integration of policy analysis across disciplines at the Federal Reserve System, an arrangement which provides an ongoing breadth and depth of perspective.\n\nThank you for your attention.\n\nCharts"

        "content": "Good morning, and welcome to the New York Fed’s Economic Press Briefing.  Today, we will focus on recent developments in household borrowing, with special attention on student debt.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nFollowing a period of steady deleveraging that began during the Great Recession, households have gradually increased their borrowing during the past three years.  Later this year, total household debt is expected to reach its previous peak, from the third quarter of 2008.  Given past experience, one might wonder whether this level of indebtedness is sustainable or a reason for concern.  Answering this question requires a fuller consideration of household balance sheets and a deeper analysis of who is indebted.  The increase in liabilities in recent years has been accompanied by significant improvements in the value of assets held by households, due to strong growth in housing and stock prices.  Moreover, household incomes have been rising at a moderate pace due to sturdy job gains and modest wage increases.  As a result, the household sector’s financial condition today is in unusually good shape for this point in the economic cycle.  In relative terms, household indebtedness is low, and—thanks in part to low interest rates—debt service burdens relative to household income have fallen to levels not seen since at least the early 1980s.\n\nAs we will show in today’s presentation, compared to 2008, a greater proportion of overall debt today is now held by older households that have higher and more stable incomes and more experience as borrowers, on average.  Consequently, a much larger proportion of debt is currently held by borrowers with higher credit scores.  The resulting higher overall debt quality is reflected in historically low overall delinquency rates.  Transition rates into new delinquency are below the levels of the early 2000s, and foreclosure and bankruptcy rates in 2016 are the lowest since our data series began in 1999.\n\nNotwithstanding this overall rosy picture, the improvement in aggregate debt quality and performance conceals important underlying changes in debt holdings that could be consequential, with implications for the housing market and for consumer spending over the longer term.  While older borrowers hold more debt of all types, there has been a significant shift among younger people toward student debt and away from mortgage and other debt.  Student debt has increased more than fivefold over the past 14 years, with more young adults taking out loans and borrowing larger average amounts.  And, while debt delinquency rates overall have fallen, those for student debt have remained elevated.\n\nSince 2012, the New York Fed has devoted considerable attention to the rapid growth in student debt levels and delinquencies by publishing a number of reports.  The findings in these reports were largely based on data from our Consumer Credit Panel (CCP), a nationally representative dataset sourced from Equifax credit reports.  This unique dataset has enabled us to provide new insights into the overall state of the student loan market and into individual student loan borrowing and repayment behavior not available from other data sources.\n\nToday, we will first provide a brief overview of aggregate household debt and its borrowers, followed by a presentation based on new research on student debt, which focuses on delinquency and repayment rates.  We find that recent cohorts of college students are defaulting at a lower rate than those who left higher education during the recession.  But, at the same time, their repayment rates are also lower.  Despite an improving labor market, overall delinquency rates on student debt remain stubbornly high, and repayment progress has slowed further, likely reflecting the recent introduction of more accommodative payment plans.  Payment progress is particularly low for those with larger debts and for those from lower-income areas.\n\nMuch remains to be learned about the causes of the observed expansion of debt burdens and repayment problems among recent college graduates.  Over the past two decades, there has been a significant change in the financing of higher education—with state and local funding covering a smaller share, and students and their families bearing a greater proportion of rising college costs.  While the federal student loan program has undoubtedly helped mitigate the impact of higher costs on college enrollment, more students now leave college with higher amounts of debt.  At the same time, college dropout rates remain stubbornly high, and empirical evidence indicates that graduates from some colleges have had trouble finding good-paying jobs.\n\nAnother important question concerns the consequences of growing student debt for the overall economy.  To investigate this question further, we linked our CCP dataset to student enrollment records from the National Student Clearinghouse in order to analyze the relationship between homeownership, educational attainment and student debt.  Not surprisingly, our research shows a strong positive association between educational attainment and homeownership, consistent with the fact that higher educational attainment is associated with higher average earnings.  Interestingly, this relationship appears to hold irrespective of family background, suggesting that colleges may be successful in “leveling the playing field” across students from different socioeconomic backgrounds.\n\nAt the same time, our analysis reveals that those with significant student debt are much less likely to own a home at any given age than those who completed their education with little or no student debt.  This finding is consistent with other past and ongoing research here at the New York Fed that points to the potential longer-term negative implications of student debt on homeownership and other types of consumer spending.  Of course, homeownership is more than just consumption—it has historically been an important form of wealth accumulation.  For a large share of households, housing equity is the principal form of wealth.  Thus, changes in the way we finance post-secondary education could also have important implications for the distribution of wealth.\n\nBefore turning it over to my colleagues, I would like to comment briefly on the importance of college costs, financing and access to higher education.  It is well known that the average earnings premium from having a college education is high and has risen over the past few decades, in part because of a decline in real average earnings for those without a college degree.  In addition to higher earnings, a college education is associated with increased homeownership, as I just discussed.  The economic and social returns to having a well-educated and skilled labor force are also well documented.  However, I would like to highlight another important role of higher education: it is a pathway to and engine of upward income mobility.\n\nI believe that income mobility—the degree to which individuals or families can move up or down in the income distribution over time—is a foundational element for a well-functioning society and indicates the ability of an economy to provide opportunities for all.  As I have discussed previously, important research by Stanford economist Raj Chetty and his co-authors has shown that intergenerational income mobility in the United States—a child’s chances of moving up in the income distribution relative to his or her parents—has remained stable over the past half century.2   However, because of the increase in income inequality and stagnant or declining incomes for the least well-off, the consequences of being born to low- versus high-income parents are greater today than in the past.  These trends have contributed to a steady decline in “absolute” upward income mobility in the United States, as defined by the share of children who earn more in real terms than their parents.  This fraction has fallen from 90 percent to 50 percent over the past half century.\n\nRecent work by Chetty and his co-authors has investigated the importance of higher education in achieving upward mobility.  They find that many highly qualified lower-income students do not attend selective colleges, while those low- and middle-income students who do—despite facing greater challenges—fare almost as well as affluent students who attend the same colleges.  Their research also indicates that some colleges are better engines of upward income mobility than others, and that colleges that offered the largest number of low-income students pathways to upward mobility have become less accessible to them during the 2000s.  As a result, higher-education’s contribution to increasing intergenerational mobility has diminished.\n\nIt is unclear why access has fallen to colleges with relatively high mobility rates.  One possibility is that recent budget cuts may have forced these colleges—which tend to be mid-tier public institutions—to raise tuition and change their admissions policies more than other institutions, such as less budget-constrained elite private institutions.  Empirical evidence points to a greater sensitivity to college costs in the higher education decisions of low-income populations.  As a result, continued increases in college costs and debt burdens could inhibit higher education’s ability to serve as an important engine of upward income mobility.  In my view, these developments are important and deserve increased attention.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I will now turn it over to Wilbert van der Klaauw, who will give a brief overview of the current state of household debt."

        "content": "It is a pleasure to be here today.  I would like to thank the University of South Florida for sponsoring this conference.  As always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.1 \n\nOne aspect of today’s event is the dedication of a financial laboratory to help students learn about financial markets, which I think has great value.  Knowledge of how financial markets operate is an important aspect of financial and economic literacy, and it leads to greater financial security over time.  For example, one important lesson is that when the promised returns on an investment offering are extraordinarily high, it is because the investment is either very risky or fraudulent.  When investing, it is important to remember that if it seems to be too good to be true, it likely is!\n\nToday, I want to take the opportunity to talk about the importance of financial markets in influencing the economic outlook and, in turn, U.S. monetary policy.  This is a subject near and dear to my heart.  Nearly 20 years ago—when I was working in the private sector—my colleagues and I introduced an index of financial conditions.2  I believe that my long-standing focus on financial conditions has, over time, helped me become a better economic forecaster.  And, I am pleased that economists and analysts increasingly incorporate financial conditions into their assessments of the economic outlook.\n\nAs I will argue, financial conditions in the United States play an important role in influencing economic conditions.  Because movements in financial markets are a major factor influencing broader financial conditions, it is necessary to understand how financial market developments can affect the economic outlook and, therefore, the appropriate setting of monetary policy.  But, this story gets more complicated, as the setting of monetary policy, in turn, affects market developments and financial conditions.  This two-way feedback is an important feature of the interaction between financial conditions and monetary policy.\n\nTo begin, let me be clear about what we mean by “financial conditions.”  Focusing on the United States, financial conditions can be broadly summarized by five key measures: short- and long-term Treasury rates, credit spreads, the foreign exchange value of the dollar, and equity prices.  Although many other measures and prices can also be included in one’s assessment, I think these five are the most essential.3 \n\nIn the conduct of monetary policy, the FOMC does not have targets for either specific components of financial conditions or for financial conditions more broadly.  We care about financial conditions not for themselves, but instead for how they can affect economic activity and ultimately our ability to achieve the statutory objectives of the Federal Reserve—maximum employment and price stability.  Let me provide a few examples.  A decline in mortgage rates can lift the demand for owner-occupied housing and support construction activity.  A rise in equity prices can boost household wealth, which is one factor that underpins consumer spending.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar can affect the relative competitiveness of importers and exporters, which, in turn, influences the country’s trade performance.  Narrower credit spreads can reduce the cost of capital for business and help support greater business investment.\n\nIn sum, financial conditions affect households’ and firms’ saving and investment plans, and, therefore, play a key role in influencing economic activity and the economic outlook.  This is why the evaluation of financial conditions is so crucial in the conduct of monetary policy.\n\nThe FOMC traditionally implements monetary policy by adjusting the federal funds rate—the short-term interest rate paid by banks that borrow reserves from other financial institutions.  However, few economic decisions directly depend on the federal funds rate.  Rather, changes in the federal funds rate affect the economy through their impact on other interest rates, which, consequently, influence broader financial conditions.  If financial conditions moved predictably with the policy rate, then there would be no need for the FOMC to focus on financial conditions.  In such a world, by adjusting the level of the federal funds rate, the FOMC could be fully confident that it could generate the appropriate financial conditions necessary to support achievement of full employment and price stability.\n\nIn fact, the response of financial conditions to changes in short-term interest rates is not rigid and predictable.  Instead, as we shall see shortly, the linkage between the federal funds rate and financial conditions changes over time, as it is influenced by a whole host of other factors.  Recent evidence suggests that even the relation between short-term and long-term rates has shifted substantially over the past 15 years.4  Moreover, at times, we have observed cases in which financial conditions did not move in the same direction as the monetary policy stance.  Let me highlight two recent divergences which indicate that we need to keep a separate eye on the evolution of financial conditions. \n\nThe first occurred in the mid-2000s.  In June 2004, the FOMC decided to begin raising the federal funds rate target in order to remove policy accommodation.  It raised the target in 25-basis-point increments at 17 consecutive meetings, pushing the rate up from a starting point of 1.0 percent to a peak of 5.25 percent.  Despite this tightening of monetary policy over two years, financial conditions failed to tighten in a similar manner.  This can be seen by looking at the behavior of well-known measures of financial conditions during this period (Exhibit 1).  The rise in short-term rates was offset by a decline in long-term yields, a rise in equity prices and narrower credit spreads. \n\nIn contrast, there have been times when financial conditions tightened even as the FOMC reduced short-term interest rates.  For example, consider what happened during the heart of the financial crisis.  Even as the FOMC lowered the federal funds rate in the fall of 2008—eventually hitting its effective lower bound that December—credit spreads widened sharply, household and business loan underwriting standards tightened sharply, liquidity in many financial markets dried up, and the U.S. stock market plummeted.  Financial conditions tightened despite the aggressive easing of monetary policy during this period.\n\nThere are many explanations for why the relationship between the federal funds rate and financial conditions is so variable.  Without being exhaustive, let me highlight three.  First, animal spirits in financial markets wax and wane, pushing asset values up or down in a manner that can more than offset the effects of movements in short-term interest rates.  The movements in many financial markets following last year’s presidential election are a notable example of this phenomenon.  Second, domestic financial conditions are influenced by what happens abroad.  If the monetary policy of major U.S. trading partners becomes easier relative to policy in the United States, then it could lead to a dollar appreciation that would weigh on U.S. trade performance, all else equal.  Third, financial instability and stress can cause risk-averse investors to increase their demand for safe assets.  This can push up risk premia and credit spreads, and push down stock prices—which can more than offset the impact of an easier monetary policy. \n\nDivergences between short-term interest rates and financial conditions often appear to be larger and more persistent in the United States than in most other advanced economies.  There are several reasons for this.  First, the U.S. financial system depends less on its banking system to intermediate financial flows than in other countries.  The share of credit supplied by the banking sector fluctuates around 50 percent in the United States, which is much lower than in the euro area, Japan and the United Kingdom (Exhibit 2).  Second, in contrast to most other countries, U.S. residential housing is financed mainly by 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, rather than—as is the case in most other countries—adjustable-rate mortgages with rates that much more closely track their central banks’ short-term interest rate targets.  Third, the equity market plays a much more important role in the United States than elsewhere.  The total market capitalization of the U.S. equity market is considerably higher than in the euro area and Japan (Exhibit 3).\n\nBecause the evolution of financial conditions can diverge from the path of the federal funds rate, financial conditions need to be carefully considered in the conduct of monetary policy.  However, I want to reiterate that what we care about is not financial conditions themselves, but rather their influence on economic activity.  Accordingly, we should care much more about longer-term movements in financial conditions than about higher-frequency, transitory movements.  That is because behavior in firms and households will be influenced much more by how financial conditions evolve over time, rather than by where they happen to be at a particular moment.\n\nTo emphasize this point, let me give two contrasting examples—one where financial conditions moved sharply but not persistently, and another where financial conditions moved systematically over a longer time period.  We will see that it is the long-lived movements that have the largest influence on the economic outlook. \n\nFor the first example, consider the U.S. equity market in 1987.  The S&P 500 index began the year at 242, shot up to a peak of 337 in August (an increase of almost 40 percent) and plummeted to a trough of 225 in October (a fall of 33 percent).  When the stock market fell more than 20 percent on October 19th—which came to be known as “Black Monday”—many feared that the decline would lead to a recession.  After all, that crash was the largest-ever one-day percentage decline of the U.S. stock market.  But, no recession occurred.  Importantly, households sustained their spending despite the sharp decline in household wealth.  This happened, in part, because household spending had not yet responded much to the sharp run-up in stock prices earlier in the year, so consumer spending turned out to be relatively insensitive to the market’s sharp reversal.  In addition, the damage from the sharp stock market decline was mitigated by the Federal Reserve’s commitment “to serve as a source of liquidity to support the economic and financial system.”5\n\nA contrasting example is the sharp appreciation of the dollar that began in 1978 and reached a peak in March 1985.  The persistent strength of the dollar had a significant negative consequence for U.S. trade performance.  Our trade deficit widened sharply in 1985 and 1986, which contributed to the sharp slowdown in U.S. manufacturing production growth—and a milder slowdown in GDP growth—over this period. \n\nThis leads to an important question:  When should the FOMC take changes in financial conditions into consideration in its conduct of monetary policy?  I don’t think there is a simple answer.  Financial conditions matter in influencing the economic outlook, but so do many other factors.  It is true that monitoring financial conditions can help improve the effectiveness of the policy decision-making process.  However, as I hope is clear from my previous examples, there is no mechanical link between policy rates and financial conditions that monetary policymakers can systematically rely upon to set policy.\n\nAnother key question is what one should focus on in assessing financial conditions.  Again, I don’t think there is a simple answer, as the significance of any particular aspect of changes in financial conditions depends on the economic circumstances and environment.  In the early- to mid-2000s, the combination of looser mortgage underwriting practices and home equity withdrawal were major financial factors contributing to that economic expansion.  The subsequent housing crash was exacerbated by the sharp reversals of mortgage lending standards and home equity withdrawal, which together contributed to the severity of the Great Recession.  Today, these factors seem less important because lending practices in the housing market have been much more stable in recent years.\n\nThe importance and complexity of financial conditions also underscore the need for caution in following any mechanical monetary policy rule.  For example, the most well-known rule—the Taylor Rule—does not explicitly take financial conditions into account in terms of its monetary policy prescription.  In that rule, the federal funds rate depends only on the deviations of output from its potential and inflation from the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent objective, and on the level of the real short-term interest rate consistent with a neutral stance of monetary policy.  Because the interactions can shift between financial conditions and the economic outlook—as well as between financial conditions and the federal funds rate—the absence of financial conditions in this rule can cause it to perform poorly as a guide for monetary policy.\n\nAs a case in point, consider what the 1999 variant of the Taylor Rule indicated as the appropriate monetary policy setting in September 2008, just prior to the failure of Lehman Brothers.  In the Bluebook document that the Federal Reserve Board staff prepared for the September 2008 FOMC meeting, the 1999 Taylor Rule called for a federal funds rate setting of 3.5 percent for the fourth quarter of 2008, well above the 2 percent setting at the time of the meeting.  The standard 1993 Taylor Rule—which puts a greater weight on inflation—called for an even higher federal funds rate target of 4.1 percent.  Given the rapid deterioration in financial conditions, instead of following the prescription from these rules, the FOMC cut the federal funds rate rapidly over the next three months, pushing the federal funds rate down to a range of 0 to a quarter of 1 percent by year-end.\n\nConsistent with this episode, such rules often perform poorly at times when the economic environment and outlook are rapidly changing.  This is one important reason why I do not support proposals that would require the Federal Reserve to explain to Congress whenever its federal funds rate target deviates from a particular prescriptive monetary policy rule.  As Federal Reserve Chair Yellen explained in a recent speech, not only are there a plethora of rules to choose from, but following any monetary policy rule in a perfunctory manner would likely lead to inappropriate monetary policy at times—especially during economic turning points when the outlook is changing rapidly.6 \n\nAlso, requiring the Federal Reserve Chair to explain frequently why the FOMC had deviated from a particular rule would unduly impinge on the ability of the FOMC to conduct monetary policy in a manner insulated from short-term political considerations.  Of course, Congress has the right to hear from the Federal Reserve about its conduct of U.S. monetary policy.  There are already several opportunities, including regular testimony and semiannual monetary policy reports.  If Congress desires, such communications could become more frequent or enhanced.  But, my point is that these exchanges should not be triggered by deviations from a mechanical rule.  And, of course, I feel that this is especially true for a rule that does not account for financial conditions. \n\nNow that I have expounded upon the importance of financial conditions, I would like to discuss their implications for the current stance of U.S. monetary policy.  As I see it, there were a number of factors behind the FOMC’s decision in March to take another step in gradually removing accommodation by raising the federal funds rate target by 25 basis points to a range of three quarters of a percent to 1 percent. \n\nMost importantly, the economy has continued to grow modestly above its sustainable long-term pace.  This has led to continued, sturdy monthly job gains and a gradual diminution of the amount of slack in the U.S. labor market.  Forward-looking indicators foreshadow a continuation of this trend.  For example, household and business confidence has increased markedly over the past few months. \n\nThe economic outlook abroad also appears to have brightened.  Growth has picked up in Europe. Commodity prices have risen, reducing the pressure on emerging market economies that are major commodity exporters.  There are still significant uncertainties and risks abroad, but overall, these risks seem significantly lower than they were a year ago. \n\nInflation has moved closer to our 2 percent longer-run objective.  Headline inflation on a year-over-year basis has moved up in the past few months as the sharp declines in energy prices in late 2015 and early 2016 have fallen out of the calculation.  Core inflation—which ignores the more volatile movements in energy and food prices—also has moved slightly higher.  Over the 12 months through January 2017, the core personal consumption expenditure deflator has risen at about 1.75 percent, up from 1.6 percent a year earlier.  Thus, I have become more confident that inflation will stabilize around the FOMC’s objective over the medium term. \n\nWhile there is still considerable uncertainty about fiscal policy and its potential contribution to economic activity, it seems likely that it will shift over time to a more stimulative setting.  Consequently, it appears that the risks for both economic growth and inflation over the medium to longer term may be shifting gradually to the upside. \n\nEven after the latest increase, the federal funds rate target range at three quarters of a percent to 1 percent is still unusually low in both nominal and inflation-adjusted terms.  While most FOMC participants judge the equilibrium short-term real interest rate that is consistent with a neutral monetary policy to be low—perhaps in a range of 0 to 1 percent—this is still above the current inflation-adjusted federal funds rate.  In such circumstances, it seems appropriate to scale back monetary policy accommodation gradually in order to reduce the risk of the economy overheating, and to avoid a significant inflation overshoot in the medium term. \n\nFinally, prior to the March FOMC meeting, financial conditions were generally easing rather than becoming tighter, even as the FOMC raised its policy rate in December and market participants increasingly expected further policy tightening in the coming year.  Between the December and March FOMC meetings, U.S. equity prices rose by about 4 percent, and credit spreads, such as those for high-yield bonds, narrowed.  Long-term yields and the trade-weighted dollar were little changed over this period.\n\nWilliam McChesney Martin, the ninth chair of the FOMC, once famously opined that the Federal Reserve is “in the position of the chaperone who has ordered the punch bowl removed just when the party was really warming up.”  I don’t think we are removing the punch bowl, yet.  We’re just adding a bit more fruit juice. \n\nBefore I conclude, let me make a few comments about the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  As you are undoubtedly aware, the Federal Reserve dramatically expanded the size of its balance sheet during and following the financial crisis to provide accommodation to support the economy when short-term interest rates were constrained by their effective lower bound.  Currently, we are reinvesting maturing Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities repayments to keep the size of the balance sheet generally stable.  We have said that we plan to continue this policy of reinvestment until we are well along in the process of normalizing the level of the federal funds rate.  As the FOMC has raised the federal funds rate three times, this process seems to have proceeded smoothly so far, prompting renewed interest in our balance sheet and reinvestment policy.\n\nThe anticipation of and actual announcement by the FOMC of changes in reinvestment policy is likely to push up longer-term interest rates and tighten financial conditions somewhat, just as the earlier purchases pushed down long-term interest rates.  To what extent is difficult to judge.  Presumably, financial conditions would tighten by more if we were to end reinvestments earlier and more abruptly.  This suggests a better course may be to taper reinvestments gradually and predictably. \n\nIn addition, because changes in reinvestment policy will likely tighten financial conditions, we will have to take this into account in our interest rate decisions.  My view is that reducing the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and raising short-term interest rates are two different, yet related, ways of removing monetary policy accommodation.  Therefore, I would expect that, when we begin to end reinvestment, we will have to consider the implications for the appropriate short-term interest rate trajectory.\n\nIn conclusion, financial conditions are important.  They matter enormously to monetary policy because their movements can often diverge from the trajectory of short-term rates, and because they affect economic activity and the economic outlook.  While it is essential to account for financial conditions appropriately in conducting monetary policy, it is also important not to overreact to every short-term wiggle in financial markets.  In addition, it is important to remember that the policy goal is not the level of financial conditions per se, but the achievement of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate objectives.  Sometimes, that will be consistent with easing financial conditions, and at other times, it will be consistent with tighter financial conditions.  At all times, our focus will be on achieving our objectives of maximum sustainable employment and price stability, thereby supporting the livelihoods of households and businesses throughout the United States.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions."

        "content": "Dr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nPresident Dudley, can you please share with us the purpose of your trip here today to Queens?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nSo, there are 12 Federal Reserve Banks around the United States, and one of them is the Federal Reserve Bank in New York that sits downtown in Manhattan, and near Wall Street. Our Second District consists of New York, Northern New Jersey, Fairfield County, Connecticut, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Haven't gotten to the Virgin Islands yet.\n\nAs part of our Mission, we want to represent the communities in our District, and so four times a year, I get on the road, and I go out to visit people, to find out what's really happening on the ground. It's meeting with businesses, meeting with people from educational institutions, going to visit manufacturing facilities, community development organizations.\n\nIt's really designed to do two things. One, explain sort of a little bit of what we do – like for example there, in the introduction, talking about this BIS. What the heck is the BIS?  Well, BIS is a bank for central banks that sits in Basel, Switzerland.  In fact, what did I do last weekend?  Well, I was in Basel, Switzerland, at the BIS. This is where central bankers get together from across the world, exchange information with one another.\n\nSo, the first thing is to explain ourselves to people in the community. Because the Federal Reserve is pretty mysterious in terms of – when I went to grad school even, I wasn't really sure again what the Federal Reserve was. Had to be explained to me.\n\nThe second thing we do in the community, and this is the more important piece, is to really learn what's going on, on the ground, in the community. What's happening in terms of businesses – are they successful? If they're having trouble, what are the reasons for the trouble? Do they have access to the credit? Can they find people with the job skills they need to support their businesses?  What are the challenges in the community, in terms of education, in terms of transportation?\n\nQueens, one of the issues is that if you're not located near a subway line, it's pretty hard to get around in Queens, and that has pretty significant implications for people's ability to get to and from work, which is important in terms of economic development.\n\nAnother issue is the affordability of housing. Queens is actually doing quite well. If you look at the employment growth in Queens over the last few years, it's been very strong. Just like New York City as a whole. But one of the consequences of economic development can be gentrification, where richer people move in and they make housing less affordable for people who have been living here for a much longer period of time.\n\nSo, all these type of issues that we talk about when we visit. And oftentimes I get some personal stories and anecdotes that are actually pretty valuable to me in terms of how I think about how the economy is operating and what we need to do as the Federal Reserve in terms of how we set monetary policy.\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank you. The economy is coming out of a serious crisis that started in 2008. From your perspective, where do you see the greatest growth in the economy right now?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, the good news is the economy is actually in a pretty good place right now. Not for everybody, but if you think about the unemployment rate today, it's 4.7%, which is pretty close to what we think is full employment. You could probably push that unemployment rate even lower, but if you did, you'd probably start to have an inflation problem. So, that would not be something that you could sustain over the longer term. The Federal Reserve has two missions: maximum sustainable employment and price stability. And so we're trying to find that balance. Right now we're doing pretty well. We're pretty close to both our objectives. In fact, if you could tell me that we could just stay here for the next 20 or 30 years, I would be very happy with that.\n\nSo, things are going pretty well. What's driving the economy? I think in the local economy in Queens, it's very dependent on transportation, very high level of transportation employment, in part because of La Guardia and JFK. Those industries are doing quite well.\n\nTourism is important to this region, so New York City has really benefited from tourism. And the fact that people want to live in cities now as opposed to live in suburbs or more rural areas is also helping a lot.\n\nIn terms of actual employment in this area, you have the transportation component.  Healthcare is also very, very important. A lot of uncertainties on that front. Maybe we'll get some resolution of some of those uncertainties today. Also business and professional services is a very important driver of growth in this area.\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank you. From your perspective, which sector do you think is actually propelling the growth?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I think – one thing that's been really good for New York City over the last few years, it's become much more diversified as an economy. In the old days, New York City was sort of rise and fall, depending on how the financial services industry was doing, especially the securities industry. And what's happened in the last few years is the securities industry employment has been pretty flat. And the securities industry, while they're making some money, it's not at all as profitable as it was back in the days of 2005, 2006, before the great financial crisis. Now that profitability was a little bit ephemeral because it was not built on a strong foundation.\n\nSince then, the city I think has become a lot more diversified. Tourism has become more important. Technology – the technology sector really is about the same size now as the financial services sector. We still see pretty good manufacturing. The hollowing out of the city in terms of manufacturing seems to be over. In fact, manufacturing employment is actually doing pretty well in the city, in certain parts of Queens. It's actually quite supportive.\n\nSo, in general, it's a pretty positive story. The city still faces challenges. I think one of the most significant ones is going to be: how does the change in the conversation about trade and immigration affect people's willingness to visit New York City?\n\nI think there is some prospect that international tourism to New York could decline over the next few years, and that would be something that would hurt the hospitality industry in New York City. So, that's something that we're going to have to keep a close eye on.\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank you. The Dodd-Frank Act, which is often referred to as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, placed regulations on the financial industry. I wanted to ask you, do you think the removal of the Dodd-Frank Act would be productive for the economy? And if so, why?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nSo removal of the Dodd-Frank Act be productive for the economy? I'm going to give you a little bit more nuanced answer. I don't think it's a question of either the Dodd-Frank Act or no Dodd-Frank Act. I certainly wouldn't want to go back to the world we were in 2006, 2007, because that financial system led to the worst financial crisis that we've had since the Great Depression, and as you know the economy suffered greatly. The unemployment rate climbed over 10%. So clearly, we don't want to go back to that.\n\nBut at the same time, is the Dodd-Frank Act as it exists today perfect? I doubt it. What I tell people is we really want to be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. What we want is a system where we have banks with adequate capital, adequate liquidity – number one – so the probability of a large bank failing is a lot lower today than it was back in 2006 and 2007.\n\nNumber two, we want a system where if a large bank were to get into difficulty, we have the ability to resolve it in a way that it doesn't threaten to take down the rest of the financial system.\n\nThe Federal Reserve intervened in a very unusual and aggressive way in 2008 because the failure of a large financial institution was threatening to basically push the U.S. economy into a Great Depression. We didn't do it because we wanted to save the institution. We did it because we wanted to save the economy. We don't want to be in that situation again. So we need to have a regime in place, so if a large institution were to fail, it doesn't threaten to take down the rest of the financial system.\n\nAnd the third thing we need is we need to a financial system that's robust and resilient to bad economies, to financial stress. One of the things that the Dodd-Frank Act does that I think is important is it mandates central clearing of derivatives activity. Now derivatives activities are things where corporations exchange interest rate payments, fixed income interest rate payments for floating interest rate payments, et cetera. During the pre-Dodd-Frank era, most of these were firm-to-firm. Financial institution to financial institution. Now they're all cleared centrally. This is a tremendous innovation because it reduces the amount of risk in the financial system. The Dodd-Frank Act has one of its chapters or titles all dedicated to the clearing of over-the-counter derivatives.\n\nAnd finally, we have some entities called financial market infrastructures. What is a financial market infrastructure? So, let's say I buy a stock, and then that stock has to be transferred to me through some entity that actually clears and settles that stock transaction. The entity that actually manages that stock transaction – you selling stock to me, or me selling stock to you – that's a financial market utility. They have to be robust as well. And one of the things the Dodd-Frank Act does is it allows the Federal Reserve to have some oversight capacity to make sure that those financial market utilities are sound.\n\nSo, there are definitely things that could be changed. I think you could definitely relax the regulatory burden on smaller banking organizations because I don't think they pose a systemic threat to the U.S. financial system. I think you could take a look at certain regulations like the Volcker Rule to see if they could be administered in a less aggressive way.\n\nSo, it's not in my mind a question of Dodd-Frank or no-Dodd-Frank. I think it's a question of better financial reform legislation.\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank you. Just like you said, the economy is picking up now, and at the same time, we are experiencing a kind of upward trend in interest rates. I wanted to ask you, do you think the current movement in  interest rates is politically-driven? If not, what is the business reason for the upward movement?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, if I said it was politically-driven, that would be an unbelievable news story. Because we try to stay as apolitical as possible and set monetary policy, not based on the political winds and fortunes of the different political parties, but what we think is appropriate to keep the economy on an even-keel and to achieve our goals of maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability. So, we're basically trying to set the level of interest rates in a way that will keep the economy close to our objective of full employment, with relatively stable price. It's 2% inflation.\n\nThat's sort of where we are right now. So, why are we raising interest rates a little bit?  First of all, I would point out that the interest rate rise that we've had in place has been extraordinarily gradual. The short-term interest rates that the Federal Reserve sets, the federal funds rate, that range is three-quarters of a percent to 1%. If you lived like I did through the 1970s and '80s, you realize that that's an extraordinarily low level of interest rates.\n\nMonetary policy over the last few years has been what we think is accommodative. In other words, it's been supporting economic activity. As we get closer to full employment, we want to make monetary policy a little bit less accommodative because if monetary policy were too accommodative, we would actually get an inflation problem over time. Then the Federal Reserve would have to slam on the brakes, we'd have a recession, people would be thrown out of work. Not a good situation.\n\nSo, the idea is to have an economy that moves in a smooth way. And so by taking out a little bit of that accommodation, moving up interest rates just a little bit, we think it's more likely that we'll achieve a soft landing and keep the economy about where it is today in terms of employment. So, it's a delicate adjustment. It's not something that's very harsh. We think it's appropriate and necessary. But I think the economy will be able to adjust to this just fine.\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank you. Sometime ago, I think that was 2012, 2013, I took some students to the Federal Reserve Bank. And you do have annual events at the Fed which I attend every year, often in March. A question that came to mind is that the students were very excited when they went to the Federal Reserve Bank. The question I wanted to ask you is what are the skills required to work at the Fed?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, there's lots of different parts of the Federal Reserve. There isn't one particular skill. There's a lot of economists because we think about how the economy is working and operating and the conduct of monetary policy. There's a lot of people that work on overseeing banks. Supervision is one of our biggest groups. We have a lot of bank supervisors who typically get degrees in public policy or business, and come and work at the Federal Reserve and become bank examiners.\n\nWe have a lot of people in the Markets Group, which I ran prior to becoming President of the Bank. We monitor the markets. We talk to market participants to understand what's going on.\n\nWe execute monetary policy on behalf of the Federal Reserve System.  We have people that are in Operational Risk, who assess risk. We have people who manage custody accounts for foreign and central banks. We have about $3 trillion of foreign central bank assets in custody at the New York Fed.\n\nWe have the largest holdings of gold in the world in the vault of the New York Fed, so someone has to protect that. We have a number of people in the Protection and Law Enforcement Services that make sure that the gold is safe regardless of what one of the Die Hard movies implied, that it could be robbed pretty easily. That's not the case.\n\nWhen I became the President of the Bank, I actually rented out the Die Hard movie because I wanted to see if it was plausible – the way they stole the gold from the New York Fed, and it turned out that they sort of glossed over that. There was apparently supposedly a subway line that was really close to the gold vault, and so they just had to punch a little hole in the subway tunnel and the gold vault was right there. But it doesn't really actually work that way. So sorry.\n\nMy point is, there's a lot of different activities that we do. Obviously in education, Bachelor's or Master's, is sort of I think probably a good place to start. The more analytical skills you can get in terms of math and economics and business – those are the skills that are very attractive to us. Training and public policy because that's what we do, is very important.\n\nIt's a great place to work. The typical New York Fed employee joins the Bank and says I'm going to be here two, three years. And then the next stop I ask them how long have you been here? “25, 30 years.”  Which I think means that it has – it's a good place to work. Reasonable pay, good benefits  But mainly, a great culture. People are very committed to what we do.  People have a strong sense of mission and integrity.\n\nI tell people that one of the great things about working at the New York Fed is there's no moral ambiguity at any day about why I'm going to work. We're there to serve the public interest, and that's a nice thing to think about every day when you go to the office.  You don't have to think about, well, why am I doing this exactly?  Well, we're trying to serve the public interest, keep the economy on an even-keel, and execute on our mission as the New York Fed.\n\nThe New York Fed is a little different than the other Reserve Banks because we're really the operational arm of the Federal Reserve System for many, many different things. So, it's sort of interesting.  We do policy, and we do operations. Very unlike most central banks around the world, where the policy and operations are all in headquarters down in Washington. In the Federal Reserve it's split, with the New York Fed doing a lot of the operational activities of the Federal Reserve System. It's a pretty cool place. Check us out!\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nI will surely do. The Federal Reserve has been around since 1913. How would you compare the 1929 Depression to that of 2008?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, very different outcome. In 1929, the stock market crash led to a widespread banking panic, where people basically tried to get their money out of banks because they were afraid the banks were going to fail. And of course in the process of trying to pull all those deposits out of the banks, the banks didn't have enough money, so a lot of banks actually did fail. And in fact, in 1933, FDR declared a national banking holiday where all the banks were closed for a period of time.\n\nFortunately, we didn't get to that point during this crisis. The Federal Reserve, and many other people around the world, pulled out all the stops to avoid the collapse of the banking system, of the financial system, and as a consequence, we had a bad recession – worst recession that we've had since in the post-WWII period, but far short of what happened in the Great Depression.\n\nThe Great Depression, the unemployment rate I think climbed above 20%. The price level, the level of prices dropped by about I think a third. So it was a really absolutely horrendous experience. If you talk to someone like my mother, my mom's 94 years old, she was a relatively young girl during the Depression. She still remembers and talks about it, just incredibly searing. People were out of work for really until WWII. The Crash started in 1929, the U.S. economy really didn't get back to close to full employment, only in the 1940s, and because of WWII.\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank you.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nSo this time was quite a bit different, thank God.\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nI'm sure that everybody here invests. And they are ... students in economics and finance. We talk about investment. I wanted to shed light or your perspective on how the fixed income investor performed in the last eight years, please.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, the fixed income market has been a good place to be because, basically, interest rates  have been generally coming down, if you look at long-term bond yields. So, we would like to look at the government debt issue by the U.S. Treasury. Ten-year government debt is trading today about 2.4% which is pretty low, and credit spreads have narrowed over that period. So, fixed income has been a pretty good place to be invested in over the last 8 years.\n\nSame thing with U.S. equity market, though, for that matter. If you bought the U.S. equity market at the very bottom in 2009, it's more than tripled in price since then. As an investor, you've done pretty well if you've stayed invested through that entire period.\n\nNow, I would expect that fixed income investing is going to be less attractive going forward because interest rates still are at a very, very low level. So, some of the gains that people have seen in fixed income have been really prices going up because interest rates were declining. And I think that you're probably not going to see prices going up a lot because interest rates are declining going forward.\n\nSo I would guess most likely, most people think that short-term interest rates will gradually rise over the next couple of years. That certainly is what the Federal Open Market Committee expects, and as that happens people generally expect that longer-term interest rates will eventually rise. And so that means that there will probably be a little bit less good returns in the fixed income market compared to the last 8 years.\n\nWe've had a bull market in fixed income really going back to 1982. My first house I ever bought, mortgage rates at the time were 17%. They're now around 4%. I got financing from the seller. I got a 12% mortgage. I thought it was a really good deal. So now mortgage rates are around 4%. We've had a very, very long bull market in fixed income. People are debating now whether this is the end of that bull market or it's going to go on for a little bit further. So, we'll see.\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank you. If you look at the global economy, it's looking buoyant now. Also the national economy, which is the United States economy, is looking buoyant now. I wanted to ask you, looking at the United States, which region do you think is growing at the moment?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI would answer that question, which region is growing at the moment, in two ways. Regionally, in terms of the geography of the United States, it's really the South and West, and this has been a pattern for a long time, that there has been sort of a migration to – when they invented air‑conditioning, they made the South a lot more attractive to people. And so the South and West have been growing faster than the country as a whole for a very long time.\n\nNow there are some pockets of weakness there because we had a big collapse in energy prices, so some of the areas in the South and West that are very dependent on the energy sector are probably a little bit less robust. So, that's the first way I would describe it.\n\nThe second way I would describe it is rural/suburban/urban. There's been a tremendous shift in people's enthusiasm for living in big cities, and that's really one reason why New York City is doing so well because people basically want to live in the big cities, especially younger people. And so you're seeing the cities, especially the big cities, outperform the smaller cities and outperform the rural areas. New York City has actually been very much a beneficiary of this, relative to many other parts of the country.\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank you.  I'm sure now that we may have questions from the audience. To my right we have – a stand there.  And to my left, we have another.  If you have questions, please, students, colleagues?  It's time for Q&A. If you have any questions, please.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nGood morning, and welcome to your college. Although the Die Hard scenario may not work in reality, cybercrime has been a greater threat to the financial system. And recently, it was reported that North Korea was able to illegally transfer monies from a Bangladesh account at the Fed to an account at the Philippines. What's being done to protect funds that are held not only at the Fed but also at other financial institutions?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, that's a good question. Cybersecurity is a really important activity for us at the Fed. We want to make sure that not only is the Federal Reserve well-protected but also the banks that we supervise are also well-protected against cyber-risk.\n\nThis is a particularly hard risk to evaluate on any given day because we're trying to improve our defenses, but the bad guys are also improving their capabilities. So, we do a lot of different activities within the bank to make sure that we're secure from a cyber-perspective. For example, we phish our employees, and we send them emails that sort of suggest that if you'll click on this, and if you click on this you get a message from our Information Technology Department that you've been phished and you learn that you have to be a lot more careful about what you actually click on. That's important because a threat can both come from outside, but it can also come from within.\n\nThe other thing we've done is we're spending a lot of time internationally to try to make the financial system safer by making sure that the payment executer, their systems are secure. So, think of that as Bangladesh. That the messenger, who the person is who's transmitting the payment, this is SWIFT, is secure. And the receiver.  So in this case, the New York Fed is secure.  That goes for anybody who is executing payments.  It doesn't have to be Bangladesh, through the SWIFT, to the New York Fed. It's anybody executing a payment through any payment medium to any receiver.\n\nThe thing that we're trying to work on internationally is to try to make sure that everyone understands their responsibilities in that chain. So, it's really important that the person executing the payment, that their facilities are secured.\n\nWhat seemed to be the case in the Bangladesh situation was their facilities were not secured, so someone executed a payment that looked completely authentic through the SWIFT pipes to the New York Fed. It was an authentic payment – it looked like an authentic payment when we executed on some of those payments – not all of those payments.\n\nSo, we need to make sure that that first leg is buttoned up, and also we need to make sure that everyone understands their responsibility along that chain.\n\nSo, this is something that we take very seriously. We're working also with the institutions that we interact with. One of the things that the Federal Reserve runs – the New York Fed runs – is called FedWire, so if you have to wire money, if someone needs the money immediately, you can wire that through a New York clearinghouse in the CHIPS system, or you can wire that through FedWire. It's really important that – and FedWire interacts with lots of institutions around the country. We need to make sure that all those institutions that interact with FedWire also have their systems secured.\n\nSo, it's a big issue. We spend a lot of resources on it. We're going to continue to spend a lot of resources on it. We take it very seriously.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nWe welcome you to Jamaica. I'd just like to ask, there have been some other regulatory measures taken over the past couple of decades. As I understand it, they repealed the Glass-Steagall Act and also passed the Sarbanes-Oxley laws. Would you say that these things had any effect on the 2008 recession, or has Congress been more responsible than not for the recession?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI think that – well, I think Sarbanes-Oxley is actually – was basically about good financial reporting, good financial accounting. Accountability of the people at the top of the house for all the financial records and statements. The Federal Reserve is not subject by law to Sarbanes-Oxley, but we actually follow Sarbanes-Oxley nevertheless. We think it's good governance. So, I would say Sarbanes-Oxley generally makes the system safer because it makes it much harder for people to – it really deters fraud and manipulation of financial accounts in a way that I think is very, very positive.\n\nThe second part was?\n\nAudience Member:\n\nGlass-Steagall?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nGlass-Steagall. Well, I think that – the Glass-Steagall Act was an act that was passed in the 1930s that basically said that you could either be in commercial banking or you could be in investment banking. You couldn't be in both. And so this is an act that basically forced the Morgan Company to separate into Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan. Now what happened was many years later in the 1980s, I actually was involved with this because I was working at J.P. Morgan at the time, people started to say, “Look, if I'm a big commercial bank like J.P. Morgan, I'm losing all my customers who are going to the securities market. I need to follow my customers, but I can't because of Glass-Steagall.” And they found that there was a loophole, Section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act basically said that you can't be principally-engaged in securities activities. So, it meant that you could be engaged but just as long as it wasn't principally-engaged. And so this is a little loophole that a number of firms managed to exploit. And so they actually found a way to get into some securities activities, and then Glass-Steagall Act a number of years later was actually formally repealed because the firms were already, essentially, in the business.\n\nNow my own personal view is that I don't think the Glass-Steagall Act had much to do with the great financial crisis. If you look at the firms that got into great difficulty, at the earliest stages – Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, AIG – they really had nothing to do with Glass-Steagall because they really weren't banks and securities firms. They were securities firms and insurance companies. My own view is that the Glass-Steagall Act was not a major – the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act was not a major factor behind the Great Recession and the financial crisis.\n\nNow this is something that people probably would debate. Other people might have somewhat different views. You could repeal the Glass-Steagall Act again. I think it would obviously require a lot of financial corporate restructuring because there are a lot of firms in the U.S. that are in both the securities business and the commercial banking business today. I think that there are links between those two businesses. It probably helps those firms, satisfy the demands of their large corporate clients more easily than if you had to separate them into separate entities. But you could do it.\n\nOne thing I would say if you do do it, you better have a mechanism in place to make sure that those large securities firms that are left actually are well-regulated, well-capitalized, have enough liquidity, and have access to a lender of last-resort.\n\nOne of the problems that we had in the financial crisis is there wasn't a good method to lend to securities firms. By law, the Federal Reserve discount window – this is the facility that we have open to commercial banks – were not allowed to have that discount window open to securities firms.\n\nSo, in the crisis, we had to do extraordinary lending activities to securities firms. We need a better lender of last resort backstop for securities firms.\n\nIf you decide to repeal Glass-Steagall and separate commercial banks from securities firms, that's not something that I would recommend, but if you were to do that, make sure you have a way of backstopping the securities industry, too, so if a big securities firm gets in trouble it doesn't threaten the entire financial system.\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank you.  I'll be expecting questions from students, too.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nNot a student.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nBut you’re a student of something, right?\n\nAudience Member:\n\nMy concern is MWBEs. I feel that the racist element within our capitalization has not allowed us to participate in the economy on an equal level by having access to capital. The government's asking for 30% on major projects. For example, at LaGuardia, we have a $5 billion project. Contracts to facilitate that will probably be too high for many minority and women-owned businesses. Therefore, if we don't have access to capital, we won't even be allowed to bid on that work. And that's when fraud comes in, when a major contractor proposes to a small contractor, “I'll help you out if you bid, give you give me a number on this contract.”\n\nIf we had access to capital, we then bid. I'd like you to take a look at what the New York State Department of School Construction Authorities are doing. They worked out a system that allows us to bid on major contracts. If you took a look at that, because we need some ingenious new ways of financing. We don't have a black bank per se. There were 94 black banks across this country, now there's only 23. Some of the banks that's going out of business, I don't think is kosher, but something has to be done to allow us to participate in the marketplace.\n\nOn your material, you have listed some organizations within the minority community that you deal with. I'd like to recommend some additional organizations. For example, the ones that are primarily interested in the flow of contracts and development. I'm not in a prime area of what's going on today. In addition, for example, we have here at York College one of the best small business development sectors.  They're number one in the state a couple of times.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI agree with your concern. Is there a question?\n\nAudience Member:\n\nYes, what can you do to set up financial resources for minority and women-owned businesses to become involved in the economy? Whether that's establishing a bank – we've asked the controller to control this, let him set up a funding source for us using pension funds, and there's a way to do that, if you look at it. But we need you to be an advocate for us in that area, but help us come up with an ingenious idea for how we can develop access to capital.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I certainly agree with the importance of access to capital, and I certainly agree with you in the importance of having minority work enterprises have the ability to participate in economic development and bidding on contracts. We don't have the legal authority to do anything direct, but we have a lot of convening authority. One thing that we do do is we do continuing workshops, conferences, symposiums. We've had a number of things with small businesses on how small businesses can get access to credit, how small businesses can figure out how to export their goods and services.\n\nAnd so this is something that for you to talk to our regional development people on how we could be helpful. Because we definitely think this is an important issue, and we definitely want to be helpful and use the resources we have, both in terms of research and our convening power, to try to take this forward. So, let's have a conversation.\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nNext question please. I'm still expecting a student.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nGood morning. My question will be in the form of appeal. This is for small homeowners. Recently, the Fed announced about increasing the interest rate. But I don't know how long the Federal Open Markets Operations committee will actually sit for that. But what I'm appealing for is for that period to be extended. We just came out from an economic recession. Thank God we didn't get to the depression part of that business cycle. Many homeowners basically, particularly small homeowners, they are struggling to fix their credits. And because their credit scores are so terrible, they cannot refinance, and therefore they are locked in with high interest rates – we are talking about thousands and thousands of dollars. Banks are making money off them because they cannot refinance.\n\nIf you go ahead and increase that interest rates when they are still struggling to pay what they have now, I think many will lose their homes. So, my appeal is for the Fed to please, let the current interest rates stay – give a little bit more room for small homeowners to fix their credit scores so that they can refinance. Thank you.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, first thing I would say is the level of interest rates are still pretty darn low. The federal fund rate, that's the rate we target, is three-quarters of a percent to 1%. And we've only raised interest rates twice since the end of the Recession eight years ago. It's important to recognize that the trajectory has been very, very shallow because we are aware of some of the issues that you're raising and we're trying to get the balance right.\n\nEnd of the day, what are we trying to accomplish? We want to have an economy that can grow for a long time. So, we want to keep the economy in balance growing at a rate that is sustainable over the medium- to longer-run. What we're trying to do is find that level of interest rates that's just right. Now we recognize that anytime that we change interest rates, it's going to help some people, and it's going to hurt other people. So, on the other side of the story are all the people, like my mom, who are savers and they're unhappy. They've been unhappy for the last eight years because interest rates have been so low. So, we're trying to get that balance right.\n\nI think we've been pretty cautious in terms of how we've been raising interest rates because of some of the concerns that you raise. Janet Yellen, who's the Chair of the Federal Reserve, has talked about the headwinds that have been slowing down the U.S. economy.\n\nOne of those headwinds is exactly what you're talking about, the fact that people are locked into homes because their homes are either underwater, the value of the homes are less than the value of their mortgages, or because their credit-rating was damaged during the Financial Crisis because people lost their jobs, and so their credit-rating was impaired. And so that's really the reason why we've been so delicate and so slow in actually raising interest rates. It's partly exactly what you're talking about.\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank you.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nGood morning. Thank you for being here. One of the things that we've been looking at here in Southeast Queens is the establishment of CDFIs, additional CDFIs to support the growth and the access to capital of small businesses. Would you comment a little bit about what do you see as the future of CDFIs going forward in this economic climate, and any suggestions that you would have to support us in doing that? Thank you.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I guess I sort of think of CDFIs as doing God's work in some ways because the hardest thing for someone with a really good idea and starting a small business is to get that initial bit of capital to establish a track record. Banks, as you know, are reluctant to lend to start‑up businesses because the firms don't have collateral to pledge against the loans, and they don't have a track record of experience. So CDFIs are really the group that can provide that lifeblood to small business enterprises at the start-up stage.\n\nIt's also very resource-intensive to lend to small businesses, so the economics don't work very well for a for-profit company. So, I'm a big fan of CDFIs. We think it's really an important avenue, especially in less developed areas where getting a small business well-established can create local jobs which can create a virtuous circle in terms of economic development. So, this is something that we definitely want to encourage over time, and anything that we can do to be helpful – we try to partner with the CFI community to be helpful, in terms of providing data, information. We have a lot of very detailed information about the local economies and we can be, I think, helpful in actually providing some information and support to the CDFIs.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nGood morning. I want to thank you for coming here and sharing some information with us.  I have two specific questions I wanted to ask. A lot of us, we've already talked about access to capital, which is a huge thing.  For those who don't know, Sen. Sanders is the ranking Democrat on the Banking Committee for New York State. My first question is how do we establish a better relationship with your organization in an effort to – we can get this information that you have and its resources on the grassroot level? And my second question is –\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nAll you have to do is give me your card afterwards.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nOh, okay. My second question is we've done an assessment of the economic state of Southeast Queens, Sen. Sanders' office, and a majority of our residents here are considered banked and under-banked. My question to you is a lot of ... especially for – we have a huge population of Millennials, we're looking to purchase homes in our area. A lot of us make under $50,000 and probably have some problems with credit.\n\nBut my question with the home buyers programs is there a way, or how can we have a conversation about increasing the matching funds because the highest that the rates for the federal home buyers program is 4:1. And we want to talk about how we can get that to 10:1 so it can help, it can match the demographics, economic demographics, of our community, so people can start receiving in tangible resources like purchasing a home with the resources that they have.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI'm not an expert in the issue of how much money you need to match. I don't think I can speak to that directly. But clearly getting people the resources so that they can become homeowners in a prudent way is a good thing. And what we saw in the financial crisis, in the run-up to the financial crisis, is that we were giving credit to people in an imprudent way. I think as long as it can be done in a prudent way, where people understand the responsibilities, have the income to pay on their mortgages, I think it's something that we definitely want to encourage.\n\nSo, what I would suggest is give me your card, and I'll give it to the right people in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and we'll have a conversation and see what we can do. This is not something that we could probably be involved in directly, as a funding provider. Legally, we don't have the authority.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is pretty powerful in terms of monetary policy. But our mandate is also pretty narrow in terms of what we're allowed to do.\n\nI remember during the financial crisis, people were coming in and saying, “you should do this, you should do that, you should do that.”  And most of the things that they were suggesting that we do were some things that were not actually allowed by the Federal Reserve Act that was passed back in 1913. Come talk to us and we will see what we can do.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nGreetings, good morning to – or good afternoon to you and your guest. Now while it would be interesting to speak of why the New York Fed and the Atlanta Fed are differing on their economic forecasts, that might be interesting, but I want to speak to something far more local. Far more local.\n\nThis community, and communities like this, were devastated, were ravaged – and I could use a stronger word – during the financial crisis of 2008.  We've never recovered from this. The black community lost approximately 50% of its wealth in four years. 50% of the wealth accumulated from slavery till today lost in four years. No one, of course, was ever jailed for these things, no one was ever – very little punishment, if anything, was done. I understand that while you may want to do or feel strongly it's not the purview of the Federal Reserve – I understand that.\n\nUsing your researchers at Liberty and other parts of your organization, I need to know what laws that I can put on the books to protect communities like this. We're about to go back into another phase of exotic mortgage-lending, and I will humbly differ with you on Glass-Steagall, of course.\n\nWe're about to go into another phase of exotic lending. They call it exotic lending. We call it predatory lending, and we pay for it. We can expect that again. What laws can I – what do we need to put on the books to protect communities like this? Liberty and other organizations, research organizations, that you guys have can come up with some of these things. I look forward to speaking with you later today.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nOkay. On this issue of predatory lending, I mean this is – I think you raised a very good point, and this is something that we actually heard about small business lending when we were up I think in the Bronx awhile back, where, basically, people have these come-ons to lend money to small business, and it seems attractive on the surface, but it turns out that the actual rate of interest that people are paying is prohibitive to be able to run a successful business. So, I think the predatory lending thing is a completely important issue that we do need to address. Obviously, the Small Business Administration can play a role in this. I think we would certainly be interested in having a conversation about it, because I think it is a really serious issue.\n\nI mean one of the problems, just more broadly, is financial literacy in the United States. Part of the reason that predatory lending can work is because people don't really have a good idea –they don't know enough about the financial system, about the economy, about what's a good value or not. They just say, “What's my payment going to be next month?” And if the payment is low, they don't look at the fine print about what the payment is going to be not next month, but a year from now, or two years from now. And that's how they get into a great deal of difficulty. So, I think not just working on the predatory loans writ narrow, but also on the issue of financial literacy writ large, I think colleges like this one can do a lot in making sure that when people graduate, they have a level of financial literacy that can help them navigate through the world.\n\nThe number of scams that are out there now are just extraordinary. Sometimes people will pretend that they're me and they send letterhead out supposedly from me telling people that if they were to send a bunch of money to someone, the New York Fed would release a check for a large amount of money, and people actually believe this. Now, my advice to people always is if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. But unfortunately people offer these things, and it's really quite tragic, because the people who fall for these things often are people that are not so sophisticated, of not so large means, and they can't afford to be sending money to fraudsters hoping that there might be a big prize from the Federal Reserve Bank in New York or somewhere else down the road, which of course there's not.\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank you. I think we have – I just have time to take only one more question.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nActually, the question I wanted to ask is for the students. Why do you refuse to ask questions?\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nSomebody wants to ask now.  Thank you.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nHow are you, sir? My question for you today is what are, or were, your daily habits or rituals that helped you get to the level of success that you have today?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nOooh, I can't think of any rituals. Habits. I guess what I would say is I've always just tried to learn more. So basically, it's always about trying to find opportunity to, what I call, grow my human capital. So, I think – my view of the way to success is find a job that's interesting to you, because you need that passion about what you do. If you don't have passion about what you do, it's not going to feel like a lot of fun and you're not going to do it with a great enthusiasm. So, if it's not fun and you're not enthusiastic, you're probably not going to do very well at it. So, the first thing is to find something that you're really liking, you're enthusiastic about.\n\nAnd two, basically find something where you can continue to learn. If you get into a job and you've been in the job for a long time and you're doing the same thing, you've sort of mastered the job, then it's probably time to move on.\n\nI was at a large investment bank for many years – 20 years to be exact – and I decided at the end of 2005 that I was going to retire because there was no job that they had that they would give me that I wanted. And vice versa. There was no job I wanted that they would give me. So it was sort of, I can keep doing my same job of being the Chief U.S. Economist and continue to do that for a great many, many years. But at that point I felt I was no longer learning so much. I was bringing in a little bit less enthusiasm to the job, and so, it was time for a change. I didn't know what that change was, and after I announced I was retiring, Tim Geithner, who was the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at the time, called me up. First conversation was, he asked me if I'd be an advisor at the New York Fed. I said, “Tim, that's a great job. I really like you, I'd love to work with you, but what do I do the 39 other hours of the week besides advise you?” And then a couple of weeks or months later, I can't remember exactly how long it was, he called up again and said, “Well, how would you like to come to the New York Fed and run the Markets Group?” Markets Group at the time had about 230 employees. They executed monetary policy for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  I wasn't sure I was going to have any time to talk to Tim Geithner in that role. And so I said yes immediately.\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nYou have a question? Are you a student?\n\nAudience Member:\n\nYes, I am.\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank you.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nI am a student.  Thank you so much for taking the time and speaking to us. My question was, being from a younger generation, I'm definitely interested in investing, but what would be your biggest piece of advice. Especially for us, the younger generation, with a limited budget, what would you – how should we go about it?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I don't think I've ever been asked for investing advice before now. It's probably not appropriate for the Federal Reserve to give out investing advice. I think the first thing is you want to get knowledgeable. I think the first thing is you want to get some knowledge before you start to invest. And recognize that there are no quick, get-rich-quick schemes. If something seems to be too good to be true, it probably is.\n\nI remember when I got out of college, back in 1974, a long time ago, I decided – I had this very small amount of money that my great-grandmother left to me, I think it was $2,000, and I decided I was going to go out and invest. And I have to say, at the beginning, I didn't really know what I was doing. But I read a lot of books and I got really pretty well educated. There's a lot of good books in the market, and I think you can actually educate yourself. And if you do that I think then you can start to gingerly start to invest. And you'll learn as you go. It's a long journey. I've learned things as I invested over the years. Now I don't do anything, but I'm sort of retired from investing in my current role. But part of that I found that I kept learning it over a very long period of time. So, it wasn't like the journey of knowledge was over at any point in time. But first thing is to find a really good book on investing, and read that. When I did it, I read probably five or ten different books, and that gave me a good sort of basis for thinking about investing. But before investing, make sure you have that $400 that you need in case an emergency comes up.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nThank you.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nThank you.\n\nDr. Olajide Oladipo:\n\nWith two good questions from our students, I think I'm comfortable now to bring the discussion to an end."

        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/dud170321a",
        "content": "First, let me thank Governor Carney, the Lord Chief Justice, and Dame Colette for including me in today’s discussion.  It is an honor to be here.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nI also want to thank the Banking Standards Board for its important work on improving standards of conduct in financial services.  The effects of this work will, I think, be felt throughout the industry, not just in the City of London. \n\nWe learned from the LIBOR and FX scandals that poor conduct can proliferate quickly throughout the global marketplace.  That’s because short-term thinking—maxing out this year’s compensation bonus or this quarter’s accounting profits—is a catalyst for poor conduct.  In contrast, good conduct may take longer to catch on.  Good conduct depends on a longer-term frame of reference.  It is building a viable career that one can be proud of, and, at the firm level, building franchise value and reputation that takes decades to accomplish.  In both cases, though, the same enabling mechanism is at work: culture. \n\nCulture—within a firm or across an industry—is not determined primarily by rules or laws, though certainly rules and laws can amplify good or bad attributes.  Culture comprises, instead, what people observe and do, resulting in accepted and mostly unspoken norms.  Mostly, people look for what succeeds and what does not, and they try to align themselves with the former.\n\nIf we want to improve culture and conduct, we need to start by being realists about human behavior.  At the New York Fed’s culture conference last October, Dame Minouche Shafik observed pragmatically that an end to all misconduct is not the goal of reform.  There will always be a few bad apples.  Rather, the goals should be far fewer instances of misconduct and far less scope, magnitude and duration when such misconduct inevitably occurs.\n\nI submit that the best way to keep problems small is to encourage a culture that spots issues and raises concerns early.  In my view, the most dangerous type of culture in finance occurs when people see something wrong but do not say something. \n\nI think back to the chat room transcripts from the LIBOR and FX scandals.  The way traders communicated so openly about their manipulation of markets makes it hard to imagine that others in their firms did not know what was happening.  So, why didn’t those people say something?\n\nThere are understandable, human tendencies that can cause each of us to avoid rocking the boat.  People want to be team players.2   Those behavioral traits can be amplified through a firm’s culture, which can weigh on one’s willingness to do the right thing.  This is, unfortunately, what seems to have occurred at Wells Fargo, one of the largest retail banks in the United States.  Whether to obtain a bonus or simply to keep a job, employees felt they had to keep quiet and meet sales targets despite the cost to customers.3\n\nSo, how do you change a culture where silence leads to misconduct?  I will offer two ideas that might help and one idea that will not. \n\nHere is what will not work: Merely telling your employees to speak up.  Cultures do not change simply by exhortation.  Eloquent speeches, a well-phrased value statement, and an annual requirement to acknowledge the code of conduct are just not sufficient.\n\nThat’s the easy one.  The two ideas that might work are harder. \n\nFirst, managers have to lead by example.  Senior executives must be seen within the firm to expect and respect challenges, and in turn must challenge ideas themselves.  And, they have to explain difficult decisions to their employees—sharing not only the news of what they have done, but why.  More important, mid-level managers have to do the same.  Of course, mid-level managers will not generally behave that way unless they see their senior leadership setting the example.\n\nSecond, if your organization values people when they raise their hand, your incentives have to reflect that.  Employees who speak up should be recognized.  The courage it takes to speak up, despite the perceived costs, should be counted as a very positive factor in evaluations.  And, where raising one’s hand has saved the firm’s money and reputation by avoiding or keeping a problem small, that action should be rewarded.\n\nIt’s only natural for an economist like me to consider the issue of unintended consequences.  One that comes to mind is creating a culture of distrust and suspicion, where everyone looking over his or her shoulder.  That would be unfortunate and costly.  But, I think it is more likely that a different culture will result. Instead, talented and conscientious people will be happy to remain at a firm or in the industry because their personal and professional values are well aligned.  Such employees will feel relief that they can speak up without fear of reprisal, and they can enjoy a clear conscience for having done the right thing.  There is significant value in being able to sleep well at night.\n\nMoreover, being receptive to diverse and dissenting views will likely yield better results. It is in the industry’s self-interest to deter silence, not only because money will be saved on fines not incurred for misconduct, but also because better ideas will be brought to the table.  I believe that business performance will benefit from having a culture in which people feel empowered to speak up.\n\nLet me give you a few examples from my own experience at the New York Fed.\n\nI want employees to speak up.  That’s why, at the start of my tenure as president, I made it clear that I wanted the “best idea to win,” regardless of where it originated or whether it contradicted something that I thought.  In some instances, that will require people to admit mistakes.  In that regard, I have to set the example that we all make mistakes, and that recognizing and addressing them head on—and, importantly, learning from them—is the best approach. \n\nA few years ago we created a new group at the New York Fed called Integrated Policy Analysis.  Its purpose was to consolidate teams from many parts of the organization to develop a more integrated view of the economic and financial environment to help inform our policy responsibilities.  I was a strong advocate for the idea.  But, after two years of effort, it became clear to me and others that it was not working as well as we had hoped.  There were a lot of reasons for that, and in the end we dissolved the group and reassigned the work and staff.  I let our employees know that I took a calculated risk and it didn’t work out.  By doing this, I aimed to show that when things do not go as planned, the best approach is to address it, not to be silent.  I hope that, when our people are confronted with disappointing results in their work, they will do the same.\n\nI mentioned earlier that we also need to reform incentives in order to encourage people to speak up.  This is hard.  I’ll share with you some of the change we have made at the New York Fed, recognizing that we do not have a monopoly on good ideas, nor can we claim to have a perfect culture.\n\nNone of these ideas is a panacea.  And, I know that we have not yet achieved our goal: a culture in which employees perceive that, by raising their hands and challenging what may be an orthodoxy or conventional wisdom, they are contributing to the mission of the New York Fed.  I hope, however, that with the right incentives and good leadership models, we can move closer to that ideal state: an organization characterized by fresh ideas and open dialogue.  \n\nAt conferences like these, we tend to focus on the cost of misconduct. But, getting rid of scandals should not be the sole reason for changing culture.4 The public expects more from the financial sector than a lack of another financial crisis or scandal.  The industry would do well to listen to Baroness Onora O’Neill: Think about your purpose.5   What are you for?  Surely, no one would answer that question by saying, “We’re for a lack of misconduct.”\n\nRather, the financial services industry should support a well-functioning, growing economy, reflecting the interests of all its stakeholders.  Banking in particular should provide critical intermediation services—the economic infrastructure that allows businesses to grow, families to save and invest, and standards of living to improve over generations for as broad a cross section of people as possible.  When society prospers, the financial services industry prospers, too.  Creating a culture that encourages and rewards diversity of thought, perspective, and experience is one means by which the industry can both do good and do well at the same time. \n\nThank you for your kind attention."

        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/dud170321",
        "content": "Thank you for your kind welcome.\n\nI am grateful to the Banking Standards Board for organizing this meeting.  For several years, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Banking Standards Board have each worked to improve culture within the financial services industry in the world’s two most important financial centers.  I would like to especially thank Sir Richard Lambert, Dame Colette Bowe, Alison Cottrell, and the members of their team—all of whom have traveled several times to New York to attend meetings and conferences on this issue of culture.  I am very pleased to have the opportunity to reciprocate and to join you today in London.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nThis morning, I would like to highlight three issues that are critical to improving culture within the financial services industry:\n\nI will then conclude by offering some thoughts on why good culture is critical to success in financial services. \n\nLet us start with purpose because it is a prerequisite for the other two.  Baroness Onora O’Neill, a member of the Banking Standards Board, was the keynote speaker at the New York Fed’s third culture conference, held in October 2016.  Her message to the audience of senior bankers and regulators was a challenge to think about the purpose of their organizations.  Namely, what are you for?2\n\nI believe the question “what are you for” can be a litmus test for a firm confronted with challenges.  Let me give you just one example, from the Salz Review in 2013.  Employees in the eight divisions of Barclays were asked to state their core values.  Three of the eight divisions did not rank “customer service” as a core value.  Two of these divisions were retail lines—UK retail banks and the Barclays credit card.  The third was the firm’s African subsidiary, which also offered retail banking services.3  \n\nMy intent here is not to pick on Barclays. Indeed, the firm should be commended for first commissioning and then publishing the Salz Review—Sir David Walker set an example of leadership in his candor and transparency.  Instead, my purpose is to make the point: If you cannot answer the question “what are you for,” or if your answers do not make sense in light of your business, then it is time to re-examine your purpose. \n\nFor any bank, a statement of purpose should emphasize sustainable success, not short-run profit.  This is because of the many important roles that banks play in the economy.  They are critical intermediaries between savers and borrowers; they provide essential infrastructure; they support well-functioning financial markets; and they act as custodians of our wealth.  These functions require long-term commitment.  They should not be erratic or ephemeral.  The economy needs a steady supply of competent, honest, and reliable banking services in order to function.  That is why any bank should emphasize the long term over the short term.\n\nAfter purpose comes measurement.  In the context of culture, however, calculating particular metrics is less important than the goals of such measurement.  The first goal is to assess how you are doing compared to what you have set out to do.  In other words, are you fulfilling your purpose?  The second goal is to assess how you stack up against your peers.  In both ways, measurement provides critical benchmarking, without which firms and the industry cannot assess whether they are making progress. \n\nSince the beginning of our work on culture, my colleagues and I have recognized that measurement is indispensable to improving bank culture.  We have not been alone in this view. \n\nAt the New York Fed’s first conference on cultural reform, in October 2014, Sir David Walker encouraged banking leaders to measure behavior within their firms in order to promote accountability.  Pursuing this theme, several panelists addressed the use of measurement as a corporate governance tool.  They argued that standardized metrics could help quantify the judgment and behavior of individual employees, making the behavioral components of annual performance reviews more objective.  The same information could also aid a firm’s senior leaders in assessing the effectiveness of their communications about how the firm conducts its business.  For my part, I encouraged the industry to collaborate on a common culture survey that could serve as a benchmark for behavior.  I also agreed with Sir David that measurement and accountability should not be decoupled.4\n\nLast week, the BSB published the results of its industry-wide benchmarking survey on culture.  This is a critical step forward in the industry’s effort to get better data on how firms are doing on cultural issues, to identify areas for improvement, and to demonstrate a public commitment to improvement.  Several facets of the BSB’s report struck me as particularly significant. \n\nFirst, in addition to creating a benchmarking survey—which generated approximately 28,000 responses—the BSB conducted focus groups with junior employees and interviews with senior leaders to add depth to what the survey results indicated.  That represents a significant investment of time by the BSB and those who participated in the qualitative review.  That commitment is essential for understanding the context and meaning of responses within individual firms.\n\nSecond, the survey asked respondents to agree or disagree with a number of statements.  Those statements were direct and cut to the core of cultural issues in banking.  Some of the standouts, in my view, included:\n\nThird, the results suggest that the respondents did not pull their punches.  Nearly 30 percent answered that they would be worried about negative consequences if they raised concerns at work.  That shows, perhaps more than any other finding, that there is still a long way to go in creating a culture for long-term success in banking.  In addition, approximately one quarter of employees did not affirmatively agree that their organization puts customers at the center of business decisions.  That is also of concern if we want an industry that is sustainable over the long term.\n\nI encourage you to read the BSB’s report, if you haven’t already.  And let me emphasize that the report is not intended as a cudgel or to assign blame.  Rather, as I see it, the report gives the industry an opportunity to improve against a benchmark.  Again, I want to acknowledge the BSB’s contribution and thank them for all their work.\n\nNow the burden shifts from the BSB to you, the industry.  What will you do with these results?  We all want to see progress on culture and behavior.  How will you—both within firms and collectively—move the needle on culture and behavior over the next few years? \n\nI suggest that if you want next year’s results to be better than this year’s, you might start by focusing on incentives. \n\nAs I have argued before, incentives shape behavior, and behavior drives culture.  If you want a culture that will support your long-term business strategy, you need to align incentives with the behaviors that will sustain your business over the long haul.6\n\nIncentives—compensation and promotion, in particular—are powerful tools for communicating the conduct and culture you desire for your firm.  Of course, the cultures of firms can and should vary.  But, the culture of every bank should share a common theme: stewardship—a word that implies professional care, exercised year after year for the benefit of the firm and its stakeholders.  A commitment to the long term must be at the core of banking.  Incentives within a firm should support that goal, not undermine it.\n\nMy emphasis on incentives is not new, but it bears repeating.  Bad incentives were a key contributing factor in the financial crisis.  In the United States, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission concluded that “Compensation systems—designed in an environment of cheap money, intense competition, and light regulation—too often rewarded the quick deal, the short-term gain—without proper consideration of long-term consequences.”7   This theme applied to all levels of banking organizations.  One notable example was mortgage brokers, who were paid based on the volume of loans they generated, not their quality.8\n\nThe financial crisis came to a head in the fall of 2008.  Fast forward eight years to the fall of 2016.  Wells Fargo’s chairman and CEO resigned after regulators uncovered what appeared to be widespread fraud in the retail bank.  Compensation, once again, seems to be at the center of a scandal.  Neighborhood bankers were paid based on the volume of new accounts opened, apparently with utter disregard for whether customers wanted them or even knew about them.  And, like mortgage brokers in the early 2000s, it appears that job security depended almost exclusively on meeting targets, regardless of how those targets were met.  There was a serious mismatch between the values Wells Fargo espoused and the incentives that Wells Fargo employed.9  \n\nInvestigations into what happened at Wells Fargo are continuing, so I will wait before drawing more definitive conclusions.  For now, though, it is sufficient to note the powerful role—for good or for bad—that incentives can play in an organization.  I understand that making progress on culture is difficult.  But, if you want the next round of metrics to look better than the last, use a powerful lever—use incentives. \n\nToday’s discussions—here at Mansion House and later at the Bank of England—are evidence that the issue of culture is important to the private and public sectors alike.  We have to keep working on this.  The public sector must continue to shine a spotlight on the issue, and the industry must continue to demonstrate that it is taking responsibility for its culture.  And, culture cannot be a subject that only receives attention because bad conduct has occurred in the recent past. \n\nI am convinced that a good or ethical culture that is reflected in your firm’s strategy, decision-making processes, and products is also in your economic best interest, for a number of reasons:\n\nGood culture is, in short, a necessary condition for the long-term success of individual firms.  Therefore, members of the industry must be good stewards and should seek to make progress on reforming culture in the near term. \n\nThank you for your kind attention, and thank you again to the Banking Standards Board for inviting me to speak and to the Lord Mayor for hosting.  I would be happy to answer your questions."

        "title": "Reforming Culture and Conduct in the Financial Services Industry: How Can Lawyers Help?",
        "date": "Mar 8, 2017",
        "speaker": "Unknown",
        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/hel170308",
        "content": "Thank you, Nancy, for your invitation and for organizing this discussion. It is an honor to join this session of the Chirelstein Colloquium.\n\nMy topic today is culture in financial services. Reform of culture has been a priority for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for several years. Many of the observations I will share today are based on that work. But, as always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nMy thesis is that lawyers should play important roles at financial firms as advisors not just on law—what is legal or illegal—but also on culture. As I see it, culture is distinct from both public law and private rules. That doesn't mean that culture is completely independent of either. Indeed, a group's culture often informs and is informed by its rules. But culture is a powerful force in its own right.\n\nI do not mean to imply that a lawyer should rush headlong into areas best reserved for organizational psychologists. A lawyer's advice on culture should always be grounded in law, and lawyers should be cautious in venturing too far afield from their core expertise and fundamental role as advisors on the law.\n\nThat said, an in-house lawyer is well-suited to assess and help improve an organization's culture. A lawyer can supply a degree of both independence and insight that is required to understand an organization's culture without becoming captive to that culture.  Independence comes, in part, from a lawyer's training, independent code of ethics, and reporting responsibilities that ultimately go up to the board of directors. Insight comes from building a trusted relationship with a client over time.\n\nA lawyer's aim should be what Gillian Tett from the Financial Times has described as the viewpoint of the \"insider-outsider,\" someone with both understanding and objectivity.2 Ben Heineman, a recent speaker at this Colloquium and a former general counsel of General Electric, has another take on the same objective: A lawyer is both a partner and a guardian. There is some inherent tension between an insider's and an outsider's perspective, between being a partner and a guardian. But, as Heineman argues, \"these potentially paradoxical ideas can co-exist and, indeed, can be complementary.\"3\n\nSome might argue that this is an expansive view of a lawyer's role. I believe it is the appropriate view. A lawyer who is both a partner and a guardian—an insider and an outsider—can greatly benefit a financial services firm. You might apply the same thinking to any number of contexts and clients. But since my experience is largely with banks, I'll stick with what I know.4\n\nLet me first explain what I mean by culture. I'll then address the relationship between culture and law, and how lawyers can contribute to a culture that respects law. Finally, I'll propose an idea for a new law to address a cultural problem, and ask for your input on how the idea might be refined. I promised Nancy I would wrap up with plenty of time for questions.\n\nFor the purposes of our discussion today, I will use the word \"culture\" to mean the shared norms within an organization that are evidenced through behavior. A strong culture is highly effective at transmitting norms within a group and helping newcomers assimilate to those norms. We each observe our environments. Often—sometimes too often—we conform our conduct to what we see around us. As one of the New York Fed's summer interns put it, \"Culture is best understood as something that makes people feel safe and confident in their inherited understanding of the world.\"\n\nThis insight suggests why culture can sometimes cause trouble. An organization's culture may yield too high a degree of adherence—or a dangerous lack of questioning. Culture can sometimes lead to a conclusion that an action is right because it appears to be accepted or ordinary. After all, if conduct is accepted, it must be safe and alright—right?\n\nThis assumption, and others like it, are frequently at the core of enforcement investigations by the Federal Reserve. If you were to ask \"Why do people commit financial crimes,\" it might be tempting to respond, simply, \"They're greedy.\" Some people are greedy. And some of those people commit financial crimes. In my opinion, however, the reasons why bankers break the law are varied and complex. And, in many instances, misconduct is related to an organization's culture.\n\nLet's face it: In figuring out how to behave on an everyday basis, people may not always refer to laws or rules or regulations or policies. They may not always consult their in-house counsel or their compliance department. I know that probably sounds terrible for me to say, particularly as a lawyer. Make no mistake, I place the highest value on our laws and regulations. When I first joined the Fed, a colleague passed along a saying that he learned while in law school: Laws are the wise restraints that keep us free. I firmly believe that. Looking at the role of culture is not the same thing as excusing personal responsibility. There is no \"culture excuse\" when people break the law. I want to be clear on this. Laws and regulations matter. As a supervisor, adherence to laws and regulations is my top priority.\n\nBut I'm also a realist.\n\nI think of a new, junior banker—fresh out of school, or otherwise new to an organization. In my experience, junior bankers typically don't consult \"the law\" for guidance on a day-to-day basis. They take their cues from their peers and immediate supervisors. That's how they discover what is important—to gauge the difference between what is right and what is wrong, or between what is successful and unsuccessful. A newly-minted trader, for example, may not realize what's wrong with a particular activity, especially if the conduct has the appearance of an accepted, ordinary, or highly rewarded industry practice. More often than not, it's an organization's culture—the shared norms conveyed through conduct—that provides instruction.\n\nAnother noteworthy aspect of cultures at some banks—again, observed in hindsight through enforcement investigations—is that they do not tolerate failure. A banker with a track record of success (academically, athletically, or professionally) may feel pressure to misstate performance indicators to preserve a self-image of success or to keep a job. The employment structures within many a firm—for example, the tournament-style systems of job retention—may contribute to this. In any year, a bank may part ways with anyone in the bottom ten or twenty percent of a peer group, based on financial performance. These bankers operate in an environment that does not tolerate failure—even when failure is guaranteed by design for a large percentage of the workers. That's dangerous for several reasons: It can encourage cutting corners. And it discourages escalation of problems.5\n\nIn other cases, a misguided desire to help teammates may have contributed to misconduct. This is also a feature of culture. Teamwork and employee loyalty are, no doubt, worthy principles. But in the LIBOR and foreign exchange scandals, for example, loyalty to friends and teammates became a reason for manipulating market benchmarks. This behavior may indicate a culture in which the company or a team is somehow viewed as above the law, or at least apart from it, as long as you are a high performer. That's a dangerous mindset for a bank, which exists in part to provide the intermediation activities on which other participants in the economy depend.6\n\nThe rate-rigging scandals involving LIBOR and foreign exchange markets are further instructive about culture in two respects. First, cultures may exist within an industry in ways that are not firm-specific. In some instances, the allegiances of the traders involved in the LIBOR and FX scandals ran toward one another, almost as a guild of traders, rather than to their employers or customers.  Loyalty to the guild may have provided a sense of security and belonging.  Second, any organization may have multiple cultures or subcultures. Indeed, most people who worked at banks involved in benchmark manipulation did not participate in misconduct.\n\nIt can be tempting to define away problems like LIBOR and foreign exchange manipulation as isolated to a \"rogue unit.\" Anytime someone uses the term \"rogue,\" as in \"rogue trading unit\" or even \"rogue trader,\" the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. Yes, it is sometimes the case that one or more people simply \"go rogue.\" But it may be more likely that a firm has a more systemic problem on its hands. Branding a behavior as \"rogue\" does not explain why it occurred. Even if the scope of misconduct appears limited to a few people, an underlying reason—such misaligned incentives or loyalties—may apply more broadly within an organization, and may lead to problems elsewhere. Without an understanding of root causes, how can you know that a particular behavior is random, or that its breadth will remain limited? Or, to borrow a common metaphor—and we lawyers love to use metaphors—how can you know that you are dealing with a single bad apple or a bad barrel?\n\nLet me make one final observation about culture. At the risk of stating the obvious, every organization has a culture. It may be embraced or eschewed, nurtured or ignored. I think an organization that ignores culture does so at its own peril. Or, more optimistically, culture can be a powerful tool for achieving the firm's goals.\n\nWhat, then, does law have to do with culture? And what role can lawyers play?\n\nAs I mentioned, having a law on the books does not mean people will follow it. And being a lawyer does not always mean clients will listen to you. Some believe the solution is more laws. (Only the enlightened few argue for more lawyers.) But as New York Fed President Bill Dudley has argued, rules are “necessary, but not sufficient.\"7 It is impossible to create a rule for every situation. Gaps in a regulatory regime are inevitable. Groups will develop shared norms for filling those gaps. So, for that reason alone, we need to look to culture as well as laws for solutions.\n\nIn addition, the pace of rulemaking is not always commensurate with the pace of rule breaking. Focusing exclusively on rulemaking creates a risk of fighting last year's scandal.\n\nWhat's more, laws are good at setting the outer limit of acceptable behavior—what is clearly prohibited. They are less frequently and less reliably used to define what is optimal or what is good.\n\nFinally, a regime dependent on bright-line rules may, strangely, entice people to walk right up to the edge of a rule—or to find creative ways around the rules. A proliferation of technical rules prompts us to ask what we can do, not what we should do.\n\nIn short, law can shape culture and conduct—but not always as intended. I worry that lawyers in financial firms are too often asked by clients, in effect, \"How close to the legal line can I get?\" Or maybe they're instructed, \"Just tell me if this is legal or illegal, not what I should do.\" Worse, I worry that lawyers, intentionally or not, enable this kind of thinking. Lawyers are certainly not immune from cultural influences.\n\nAnd recall my observation earlier about culture: Repeated behavior becomes a shared norm. Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, has a few views about this. He has described two particularly pernicious forms of culture, based on cases handled by his office: the culture of minimalism and the culture of formalism. In a minimalist culture, an organization does the \"least amount possible to be in some kind of compliance with rules.\"8 In a formalist culture, technical requirements take precedence over principles. Either way, it's only a matter of time before these cultures lead people to cross the line. When this happens, CEOs have to explain themselves to people like Preet Bharara—and, if you're a banker, to me and my colleagues.\n\nIn my view, lawyers must push against minimalism and formalism. They must argue not just for what is legal, but for what is sound and right. Lawyers should play a role as a part of the conscience of the organization.\n\nNow, this is not a new concept. I certainly didn't invent it. And you've heard recently from a leading expert in the field—Ben Heineman. I state it here because it is so important to what we as lawyers do.\n\nGood in-house counsel will combine traits of outsiders and insiders that can produce keen insights and contribute to successful results. As outsiders, lawyers are trained to spot issues and, in the common law tradition, to reason by analogy and common sense. We also learn some actual law—not necessarily a whole lot, but enough to be able to learn more as we go.\n\nI also think that lawyers are natural questioners—a self-selecting bunch. Questioners tend not to be yes-men or yes-women, afraid of rocking the boat. One of my predecessors at New York Fed put it this way, writing to the Legal Department in 1964: Lawyers should be \"neither obstreperous nor mousy.\"9\n\nWe also enjoy professional standards that help resolve difficult ethical questions. Indeed, the rules that govern our profession expressly permit advice on non-legal matters.10  \n\nLawyers can also, and should, function as trusted insiders and advisors. We're partners in addition to guardians. In-house counsel, in particular, are able to build longstanding relationships with their clients. We get to know their businesses. We have opportunities to build trust and confidence, which can make us that much more effective and credible when we raise questions.\n\nRetained by the organization, we are invited to take an enterprise-wide view, not a narrow view of a particular business line.11 At large financial firms, lawyers advise most divisions, if not all of them. Lawyers can leverage their broad insights across a financial services firm. They can discuss among themselves how the conduct they observe in one division compares with the conduct observed by colleagues in another division.\n\nIn this way, lawyers can identify and help combat troublesome silos of behavior—to help firm management identify whether they have an issue in an isolated \"rogue\" unit, or a more systemic problem. For a junior lawyer, this might mean escalating up when she spots issues. For a more senior lawyer, this might mean engaging with peers in management—including the chief risk officer or chief compliance officer—to help ensure that issues are identified and addressed.\n\nAll this is to say, lawyers should support their clients with a healthy skepticism. When a CEO chuckles over the ethical lapses at another firm, assuming that such a thing could never happen at her firm, that is precisely the moment to step in, and challenge, and ask how the CEO gains this comfort. Are her assumptions are well-founded? Supervisors at the Federal Reserve call this \"effective challenge.\"12 Lawyers can look out for effective challenge at all levels of an organization. They themselves should also be effective challengers.\n\nIn addition to challenging a CEO's schadenfreude when another firm experiences trouble, here are some categories of questions that, while not strictly legal, a good lawyer should ask. Each of these categories requires both the understanding of an insider and the independence of an outsider.\n\nThe first category is structure. Does a particular way of organizing a business run the risk of unacceptable conflicts of interest? Are roles within a group clearly defined? Are they over-defined, so that employees lose sight of the big picture? Are control functions participating in key decisions? Are lawyers themselves siloed within separate business units? Are they consulted early, or only at the last minute? To quote again from one of my predecessors at the New York Fed: \"Please let us get in on the take-off, if you expect us to be in on the crash landing.\"13\n\nThe second category is communication. Are principles and tasks made clear? Are problems escalated early or belatedly? How is bad news relayed and received—both from employees to managers, and vice versa? Note that, in both directions, communications pass through a middle layer. So, you might also ask how intermediaries influence the content of communications.  In addition, do control areas communicate and coordinate with each other? Do lawyers share with each other and with other control areas such as compliance and risk officers about what they are seeing?\n\nThe third category is leadership—in particular, what has been called \"character at the top.\"14 Do the messages from senior leaders match their actions? Do senior leaders set an example of encouraging questions? Do they seek out feedback and input? Do senior leaders ask questions themselves and demonstrate openness to alternative ideas? How do they handle the inevitable mistakes that will occur in large organizations? Do they learn from them?\n\nA fourth category, which I think is particularly important, is how the firm treats employees who escalate issues. This is where I am focusing many of my efforts as general counsel at the New York Fed. For an institution with so many public responsibilities—and, indeed, for any institution that wants to be effective over the long run—it is mission-critical that employees feel comfortable escalating potential problems and challenging accepted points of view. Do we seek out a diversity of viewpoints? If not, how do we know it the best idea wins? This is not always easy or natural. I think human beings have a natural bias to seek out others who have similar views to our own. But this only results in group-think. So, I encourage you to pay close attention to how your organization encourages escalation and responds to dissenting or divergent views.\n\nNone of these questions are strictly, or even largely, legal. But, paying attention to these issues is good legal risk management—part of being both a partner and a guardian. In my view, organizations with good structures, communication, and leadership—and, perhaps above all, organizations that welcome divergent views and promote raising one's hand—will, in my opinion, have fewer legal problems.\"\n\nOf course, lawyers have to be mindful of the possible consequences, however unintended, that the partner/guardian or insider/outsider model may create. Lawyers may be perceived as giving authoritative advice on issues for which they should be only one of many voices. While lawyers may have a monopoly on rendering legal advice, they do not have a monopoly on advising as to what is \"right.\" \"We are not priests or rabbis.\"15 And as lawyers become more vocal on ethical issues, there is a risk that tough ethical questions may be routinely outsourced to the lawyers. I get nervous when I hear a client say, \"I'm just doing this because the lawyers told me to.\" This would be the opposite of the result that I would like to see: that business lines feel more responsible and are held more accountable for their own ethics and conduct. Finally, the more lawyers engage on non-legal questions, the more doubtful the privileged nature of communications with them becomes—and, an uncertain privilege, is not much of a privilege at all.\n\nI believe these risks are manageable. They require careful attention, but not anything extraordinary. On the question of privilege, for example, client confidences should be protected from discovery if lawyers ground their advice in legal matters. And, by the way, this is an important check against straying too far from our expertise. Our advice is more valuable and more credible when we speak from our training, knowledge, and experience.\n\nMoreover, in my view, the benefits far outweigh any possible risks. Paying attention to structure, communication, leadership, and escalation in a firm provides opportunities to spot potential misconduct early and intervene before problems grow even larger. Lawyers can also serve as models in this regard, prompting non-lawyer colleagues to respond in kind. Remember, culture is contagious.\n\nBeyond spotting issues, lawyers must be proactive in solving problems, even ones that are of their own making. I will give you an example that we are struggling with today. To extend the metaphor I introduced earlier, we often call this the \"rolling bad apple problem.\"\n\nWhen an employee moves from one bank to another, it is standard practice for an employer to provide the equivalent of name, rank, and serial number. You can blame lawyers for this. I mentioned earlier that lawyers are natural questioners. I think we're also genetically averse to risk. Providing information about employees creates a risk. For example, if the information provided is incorrect, there is a risk of a lawsuit for defamation or tortious interference—to name just two possible causes of action. And, regardless of the merit of a claim, it is very difficult to get employment cases dismissed at the pleadings stage. Most suits go to discovery, which is expensive. So, lawyers advise clients that the best option is to say as little as possible.\n\nHere's the problem with that legal advice. It's been observed since the financial crisis that some of the persons most directly responsible for misconduct were not first-time offenders. They had records of misconduct at previous employers. But their former employers did not share information about misconduct with their prospective employers. Thus, a banker with a record of misconduct could move from firm to firm, spreading bad practices. Remember what I said earlier: Culture is contagious. Bad behavior can travel with a banker across firms, but his official record does not travel with him. What's legally advisable for one organization results in a collective action problem for all firms.\n\nNew York Fed President Bill Dudley spotted this problem a few years ago and proposed a database of banker misconduct to address the issue.16  In theory, a change in the law could establish two duties for financial institutions: a duty to report misconduct and a duty to check the database before an employee begins work.\n\nThe duty to report should arise when a covered employee leaves a firm in connection with some misconduct, defined to include not only violations of law, but also bank policies that govern behavior. Banks must explain the circumstances of misconduct in reasonable detail, such that a prospective employer could understand what happened. Those records would be available to other financial institutions for some reasonable period of time—say, five years—and would then expire.\n\nThe duty to check the database should arise after a conditional offer is made, but before the individual begins work. An offer of employment would be contingent upon a database inquiry. The prospective employer could withdraw its offer if it were not satisfied with what it sees in the database.\n\nTo overcome the legal risk that inhibits disclosure, a federal statute could provide limited civil immunity for reporting—a safe harbor. Banks would not face suits for money damages by former employees. But their reports to the database would face judicial scrutiny. To guard against abuse by banks, the statute should entitle employees to prompt notice and two options to pursue redress in the event that they believe a report about them is false: a low-cost, fast-track ombudsman hearing, or a full judicial review in federal court. This is critical. Remember that most people who work in financial services firms are not millionaires. The official sector would also remain free to take action—criminal or civil—to combat abuse of the database and its safe harbor.\n\nThere are costs and benefits to this idea—again, I'm only dealing with a hypothetical law, not any statute on the books or pending before Congress. And the database idea is not a cure-all.  It will not deter all bad conduct and will not, standing alone, restore the trustworthiness of banks. But, on balance, I think a database will help overcome a collective action problem in the financial services industry, which will benefit both banks and their customers.\n\nThe database idea would benefit from input by prosecutors and regulators, employment lawyers for plaintiffs and defendants, in-house counsel, and others with empirical insight on human behavior. It is, in short, a prime opportunity for collaboration and refinement through forums like this one. I welcome your comments and questions.\n\nOne final note before I open the floor for questions. Some of you may be saying to yourselves, \"Well, that was a riveting and insightful speech. [You're welcome.] But since I'm never going to work in financial services, I don't really need to worry about any of this stuff.\"\n\nThere is an ongoing debate as to whether there is something intrinsic and idiosyncratic about financial services that creates especially egregious culture problems. I've tried to stay away from that discussion today. Instead, I've tried to frame my remarks about culture in a way that can be extended beyond financial services to a variety of industries—and, dare I say it, even to academic settings or public sector institutions like the New York Fed. I would respectfully suggest, though, that you should be concerned with culture in financial services even if you're planning a career in a very different field. That's because problems in financial services don't tend to stay in financial services. They involve clients of those firms, and often have consequences for other sectors of the economy.\n\nWhat's more, cultural problems are everywhere. Think of the problems at GM with its faulty ignition keys, or problems in the pharma industry with inappropriate sales practices, or just recently the headlines about a ride sharing company that allegedly used software to evade local laws. In each of these instances, and in many others, I always wonder how the lawyers could let this happen. I'm not the only one. \"Where were the lawyers?\" is a question often attributed to Judge Stanley Sporkin following the collapse of Lincoln Savings and Loan.17 A decade later, the post-mortem evaluation of Enron criticized lawyers who \"saw their role in very narrow terms, as an implementer, not a counselor.\" 18  And, within the last year, Ben Heineman posed the question again regarding Wells Fargo.19\n\nCulture is an issue that you, as lawyers—both starting out in your careers and as you become more seasoned—will need to work with, regardless of where you end up or who your client is. Hopefully, you will be positioned to help your clients think about these issues proactively to mitigate risk ex ante, rather than just reactively, after a firm experiences significant, even existential, problems.\n\nThank you again, Nancy, for your kind invitation, and thanks to all of you for your kind attention."

        "content": "Introduction\n\nGood afternoon. Thank you very much for the kind introduction.\n\nSince the financial crisis, the topic of today's conference—Optimal Bank Capital Regulation—has been of considerable interest to academics, the official sector, and market participants. Some have argued for dramatically higher capital requirements, while others have argued with equal conviction for substantially lower capital requirements.\n\nI am happy to be here today to offer some thoughts about potential trade-offs across supervisory tools and objectives, and how one might consider those trade-offs within the current supervisory framework. I conclude that the U.S. banking system has become considerably more resilient since the financial crisis, which is a necessary condition for the sustainable provision of financial services to households and businesses that supports the growth and stability of the U.S. economy.\n\nMy comments today are my own and do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nSupervisory Objectives and Trade-Offs\n\nA well-functioning financial system intermediates between savers and borrowers, supports a robust payments system, and facilitates risk transfer and the efficient allocation of capital. This occurs through a wide range of institutions including bank holding companies, banks, and other firms supervised by the Federal Reserve System.1 In that context, a healthy bank maintains a strong balance sheet, measured by conventional metrics like capital, liquidity and asset quality; has a durable business model that generates a sustainable stream of earnings commensurate with a properly-defined risk profile; and has the appropriate controls in place that include, among other things, a robust risk management framework, a strong audit function, and effective oversight by the board of directors.\n\nAll of these factors make a financial institution stronger and lower the chance that a shock such as an unexpected deterioration of credit quality or operational loss would drive the firm into insolvency, result in a loss of confidence by the firm's creditors, counterparties, investors or customers, or force the firm to curtail its core activities. That is, a healthy firm is more resilient. This is true for financial institutions of all sizes and represents a baseline supervisory goal.\n\nI should emphasize that resiliency is not the ultimate aim, but rather a means to broader policy objectives. A resilient firm, for example, is more likely to provide a sustainable flow of financial services—broadly defined to include credit intermediation, payments, and risk transfer—through the cycle and across a range of possible macroeconomic outcomes; a resilient firm is less likely to harm the economy or consumers through excessive risk-taking; and a resilient firm is less likely to put taxpayer funds at risk. That is why resilience of financial institutions is valued.\n\nThe supervisory program for the largest banks implemented since the financial crisis builds on that foundation and explicitly acknowledges the potential impact that distress at a large bank could have on financial markets or the economy. This approach to large bank supervision has been codified in Supervision and Regulation Letter 12-17, or SR 12-17.2\n\nThis framework expresses two complementary goals for the Federal Reserve's program for large bank supervision: (1) Enhanced resiliency of the firm to lower the probability of failure or inability to serve as an intermediary and (2) Reduced impact on the financial system or economy in the event failure or material weakness does in fact occur.\n\nTo analysts of credit, this will sound familiar because it is essentially a probability of default/loss given default or PD/LGD framework. The key elements of enhanced resiliency, or lower PD, in this framework include capital, liquidity, corporate governance, management of core businesses, and recovery planning. A reduced impact of distress, or lower LGD, depends on effective management of critical operations, support for banking offices, and strong resolution planning.\n\nAs an aside, the implementation of enhanced standards for the largest, most systemically important financial firms reflects a core tenet of the Federal Reserve's supervisory program, namely that supervisory expectations should be tailored to the risks that individual institutions face and the potential impact that distress might have on the broader financial markets or economy. Chair Yellen recently discussed this topic3 and the recent rule that removes large, non-complex firms from the qualitative assessment of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) is a recent example.4\n\nThis tailoring principle drives efforts to mitigate risks to financial stability, while minimizing the collective burden on financial institutions, particularly for community and mid-sized banks, and allocating supervisory resources most efficiently. As a result, the standards and expectations from supervision become more stringent as a firm becomes larger and more complex in ways that pose risks to the broader financial system.\n\nWith that background in mind, I'll turn to the question of \"optimal\" bank capital that is the topic of this conference. To me, the question of optimal capital implies some type of a trade-off. This thinking is not limited to bank capital, but reflects all of the potential supervisory and regulatory tools such as capital and liquidity standards or a resolution framework.\n\nOne can frame this trade-off simply in terms of two objectives often attributed to supervision: ensuring the safety and soundness of financial institutions and promoting efficient financial intermediation that supports the growth and stability of the U.S. economy. Other objectives could include, for example, reducing the potential spillover costs associated with distress and promoting fair and transparent financial services for consumers.\n\nIn many cases, the objectives of enhanced resilience and efficient financial intermediation are mutually reinforcing. For example, a firm with a strong traditional lending franchise with appropriate risk management can both build capital organically through retained earnings and serve its customers through the efficient provision of financial services. Similarly, a firm that diversifies into a broader portfolio of financial products may reap the benefits of economies of scope and diversification, while better serving its clients' needs. This would support both enhanced safety and soundness and the broader objective of effective financial intermediation.\n\nThere may be times, however, when these two objectives appear to contradict. For example, a firm holding a large buffer of low return, highly liquid assets might be stronger from a liquidity perspective, but might have less lending capacity. Similarly, greater oversight and controls around a particular activity may lower the associated risk, but could also reduce the provision of that financial service. Finally, higher levels of capital may increase the weighted average cost of funding, which could prompt banks to reduce the supply of certain financial services. The latter point remains an area of active research without a strong consensus.5\n\nThis suggests the potential for a trade-off between resilience and intermediation, implying an \"optimal\" level of capital. This simple, static framing, however, is incomplete and requires further elaboration in terms of the policy horizon and a broad perspective on costs and benefits.\n\nFirst, as I mentioned earlier, the core function of a bank is to provide financial services, and that is not just in the short-term, but also in a sustainable manner over time. A critical argument behind the desire for resilient financial firms is that they are more likely to withstand shocks and to continue to function through a wide range of macroeconomic and financial conditions. This suggests that the apparent short-term trade-off between resilience and the provision of financial services may be reframed over a longer policy horizon as a dynamic trade-off between the provision of financial services today and in the future.\n\nFor example, a stated goal of the first public stress test in the U.S., the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) during the financial crisis in 2009, was to ensure that participating banks would have sufficient capital to \"withstand losses and sustain lending—even if the economic downturn is more severe than is currently anticipated.\"6 Resilience is valued because it supports the sustained provision of financial services over time and across macroeconomic outcomes.\nSecond, the official sector considers all potential costs and benefits to society when evaluating a policy in a way that private actors may not. For example, asset fire sales dynamics that negatively impact market prices or a loss of confidence in the industry during periods of uncertainty or distress are examples of \"externalities\" with far-reaching effects on the financial system.7 Moreover, those costs and benefits will be realized in the future and thus need to be assessed ex ante from a probabilistic perspective.\n\nThe official sector includes all of these costs and benefits to society in assessments of policy efficacy. This makes evaluating trade-offs and assessing effectiveness difficult, and suggests that simple assessments are likely to be incomplete. Policy assessment requires a rigorous evaluation of a broad range of outcomes, and an important part of the ongoing dialogue in conferences like this one is to continue to develop the conceptual frameworks and to study the data in order to make the most meaningful assessments of policy effectiveness.\n\nA Look at Bank Performance\n\nI will now discuss two perspectives on bank performance since the financial crisis that serve as rough proxies for the resilience of the industry and the provision of financial services. This is clearly not a rigorous test of whether specific regulations are optimal, but provides some indicative results about trends in resiliency and financial services.\n\nI will focus on accounting metrics from the balance sheet and income statement, but one could also turn to market data to assess resiliency. For example, equity prices reflect, in part, investors' expectations of future profits and their assessment of a bank's management and business model, while bond yields and credit default swap spreads convey useful information about investors' perceptions of default probabilities. Supervisors regularly evaluate market data in our assessment of financial institutions and these indicators generally show that investors' confidence in the health of U.S. institutions has increased, although there has been some debate on the interpretation. 8\n\nResiliency\n\nAt the aggregate level, the largest U.S. banks have substantially improved both the quantity and quality of capital and liquidity, supporting the belief that the system is substantially more resilient relative to the pre-crisis period. As shown in (Figure 1), the ratio of tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets has more than doubled from the crisis lows in 2009. Similarly, the ratio of net liquid assets to total assets has increased substantially over the same period.9\n\nOne can also look beyond the aggregates to see how capital and liquidity are distributed across large banks. (Figure 2) plots the aggregate ratio of tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets for a sample of large bank holding companies, and the 15th and 85th percentile bands. The entire distribution has shifted upward with the 15th percentile in 2016 comparable to the 85th percentile in the pre-crisis period. Not only has resilience increased in the aggregate, it has increased for most large institutions.\n\n(Figure 3) shows similar data for net liquid assets as a share of total assets. Large banks have improved their liquidity profile, both in aggregate and in the cross-section. Over the same period, banks have also shifted the composition of liabilities towards more stable sources of funding such as core deposits and away from non-core and short-term wholesale liabilities. Those funding shifts have bolstered system resilience by reducing the risk of runs and fire sale asset liquidations.\n\n(Figure 4) plots the return on equity for the U.S. banking industry, both as a whole and for the large banks used above on a merger-adjusted basis. This accounting measure of profitability shows an improving picture over the last few years, with ratios recovering towards historic norms despite significant headwinds from the low rate, flat yield curve environment and modest economic growth. This trend is particularly noteworthy when one considers the substantial increase in capital held in the banking industry. In addition, as shown in (Figure 5), earnings have shifted back toward net interest income and have been more stable in the post-crisis period, which is consistent with the idea of more sustainable and less volatile earnings streams.\n\nFinally, it is useful to compare the U.S. experience to other developed economies. As shown in (Figure 6), large U.S. bank outcomes compare favorably to their global peers from both a profitability and capital perspective. This is supportive of the conclusion that the suite of post-crisis official sector actions in the U.S. has made the U.S. financial system more resilient, while not eroding global competitiveness.\n\nProvision of Financial Services\n\nI will now turn to the provision of financial services by looking at indicators of different types of banking activities such as lending or underwriting activities.10 A more rigorous analysis would identify supply and demand factors in an attempt to understand not just what has changed, but why, and could allow an assessment of whether financial services are efficiently provided. Nonetheless, this perspective provides a benchmark from the pre-crisis period to support some initial conclusions.\n\nIn terms of traditional lending, (Figure 7) shows that the ratio of aggregate bank loans to GDP—a rough measure of credit intermediated through the banking sector—has recovered from the post-crisis low and is consistent with historical levels. In addition, aggregate net lending revenues, proxied by net interest income and scaled by GDP, are near historic norms despite compression of net interest margins in the low rate environment.\n\nSurvey evidence of credit availability also shows ongoing provision of credit. According to the National Federation of Independent Business, the proportion of small businesses that report credit as hard to get has declined to pre-crisis levels.11 This is consistent with the generally easing credit conditions across most loan classes over the last several years reported in the Fed's Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, particularly in commercial and auto loans, but also expanding more recently into other types of household credit.12 This evidence suggests banks continue to provide this core financial service.\n\nTurning to capital market activities, (Figure 8) plots non-interest revenues from core businesses—trading, investment banking, fiduciary activities, and securities brokerage. While trading revenue has declined, non-interest revenue of other types has generally grown in line with GDP, showing the compositional shift in revenue. The changes reflect the ongoing shift toward activities that generate more stable income streams such as fiduciary and brokerage activities. Looking within the trading business, there is also some evidence that activities are becoming less risky, less opaque, and less complex, e.g., level 3 trading assets have declined as a share of total trading assets over this period and there has been a shift toward central clearing of derivatives even as volumes continue to grow.13\n\nI conclude this section by emphasizing that the supervisory goal is not to allocate credit or to dictate specific aspects of business models, but rather to ensure that firms are resilient so that they can meet the broader policy objectives of the sustainable provisions of financial services and financial stability.\n\nOther Issues for Supervision\n\nI would be remiss, however, if I left you with the impression that all supervisors focus on is capital, liquidity and earnings. It is not all about the balance sheet and the income statement. Financial institutions face other risks that threaten their ability to provide financial services or even their viability, and supervisors are acutely aware of these risks. I will briefly discuss three—cybersecurity, fintech, and business conduct risk.\n\nBeginning with cybersecurity, the Federal banking agencies have recently released an advanced notice of proposed rule-making around a set of potential enhanced cybersecurity risk-management and resilience standards that would apply to large and interconnected entities under their supervision.14 Supervisors and regulators continue to work with other agencies in the official sector to defend against cyber-attacks and to minimize the disruption from a successful attack. This type of disruption could impede the critical services from the financial sector and is a first-order concern.\n\nOn fintech, which I define simply as the intersection between financial services and technology, I view this as potentially disruptive with the ability to transform how financial services are provided. This could have a wide range of possible impacts on supervised firms depending on the nature of the innovation, how new technologies or service models are introduced and adopted by supervised firms, and the resulting impact on business models, competition and market structure.\n\nFederal Reserve Governor Brainard has recently discussed these issues and highlighted some of the critical issues and potential trade-offs.15 For example, new entrants' use of non-traditional data may enhance credit analysis, but this could have implications for consumer privacy and protection. As a second example, the economics of innovation may favor rapid introduction of new products to gain a first-mover advantage, but this approach may be a challenge in an industry like banking that requires trust and confidence to support a stable business model. It is imperative that risk management keep pace with financial innovation.\n\nThird, I'll mention business conduct risk. The New York Fed has challenged the financial industry to consider and address the many factors that have contributed to recent, widespread misconduct at large financial firms.16 These incidents impose real costs in the form of fines, settlements, and the diversion of internal resources related to investigation and remediation. In addition, there are more difficult to measure costs linked to the potential loss of confidence and trust in the firm and the industry. Recurring misconduct poses a real threat to the provision of financial services if customers and counterparties were to pull away from the sector.\n\nSupervisors can help mitigate these risks by supporting the development of effective internal governance regimes, prudent risk management policies, and strong compliance and control structures, all within a framework of effective oversight from the firm's board of directors. SR 12-17, for example, describes the essential components of effective corporate governance and sets the expectation that a firm's board of directors should establish and maintain a firm's culture, incentives, structure, and processes necessary to promote compliance with laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance and to avoid conflicts of interest and the effective management of reputational and legal risks. Using the trade-off language from earlier, this might be framed as ensuring that potential short-term gains are appropriately balanced against the longer-term objectives of serving clients and maximizing value over time.\n\nIn my view, this goes further than the incentives, processes, and oversight roles. All of these are necessary, but they are not likely to be sufficient. Firms also need to look at how leadership dimensions drive decisions, whether there is effective challenge from controls functions, how the inevitable mistakes are treated, and how compensation and promotions are determined. Ultimately, establishing and maintaining an effective culture with appropriate risk governance and controls is the responsibility of individual firms and the industry, but the official sector can help highlight best practices, solve collective action problems, and drive toward socially desirable outcomes.\n\nAnd, finally, we must recognize that there are risks that we don't see. We all suffer from blind spots—issues we should be thinking about, but aren't. One of the most important supervisory challenges we face is to always ask ourselves—what are we missing? What else should we be studying? Where are new risks emerging? As the financial industry continues to evolve in response to regulatory, technological and business factors, I expect new issues will emerge that potentially threaten individual firms, and supervisors need to be prepared to address them.\n\nConclusions\n\nEffective supervision and regulation help create the environment where financial institutions provide critical intermediation services in a sustainable manner over time. A key lesson of the financial crisis and the post-crisis period is that stronger, more resilient financial firms can dampen rather than amplify shocks to the system. The greater resilience we observe today relative to the pre-crisis period suggests the U.S. financial sector is better positioned to continue to provide the critical services to households and businesses that are necessary to support the U.S. economy across a wide range of potential macroeconomic and financial conditions.\n\nIt is also essential to distinguish the intended consequences of supervision and regulation where informed choices are made based on careful data analysis from the unintended consequences where outcomes are not consistent with policy objectives. This requires both a conceptual framework to identify costs and benefits to society as a whole, and empirical analysis to measure them. In my view, it is entirely appropriate to continuously evaluate and rigorously assess the impact to ensure that the observed outcomes are consistent with stated objectives such as greater resilience, efficient financial intermediation over time, and financial stability.\n\nConferences like this that bring together the official sector with financial analysts, markets participants and academic economists play an important role in developing the theory and empirical analysis needed to inform those assessments.\n\nThank you very much for your attention.\n\nData Appendix\n\nThe primary sample includes U.S. owned bank holding companies (BHCs) with assets greater than $50B as of 3Q16. This represented approximately 80% of all U.S. owned BHC assets. Where available, estimates are adjusted for mergers since 2000 to include major banking and non-banking (broker-dealer) operations. The FDIC sample represents all FDIC-insured depository institutions.\n\nCharts"

        "content": "Maureen O’Hara:\n\nBill, let me start off with kind of the low-hanging fruit. The post-Trump economy has been confusing, with low Q4 growth, yet record-setting stock market levels. So let me just throw you an easy one here. What does the Fed see as the outlook for the next year?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nFor the near-term I think more of the same. I mean, we think the economy is going to continue to grow, a little bit above-trend. That's going to generate job gains that put, you know, more pressure on the labor market, and as a consequence of that, we think inflation's going to move back towards our 2% objective.\n\nSo, you know, we could be completely wrong, but that – the data that's come out over the last couple of months, is very consistent with that pattern.\n\nA lot of uncertainty in the outlook. I mean we don't know what's going to happen with the whole host of policy choices: healthcare reform, immigration policy, trade policy, tax policy, fiscal policy. So, how that, how those policy questions get answered will also be an important aspect in terms of how the forecast actually falls.\n\nBut the baseline forecast is pretty similar in 2017 to 2016, slowly above trend growth, a little bit more pressure on the labor market, gradual rise in inflation, back towards our 2% objective. And if that happens, if we stay on that trajectory, I think as Chair Yellen said yesterday and today, we would expect to gradually remove further monetary policy accommodation, snug up interest rates a little further in the months ahead.\n\nMaureen O’Hara:\n\nWell I think that's somewhat encouraging, isn't it?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nBut the uncertainty around that forecast is pretty high.\n\nMaureen O’Hara:\n\nIs pretty high.  Although, you know, it's interesting, think about the U.S., um, you know, our situation in the last couple of years has clearly been improving. What's been interesting is seeing the news out of Japan, that, you know, Japan seems to be able to keep out of deflation, which they haven't for a long time. Even Europe seems to be eeking some growth out.\n\nDo – do you think everybody's going to be doing better or is this just a blip?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I think that – a couple of things. Just let me touch on the U.S. first. One thing that's interesting is post-election you've seen a pretty big improvement in household and business confidence, especially business confidence among smaller businesses.\n\nNow it's hard to say how much weight to put on that because historically consumer confidence goes up and down, and it doesn't just necessarily feed into consumer spending. But the increase in business confidence is quite striking, especially for smaller businesses. And so one of the big open questions that we're going to be assessing over the next few months is: is that improvement in animal spirits, so to speak, going to actually feed through and lead to more spending?\n\nSo, I think where a year or two ago, I think our anxieties were more about the risks to growth to the downside, so as that – well, a year ago, we were worried about events in China, we were worried about uncertainties about Europe. I think now the balance of risk is gradually shifting, where the possibility is that growth could actually be stronger than expected, rather than weaker than expected.\n\nThe markets expect fiscal stimulus out of this Administration. That's another factor that probably will over time tilt the equation more to the upside.\n\nBut on fiscal policy, it's really hard to factor into your forecast at this point because we don't know what it is, how big it is, or when it will happen. Other than that, we have it completely nailed down.\n\nSo, it's really hard to sort of put that into your forecast. And so the way I think about the fiscal policy outlook is that we're probably going to get some fiscal stimulus at some point.  And so that's just another factor that maybe tilts the risk to the economy a little bit to the upside.\n\nMaureen O’Hara:\n\nSo, Bill, how about we think a little bit more broadly. You talked about where – it looks like interest rates are going up, at least that's what, you know…\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nGradually, right.\n\nMaureen O’Hara:\n\nWhat Janet Yellen indicated would happen. There's this interesting question, though, about will interest rates over the next year go to quote normal levels, or is there a new normal, right? I mean we've struggled through how many years now of zero interest rates, and the distributional consequences those have had, is there a \"new\" normal?  Do we have an idea what that \"new normal\" is going to be?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell I think if you look at what the FOMC publishes, the so-called Summary of Economic Projections, one of the things that they forecast, we forecast, is the long-run federal funds rate, where we think the federal funds rate is going to end up in the long-run. So think five, six, seven years out. And that estimate has come down over the last few years. So what that's telling you is that people on the FOMC think that the normal federal funds rate is lower now than it's been in the past.\n\nAnd the idea behind that is a very simple one. One, there's probably still some residual headwinds left over from the financial crisis that are going to persist for some time. Think about how difficult it is to get a mortgage if you're a lower credit-rated borrower today compared to 2005, 2006. And two, productivity growth in the economy has been very anemic, and I think generally, most economists think there's a relationship between productivity growth and the inflation-adjusted level of interest rates in the economy.\n\nSo, productivity growth is strong, you tend to have high real rates. At 2% inflation you get a relatively high federal funds rate. If productivity growth is weak, you have low real rates. Add 2% inflation, you get a little bit lower level of interest rates.\n\nSo generally, if you look at the FOMC projections, people think that the federal funds rate in the medium term is going to more like 3% rather than the 4% that might have been attained historically.\n\nNow there's one little problem with this. Economists are terrible at actually forecasting productivity growth. So just because productivity growth has been weak over the last few years doesn't mean it will necessarily be weak over the next five years.\n\nMaureen O’Hara:\n\nWell, it's a tricky one. Here's one that's tricky, too. Are there issues connected with financial market valuations that concern you? And that's kind of the grown-up question. Here's the one we all want to know. Any predictions on the Dow reaching 30,000 this year?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nNo way.\n\nMaureen O’Hara:\n\nOh, quick, call your brokers.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nLet's put it this way, if it did reach 30,000, I would be concerned about the stock market valuation. I think one of the things that's interesting post the election is, I think the uncertainty level about policy has gone up enormously, yet markets have actually performed very well, especially the equity market.\n\nAnd that's actually pretty unusual. Usually markets don't like uncertainty. And so, one thing to ask yourself the question is, why are markets going up even though the uncertainty level has climbed so much?\n\nI think one of the reasons, perhaps, is the notion that political deadlock in Washington is going to ease. Another thing is maybe fiscal policy is going to ride in and provide some support for the economy. But it's an unusual environment, where uncertainty level goes up and the stock market goes up. There's a little tension there between those two things.\n\nMaureen O’Hara:\n\nThe VIX which is –\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, that's the other thing. Volatility in the market is extraordinarily low. So, that's another thing that doesn't quite fit. You would think if uncertainty was high, you'd have a little bit more volatility. If I was going to write something down as a prediction, I guess I would think volatility will go up. At some point.\n\nMaureen O’Hara:\n\nWell, it is a confusing structure right now. I think it's hard for anyone to kind of predict this economy. But that kind of makes it fun. Let's talk about something else that is somewhat hard to fathom. What are your thoughts on the election? Let me make it a little more – are there lessons from the election that you think are particularly important for the economy going forward?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, obviously, the Federal Reserve is completely apolitical, so we don't take sides in terms of elections, and whether the Democrats or Republicans win. But I do think there is an interesting lesson in the election in the sense of support around the country and around the world for globalization, and why that support did not seem to manifest itself in terms of our election outcome.\n\nYou know, I think that globalization has lifted literally hundreds of millions of people out of poverty over the last decade or two. And so I think net-net from my perspective it's been a good thing. But people have been left behind from globalization. I think a lot of people in the United States didn't put enough weight on those people. You look at income distribution in the United States it’s become a lot more skewed. You look at income mobility in the U.S., it's not very good.\n\nI think those are things that we really need to work on is the country.  I think we really want to make it so that globalization lifts all boats rather than just some boats because if you don't have that, you're not going to have support for globalization. You're not going to have support for free trade. And if you don't have that, then I think that has its own set of consequences.\n\nMaureen O’Hara:\n\nYes, well, I think you've raised a great point, that there are both positive and negative consequences of globalization. Let me raise something that may have similar negative and positive, and that's the impact of technology. I think we're all beginning to see a brave new world in which technology is entering ways that even 10 years ago were hard to fathom. And you know, I think that just as globalization seems to have made people nervous about the future, so has technology.\n\nNow, what are your thoughts on that? Is technology going to be the bigger influence over the next decade? Is that what's going to change our economy and the ability of people to make that leap-up that you just talked about?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell I think technology is always challenging. I think it's been challenging for decades, even centuries. My mom for many years lived in Westville, Massachusetts, and if I have this right, it was the buggy whip capital of the world at one point.\n\nWell, Westville had to make the transition from being the buggy whip capital of the world to other things. And I think – so, I don't think this is new. I don't think this is a new story about technology.\n\nWhat I think is what's new is we have to do a better job in terms of retraining people, getting people the mobility they need so they can actually feel that they have a place in the new economy.\n\nI was thinking about this question about technology and you think about the U.S. farm sector. You think about how many people in the United States worked on farms in 1900 and how few people work on farms today. Same kind of tech, same science and process of technological transition, but the good news is we were able to find things for those people to do.\n\nPeople always have for many, many years, talked about how technology is going to put everyone out of work, and everyone's just going to have a lot of leisure. That has not panned out up to now at all, and so I'm just a little bit skeptical that now we're at that critical turning point. I could be wrong. This time could be different. But if you think about how long we've had these conversations about technology obsoleting everyone's skills and leading to massive unemployment, this has been a conversation that we've been having for hundreds of years, literally.\n\nMaureen O’Hara:\n\nIt's tricky now, though, isn't it? I mean in the past, I think you used to think about technology as taking away some of the lower-skilled jobs, and yet now we're seeing it kind of marching its way up. I think it'll be awhile before it gets to Fed presidents. But I know…\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, there are some people in Washington that would like to make us conduct monetary policy by a rule.\n\nMaureen O’Hara:\n\nAnd there you go, a robot can do it. \n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWe don't think that's such a good idea, by the way.\nMaureen O’Hara\n\nIt's an interesting challenging, and particularly here I saw some numbers the other day that the high school graduation rate in New York state is somewhere in the 70 percentage points. And again, as you think about the technology creating winners and losers, you know, obviously we’re in education, all of us are committed to education, you know. Is that kind of crucial to the technology solution? What do we do with the people who don't?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I think – I mean look, I think education is absolutely essential. Giving people the skills they need to sort of navigate in the 21st century economy.\n\nAnd the second thing we need to do a better job is actually retraining people so that the only education you get shouldn't just be when you're 18 to 22 years old or 25 years old. We need to have a better system where people can sort of retool themselves.\n\nI think a third thing we can do is a better job of matching the skills that people get in universities to the business needs. One of the things that we've been talking about for a long time is that the New York Fed has tried to have better partnerships between businesses and education, so that the skills that people are getting when they go to the university match the opportunities when they actually graduate.\n\nAnd I think we've made a lot of progress on that, but that's something that I think we could even do better on going forward.\n\nMaureen O’Hara:\n\nCan you turn us back to monetary policy again for a minute because, you know, one could argue that one of the major forces that helped us get through the crisis was monetary policy, with its expansive, you know, quantitative easing with the role that the central bank took up and really helped keep the financial markets from collapsing, and now also keeping the economy from collapsing.\n\nNow we have, as you mentioned earlier, the prospect for more fiscal stimulus, which in some ways makes it a little better…\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nPotentially.\n\nMaureen O’Hara:\n\nBecause it's not just monetary policy, we’ll have fiscal policy. But we also have a variety of other factors that may influence monetary policy. One of which is the possibility that we as a country are going to become more isolationist. And that has implications, doesn't it?  For your monetary policy and how you implement it?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I think we – as I said before, I think we have a lot of uncertainty about what's going to happen on immigration and trade. Most economists – the overwhelming number of economists – think that open and free trade is a good thing, comparative advantage, you want to produce the goods and services that you're best at producing and let other people produce the goods and services that they're best at producing, and that actually generates gains for both sides. That's really the theory of trade.\n\nSo I think that’s – so I think we don't want to lose sight of that. Obviously, to the extent that we – I think it's very – it's way too soon to sort of see how this is going to evolve. It could evolve in the direction where we negotiate hard and we get somewhat better trade deals for the U.S. and trade barriers around the world don't go up very much at all, if at all. That's probably not a bad outcome for the U.S., and I don't think it's a bad outcome for the world. Or you could go down the path that was quite a bit more pessimistic than that.\n\nSo, I think it's just too soon to sort of see which direction. You know, the Federal Reserve is going to obviously take the world as it is. I mean we – our objectives are set by Congress. Very clearly, maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability. So we have two goals: employment and inflation.\n\nAnd if the world is a really good place, it maybe makes it a little easier to achieve those goals. And if the world is at a more difficult place, maybe it makes it a little harder to achieve those goals. But it doesn't change our goals, and it doesn't change our monetary policy mission.\n\nMaureen O’Hara:\n\nLet me turn that, our focus, just a tiny bit. You've been a leading critic of culture in the banking industry, and I kind of have a two-part question here. Do you think the era of bad behavior in banking is behind us? And here's the second part of the question:  some people would argue that the behavior wasn't really that bad but instead the regulators…\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWho are those people?\n\nMaureen O’Hara:\n\nThere was Elizabeth Warren, I'll say that, I think she’s convinced. But some people would argue that the regulators used the opportunity to extract excessive fines from banks for behavior that maybe wasn't ideal but wasn't so horrible. There's two different perspectives. I think no matter how we look at it, some of the behavior of the banks was sort of unacceptable. Are we past that, do you think?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, first thing I would say is a lot of the behavior was just totally egregious, totally unacceptable. Not in the gray area. You know people talk about, well, it's hard to know where to operate in a gray area, I think a lot of the behavior was way over the line. \n\nWhen people are getting together in chat rooms trying to talk about how they can collude to rig a market, that's not in the gray area. That's way over the line.\n\nWhen people are consciously doing things to evade any money laundering rules and sanctions, that's not in a gray area, that's way over the line.\n\nSo I feel that most of the things that have resulted in fines can be tied to things that are not in a gray area. They're just way over the line.\n\nNow the question of whether the fines are excessive – I mean it's hard to know how you take the behavior and then map it back onto the fine. I think the important thing, though, is to make the fines big enough so that the senior management of these institutions doesn't just say, \"Well, I can just write a check, accept the bad behavior, and move on.\"\n\nIf the fines are substantial, then it actually gets some senior management’s attention, and I think that's one of the reasons why banks are working harder on the issues of culture in their institutions.\n\nI've actually been very – you know, you asked me the question, is bank bad behavior over? I expect not because I think there's always people that test the limits of the law and regulation and are always trying to see where they can go. And there are obviously going to be bad apples in any really large organization.\n\nWhat I hope is that, one, the banks will sustain their effort to improve their cultures. Banks really are working on this. I spoke at a bank industry conference about a month ago, where they brought in all their very high potential mid-level people to talk about culture, and it was really them talking about bank culture and I came in for a very short period. I think I was the only person from the official sector that spoke there.\n\nAnd I thought the fact that they were taking all these people that are high-performers and spending a day trying to inculcate them with the importance of culture maybe suggests that we've passed a tipping point. So, that's important.\n\nI think the other thing that I'm hoping to see is the banks start to cooperate a little bit more with each other and share best practices on bank culture. Up to now it's been most banks working sort of on their own thing alone. I think if they actually shared best practices, shared survey results, to see how they were doing relative to their peers, that would also help them perform.\n\nAnd the last thing I would say on culture, I think we've got to continue to work on incentives. I have a very simple mantra. Incentives drive behavior. Behavior sets social norms. And those social norms define culture. So if you have the wrong incentives, you're probably going to have bad culture. If you have the right incentives, you're probably going to have a much better culture.\n\nOne thing that Preet Bharara said when he came to a conference we had at the New York Fed, he said one of the big challenges that he sees is that people don't speak up early enough when they see something wrong going on. He said that if people spoke up early, a lot of these big things would never have been big things. They would have been little things.\n\nAnd so, the important thing also is to really educate people that it's okay if you see something that bothers you, that you're not comfortable with, raise your hand. You're not doing anybody a favor by keeping silent, hoping it will go away. You're not doing anybody a favor by thinking, well, if I raise my hand, I'm sort of tattling on my colleagues. That is not the right way to think about it.\n\nBad behavior is not good for you, it's not good for the institution. And so, if you do see bad behavior, or something that you're not really sure whether it's bad behavior or not, raise your hand and raise it to your manager, and have a conversation about it.\n\nMaureen O’Hara:\n\nWell, I think, I hope you're right that we're reaching a new awareness of the fact that some behaviors just can't be accepted. You know, I don't care whether they're legal or not. They're over any kind of ethical lines. And we shall see, it's a new world, isn't it?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nYeah. It's very important that people understand that the idea is not to just perform to the regulation and the legal law. And one of the things we have, because we have a very legalistic system with lots of regulations with banks – people sometimes feel like, \"Oh, well, given that, I can do anything within those parameters.\"\n\nWell, the world changes faster than the regulations and law can sort of keep up. And so, using that as your guide in terms of what's good behavior, permissible behavior, I think is a very bad, bad guide.\n\nMaureen O’Hara:\n\nWell let me turn to one last question, and then we'll open it up to all of you. Would repeal of parts of Dodd-Frank, the Volcker Rule, be a good thing for the financial system? Any predictions about what's going to happen with financial regulation going forward?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I think that it's certainly going to be looked at, and obviously we'll have to see how it makes its way through the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. I'm perfectly – I think it makes sense to look at the Dodd-Frank Act, to see which parts are working and which parts are not working so well.\n\nI mean, when I sort of think about the Dodd-Frank Act, I think there's really two things that we're trying to accomplish here. Number one, we're trying to make the probability of failure of large complex financial institutions a lot lower than it was before. So that means more capital, more liquidity, better governance, better risk management. And we want to keep all those things.\n\nAnd the second thing we're trying to do is that if a firm does get into trouble, we can actually allow it to fail without it threatening to take down the rest of the financial system. So that means you need good resolution regimes, and you need a financial system where you don't have a lot of vulnerabilities.\n\nYou know, one thing, for example, that we've accomplished over the last year is we've had money market fund reform. Money market funds were one of the accelerants of the crisis after Lehman Brothers failed.\n\nSo, fixing the financial system to address some of those structural weaknesses is also important. So I think keeping that part of Dodd-Frank, central clearing of derivatives, I think is something that makes the financial system more robust. Keeping all those parts I think makes a lot of sense.\n\nVolcker Rule? You could probably do the Volcker Rule in a more efficient way to achieve the same objectives without the burden of regulation that you have right now. You know, right now, if you're an equity trading desk and the equity market falls very violently, you really aren't supposed to go in and buy equities unless you actually have customer orders. So, you actually have this crazy situation where the equity desk can't actually buy equities to support the market.\n\nSo, I'd like to see the Volcker Rule looked at to see if there's a way of doing it in a way that – if you're a client-facing business, and you're trading your own asset class, you have a little bit more freedom to buy and sell when markets are volatile and maybe provide actually a little liquidity support in the market. But also make it a lot easier, I think, to enforce the Volcker Rule.\n\nThe other thing I would say is relief for smaller banking institutions. The financial crisis was not about small banking institutions. It was about large banking institutions and particularly it was about large broker-dealers. And so I think the Dodd-Frank Act imposed a lot of compliance and regulatory costs on smaller banking institutions.\n\nAnd I think – we have about 6,500 smaller banks in the United States plus a lot of credit unions and other financial intermediaries. Relief for those guys I think would be really, really valuable because the burden on them, they feel that burden disproportionately because they don't have as big an asset base to spread all those compliance costs across. And I think it has more of a real consequence because a lot of these institutions support small business lending, which I think is really important to have a vibrant economy.\n\nMaureen O’Hara:\n\nSo given the two goals you said that there were for the Dodd-Frank Act, it does make you wonder how the Congo Minerals Relief Act ever got into the Dodd-Frank. But maybe we'll leave the Congo Minerals for another night. Well, I think the issues we've talked about here have covered a wide range of areas, and let me turn it open to the audience here and see if we can come up with some other questions. How about you? Yes.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nYou alluded to China and the concerns we had about it last year that have now gone away. Why do you think the narrative changed on that, why do you think China is doing better? Also, you know, we're seeing more about rising inflation, so is this really about rising inflation or is it about the end of the disinflationary-deflationary scare? Thank you.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell I think last January, early February, the markets were under a lot of distress. There was a big flight to risk aversion and markets went down pretty hard around the globe. I think part of the story was China, but I think part of the story was also worries about the slowdown in China leading to a big commodity bust, and that commodity bust then putting a lot of pressure on especially emerging market economies that were actually selling a lot of the products to China.\n\nChina's been on a much more sort of stable growth path this year. They've also clarified what their foreign exchange rate regime is. So I think people are a lot more comfortable in terms of how they're managing the renminbi.\n\nI think there are still challenges in China and they're still trying to reorient their economy from investment-led growth to consumption-led growth. They're still an economy that I think that credit is growing quite rapidly and so you sort of worry about how sustainable that is over the long-run.\n\nBut I think it's much less of a focus of the markets today than it was a year ago, and I think the anxiety about the emerging market economies is much more focused on individual countries rather than sort of broad like it was a year ago.\n\nI mean financial conditions really, if you look at the financial markets post-election, we've seen stocks up, we've seen the dollar a little bit firmer. We've seen credit spreads narrow quite a bit, and we've seen bond yields up a little bit. But net-net, financial conditions haven't actually changed very much post-election. That was very different a year ago. Financial conditions were actually tightening quite sharply a year ago. And it wasn't really clear how far that was actually going to run.\n\nMaureen O’Hara:\n\nThere we go, question?\n\nAudience Member:\n\nCan you talk a little bit about balance sheet normalization, how you think about that in the context of monetary policy? In the September FOMC, you guys talked about thinking about balance sheet normalization in terms of when your rate hikes are well under way. What does \"well under way\" mean, how are you thinking about that?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI'm sure \"well under way\" means different things with different people. I think the -- we made it pretty clear in terms of our statements that we sort of want the active tool of policy to be short-term interest rates. And the balance sheet to be sort of in the background. We've also said that we wanted to get some room off the zero bound before we actually start to normalize the balance sheet, to end the reinvestment.\n\nNow I think my own personal view is, how soon you want that process to start depends not just about how much margin you have between the current federal funds rate and zero, but also how confident you are that you're actually not going to need to reduce the federal funds rate in the near-term.\n\nSo, to the extent that we become more confident, if we become more confident about the economic outlook, that the recovery will be sustained, then I think that for me – speaking for myself, and only myself – that might make me a little bit more comfortable to proceed with balance sheet normalization a little bit more quickly.\n\nI think the important thing here is that when balance sheet normalization occurs and we start to end the reinvestment, don't think of it as an active tool of policy. Think of it as a passive tool, number one. And number two, to the extent that we then do decide at some point in the future to taper or end the reinvestment, that will also be a way of removing accommodation. And so that would be a bit of a substitute for raising short-term interest rates.\n\nSo, I would guess, my own personal view, is if we move to balance sheet normalization, that might actually stretch out the process of raising short-term interest rates a little bit because the two are substitutes for one another in terms of removing monetary policy accommodation.\n\nThe Chair said in her testimony that this is something we're going to be looking at over the coming meetings. We want to make sure that we know exactly what we want to do long before we have to do it, and so obviously the discussion and contemplation of what the right strategy is here needs to start relatively early, so it can be done absolutely as soon as you actually might want to do something.\n\nPeople sometimes think that when we start talking about something in the minutes that that means that we're going to do something momentarily. Usually it takes a while for us to develop those themes and issues, and reach a consensus.\n\nSo, I wouldn't take a lot of signals just because it was in the minutes last time and something here is imminent.\n\nMaureen O’Hara:\n\nWell, you'll have a few openings, too, in the FOMC that have to get filled in before you'll get full strength. So again, a slightly different Federal Reserve Board going forward, too.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nYes.\n\nMaureen O’Hara:\n\nAn excellent point, an excellent point. What have we got?  Here we go.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nIf the new Administration continues with this isolationist policy, is able to successfully put tariffs on imports, would that have an inflationary impact and would the Fed have to address that?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, again, I don't think that's – I don't really think that's the professed goal of the Administration. I think the Administration wants better trade deals and not – I think the question is whether they'll get better trade deals without actually having to put, you know, higher trade barriers in place.\n\nObviously to the extent that trade barriers go up and that would tend to raise import prices, that would feed into price level in terms of inflation, and so obviously, we had to take that into consideration in terms of how we do monetary policy.\n\nBut going to be happening in a dynamic world where a lot of other things are going on. So, I wouldn't want to take one thing and say, “Oh, if that happens, we're going to do X,” because it really depends on, one, it’s highly speculative what's going to happen on trade policy, and two, even if it happened, it would depend on magnitude and it would depend on a lot of other things that are going on.\n\nSo I think it's really hard to speculate about something like that.\n\nMaureen O’Hara:\n\nOkay, I see some hands way back there. So if you can hand the microphone to someone who's got their hand up, way back there, that'd be great.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nRecently, it's been speculated that the Trump trade policy actually will evolve into a border tax. It's been in the works in the Republican Party for the last several years. This would simply entail an increase across-the-board in taxation on imports and an equal proportional across-the-board decrease on all exports.\n\nFirst question would be, what do you think of this type of proposal? And second, if this were implemented, what do you forecast the impact to be?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, there's been a lot of discussion in Washington about this border tax adjustment. If you were starting with a corporate tax code from scratch, it would be, I think, quite attractive in a lot of ways because it basically eliminates a lot of the incentives to engage in games of transfer pricing. It reduces a lot of the incentives to book your intellectual property abroad.\n\nSo, it actually has a lot of attractive features. I think the challenge is that it's very different than the current tax regime, and so there really would be some pretty significant adjustment costs and frictions of moving from the current regime to that new regime.\n\nAnd so, I think the question is really going to be: do people think those adjustment costs are a price worth paying for what I would agree is probably a better corporate tax regime. Certainly, a much better tax regime than the one we have today.\n\nBut you know, there's going to be a lot of people that are going to be worried about how that adjustment is going to affect their particular industry. If you're an importer, you're going to be worried that your price of imports is going to go up.\nSome people argue that the dollar will move proportionately with the size of the import tax, so the import prices won't go up at all in dollar terms.\n\nBut, you know, that's theory, and people worry about how it will actually work in practice. So, I think this is just going to be a very heavily debated topic in Washington in the coming weeks and months.\n\nMaureen O’Hara:\n\nI think we have time for maybe one or two more. Let's let some people in the back again.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nHi, Mr. Dudley, nice to hear from you. I've got lots of questions, but I guess everyone gets to only ask one.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nYou can ask more than one, but I'll only answer one.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nOkay, so, I was going to ask some sort of structuralist post-Ricardian question, but I'll set that one aside.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nThank you.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nOn a similar vein, to what degree do you think that this challenging of facts and these threats about what is truth and, you know, journalistic integrity, to what degree did this affect the financial system and to what degree did this confidence in what the Wall Street Journal might say or the New York Times might say as a fact can affect confidence in financial institutions? And what remedies do you have, or does the Fed have, to combat that?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI don't think I have any good real answers to that. I'll just have to say that I'm fact-based. New York Fed is fact-based. And I hope we stay that way.\n\nMaureen O’Hara:\n\nDo you have alternative facts? Just checking, just checking.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nLook, I think a healthy debate is a good thing about what facts matter and how the world works. You know, people can have different models about how the world works and what's important, and what's not. But I think that they have to be based on real evidence. So, I'm going to continue to live in my world, which is very much fact-based.\n\nMaureen O’Hara:\n\nI think we have time for one more question, and we have someone back there who's got a mike.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nYeah, Mr. Dudley, I have a question. You mentioned that there was some nefarious behavior by banks. I heard you mention that there was some nefarious behavior going on by banks during the financial crisis.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, the employees of banks.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nOk, employees of banks. My question is, there was – some of the big banks, including J.P. Morgan and Bank of America, basically bailing out the government and the FDIC, buying institutions like Countrywide, Merrill Lynch, Washington Mutual.\n\nIn some of these cases, they were given winks and nods by the government that they were not going to be held accountable for let's say the sins of these institutions that they took over.\n\nBut then what happened, they did this, and then later on, these institutions were fined billions of dollars by the government. And I guess my question is would you call this nefarious behavior on the part of the government to do this to these companies that basically helped out the government and the FDIC, in taking over these insolvent institutions?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I wasn't part of any of those conversations, so I don't know what winks or nods were actually exchanged.\n\nLook, I think the banks are, people are, managers are big boys and girls. And I think when they were making these transactions, they had the ability to negotiate whatever terms and conditions that they wanted to negotiate.\n\nNow, I understand that there's some bad feelings after the fact, to the extent that the sins of the institutions that were acquired went along with those entities. But it'd be a little bit sad if you can have institutions do lots of bad things and then have them acquired and then have their sins sort of automatically forgiven because they were acquired by another institution. That would be a sort of \"get out of jail free\" card. And so I'm not sure that's necessarily the right approach either.\n\n[END OF SESSION]"

        "content": "Good morning.  It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak at this year’s gathering of the National Retail Federation.  Retail activity plays a key role in the U.S. economy, with consumption comprising about two-thirds of total gross domestic product.  As such, understanding what is happening in your sector is critical in assessing the economic outlook—and, with that, the outlook for employment, inflation and interest rates.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1  \n\nThis morning, I will be focusing on retail spending—an important element of household consumption.  But, I will do so in a way that’s perhaps somewhat different from the usual approach, focusing in particular on the connections between housing and retail sales.  I will argue that there have been some dramatic changes that have taken place in the way that households finance their consumption.  I believe—and  hope to convince you—that changes in the housing and mortgage markets have affected the willingness and ability of households to borrow, and that this, in turn, has had important consequences for the dynamics of consumption over the last decade.  It is an important reason why the economic recovery and expansion have been weaker than we would like, despite the efforts of the Federal Reserve to stimulate economic activity.  It also matters as we look forward.  The good news is that, while the current expansion is quite old in chronological terms, it is still relatively young in terms of the health of household finances.  Later in my remarks, I will talk a bit about the outlook for consumer spending in 2017 and beyond.\n\nIt’s worth starting off with some background in order to develop the linkage between housing wealth and retail spending.  Household incomes tend to increase as individuals grow older and become more skilled in their work and better matched to their employers.  This tends to continue until they approach retirement age.  This means that incomes are much higher later in life than when people first enter the workforce.  Ideally, households would like to be able to even out their consumption based on their lifetime incomes, raising consumption in their early adulthood years.  In general, this would mean that young people would consume a relatively high share of their incomes, while older people would save more. Indeed, young people might even wish to borrow against some of their future income so that they can enjoy some of those benefits earlier in their lifetimes.\n\nHowever, there are limits on the ability to shift consumption to earlier in life through borrowing.  One problem is that lenders don’t have a reliable way to compel repayment of such debts.  Consequently, the young may not have access to the credit they need to even out consumption to the extent they would like.  A pledge of assets—collateral—can help to solve this problem, since it can be claimed by the lender in the event of a loan default.\n\nFor most households, the main form of wealth is human capital—the value of the wages that the household members can earn over the course of their lifetimes.  But human capital cannot always be credibly pledged as collateral.  For funding of educational investments, government intervention in the form of the federally-guaranteed student loan program helps address this problem.  While private student loans exist, they typically require a co-signer with a strong credit record.  Moreover, these borrowing sources are broadly restricted to education-related spending only.\n\nThe second most important asset on the balance sheet of many households is housing equity.  So, in addition to being a source of shelter, housing can be a major form of collateral for borrowing for many households.  In fact, for those households that have collateral available to secure loans, housing equity is by far the most important form of collateral.\n\nWhat this tells us is that the performance of the housing and mortgage markets are important to the retail business.  When home prices are rising and housing equity can easily be converted into cash, we can expect to see relatively high levels of consumption, all else equal.  Conversely, when home prices are flat or declining, or mortgage credit is tight, this will put a damper on retail spending.  Events of the last decade have driven this point home in a very clear way.\n\nIt is well known that beginning in the mid-1990s and intensifying in the early 2000s, there was a massive U.S. housing boom that dramatically increased the value of residential real estate in the United States.  Over the period from 1995 to 2006, the aggregate value of real estate owned by households and nonprofits nearly tripled, rising from $8.6 trillion to nearly $25 trillion.\n\nA remarkable, yet not widely-known, fact about this boom period is that while home values were rising very quickly, borrowing was growing almost exactly as fast.  Rather than saving the extra wealth that was being generated by the housing boom, households were diverting a large share of it to other purposes.  Indeed, the fraction of every additional dollar of households’ housing wealth that was consumed seems to have been higher than that for financial wealth—such as investments in equities and bonds—suggesting that they viewed the increase in home prices as permanent.\n\nIn order to be able to assess the evolution of household finances more precisely, we worked with Equifax—a major credit bureau—to create a new database that tracks the credit files of a random sample of households over time.  From this consumer credit panel data, we conclude that between 2004 and 2006, households were increasing their cash flow by over $200 billion a year by borrowing against their housing equity collateral.  They supplemented that with another $185 billion through non-mortgage borrowing.  So, at the height of the boom, annual consumption was being supplemented by around $400 billion in cash flow from debt, much of it collateralized by housing.\n\nAs we now know, homeowners were mistaken in viewing the home price increases during the boom as permanent.  Things turned quickly as housing supply increased, home prices softened and mortgage underwriting standards tightened sharply as credit losses on residential mortgage lending climbed.  The rise and fall of mortgage securitization activity marked by tranching mortgage cash flows into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) exacerbated the downturn.  Home values began to fall in mid-2006.  By 2008, we saw a massive reversal in the way people used their housing equity to finance consumption.  People went from borrowing hundreds of billions of dollars per year and increasing their mortgage debt, to paying back hundreds of billions dollars and reducing their mortgage debt.  Households deleveraged even apart from the decline in household debt associated with the charge-offs from foreclosures.  Instead of $400 billion in net cash flow from increased borrowing, this net cash flow sharply reversed to negative $150 billion by 2010, with increased residential mortgage debt pay-down being the main source.  This rapid swing—a reduction of more than $500 billion on an annual basis—in the resources available for household consumption was associated with a sharp and prolonged slump in personal consumption expenditures during the Great Recession.  Typically, consumption growth slows but remains positive during a recession.  In contrast, consumption actually contracted by over $300 billion during the Great Recession.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2012, households continued paying down debt of all kinds—with the exception of student loans, which behave differently from most other forms of consumer borrowing.  Ultimately, housing prices stabilized and began to increase again in 2012.\n\nHowever, since that turning point in home prices over five years ago, something surprising has happened.  Nationally, home values have risen over 40 percent since 2012, and are now very close to their pre-crisis levels on average—just 4 percent below their all-time peak reached in early 2006.  Most other kinds of debt—first auto, and now, credit card debt—have joined student debt by starting to rise again, resuming their traditional role in financing consumption.  The surprising development is that housing debt has stayed virtually flat.  The previous behavior of using housing debt to finance other kinds of consumption seems to have completely disappeared.  Instead, people are apparently leaving the wealth generated by rising home prices “locked up” in their homes.\n\nThe implications of this development have been quite significant for the retail sector.  As I noted earlier, housing debt during the boom was rising at essentially the same pace as home values, leaving household leverage ratios more or less constant.  If housing debt had risen apace with home prices since 2012—rather than staying flat as it has—then we would once again be seeing housing debt producing cash flows available for consumption of about $200 billion a year.  Instead, households continue to divert about $200 billion annually to paying down their housing debt.  That’s a difference of roughly $400 billion per year, or about 3 percent of total consumption.  Relative to historical patterns the household saving rate currently seems quite high, given the ratio of household net worth to disposable income.\n\nSo, why has household behavior with respect to housing debt apparently changed so much?  As always, the data reflect the result of the interaction between the demand and supply sides of the credit market.  One obvious demand-side candidate is that consumers may have become more cautious about housing’s value as a financial investment, or its value as collateral for borrowing to finance consumption.  That is, households may have come to view housing wealth as more similar to financial wealth in that changes can be transitory rather than permanent.  Consequently, it may be viewed as prudent not to spend too much out of increases in these sources of wealth.  Additionally, the deep job losses that occurred during the Great Recession may have also impressed on households the need for precautionary savings against adverse income shocks.\n\nIn fact, the lessons from the housing boom and bust may have been even more traumatic.  There are many versions of this story, and most have a word like “scarring” in them.  Perhaps some potential homeowners, having seen the wild gyrations in home prices during the 2000s, have soured on homeownership altogether.  This would result in a reduced homeownership rate due to a loss of confidence in housing as a good financial investment.  Data indicate that homeownership has declined, especially among younger workers.  However, households in our Survey of Consumer Expectations continue to report that they believe that housing is a sound financial investment.  So, the explanation for our declining homeownership rate doesn’t appear to be that homeownership has lost its luster as an investment.  And, reduced homeownership doesn’t explain why people who still own homes have become less likely to tap their available equity to finance consumption.\n\nOther households may have been scarred by the experience of seeing their neighbors who borrowed heavily during the boom lose their homes and have their credit ratings badly damaged. Observing these consequences may dissuade current homeowners from making themselves vulnerable to foreclosure by borrowing against rising home values.  This would lead to an increase in a household’s precautionary demand for savings in the form of higher housing equity.  This increased equity cushion would guard against the risk that the household could find itself in a negative equity position in the event of a future decline in home prices.  With an equity cushion, even if the household were to experience a job loss during a future housing downturn, they would be able to sell their home, pay off the mortgage and avoid any damage to their credit.\n\nHomeowners’ desire to finance consumption by borrowing against housing equity might also be diminished by their desire to retain their ability to move easily.  The decline in home prices during the bust eliminated many households’ home equity, which is traditionally the source of down payments for households that wish to move and remain homeowners.  This mobility might be associated with a change of labor markets or an upgrade of your home or residential location.  It is possible that households have saved their newly recovered equity in order to rebuild the capacity to make future down payments and therefore restore this option to move.  It is certainly the case that mobility has declined since the housing bust, a fact consistent with this hypothesis.\n\nMany homeowners also took advantage of the Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary policy stance to refinance into very low fixed-rate mortgages.  As mortgage rates rise, there is a higher financial cost to extracting housing equity through a cash-out refinancing.  The pace of cash-out refinancing has indeed been very low even as housing equity has risen, consistent with this hypothesis.  But, owners have other ways of tapping equity, like taking out a second mortgage or a home equity line of credit (HELOC).  Interestingly, these forms of housing debt have been paid down even more aggressively than first mortgages.  So, the fluctuation in the level of mortgage rates also does not explain the change in household behavior.\n\nA final factor that may be reducing the demand for home equity extraction is a change in the distribution of housing equity in the population.  Even though aggregate home equity is back to pre-crisis levels, the data indicate that the growth in equity since 2012 has gone disproportionately to older, wealthier households.  Presumably, these households have less demand for credit to fund their consumption plans.  In contrast, those who would like to convert housing wealth into retail purchases have not yet seen their housing equity restored to its earlier levels—reflecting, in part, slower rates of mortgage balance paydown.  In addition, younger and less credit-worthy households also experienced higher relative declines in homeownership rates.\n\nWhile some of these demand-side factors seem to be playing a role in reducing home equity extraction, there is undoubtedly a strong supply-side effect in operation as well.  Our consumer credit data indicate that lenders’ adoption of minimum credit scores for mortgage lending and their considerably more rigorous underwriting standards for HELOCs have played a very important role in limiting consumers’ ability to convert home equity into new consumption.  The drivers of this change in lender behavior are complex, but are likely to include a combination of more regulation and stress testing of banks’ portfolios, more conservative practices by the government sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac—which tend to dictate underwriting practices for a large part of the market—and banks’ own experience from the crisis period, when so many lenders faced extreme stress and residential real estate seemed to be the main culprit.\n\nThe fact that housing prices declined so much and that the foreclosure process was so often drawn out may also have caused lenders to reassess how much to rely on the housing collateral as security for their loans.  In response, lenders may have shifted their underwriting to put more weight on the creditworthiness of the borrower rather than relying mainly on the value of the collateral.  This is consistent with the fact that mortgage credit is now much harder to get for lower credit-rated borrowers than during the housing boom.\n\nSo, what’s next? When and to what extent will households again start tapping home equity to fund their consumption?  Answers to these questions will determine the degree to which housing equity growth will add to income growth as a fundamental driver of consumption.  We do not want to repeat the experience from the housing boom, but there are prudent ways for households to access their housing equity.\n\nIt is hard to predict when the recent trends might change, given that some milestones have passed that could have reignited lenders’ and borrowers’ appetite for home lending.  First, home prices stopped falling in 2010, which could have been taken as a signal that a complete collapse was not imminent and that the worst was behind us, yet mortgage borrowers continued to divert cash to paying down their debts.  Second, home prices—and home equity—resumed their growth in 2012, indicating that the market was recovering.  Yet, far from extracting this equity, borrowers continued to pay down their mortgages thereby reinforcing the effect of the home price increases in terms of rebuilding housing equity.  Aggregate home prices and home equity have almost reached their previous peaks.\n\nTime will tell if there is a renewed appetite, on both lenders’ and borrowers’ parts, to convert housing wealth into consumption.  Perhaps, we will soon see a recovery in cash-out refinancing and in HELOC borrowing as a means for households to expand their consumption.  In this case, the household saving rate will begin to decline.  Or, we may need to wait longer for households to feel confident enough to extract some of their home equity, and for lenders to decide that expanding such lending is safe enough for their balance sheets.  Whatever the timing, a return to a reasonable pattern of home equity extraction would be a positive development for retailers, and would provide a boost to aggregate growth.  In the meantime, consumption growth will largely be determined by income growth, the trajectory of wages and the strength of the labor market.\n\nThe U.S. expansion is now in its eighth year.  By historical standards, it is long in the tooth.  Despite this, I am optimistic that the economic expansion will continue over the next few years.  First, it is important to note that economic expansions don’t simply die of old age.  Usually, they end either because inflation climbs and the Federal Reserve responds by shifting to a much tighter stance for monetary policy, or because the economy gets hit with a large unanticipated shock that the Fed and the fiscal authorities cannot respond to quickly enough, or with sufficient force, to prevent an economic downturn.  While economic shocks are, by their very nature, difficult to forecast, the risk that the Fed will snuff out the expansion anytime soon seems quite low because inflation is simply not a problem.  Not only are underlying inflation trends very subdued—for example, the core personal consumption expenditures deflator has risen at only a 1. 7 percent annual rate over the past year—but the economy is not growing much above its sustainable long-term pace.  Thus, while pressures on labor resources have been increasing, but quite slowly.  Finally, the recent strengthening of the dollar will put downward pressure on import prices and limit the ability of domestic producers to raise their prices.\n\nSecond, the household sector’s financial condition is in unusually good shape for this point in the economic cycle.  Household indebtedness is relatively low, debt service burdens relative to household income have fallen to levels not seen since at least the early 1980s.  Moreover, household incomes are rising at a moderate pace, supported by continued job gains and some modest strengthening of wage compensation trends.  If households and lenders again become comfortable with financing consumption with debt in addition to income, this will provide additional support to household spending and to the current economic expansion.   \n\nThe challenges in the retail space over the near term, therefore, are not likely to be a shortfall of aggregate demand from households.  Instead, it seems to me the challenges lie more in how to satisfy households’ changing demands for goods and services, and the medium through which these demands are satisfied—whether it be brick and mortar or  online.  Also, there is the important issue of how to retain brand loyalty in a world where information is ubiquitous and always near at hand, and it is easy to shift purchases among participants in the retail marketplace.    \n\nThank you for your kind attention. \n\n1 Andrew Haughwout, Joseph Tracy and Wilbert van der Klaauw assisted in preparing these remarks."

        "speaker": "William C. Dudley",
        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2017/dud170111",
        "content": "I very much appreciate having the opportunity to participate in today’s program. Improving the culture of financial services is an important issue for me and my colleagues at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as well as for many senior policymakers both domestically and abroad. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nWhy should we seek better culture in the financial services industry? We do this to achieve better outcomes in terms of conduct and behavior—and, with that, greater trustworthiness in our nation’s financial system. Greater trustworthiness will make it easier for the financial industry to perform its role in supporting economic activity and rising living standards. Greater trustworthiness will also make it easier to attract top talent into the industry. Without that, the industry will suffer.\n\nThe focus of today’s event is the role you can play as future leaders of the industry. Your firms selected you to attend because of your career success thus far and your potential for senior leadership. It is timely, therefore, for you to consider what type of leader you want to be, what type of firm you want to lead, and what type of industry you want to work in and influence. I have some views on all three, which we will get to in a moment.\n\nI am encouraged that members of the industry have convened here today to engage on these issues. I think it is important that the industry tackle this together. You can learn from one another. And, given the scandals of recent years, you really do have to sink or swim together.\n\nBefore the recent spate of conduct problems, there were times when one might be secretly happy when a competitor stumbled through some sort of misconduct. All the better if such a stumble generated negative publicity and headlines. Today, the situation is vastly different. When each new scandal emerges, the industry is painted with the same broad brush. This underscores the importance of taking both individual and collective responsibility for reform. You have a personal stake in improving bank culture. Your firms have a stake too. And so does the industry.\n\nThere are three messages I am going to focus on today:\n\nFirst, stay in banking and be good role models of the behaviors and conduct that we all want to see. It’s important. The banking industry needs your talents. And, if done the right way, it will result in a fulfilling career.\n\nSecond, banking does not have its own ethics—nor should it have its own ethics. The qualities that you value in other aspects of your life should be the same qualities you apply at work and encourage in your colleagues.\n\nThird, candid assessment is critical to improving culture. I invite you to think in particular about the incentives and norms of behavior within your organizations. Do they support or impair the qualities and principles that guide you and that your firm espouses?\n\nBefore expanding on those points, let me explain why I believe that reforming culture is important, and justifies the time and effort of not only of today’s program, but of the ongoing work at your institutions and collectively across the industry.\n\nThe manipulations of LIBOR and foreign exchange rates prompted the New York Fed’s work on culture. Of course, widespread misconduct did not originate with either episode. The timing, however, was significant. Despite the near-death experience of the financial crisis, new rules and regulations, and―in some cases―large fines and penalties, the LIBOR and FX events made clear that serious ethical and behavioral problems had persisted in the industry. I was particularly struck by how the manipulation of foreign exchange rates occurred even after the LIBOR fixing was widely known. The appropriate lessons from the LIBOR scandal did not seem to have been learned. That was both surprising and profoundly disappointing to me.\n\nThe LIBOR and FX collusions were not occasional atonalities in an otherwise harmonious financial system. They were not two remote tail risks that both happened to materialize, or just a bad coincidence. There have been too many examples of other misconduct to list. Wells Fargo is the most recent example, but serious misconduct is not confined to a single jurisdiction or a business model. The evidence, which now stretches over a decade, has only reaffirmed my initial belief that there is an industry-wide problem.\n\nIn light of these continuing and widespread failures, my colleagues and I recognize the importance of culture—that is the unwritten norms and accepted practices of an organization. The culture of each firm will necessarily be its own. But the pervasiveness of problems—across firms and countries—points to common, industry-wide norms that need attention.\n\nAn industry-wide problem needs an industry-wide solution. I also think that, when the problem is cultural, any solution must be industry-driven. It is the public sector’s job to establish and enforce rules, but rules face some inherent limits in shaping conduct and behavior. It is natural to adapt to the behaviors that we observe around us. A common illustration of this point is the speed limit. Most drivers move with the flow of traffic. They pay less attention to a number posted on a sign.\n\nThis is not to deny the necessity and importance of regulation, or to criticize any of the particular rules imposed in response to the financial crisis. But, we also must recognize that it is impossible to create a rule for every situation. Also, rules tend to be reactive rather than proactive. Rulemakers—whether they be members of Congress, regulators or judges—are almost always responding to events. And, even if rules could cover every situation, having a rule does not mean that people will always follow it. In many recent examples, the behaviors we observed violated rules already on the books. Thus, more rules and penalties alone will not cure the industry’s underlying problems. They are necessary, but not sufficient.\n\nWhat’s more, establishment of too many brightline rules may prove counterproductive in encouraging a good culture. For one thing, intricate and detailed rules can be construed as implying that the responsibility for good conduct rests with supervisors and regulators. For another, rules may create opportunities or incentives for legal or regulatory arbitrage—finding creative ways around rules. And this activity may, in itself, have insidious effects on culture.\n\nAs I see it, the problem occurs when an organization’s culture equates “what is right” with what is legally permissible, and when “what is wrong” becomes equivalent to what is legally impermissible. The technical legality of the rule, not the propriety of our conduct, becomes the arbiter of our actions. A proliferation of rules may prompt us to ask first what we can do, not what we should do. Legal arbitrage is intellectually energetic, but ethically lazy.\n\nAnd, as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara has observed, if you spend your time thinking about how close to the line you can get, it is inevitable that you will at some point cross that line. No one gets the arbitrage right 100 percent of the time.2 When you make that mistake, you will not only have a bad culture, but you will also have to deal with Preet Bharara’s office.\n\nTherefore, what’s needed is a better culture. Culture can help to fill in the spaces between and beyond rules. Culture also shapes our attitude toward rules. A strong, ethical culture is one in which individuals within an organization demonstrate to each other a commitment to certain first principles. These principles must align with both the private purpose of the organization and the public rules governing its operations.\n\nOf course, it is possible for principles to conflict. When that occurs, determining the right course will be difficult. But, the more you wrestle with that conflict, the better you will become at resolving ethical quandaries. Aristotle called this aspect of ethics “habit,” but I prefer to think of it as ethical muscle memory. The more practice you have in thinking about it, the better you will be at determining what is right.\n\nBankers will be more likely to think about what is right, as opposed to what is merely legal, the more often they observe their colleagues doing the same. I doubt that rules alone can accomplish this. Telling people to be ethical doesn’t make it so. Seeing others engage in ethical decision-making is, by contrast, quite powerful.\n\nWith that prologue, let me turn to my first message: Stay in banking. This might be a surprising message in light of my introduction. Nonetheless, banking is important work. Society relies on its financial system to “create substantial value for our society.”3 As investor and author John Bogle has written:\n\nTo fulfill its potential for creating value for society, the financial system needs talented and dedicated people at the helm. This is especially true for banks, which are indispensable to our economic system.\n\nAs the philosopher Onora O’Neill has observed, banking requires more than just technical competence.5 Bankers must reproduce their efforts and results with reliability. And, above all, bankers must be honest. They must do what they say and say what they mean. This is necessary for the financial system to be viewed as trustworthy. Without that, the financial industry cannot be effective in performing its key roles.\n\nCultivating these three traits emphasized by Onora O’Neill—competence, reliability and honesty—will help enable you to have a personally fulfilling career. The best doctors or lawyers do their work not only because it pays well, but because it is interesting and contributes an important service to society. I hope you feel the same about what you do. And if you don’t, I urge you to consider how your industry can become more professionally fulfilling. What is needed for you to feel better about your work, to sleep more soundly, to worry less about the risk posed to your business by potential misconduct?\n\nYour professional fulfillment will grow if you also contribute to promoting these qualities in others—that is, by helping to improve the culture of financial services. It is easier to be smart, dependable and trustworthy when you are surrounded by other people who also fit that description.\n\nMy second message is to reject the idea that a separate regime of ethics or morality applies in banking. I’m sure you have heard this, or perhaps even thought this, at some point in your career. Let it end there. We often teach our children by asking them if they would engage in that type of behavior at home. This is good professional advice as well.\n\nBankers have been criticized for their ethical and moral shortcomings. That criticism has legitimate grievances at its roots. There have been far too many instances in which bankers have not lived up to expectations. But it is also true—and I’m sure you have experienced this—that you have advanced in your careers because you have demonstrated personal attributes that anyone would be proud to possess. I mentioned before honesty, competence and reliability. You could add to that list hard work, perseverance and responsiveness.\n\nMoreover, if you are like me, your careers will have benefitted from teamwork—the good fortune to work with capable colleagues. Individual effort is essential, but success often depends as well on the contributions of others.6 Whatever list you have come up with, make sure that teamwork is among your core personal principles.\n\nI would also like to make a slightly different observation on banker ethics. What’s missing is not so much a personal commitment to good conduct, but rather a commitment to call out bad conduct observed in others. You might think it is a paradox or a contradiction to praise teamwork in one breath, and then in the next breath to call for raising the red flag when you see bad conduct in others. I do not see it that way.\n\nWe hear often that integrity is a corporate value. I think what is often meant by this is honesty—doing what you say, and saying what you mean. But integrity, to me, has an additional meaning. It means operating according to a single, internally consistent set of principles. If you are honest only in some places or circumstances, but not others—or only with some people, but not others—then honesty is hardly integral or integrated into your life and work.\n\nThe importance of this particular meaning of “integrity” was made apparent to me on a recent visit I made to the United States Military Academy at West Point. The faculty and students there believe that strong individual ethics are what make large organizations like the U.S. armed forces succeed. The commitment of cadets to living the ideals of the institution was impressive and humbling. They embodied the word integrity—alignment of word and deed in all aspects of life.\n\nAnother lesson that I took from West Point is that cadets commit to integrity because their careers—and, in combat, their lives—depend on others. We are in this together—this city, this industry, this country. And if we’re in it together, we all have to behave in ways that benefit the group.7 We have to behave in ways that merit the trust of others.\n\nWhether we are citizens or soldiers, the most important relationships in our lives are built on trust. In our personal lives, we take action when our trust has been betrayed. To reform financial services, we need to bring the same expectations of trust—and the consequences of a breach of that trust—to the office each day. If you would not tolerate a practice in your personal life, do not tolerate it in the office.\n\nCalling out bad conduct is not easy. Let me share with you another observation from Preet Bharara. A common element in many of the frauds his office has prosecuted is the failure of colleagues to call out bad conduct by raising their hands. This is so telling of a culture that condones or promotes misconduct. People see something, but do not say something. And, it is so shortsighted. It prevents problems from being addressed while they are small. By not raising their hands, these colleagues are “quietly adding risk to your books [and] invisibly enlarging your liabilities.”8 They are also tacitly encouraging bad conduct by skewing incentives.\n\nThere may be many reasons for choosing silence over raising your hand. You may face a conflict of loyalties. It’s uncomfortable to tell on a colleague. You may think that the problem will just go away, or that calling attention to a problem will harm the firm. Raising your hand is difficult. But, it is also absolutely necessary. As rising leaders in the industry, you need to lead by example. In doing so, you will make it easier for others to follow your lead.\n\nMy final message is a request that each of you commit to a candid assessment of yourselves, your firms and your industry. For Adam Smith, candid observation was a cornerstone of economic behavior:\n\nCandid self-assessment is essential to knowing where you stand and how you are progressing toward your goal. Industry groups here and in other financial centers are working on useful ways to measure culture—consistent with the maxim, “if it’s important, you will measure it.” But, assessment cannot stop there, and it cannot be the job of someone else—such as management, compliance, audit or a regulator. Each of us must also be reflective about our own faults. We must also commit to do better going forward.\n\nWhen it comes to making a candid assessment of your group, your firm and your industry, I would like to suggest that you devote significant attention to incentives. I believe that incentives shape behavior, and behavior drives culture. If you want a culture that will support your long-term business strategy, you need to align incentives with the behaviors that will sustain your business over the long haul.\n\nThere are many ways of encouraging certain behavior through incentives. Promotion is quite powerful, as is compensation. They are powerful, in part, because they convey values and community esteem. People work hard to earn money. But, most also work hard to earn the trust and respect of colleagues, peers, subordinates and seniors. If you want to know what behaviors are valued or esteemed in reality, look to see who is promoted and well-compensated and the behaviors that they embody. Do the results match what is said? Do they match your expectation of fairness? Do you aspire to be one of these individuals, not because of their status and compensation alone, but because of the esteem you hold for them and their values?\n\nOver the long haul, the economy needs a vibrant and trustworthy financial sector in order to thrive, just as the financial sector needs a vibrant economy to thrive as well. You are the rising leaders of your firms. You can help accomplish these aims. A strong and ethical culture in the banking industry will make it more trustworthy, and therefore more effective in performing its mission. It will also help the industry be held in higher esteem and this will help attract the talent needed to sustain the industry. I am encouraged by today’s gathering, and hope you will take heart that an improved culture in the financial services industry is both necessary and possible. Thank you for your continued efforts and your kind attention.\n\n1 Stephanie Chaly, James Hennessy, Thomas Noone, Joseph Sommer and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\n2 See Criminal Accountability and Culture, Remarks by Preet Bharara, Reforming Culture and Behavior in the Financial Services Industry: Expanding the Dialogue, October 20, 2016.\n\n3 See John C.
