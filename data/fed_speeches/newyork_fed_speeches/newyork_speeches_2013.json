        "content": "Good morning and welcome once again to the New York Fed’s Regional Economic Press Briefing.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak with you—and, through you, to the people in our District.  I am going to discuss conditions in the national economy and then on conditions in our region, with a focus on private, for-profit institutions, which have become more visible in the U.S. higher education market. \n\nAs always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System. \n\nNational Economic Conditions\n\nLet me begin by taking stock of where we are at the moment. Then I will address my expectations for the performance of the economy in 2014 and 2015. \n\nSince the end of what is now called the Great Recession in mid-2009, the U.S. economy has experienced 17 consecutive calendar quarters of positive growth of real GDP (gross domestic product). However, the compound annual rate of growth over that period has only been around 2¼ percent, close to prevailing estimates of the economy’s potential growth rate. Thus, we have made limited progress in closing the substantial output gap that was created during the recession. \n\nA similar conclusion is drawn from an assessment of labor market conditions. Although the unemployment rate has declined by about 2 ¾ percentage points since peaking at 10 percent in October of 2009, a significant portion of that decline reflects the substantial decline of the labor force participation rate over that period. It should also be noted that since the previous business cycle peak at the end of 2007, the decline of the labor force participation rate has been more than accounted for by a decline in participation of people in the prime working age of 25 to 54. \n\nThe inflation data are also consistent with this overall picture of an economy operating well below its full potential. Total inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator, has been quite volatile in recent years due to sharp fluctuations in energy prices. Core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy components and thereby may be a better guide as to underlying inflation, slowed from around 2 percent in early 2012 to just above 1 percent in mid-2013. In recent months it has shown signs of stabilizing, but remains well below the FOMC’s expressed goal of 2 percent for total inflation. Fortunately, inflation expectations remain relatively stable at levels somewhat above the current inflation rate. This stability should help prevent an undesirable further drop in inflation relative to our 2 percent objective. \n\nThat said, there are some nascent signs that the economy may be doing better.  For example, based on the first estimate, which is subject to revision, real GDP increased at a 2.8 percent annual rate in the third quarter of 2013, above the trend of the past four years.  And the most recent payroll employment report showed a pickup in the monthly pace of job gains.  The 3-month moving average rose back above a 200,000 pace after slowing to about 150,000 as of July of this year.  I hope that this marks a turning point for the economy. \n\nBut before we rush to this conclusion, a few more cautionary comments are appropriate.   With respect to GDP growth, it turns out that inventory investment contributed ¾ of a percentage point to that overall growth rate. Thus, because this impetus from inventories will likely reverse this quarter, the real GDP growth rate is likely to slow to around a 2 percent annual rate or a bit less in the fourth quarter. With respect to payroll employment, we have seen such bursts in payroll growth before over the past few years and have been disappointed when the pickups proved temporary and did not lead to a rise in the overall growth rate. \n\nBut, I have to admit that I am getting more hopeful.  Not only do we have some better data in hand, but also the fiscal drag, which has been holding the economy back, is likely to abate considerably over the next few years at the same time that the fundamental underpinnings of the economy are improving.  \n\nThe first thing to note is that federal fiscal policy in 2013 has been unusually contractionary.  At the beginning of the year the payroll tax cut expired while tax rates on higher income households were raised, a series of taxes associated with the Affordable Care Act took effect, and spending was reduced due to the sequester and the gradual winding down of foreign military operations.  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the cyclically-adjusted or full-employment budget balance increased by roughly 1 ¾ percentage points of GDP in fiscal year 2013. Over the past 50 years there have been only two other episodes of fiscal contraction of this order of magnitude, and both of those occurred when the unemployment rate was substantially lower than it has been of late.  Under current law, the amount of federal fiscal restraint will decline in 2014 and then decline further in 2015.  At the same time, the sustained contraction in spending and employment by state and local governments appears to be over. \n\nThe fact that the U.S. economy has continued to grow at around a 2 percent pace in 2013 despite this quite intense fiscal restraint provides evidence to the second key point, which is that the private sector of the economy has largely completed its healing process and is now poised to ramp up its level of activity. Key measures of household leverage have declined and are now near the lowest levels they have been in well over a decade. Household net worth, expressed as a percent of disposable income, has increased back to its average of the previous decade, reflecting rising equity and home prices and declining debt. Recently, banks have eased credit standards somewhat after a prolonged period of tightness. As a result, we are now experiencing a fairly typical cyclical recovery of consumer spending on durable goods. For example, sales of light-weight motor vehicles have increased steadily over the past four years, reaching an annual rate of 15.7 million in the third quarter of 2013, though sales in September and October have been somewhat below that average. \n\nSimilarly, after five years in which housing production was well below what is consistent with underlying demographic trends and the replacement demand for houses, it now appears that we have worked off the excess supply of housing built up during the boom years of the last decade. Housing market activity has begun to recover, and a widely followed national home price index is up 12 percent over the 12 months ending in September.1  Anecdotal reports suggest that this higher-than-expected increase in home prices is due to a relatively low number of homes for sale.  Due to this shortness of supply, there is reason to expect increases in starts going forward. \n\nYet another bright spot on the horizon is the fact that growth prospects among our major trading partners have improved following a few years of lackluster performance which induced a sharp slowing of growth of U.S. exports. In particular, the euro area appears to have emerged from a protracted recession and is experiencing modest but positive growth. \n\nTo summarize, while growth in 2013 has been disappointing, I believe a good case can be made that the pace of growth will pick up some in 2014 and then somewhat more in 2015. The private sector of the economy should continue to heal, while the amount of fiscal drag should subside. Despite near-term concerns, growth prospects among our major trading partners will improve further next year. This combination of events is likely to create an environment in which business investment spending will strengthen. As growth picks up, I expect to see more substantial improvement in labor market conditions and a gradual updrift in inflation back towards the FOMC’s target rate. \n\nHowever, the notion that the economy will grow more swiftly remains a forecast rather than a reality at this point. As is always the case, there is substantial uncertainty surrounding this forecast. Moreover, there is always the possibility of some unforeseen shock. Thus, we will continue to monitor U.S. and global economic conditions very carefully and will adjust our views on the likely path for growth, inflation and the unemployment rate accordingly. \n\nRegional Economic Conditions\n\nLet me turn now to the regional economy. A year has passed since Superstorm Sandy devastated the tri-state region. And even today, many of the hardest-hit places are still struggling to recover and rebuild from the storm. In fact, reminders of the storm’s damage remain visible in neighborhoods across Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island, as well as along the coasts of Long Island and New Jersey. On a more encouraging note, however, the broader regional economy has proven to be remarkably resilient. After a brief dip following the storm, the regional economy quickly rebounded and has continued to add jobs at a reasonably good pace. Moreover, the region’s housing markets have continued to show steady improvement throughout the year. \n\nTo help monitor the performance of the regional economy more generally, the New York Fed produces economic activity indexes for New York State, New York City and New Jersey. Based on these measures, New York City’s economy has continued to grow strongly throughout the year, and both New York State and New Jersey have seen some pickup in growth in recent months. As a result, a growing number of places in the region have either recovered or are close to recovering the jobs that were lost during the Great Recession.  \n\nMore troubling, however, is that Puerto Rico’s economy remains exceptionally weak; activity and employment on the Island continue to decline.  Our economists will elaborate on these trends this morning. \n\nPrivate For Profit Institutions in the Higher Education Landscape\n\nThe important role of post-secondary education is undeniable given the key role that human capital plays in economic growth.   However, the higher education landscape comprises different types of post-secondary institutions that provide different educational experiences. One such group of institutions—private for-profit institutions—have progressively become more visible in the U.S. higher education market.  For-profit institutions and their growth in the market for student loans and federal need-based aid is the subject of the special topic in today’s briefing.  \n\nAnalysis done here at the New York Fed reveals that enrollment in for-profit colleges showed explosive growth nationally during, and for some time after, the Great Recession. Interestingly, this growth in enrollment has leveled off perceptibly as the economic recovery has taken hold.  These patterns suggest that workers who were displaced from their jobs during the Great Recession chose to enroll in two-year and less-than-two-year colleges, mostly in for-profits but also in public community colleges. Now, with improved labor market conditions, individuals have less reason to get a short-term degree or may have returned to the labor force. \n\nStark patterns are also observed in the market for student loans.  Both the incidence of student loans and average loan size are by far greater in for-profit institutions than in comparable public colleges. Given the importance of post-secondary education in our nation’s future, and the key role that human capital plays in our nation’s growth, we at the New York Fed will continue to analyze the growth of the private for-profits in particular, and post-secondary institutions in general, in our region and the nation.\n\n I will now ask Jaison Abel to discuss economic conditions in our region.\n\n1 Based on the CoreLogic home price index including distressed sales."

        "content": "Good afternoon.  It is always a pleasure to speak with the different communities that make up our region, and it is especially gratifying to have the opportunity to speak with you, our future leaders.  So thank you for inviting me.\n\nI am especially pleased to be here at CUNY (City University of New York) Queens College, given the relationship that we have developed with CUNY through our educational and regional outreach.  This academic year we are hosting, at the Bank, a Queens College student participating in the CUNY Service Corps which is a program to provide students with work experiences in regional and economic outreach.  We also collaborated with CUNY for this year’s College Fed Challenge, our yearly competition where teams of students from area universities take on the roles of the members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and debate the appropriate next step for U.S. monetary policy.  A number of CUNY schools competed and professors served as judges, including your own Professor Thom Thurston. \n\nMy meeting with you today is part of our continuing efforts to understand what is going on at the grassroots level of our economy and to share what we are seeing. Earlier today, I met with a number of Queens business leaders, and the leadership of HANAC, the Hellenic American Action Committee.  Following this visit to Queens College, I’m headed to the Queens Chamber of Commerce to meet with others in the business community.  Subsequently, I’ll tour the manufacturing floor of Steinway & Sons piano factory. \n\nThe agenda for these visits is always packed, but that’s part of the point—to meet with a diverse array of people in order to get a comprehensive picture of economic conditions and issues in the regions we serve and a fuller understanding of the major concerns. This is our second trip to the Borough of Queens in the past few years and recent trips have also taken us throughout our District, to Upstate New York, Northern New Jersey, Long Island, Fairfield County, Staten Island, Brooklyn and the Bronx.    \n\nThese outreach trips complement the ongoing efforts of the New York Fed to assess conditions in our region, which I will discuss shortly. Among our activities, we monitor economic performance on a monthly basis, we tap into the insights of the members of our Small Business and Agriculture Advisory Council and Upstate Advisory Board, we have constructed a consumer credit panel that allows us to better understand the financial condition of homeowners and students, we have developed a “Regional Mortgage Conditions” dataset and other housing tools at the county and zip code level to ensure that policymakers and counselors are well informed, and we conduct a biannual poll of small businesses to understand their credit needs and availability. Interestingly, our most recent poll, released in May of this year, shows improvements in small businesses’ ability to get credit throughout the region, though it remains a major growth challenge for these types of firms.\n\nAs you can see, we have a lot to keep us engaged with the region. Much of this information can be found on our website, which I would invite you to visit and use as a resource. \n\nNow, I’d like to review recent developments in the local and national economies, and at the end of my talk will be happy to answer any questions you have. \n\nAs always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions\n\nStarting with the area’s economy, one of the greatest challenges in the City over the past year has been the massive disruption and destruction caused by Superstorm Sandy.  While areas of the New York City metropolitan region were hard hit by the storm, the devastation was particularly severe along the waterfronts of Queens—and in particular in Far Rockaway.  We saw and heard about the devastation of the storm first-hand from many of those affected, through a series of support clinics that we held in the storm’s immediate aftermath, as well as from many of our own employees who lived in some of the hardest hit areas.\n\nThe good news is that a little more than one-year later there has been a significant rebound in employment and economic activity across the five boroughs.  New York City has continued to see pretty solid job creation through this past summer, and, in stark contrast with past economic expansions, this is happening without any direct contribution from the securities industry—or, more colloquially, Wall Street.  So far this year, the city’s job gains have been broad-based, led by strong growth in industries such as education and health, advertising, computer services, leisure and hospitality, wholesale and retail trade, and, especially, construction. \n\nOf course, while it is reassuring that most of the city has bounced back strongly from this historic natural disaster, it is important to remember that the hardest hit communities, and the residents and businesses there, who lost so much, are still struggling to recover.  Many of those communities are right here in Queens: the whole Rockaway peninsula—from Breezy Point to Arverne—was completely flooded, as were neighborhoods like Howard Beach, Springfield Gardens, Lindenwood, and even parts of Flushing, Long Island City, Astoria and Maspeth.  Still, Queens as a whole showed strong resilience—employment bounced back from Sandy fairly quickly, and as of early 2013 it had already surpassed its pre-Sandy level. \n\nWhile many residents here commute to work in other boroughs, primarily Manhattan, Queens has a formidable industrial base of its own.  Jobs are prevalent in industries ranging from medical care to construction, not to mention printing and a number of other manufacturing industries that benefit from being in a large population center.  But Queens’ most concentrated industry is transportation—specifically air transportation which employs about 27,000 workers, about five percent of Queens’ jobs. \n\nEducation is another key industry in Queens and the city as a whole. And it is not just a job creator. The investment in human capital that education entails makes it a socially desirable activity.  There is considerable value from a college education both to the person that has been educated and to society as a whole.  The Great Recession and sluggish recovery that has followed has made it difficult for people to find jobs, and I’m sure you may be wondering about whether going to college will turn out to be a good investment, especially if faced with the burden of student debt, something we track quite closely. \n\nLet me reassure you, the benefits of a college degree remain significant.  Research we have undertaken at the New York Fed shows that young people with a college degree are more likely to have a job and they tend to earn considerably higher wages than those without degrees—and this is true even for those who may be underemployed initially when they first enter the labor market after graduation.  Although the labor market has been challenging for college graduates in recent years, I am confident that most will find work and transition into higher-skilled jobs as they gain experience and as the labor market improves.  \n\nNow, I’d like to turn my attention to recent developments in the national economy.\n\nNational Economic Conditions\n\nLet me begin by taking stock of where we are at the moment. Then I will address my expectations for the performance of the economy in 2014 and 2015.\n\nSince the end of what is now called the Great Recession in mid-2009, the U.S. economy has experienced 17 consecutive calendar quarters of positive growth of real GDP.

        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2013/dud131107",
        "content": "It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to speak here today.  My remarks are going to focus on what is called the “too big to fail” problem.  As you are aware, this problem arises when the failure of a large, complex financial institution threatens to cause such significant disruption to the financial system and the economy that these potential costs are judged as too severe to bear, leading to government intervention to prevent the failure.  As a result, the firm, by being too big to fail, gains an implicit guarantee at the taxpayers’ expense that it does not have to pay for.  I think there is broad agreement that such a regime is unacceptable in several respects.  The first problem is that it creates an uneven playing field between large and small financial firms, with larger financial firms gaining a funding advantage from the perception that they may be too big to fail.  The second problem is that this funding advantage creates incentives for financial firms to become bigger and more complex.  The third problem is that there is a positive feedback loop.  As the banking system becomes more concentrated and complex, that just increases the financial stability risks, making the too big to fail problem even more acute.  \n\nSo what should we do about it?  Today, I will evaluate three broad sets of choices: 1) Building a credible resolution regime and more resiliency in the financial system that together reduce the systemic costs of failure sufficiently so that large, complex firms can be allowed to fail; 2) taking steps, such as tougher prudential standards, that further reduce the probability of failure of such firms; and 3) breaking up the too big to fail firms so that no firm is so large that its failure would threaten financial stability in the first place.  \n\nTo summarize, I conclude that building a credible resolution regime is necessary but not sufficient.  Even if the single-point of entry resolution framework proposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which I very much endorse, is fully perfected, the costs of resolution for the largest systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) will still be significant.  I will argue that at least as much effort should be made to lower the risk of failure of such large, complex firms.  Not only does this include higher capital and liquidity requirements, which we are implementing, but also building incentives into the system so that firm managements will act more forcefully and much earlier to put their firms on more solid ground before they encounter greater difficulties.  \n\nFinally, I am not yet convinced that breaking up large, complex firms is the right approach.  In particular, these firms presumably exist, in large part, because there are scale or network effects that allow these firms to offer certain types of services that have value to their global clients.  These benefits might be lost or diminished if such firms were broken up.  In addition, the costs incurred in breaking up such firms need to be considered.  Finally, the breakup of such firms would not necessarily result in a significant reduction in overall systemic risk if the resulting component firms were still, collectively, systemic.  \n\nAs always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System.  \n\nDefining the Too Big to Fail Problem\n\nThe root cause of the too big to fail problem is the fact that the failure of a large, complex financial firm is likely to generate significant, undesirable externalities. These include disruption to the ability of the financial system to provide credit and other essential financial services to households and businesses. When this happens, not only is the financial sector adversely affected, but its troubles spill over and harm the real economy. \n\nAlthough there are negative externalities associated with the failure of any financial firm, these externalities are disproportionately more damaging in the case of large, complex and interconnected firms.  However, despite the label, too big to fail, the magnitude of these externalities does not depend simply on size. The extent of the externalities also depends on the particular mix of business activities and the degree of interconnectedness with the rest of the financial industry.  One significant element is the importance of the services the firm provides to the broader financial system and the economy, as well as the ease with which its customers can move their business to other providers. Another element is the extent to which the firm’s structure and activities create the potential for contagion—that is, the potential that a problem at one firm could spread more broadly through the financial system.  Contagion might occur along several different pathways, including the direct losses imposed by failure on the firm’s counterparties, the impact of the failure on the asset prices held by other leveraged financial institutions, or a loss of confidence spreading to other firms with similar business models.  \n\nThe presence of large negative externalities creates a dilemma for policymakers when such firms are in danger of failing, particularly at a time when the wider financial system is also under stress.  At that point in time, the expected costs to society of failure are very large compared to the short-run costs from providing the extraordinary liquidity support, capital, or other emergency assistance necessary to prevent catastrophic failure. \n\nThe market's belief that a too big to fail firm is more likely to be rescued in the event of distress than other firms weakens the degree of market discipline exerted by capital providers and counterparties.  Since the government does not charge for this implicit guarantee, this reduces the firm's cost of funds and incents the firm to take more risk than would be the case if there were no prospect of rescue and funding costs were higher.  The fact that firms deemed by the market to be too big to fail enjoy an artificial subsidy in the form of lower funding costs distorts competition to the detriment of smaller, less complex firms.  This advantage, in turn, creates an unfortunate incentive for firms to get even larger and more complex.  As a result, the funding benefit of being seen to be too big to fail causes the financial system to become skewed toward larger and more complex firms in ways that are unrelated to true economies of scale and scope. \n\nThus, the too big to fail problem consists of two intertwined issues.  The first is that the negative consequences to the financial system and to the economy from failure for a given set of firms are unacceptably high.  This is the financial stability risk.  The second is that anticipated interventions to prevent catastrophic failure create an uneven playing field.  Not only is this outcome unacceptable from an equity or fairness perspective, but it is also undesirable because it can increase the incentives for firms to become even bigger and more complex.  Over time, this may lead to a greater number of systemically important firms and expose the financial system to greater systemic risk.   \n\nThis suggests that we need to maintain our focus on two goals:  (1) Making the financial system more stable by reducing the degree of disruption when failures occur—that is, shrinking the size of the externalities—and by lowering the risk of failure in the first place, and (2) eliminating the artificial advantages that large, complex firms might have that create incentives for them to become bigger and more complex.\n\nOne more point deserves emphasis.  Only eliminating the competitive advantage of large, complex firms from the too big to fail subsidy will not necessarily make the financial system more stable.  For example, consider a regime in which interventions to prevent the failure of large, systemically important firms were impossible.  In that case, the funding advantage that comes from being perceived as too big to fail would be eliminated because such firms could fail putting the firm’s equity and debt holders at risk.  But, this would not be a good outcome from a financial stability perspective because the failure of such firms could still be catastrophic for the financial system and the economy.  Thus, we need to solve the “fairness/subsidy” issue, but do so in a way that ensures that the resulting regime is more stable, resilient and robust.   \n\nThe Fairness/Subsidy Issue \n\nThere is considerable debate about the size of the funding advantage of large banks that is due to too big to fail and how much this funding advantage creates incentives to become larger and more complex.  One reason is that it is difficult to measure the size of these effects.  For example, consider funding costs.  We can document that larger banks’ unsecured debt funding costs tend to be lower than those for smaller banks.  But the funding costs for larger firms across a broad range of industries also tend to be lower than for smaller firms in the same industries.  This reflects, in part, the fact that the debt issues of larger firms tend to be more sizeable and more liquid.  In addition, larger firms may be more diversified on average and thus less prone to failure, everything else equal.   \n\nThe measurement challenge, then, is to identify what portion of the lower funding costs at the largest financial firms, after accounting for these other factors, is due to a perception among investors that such firms are too big to fail. \n\nDespite these measurement difficulties, most of the evidence is consistent with a too big to fail funding advantage in banking.  First, during the financial crisis, we observed that the funding cost advantage of the larger banks grew substantially relative to the smaller banks as the crisis became more acute.  This is noteworthy because if the funding cost advantage is due to a too big to fail premium, then that premium should rise when the economic environment worsens and the potential risk of failure increases.  Of course, the Dodd-Frank Act has changed the landscape.  \n\nSecond, ongoing research by Federal Reserve Bank of New York staff shows that the funding advantage of large versus small banks is higher than the funding advantage for large versus small non-bank financial firms and non-financial firms when other factors are held constant. \n\nThird, the major rating agencies add an uplift to their credit ratings for the largest banks due to the prospect of government support.  While it is possible that the rating agencies are wrong in their assessment, what matters is perception.  If investors share this view or simply follow the ratings, then this should create a too big to fail funding advantage.   \n\nWith respect to the second consequence of the subsidy—the incentive for management to make their firms larger and more complex so as to be perceived as too big to fail and thus able to take advantage of any funding subsidy—this is harder to evaluate.  On one hand, this is not the only incentive management may have to get bigger.  For example, the fact that chief executive officer compensation and prestige are related to size may be just as important.  On the other, this still is a problem because it works to distort the structure of the financial system and makes—by encouraging the proliferation of large, complex firms—the too big to fail problem worse.  \n\nI conclude that while the funding advantage issue is very relevant to the debate on too big to fail, it may not be the most important issue.  To me, the unacceptable risk posed to financial stability from the failure of large, systemic firms is at least as important. \n\nSolving Too Big to Fail \n\nAs I see it, there are two broad ways of solving the too big to fail problem.  The first is to create a more robust financial system so that the failure of a large, systemically important financial firm does not threaten to take down the rest of the financial system.  In this case, the authorities can let the troubled firm fail.  Because failure is now credible, this should also eliminate the funding advantage from being perceived as too big to fail.   \n\nThe second is to take steps to prevent the failure of such large, complex firms in the first place.  This also reduces any funding advantage for firms perceived as being too big to fail, but without some of the negative financial stability consequences associated with failure.  I view these two strands as complements rather than substitutes, with more work necessary on both.   \n\nTurning first to the issue of reducing the consequences of failure, there are numerous elements of this effort underway.  Some are focused on making the financial market infrastructure more robust so that when a failure occurs the shock is dampened, not amplified and propagated throughout the financial system.  For example, considerable effort has been made to create incentives for firms to standardize over-the-counter derivative trades and to clear those trades through central counterparties.  Similarly, extensive work has been undertaken by the Federal Reserve and the major clearing banks to make the tri-party repo system more stable.  Money market mutual fund reform is also part of this ongoing effort.  \n\nOther initiatives are focused on reducing the financial stability consequences from the failure of a systemically important financial firm.  The major initiative here is the single point of entry framework for resolution proposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  Under this framework, if a financial firm is to be resolved under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC will place the top tier bank holding company into receivership and its assets will be transferred to a bridge holding company.  The equity holders will be wiped out and sufficient long-term unsecured debt will be converted into equity in the new bridge company to cover any remaining losses and to ensure that the new entity is well capitalized and deemed creditworthy.  Subsidiaries would continue to operate, which should limit the incentives for customers to run.  By assigning losses to shareholders and unsecured creditors of the holding company and transferring sound operating subsidiaries to a new solvent entity, such a \"top-down\" resolution strategy should ensure continuity with respect to any critical services performed by the firm’s subsidiaries and this should help limit the magnitude of any negative externalities.   \n\nI very much endorse the FDIC’s single point of entry framework for resolution.  I think it is the best plan for implementing Title II given the complexity and scope of large, global financial institutions, and I also think it is well suited to the U.S. bank holding company framework.  For this regime to work properly there needs to be a sufficient amount of debt outstanding at the parent company that can be converted by the FDIC into equity to ensure that the new bridge company will be demonstrably well-capitalized. We don’t yet have a long-term debt requirement—this is an area where we are still working out the details. My own view is that a holding company needs a substantial amount of long-term debt to ensure that the newly created bridge company will be considered fully viable by its counterparties. \n\nWhile the Title II single-point-of-entry strategy holds tremendous promise, there are important implementation issues that still need to be worked out.  Implementing the resolution regime on a cross-border basis remains one of the most significant challenges.  In this regard, I am worried about two current shortcomings: \n\nUnless market participants make the appropriate contractual changes that will ensure that the placement of the parent company into Title II will not trigger the close-out provisions of over-the-counter derivatives and other qualified financial contracts that are outside the reach of Title II’s U.S.  application, foreign counterparties to a SIFI will tend to exercise this right whenever it is in their individual economic interest to do so.  This would create significant difficulties.  Such actions could greatly complicate the operations of the firm during a time when it is already under considerable stress and could propagate stress more broadly in financial markets.  \n\nThere are two main courses of action for addressing this concern, and they are not mutually exclusive.  First, existing derivative contracts need to be amended and future contracts need to provide that the parent’s entry into the Title II proceeding does not trigger the close out option.  Second, legal changes need to be implemented abroad so that the one-day stay that applies to qualified financial contracts governed by U.S. law is enforceable against those contracts governed by foreign law.  Only by making these changes can we avoid the potential for disruptive close outs.  I strongly encourage the ongoing efforts to address this critical issue.  \n\nA second issue with respect to Title II resolution on a cross-border basis is that we cannot be certain how foreign authorities will react when the parent holding company is put into the Title II proceeding.  While the U.S. authorities have been in discussion with our colleagues abroad to enable the coordination needed for a smooth cross-border resolution process, uncertainties remain regarding the circumstances under which host authorities may either choose to take or be required to take actions such as unilateral \"ring-fencing\" that might disrupt the implementation of the single point of entry approach.  Thus, we need to continue to work with foreign regulators to iron out any issues ahead of time to remove these uncertainties so that the resolution regime will work well for global, systemically important firms. \n\nAnother issue with respect to the Title II resolution regime is the residual uncertainty about whether a particular firm in fact would go through a Title II resolution.  Recall that under the Dodd-Frank Act, Title II is not the default approach for dealing with the failure of a large complex firm.  For a firm to go through Title II, a determination must first be made that the failure of the firm and its resolution would have serious adverse effects on U.S. financial stability under the insolvency law that would otherwise apply.  This means that market participants will not know for certain which path U.S. authorities will ultimately take until this determination is made—allowing resolution under ordinary insolvency law, as contemplated under Title I, versus initiating a Title II resolution.  Faced with this uncertainty, investors in the short-term obligations that would likely be protected only under the Title II regime could decide to run.   \n\nReducing the Likelihood of Failure \n\nEven with an appropriate resolution process in place that ends too big to fail, the consequences of failure will still be messy.  Also, market discipline is only effective to the extent that those investors with their funds at risk perform the appropriate due diligence on an ongoing basis.  This suggests that a resolution regime by itself is not sufficient.  Further efforts should also be made to reduce the probability of a default.  \n\nA number of steps have already been taken along these lines that further reduce default risk.  The Basel III framework significantly raises both the quantity and quality of capital required of internationally active bank holding companies.  This risk-weighted capital standard is also being augmented by a higher leverage ratio requirement. The Basel framework will also require SIFIs to hold additional capital due to their complexity (more commonly referred to as the SIFI surcharge).  As a result, the capital buffer for the more systemic firms should be higher based on size, complexity, interconnectedness, global exposure and substitutability, so that their expected probability of failure will be lower than for less systemic firms.1\n\nThe SIFI surcharge acts as a penalty for size and complexity, leaning against any remaining funding cost advantage that might remain for a large complex firm even after a viable resolution regime is in place.  This should further level the playing field for smaller firms and reduce the incentive to become systemically important in the first place.  However, I expect that it will take considerable time for the surcharge to have a meaningful impact on size and complexity. \n\nWe also need to create new mechanisms and incentives for bank management to act early, well before resolution becomes necessary.  Early intervention is likely to be much more successful in preventing failure as compared to last-ditch efforts. These actions can take many forms—cutting capital distributions earlier, raising new capital faster, restructuring businesses sooner, and reorganizing senior management and boards of directors more radically when the firm is not performing well. \n\nIn this regard, the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) should bolster the incentives for early action.  The CCAR is a significant supervisory innovation intended to ensure that large, complex bank holding companies have robust internal capital planning processes and sufficient capital to withstand stressed economic conditions and to continue to be viable financial intermediaries.  Importantly, the CCAR takes a forward-looking perspective in assessing a bank’s capital adequacy, including ensuring that its internal stress testing processes address its unique vulnerabilities and exposures.  The CCAR should push banks to proactively manage their capital so as to be well prepared for the type of market stresses that could cause significant declines in income and capital.  \n\nOther steps could be taken to complement the CCAR.  One approach would be to implement a long-term debt requirement in a way that further enhances market discipline and provides incentives for regulators to promptly intervene if necessary.  Another might be to structure compensation practices to strengthen senior bank managers’ incentives to proactively manage risk.  For example, imagine how incentives would change if a significant portion of senior bank management’s compensation each year were deferred to be available to cover future capital losses.  I suspect that over time this would meaningfully alter management’s risk tolerance.  Also, in addition to the quantity of the deferred compensation, the form it takes could also affect incentives.  If most of the deferred compensation were in the form of debt rather than equity, I suspect this would also affect management’s risk tolerance and the appetite to cut dividend payments, reduce share repurchases or raise more capital more promptly when the firm began to become stressed.  The terms and the form of deferred compensation are an important tool that could be further developed to generate a better set of incentives consistent with our financial stability objectives. \n\nWe must also ensure that firms can respond to financial or operational weakness of any type by having robust recovery plans that get triggered long before resolution becomes necessary.  They should develop and track metrics that not only identify when they are on the verge of insolvency or default, but that trigger appropriate remediation actions whenever the firm begins to become stressed.  These plans should identify actionable options that the firm can take in response to financial weakness that will restore the confidence of the firm’s counterparties without the need for extraordinary official sector support.  They must also have disciplined processes that analyze the root causes of their problems and identify longer-term strategies that will need to be employed as other recovery options to restore capital and liquidity are being executed.  And firms must support the viability of their contingency and recovery plans by implementing the internal governance necessary to develop, test, update and implement them credibly.   \n\nSome argue that what I have proposed—higher capital requirements and better incentives that reduce the probability of failure combined with a resolution regime that makes the prospect of failure fully credible—are insufficient.  Perhaps, this is correct.  After all, collectively these enhancements to our current regime may not solve another important problem evident within some large financial institutions—the apparent lack of respect for law, regulation and the public trust.  There is evidence of deep-seated cultural and ethical failures at many large financial institutions.  Whether this is due to size and complexity, bad incentives or some other issues is difficult to judge, but it is another critical problem that needs to be addressed.  Tough enforcement and high penalties will certainly help focus management’s attention on this issue.  But I am also hopeful that ending too big to fail and shifting the emphasis to longer-term sustainability will encourage the needed cultural shift necessary to restore public trust in the industry.\n\nOne alternative strategy for dealing with too big to fail is to reduce the size of large banks by imposing size limits.  While I understand the motivation, it is important to recognize that imposing size limitations might not be a very efficient means of making the financial system more stable.  First, it could sacrifice some socially beneficial economies of scale and scope, especially to the global clients of large financial institutions, depending on how the size limits were implemented.  Second, the resulting benefits in terms of reducing systemic risk might be quite small.  As demonstrated by the thrift crisis, if many firms are all vulnerable to the same shock, ensuring that these firms are small and numerous won’t necessarily reduce the systemic risk they collectively pose to the financial system.  Third, the costs incurred in breaking up such firms also need to be considered.  \n\nOthers have argued in favor of separating commercial and investment banking activities of the large banks.  In my opinion, there are shortcomings to re-imposing Glass-Steagall-type activity restrictions.  It is not obvious to me that the pairing of securities and banking businesses was an important causal element behind the financial crisis.  In fact, independent investment banks were much more vulnerable during 2008 than the universal banking firms which conducted both banking and securities activities.  More important is to address the well-known sources of instability in wholesale funding markets and to give careful consideration to whether there should be a more robust lender of last resort regime for securities activities.\n\nEvaluating the socially optimal size, scope and organizational structure of financial firms is a complicated exercise, and so is establishing a viable transition path to a system of much smaller banks.  It would be helpful in this regard if advocates of the break-up solutions would develop detailed proposals that address the essential questions of how such downsizing or functional separation would be accomplished, and what the expected benefits and costs could be from such a restructuring. \n\nThe recent financial crisis underscores the importance of financial stability as a necessary condition for a vibrant economy.  An important element in improving financial stability is to reduce the expected loss associated with the failure of any financial firm to the point where default does not imperil the financial system and the real economy.  A holistic approach is needed that both provides a credible resolution process for large, complex and interconnected banks, uses enhanced prudential standards and initiatives to further reduce the probability of default and the social losses associated with a default, and that incents management to intervene early to address incipient problems before they threaten the viability of the firm.  Relying solely on resolution is not sufficient.  Until the Title II resolution process is used, there will remain uncertainties regarding how well this approach will work in practice—especially in a time of market stress. For this reason it is also important to continue to pursue a number of alternative approaches. \n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to answer a few questions.\n\n1 New liquidity requirements such as the liquidity coverage ratio also work to reduce the risk of failure by giving firm management more time to address problems before a funding squeeze becomes acute."

        "content": "The topic of how systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) will be resolved is a very important subject.  As we saw during the financial crisis, the failure of Lehman Brothers generated huge shocks across the global financial system that led to a deep global downturn.  That is not an acceptable regime and I am very glad we are working hard to change it. \n\nI thank the organizers for giving me the opportunity to make some short remarks.  Today, I’m going to take a somewhat broader view than some of the other speakers, focusing on two issues: \n\nAs always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System. \n\nThe first point I’d make is that I very much endorse the single point of entry framework for resolution as proposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).  I think it is the best plan for implementing Title II given the complexity and scope of large, global financial institutions and I also think it is well-suited to the U.S. bank holding company framework.  By assigning losses to shareholders and unsecured creditors of the holding company and transferring sound operating subsidiaries to a new solvent entity, such a \"top-down\" resolution strategy will facilitate continuity for the critical services performed by the firm’s subsidiaries.  This will reduce the costs associated with the failure of the parent company and reduce the degree of disruption to financial markets and financial stability.\n\nWhile the Title II single point of entry strategy holds tremendous promise, I think it is important not to declare victory prematurely.  First, there are still significant issues about how the resolution of a large systemically complex firm would work in practice.  Second, even assuming that our efforts to overcome these challenges are ultimately fully successful, resolution is still likely to represent a \"second best\" outcome compared to preventing a systemically important financial institution from failing in the first place.  After first describing some of the current implementation challenges associated with Title II resolution, I will return to this second issue. \n\nImplementing the resolution regime on a cross-border basis remains one of the most significant challenges.  U.S. authorities are working with authorities abroad on the issues that require international collaboration, but the financial industry also has a role to play in overcoming these challenges.  I encourage the industry to promptly address the matters that require action on their part. \n\nIn particular, I am worried about two current shortcomings:\n\nUnless market participants make the appropriate contractual changes that will ensure that the entry of the parent company into Title II will not trigger the close-out provisions of those over-the-counter derivatives and other qualified financial contracts that are outside the reach of Title II’s U.S. application, foreign counterparties to the systemically important firm will tend to exercise this right whenever it is in their individual economic interest to do so.  This would create significant difficulties because such actions could greatly complicate the operations of the firm during a time when it is already under considerable stress and would propagate stress more broadly in financial markets. \n\nThere are two main options for addressing this issue, and they are not mutually exclusive.  Existing derivative contracts need to be amended and future contracts need to provide that the parent’s entry into the Title II proceeding does not trigger the close-out option, or legal changes need to be implemented abroad so that the \"one-day stay\" that applies to qualified financial contracts governed by U.S. law is enforceable against those contracts governed by foreign law.  Only by making these changes can we avoid the potential for disruptive close-outs.  I strongly encourage the ongoing efforts to address this critical issue.   \n\nA second issue with respect to Title II resolution is that we cannot be certain how foreign authorities will react when the parent is put into the Title II proceeding.  While the U.S. authorities have been in discussion with our colleagues abroad to enable the coordination needed for a smooth cross-border resolution process, we cannot always be certain of the circumstances under which host authorities may choose to take or be required to take actions such as unilateral \"ring-fencing\" that might disrupt the implementation of the single point of entry approach.  Thus, we need to continue to work with foreign regulators to iron out any issues ahead of time so that the resolution regime will work well for global, systemically important firms.\n\nThe smooth operation of a resolution proceeding also depends on the existence of adequate liquidity in the early days of the process.  One of the key pillars of Title II is that, unlike a bankruptcy proceeding, the FDIC will have access to liquidity from the U.S. Treasury to help ensure an effective resolution.  While this access provides significant support for an effective resolution, it will still be important for the resolution authorities to provide clarity about the timing and the amount of liquidity resources that will be made available after a firm enters into resolution.  This clarity will likely be necessary in order to calm creditors and markets at the time of resolution.  Under the single point of entry framework, the intent is to create a highly capitalized bridge entity so that counterparties will be willing to stay engaged based upon the improved creditworthiness of the bridge parent and its recapitalized subsidiaries.  If successful, this will reduce the need for the up-front provision of external liquidity resources.  Nevertheless, to make the viability of the bridge entity fully credible, market participants must believe that the bridge company has access in a timely way to whatever additional liquidity resources might prove necessary. \n\nIn addition, under the Dodd-Frank Act, Title II is not the baseline or preferred approach for dealing with the failure of a large complex firm.  For a firm to go through Title II, a determination must first be made that the failure of the firm and its resolution would have serious adverse effects on U.S. financial stability under the insolvency law that would otherwise apply.  Because market participants will not know for certain which path U.S. authorities will ultimately take—allowing resolution under ordinary insolvency law, as contemplated under Title I, or instead initiating a Title II resolution—this uncertainty in and of itself could cause investors in short-term obligations that are likely to be protected under Title II to run.\n\nSeveral other issues are also worthy of note.  First, for the Title II single point of entry strategy to work properly, there needs to be a sufficient amount of debt outstanding at the parent company that can be converted by the FDIC into equity to ensure that the bridge company will be demonstrably well-capitalized.  We don’t yet have a long term debt requirement—this is an area where we are still working out the details.  My own view is that a holding company needs a substantial amount of long term-debt to ensure that the newly created bridge company is viewed as fully viable by its counterparties. \n\nWe also need to ensure that the holding company is structured so that the bridge bank formed upon resolution can easily downstream capital to its operating subsidiaries.  The ability to do this will help reduce the risks of preemptive ring-fencing by foreign regulators and runs by counterparties of the foreign operations of U.S. firms.\n\nTurning to the second main theme I would like to discuss, resolution is being offered up by some as not only a necessary element of the solution to the too big to fail problem (a proposition I agree with), but also as an entirely sufficient solution that eliminates the need for heightened prudential standards to reduce the probability of failure in the first place.  The argument is based on the view that, in resolution, shareholders’ equity will be wiped out and that some portion of the long-term debt will be converted to equity.  The prospect of this outcome will, it is argued, lead to a disciplining effect by the parent company’s long-term debt holders, who will demand higher yields now that the prospect of failure is credible.  This, in turn, will help to eliminate the implicit subsidy of too big to fail.  Under this theory, Title II would also limit the incentives for firms to become larger and more complex in order to gain this funding subsidy.    \n\nBy itself, however, Title II does not entirely eliminate the advantages of being large and complex.  That is because large, complex firms are more likely to go through Title II than smaller, less complex bank holding companies, who will generally go through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding.  Also, only large firms will benefit from Title II’s one-day stay on qualified financial contracts.  Finally, under the Title II resolution regime, the businesses and the franchise value of the subsidiary-level customer relationships will be maintained relative to a traditional bankruptcy proceeding, which in the past has often led to the liquidation of the bankrupt entity.  As we saw in the case of Lehman Brothers, for financial firms, bankruptcy can destroy considerable value. \n\nThis isn’t an argument against Title II resolution.  Dodd-Frank’s addition of Title II to the resolution toolkit was an important advance to regulators’ ability to mitigate financial instability.  But we must recognize that Title II by itself it is not sufficient to eliminate the advantages of being perceived as too big to undergo ordinary bankruptcy at the holding company level. \n\nMoreover, even with a viable Title II resolution regime in place, we must recognize that there still will be disruption to the financial system when a large firm fails.  This suggests to me that while a Title II single point of entry resolution is a very useful tool that we should continue to develop, we should view it as more preferable to prevent the failure of the SIFI in the first place.    \n\nIn this regard, I think we have made considerable progress by raising capital and liquidity requirements for large, complex firms.  In addition to the role of these requirements in reducing the probability of failure, higher capital and liquidity requirements for large, complex firms also have the ancillary benefit of offsetting any residual competitive advantage that might remain for SIFIs because of how they are likely to be treated under Title II resolution.\n\nThe Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress tests are important in this regard because they make the capital requirements for large, complex institutions forward looking.  What matters is not just the current capital ratio, but also what the capital ratio could be if a stress environment were to materialize.  The CCAR process is also useful because it focuses on the quality of the bank’s capital planning processes.  It is not sufficient just to have enough capital; the bank’s management and directors need to be able to evaluate the bank’s ongoing capital needs in a thoughtful and thorough manner.\n\nThe responsibility of the management of a large, complex firm does not end with capital planning.  Firms’ managers need to ensure that they can respond to financial or operational weakness of any type by having robust recovery plans that get triggered long before resolution becomes necessary.  Firms should develop and track metrics that not only identify when they are on the verge of insolvency or default, but also trigger appropriate remediation actions whenever the firm begins to become stressed.  These plans should identify actionable options that the firm can take in response to financial weakness that will restore the confidence of the firm’s counterparties in the firm without the need for extraordinary official sector support.  Firms must also have disciplined processes that analyze the root causes of their problems and identify longer-term strategies that will need to be employed as other recovery options to restore capital and liquidity are being executed.  And firms must support the viability of their contingency and recovery plans by implementing the internal governance necessary to develop, test, update and implement them credibly. \n\nThere is also more work that we, as supervisors, can do to reduce the probability of failure and to incent firm managers to act well before resolution becomes necessary.  We need to do more to create incentives to force banks to act sooner to steer away from impending icebergs—cut capital distributions earlier, raise new capital faster, restructure businesses sooner, and restructure senior management and boards of directors more radically when the firm is not performing well.  For example, one approach might be to implement a long-term debt requirement in a way that enhances market discipline. \n\nAnother reform would be to reduce the incentives of large, complex firms to rely on short-term wholesale funding to finance longer-term, illiquid assets.  Among other benefits, reducing a firm’s susceptibility to sudden runs associated with short-term wholesale funding will lengthen the \"runway\" for management to implement the strategic actions that would restore the firm to health.\n\nLet me conclude by emphasizing that these two paths—reducing the financial stability costs associated with the failure of a systemically important financial firm versus applying tougher capital and liquidity standards for such firms that reduce the probability of failure—are complements not substitutes.  We need to keep pushing forward with both approaches in order to make the financial system more resilient and robust. \n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions."

        "content": "It is a pleasure to be here today.  Does the implementation of unconventional monetary policies pose a threat to central bank independence?  My short answer, which I will elaborate on, is that while the threat is low, central bankers need to be cognizant of such risks, and clearly explain the motivations for their actions in order to mitigate such risks.\n\nThe best way for central banks to maintain their independence is to use all their available monetary policy tools to best achieve their objectives.  Because the use of our unconventional monetary policy tools has been in pursuit of our dual mandate objectives of maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability, I do not see the use of these tools as creating significant new risks to our independence.\n\nAs always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nTo start, it is important to be clear on what we mean by unconventional monetary policies. In my remarks, I am going to focus only on the set of unconventional monetary policies that are relevant today in an environment in which central banks are constrained from lowering their policy rate any further due to the zero lower bound.  I will not discuss the type of extraordinary interventions that occurred at the height of the financial crisis.1 \n\nA starting point is that the independence of the central bank with respect to its budget supports its overall independence.  The Federal Reserve’s traditional monetary policy framework has helped to assure this budgetary independence. The liability side of our balance sheet consisted primarily of currency and reserve balances on which we did not pay any interest. The asset side consisted primarily of Treasury securities.  There was no meaningful credit risk and the interest rate risk was limited because assets were generally held to maturity. This, combined with the zero cost of the Fed’s liabilities, resulted in the Federal Reserve turning over a large amount of earnings to the Treasury each year after covering all of its operating costs and retaining a small portion of its earnings to maintain a level of surplus capital equal to the amount of capital paid-in by member banks.\n\nThus, one key question is how this budgetary independence might be threatened through the use of unconventional monetary policies.  After all, some of these policies do have implications for the Federal Reserve’s remittances to the Treasury and, thus,  could conceivably create a potential threat to the Federal Reserve’s budgetary independence.\n\nTo step back, the Federal Reserve’s set of unconventional monetary policies has consisted of three major components:\n\nWith respect to forward guidance, it is important to distinguish between two specific forms that this guidance may take.  In the first form the central bank provides its forecast for the future path of the policy rate and, possibly, some sense of the degree of uncertainty around this path.  In the second, the central bank pre-commits to a specific future path for its policy rate.\n\nProviding a forecast for the policy rate by itself does not create any budget or reputational risk for the Federal Reserve, so I generally do not see the first form of forward guidance as posing much risk to central bank independence.2 \n\nThe second form of forward guidance—pre-commitment to a policy rate path—could create more risk for the central bank.  In particular, consider a scenario in which the central bank decided to increase monetary accommodation by committing to maintain a low short-term interest rate for a long time even if this commitment resulted in inflation overshooting the central bank’s objective in the future. I could see how this could create a potential threat to the central bank’s independence.  That is because the commitment could force the central bank in the future to conduct monetary policy in a way that was inconsistent with the inflation portion of its mandate. \n\nAlthough this second form of forward guidance could create greater risk for the central bank with respect to its future independence, this is not a policy that has been adopted by the Federal Reserve.  There are implementation challenges with this approach.  In particular, it is difficult for a monetary policy committee today to institutionally bind future monetary policy committees to follow actions that could conflict with their objectives in the future.  Without such a credible forward commitment, such policies would likely be ineffective in affecting expectations in the manner needed to provide additional monetary policy accommodation.\n\nIn contrast, I think there are greater potential risks to central bank independence from the Fed’s large-scale asset purchase programs and the Treasury maturity extension program.  These programs do create some budget risk for the Federal Reserve. The issue here is not that the Fed is taking credit risk because the Fed’s purchases are restricted to Treasuries and agency MBS.  Instead, the budgetary risks stem from the fact that these asset purchase and maturity extension programs expose the Federal Reserve to increased interest rate risk that could affect the level of net interest earnings and therefore the amount of the Fed’s remittances back to the U.S. Treasury.  If the Federal Reserve needed to raise short-term rates to attain its objectives, it would do so by raising the interest paid on its reserves. As a result, net interest earnings would fall due to the increase in interest cost. If the rise in rates were sufficiently large, the Federal Reserve’s net interest margin could turn negative, resulting in losses for the Federal Reserve. \n\nThe Fed’s earnings could also be adversely affected by asset sales.  For example, if the Fed determined that it needed to reduce the aggregate level of reserves through asset sales, the Fed might incur losses by selling these assets at prices below their amortized costs.\n\nAlthough this risk is real, I believe it is not a big threat to the Federal Reserve’s independence for two reasons.  First, the potential for this outcome is mitigated by the fact that the Federal Reserve has considerable non-interest bearing liabilities on its balance sheet—namely currency. These liabilities incur no interest expense regardless of the stance of monetary policy. This means that short-term interest rates have to rise appreciably before the Federal Reserve’s net interest margin turns negative.\n\nSecond, even if the Federal Reserve were to incur an operating loss either because of an increase in interest expense or because of realized losses on asset sales, the Federal Reserve can create a deferred asset on its balance sheet, obviating the need for funding from the Treasury to the Federal Reserve. In this sense, the Federal Reserve would retain its budgetary independence.\n\nIn the case where the Fed recognizes a deferred asset, its remittances to the Treasury would cease until that deferred asset was paid down. Is there a risk to budgetary independence that might emerge if the Federal Reserve did not remit any income to the Treasury for a considerable period of time?  My response here is that we should take a long-term perspective when we assess the potential fiscal costs associated with the Federal Reserve’s enlarged balance sheet.  The fact is that the Fed’s reimbursements to the U.S. Treasury have been around $80 billion per year in recent years, far higher than the $20 to 30 billion range that applied before the financial crisis.  Under most scenarios, the Federal Reserve’s total remittances to the Treasury will be larger than they would have otherwise been in the absence of the asset purchase and maturity extension programs.\n\nMore importantly, the Fed’s cumulative earnings understate the fiscal implications of the Federal Reserve’s actions.  To the extent that the asset purchases have resulted in easier financial conditions that have promoted stronger economic activity, this in turn has had a positive fiscal consequence for the U.S. government.  In addition, the Fed’s asset purchase programs have pushed longer-term interest rates below what they would otherwise have been, reducing the overall funding expenses of the U.S. Treasury.  Once we take into account the broader fiscal consequences of the unconventional monetary policies put in place by the Fed, they are quite likely to cumulatively have an overall positive impact on the government budget.  As a result, the use of unconventional monetary policy tools should pose no significant threat to the Fed’s independence.\n\nNow some worry that a large balance sheet may cause the Federal Reserve to deviate from the monetary policy that is consistent with its dual mandate goals with respect to unemployment and inflation.  The argument is made that concerns about the impact of policy changes on the level of remittances might constrain the conduct of monetary policy.  In particular, some argue that the Federal Reserve might pull its punches and not raise short-term interest rates in as timely or as aggressive a manner as needed to keep inflation in check.\n\nI think that the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet actually creates incentives that reinforce the pursuit of the Federal Reserve’s objective with respect to inflation.  Consider what would happen if the Federal Reserve failed to tighten in a timely way.  Inflation and long-term interest rates would rise, and this would necessitate a larger rise in short-term interest rates and even greater pressure on the Federal Reserve’s net interest margin and earnings in the future.  In contrast, by tightening in a timely way, the Fed would prevent inflation pressures from emerging and this would limit the need for a larger rise in short-term rates in the future.  The current size of the balance sheet would also discourage a premature interest rate hike.  In the absence of solid improvements in labor market activity, a sharp increase in short-term rates would unnecessarily reduce the Federal Reserve net interest income without any benefits in terms of achieving its dual mandate goals.  Thus, the current size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet actually create strong incentives to adjust policy in a timely way.\n\nA far more important threat to central bank independence than the use of unconventional monetary policy is whether the fiscal authorities act in a manner consistent with the central bank’s objectives.  As recent history has shown, central banks may not be able to achieve their objectives when an inconsistent fiscal regime is in place.  That is, monetary and fiscal authorities need to share the same objectives. When the objectives differ, fiscal dominance can become a major problem for the central bank.  For example, if the budget trajectory were clearly unsustainable, then monetary policy may no longer be able to credibly act in a way that keeps inflation expectations in check.  But I don’t think the issue of fiscal dominance is linked back to whether the central bank pursues unconventional monetary policies or not.\n\nAt the end of the day, I think that the best way to maintain independence is for central bankers to use all their available monetary policy tools, including unconventional monetary policy tools when needed, to best achieve their objectives.  The historical record is clear: Central bank independence tends to lead to better monetary policy outcomes.  But, the causality also runs in reverse: Good monetary policy outcomes help ensure monetary policy independence. \n\nThank you for your attention.\n\n1 However, it is important to note that some of those interventions did indeed result in tighter limits on the central bank’s authority as a lender of last resort.  For example, the Fed’s scope to provide liquidity to troubled firms in unusual and exigent circumstances—under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act—was curtailed somewhat by the Dodd-Frank Act.  This underscores the fact that central bank actions can have consequences with respect to independence.\n\n2 While I have categorized providing a forecast for the future path of the policy rate as a form of unconventional monetary policy, this may be a misnomer in that some central banks use this form of forward guidance as part of their standard communication strategy, and the Federal Reserve may choose to continue to provide this form of forward guidance even after its policy rate is no longer constrained by the zero lower bound."

        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2013/dud131004",
        "content": "Good morning.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to open this workshop and discuss key developments in the tri-party repo market.  In my remarks, I would like to give a brief overview of some of the problems that surfaced in this market during the financial crisis of 2008, recognize the improvements that have occurred since then, and most importantly, highlight significant vulnerabilities that still persist despite the progress we have made.  While we can feel proud of the enhancements that are currently underway in the tri-party repo market, today I want to underscore the fact that significant work remains to be done. \n\nThe tri-party repo market constitutes a vital component of the U.S. financial system.  It plays an important role in providing financing for broker-dealers that make markets in Treasury and agency securities, and is an important mechanism that supports dealer intermediation of credit.  The market also provides a secure investment vehicle for those that manage large amounts of liquidity and need an investment vehicle to park these monies.  We care about the health and stability of the tri-party repo market both because of our interest in promoting stable and liquid financial markets and because we use it to implement monetary policy.  \n\nThe recent financial crisis showed us that the tri-party repo market was inherently unstable due to deficiencies in the settlement infrastructure.   Prior to 2008, there was limited recognition of the ways in which adverse developments in this market could quickly transmit risk to other parts of the financial system with unforeseen consequences.  We now know, with the benefit of hindsight, that the market was overly reliant on massive extensions of intraday credit by the clearing banks to the broker-dealers, that market participants did not adequately appreciate the magnitude of the risk embedded in the role played by the clearing banks, and, as a result, market participants underpriced risk in ways that undermined the market’s resiliency during periods of stress.  \n\nThese vulnerabilities were made apparent in the spring of 2008 when the events surrounding Bear Stearns demonstrated the run risk that existed more broadly in the tri-party repo market, prompting the Federal Reserve to intervene in order to restore confidence and market functioning. This intervention took the form of the creation of a Primary Dealer Credit Facility in March 2008, and a subsequent expansion of the facility in September 2008.  The scope and scale of the market disruption were clearly very troublesome. \n\nAs many of you are aware, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York published a white paper in May 2010 that highlighted three critical sources of instability associated with practices in the tri-party repo market:  (1) the market’s excessive reliance on intraday credit from the clearing banks; (2) weaknesses in the liquidity and credit risk management practices of cash lenders and clearing banks that left them vulnerable to stress environments; and (3) the lack of a mechanism or process for liquidating collateral during periods of stress in a manner that did not destabilize other segments of the financial system. \n\nAfter the crisis, we asked the industry to help develop a plan to reengineer the tri-party repo settlement infrastructure to mitigate these risks.  The industry responded by identifying key changes that could be made to the platform to eliminate market reliance on intraday credit, thereby removing a key source of fragility observed in 2008.   This process was challenging at times, and ultimately required our intervention as a supervisor to move forward.  But the industry successfully developed a roadmap for reform that is the basis for the changes now being implemented.  The clearing banks are making substantial investments to reengineer their tri-party repo settlement processes, while lenders and borrowers are making adjustments to their business practices and technologies to ensure they are ready for changes that are occurring in the market.  When completed at the end of next year, we expect that these changes will substantially improve the stability of the market.  Indeed, the work completed to date has already reduced the amount of activity being financed on an intraday basis from 100 percent to about 70 percent, and we project that intraday credit usage will decline to no more than 10 percent by the end of next year.  By removing the clearing bank from the role of substantial intraday lender, and making tri-party repurchase exposures truly bilateral, we expect that market participants will have better incentives to manage their liquidity and credit risks more prudently. \n\nWhile these changes represent positive developments that will enhance the stability of the tri-party repo market, an important challenge remains.  Current reforms do not address the risk that a dealer’s loss of access to tri-party repo funding could precipitate destabilizing asset fire sales, whether by the dealer itself, or by the dealer’s creditors following a default.  Industry participants have yet to fully embrace the role they must play in finding a solution to this problem.  As a result, I would urge industry participants to begin work on this issue without further delay.  In fact, this is one of the motivations for convening today’s workshop—to start the dialogue. \n\nAs several of the speakers will discuss in greater detail today, when fire sales occur they can undermine the stability of other markets beyond the tri-party repo market.  The transmission of instability typically occurs as a consequence of increased margin calls and mark-to-market losses that strain firms’ liquidity and capital positions and put additional pressure on firms to further deleverage.  Such scenarios can have material adverse repercussions on other market segments and market participants. \n\nIt is vital that we take steps to address this risk now, during a period when markets are functioning without stress, in order to improve the resiliency of this market before the next crisis occurs.  This is especially important in light of the heightened threshold established by the Dodd-Frank Act for future central bank interventions in the event of a market disruption.  Even if this constraint did not exist, the experience of the recent financial crisis has served to strengthen our resolve to ensure that the market is structured in a way where risk is accurately priced and resilient to stress on a day-to-day basis, without the need for official sector intervention as a first resort.  \n\nAs many of you know, the Federal Reserve has been calling for action on this issue over the past two years, and all three Financial Stability Oversight Council annual reports have highlighted this as a significant issue worthy of our attention.  However, the diversity of participants in the tri-party repo market has made it difficult to move forward quickly with a market solution that addresses the risk I have outlined.  Industry leadership is absolutely critical to overcoming these challenges.  If industry is unable to play its role in achieving a holistic solution, regulators may find themselves forced to employ the specific policy tools at their disposal in their respective purviews to address the fire sale risk.  While such an approach may indeed enhance the overall stability of this market, it could also lead to unintended consequences that include reducing the efficacy of the critical role played by this market in supporting the broader financial system. \n\nI am glad that you are all here today to work with us to begin to identify the best solutions to the problem of fire sale risk in the context of the tri-party repo market.  I urge you to participate actively and express your ideas candidly.  I am confident that we will come up with the best solution to this problem by working together."

        "content": "Good afternoon. I am pleased to be here today at Syracuse University.  It is always a pleasure to speak with the different communities that make up our region, and it is especially gratifying to have the opportunity to speak with you, our future leaders. So thank you for inviting me. \n\nMy meeting with you today is part of our continuing efforts to understand what is going on at the grassroots level of our economy. Earlier on this trip, I met with government and business leaders in Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse to learn about some of the challenges the region faces as well as the collaborative efforts being taken to further economic development. The agenda for these visits is always packed, but that’s part of the point—to meet with a diverse array of representatives in order to get a comprehensive picture of economic conditions in the region and a fuller understanding of the major issues and concerns.  This is our fourth trip to Upstate New York in the past few years and recent trips have also taken us to Northern New Jersey, the boroughs of New York City, Long Island, and Fairfield County, Connecticut.\n\nMy outreach trips complement the ongoing efforts of the New York Fed to assess conditions in the upstate New York economy and throughout our District.  We monitor economic performance on a monthly basis through our indexes of economic activity and our survey of New York State manufacturers.  We also get important input on economic conditions from meetings with our Upstate Advisory Board, whose members are major leaders in the upstate economy.  We have constructed a consumer credit panel that allows us to better understand the financial condition of homeowners and students, and conduct a bi-annual poll of small businesses to understand their credit needs and availability.  The results of the latter have helped inform a series of clinics that we have conducted to help small businesses take the next step to access capital and identify new sources of funding.  \n\nAs I mentioned earlier, we are always eager to engage with students, and our commitment to our region includes a series of educational programs worth highlighting. First, Math x Economics, which encourages students attending Title 1 schools to consider preparing for a career in finance or economics.  And, second, our yearly Fed Challenge competitions, in which teams of students from high schools and colleges in the District take on the roles of the members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and debate what is the appropriate next step for U.S. monetary policy.  \n\nAll in all, there is a lot to keep myself and my colleagues fully engaged with the communities we represent. \n\nNext, I’ll review recent developments in the national and regional economy, and at the end of my talk will be happy to answer any questions you have about the economic outlook.           \n\nAs always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee. \n\nNational Economic Conditions\n\nLet me begin by taking stock of where we are at the moment.  Then I will address my expectations for the performance of the economy over the remainder of 2013 and into 2014.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Economic Research, which determines the timing of economic recessions and expansions, the current expansion began in mid-2009, more than four years ago.  However, the expansion has been subdued so far, as the average annual growth rate of real GDP has been just 2.2 percent over the past four years.  While that growth rate is near most FOMC participants’ estimates of the U.S. economy’s longer-run growth rate as well as those of many outside analysts, a more rapid pace of growth likely is necessary to reduce meaningfully the significant economic slack that developed during the Great Recession. \n\nConsistent with the modest pace of economic growth, improvement in labor market conditions has been slow.  Even though the unemployment rate has declined by 2.7 percentage points from its peak of 10 percent in October of 2009, there are still many people that want jobs but are not counted as unemployed because they are not actively looking for work.  An alternative measure of labor market conditions, the employment to population ratio, which is not influenced by changes in the number of these workers, has shown limited improvement.  Job loss rates have fallen, but hiring rates remain depressed at low levels.  Taken together, the labor market still cannot be regarded as healthy.  Numerous indicators, including the behavior of labor compensation, are all consistent with the view that there remains a great deal of slack in labor markets.\n\nNevertheless, as I have stated in earlier speeches, I see persuasive evidence of improving underlying fundamentals for much of the private sector of the U.S. economy.  Key measures of household leverage have declined and are now near the lowest levels they have been in well over a decade.  Household net worth, expressed as a percent of disposable income, has increased back to its average of the previous decade, reflecting rising equity and home prices and declining debt.  Banks have eased credit standards somewhat recently after a prolonged period of tightness.  As a result, we are now experiencing a fairly typical cyclical recovery of consumer spending on durable goods.  For example, light-weight motor vehicles sold at a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of nearly 16.1 million in August, close to the number sold in 2007.\n\nSimilarly, after five years in which housing production was well below what is consistent with underlying demographic trends, it now appears that we have worked off the excess supply of housing built up during the boom years of the last decade.  Existing home sales remain on an upward trend, and a widely followed national home price index is up around 12 percent over the 12 months ending in July.1  Indeed, anecdotal reports suggest that this higher-than-expected increase in home prices is due to a lack of homes for sale.\n\nHowever, a number of risks to the outlook are evident.  Long-term interest rates, including mortgage rates, have risen significantly since early May.  Since then, we have seen a sharp drop in refinancing mortgage applications, a more moderate but significant decline in purchase mortgage applications and fairly flat housing starts and new home sales.  Although I do not anticipate that the rise in long-term rates will lead to a downturn in housing, these developments do suggest that higher mortgage rates have cut into the upward momentum of the housing sector.  We will need to monitor upcoming data closely to assess more fully the impact of higher rates on the housing recovery. \n\nAnother risk is that federal fiscal policy could exert further restraint on the economy during the rest of this year and in 2014.  It is difficult to assess how much of the contractionary effects from sequestration, for example, have already occurred, or still remain ahead.  A related issue is the high degree of uncertainty about fiscal policy.  In coming weeks, Congress will be considering how to fund the government for the next fiscal year and will also be debating what to do about the debt limit.   This creates uncertainty about the fiscal outlook and may exert a restraining influence on household and business spending.   \n\nOne other risk to highlight is the global economic outlook.  Even though the euro area appears to have begun to grow again after a protracted recession, growth in that area is still expected to be fairly weak at best.  In addition, growth in many of the largest emerging economies has slowed, and some of the countries with large trade and current account imbalances have seen their financial markets and currencies come under pressure.  If growth abroad were to slow, this could impede the growth of U.S. exports and this could result in less strength in manufacturing production and employment in the U.S.\n\nThus, returning to an analogy I have used in previous speeches, I see the economy in a tug-of-war between these headwinds and underlying fundamental improvement, with a great deal of uncertainty over when the improvement in the underlying fundamentals will prevail.     \n\nIn the end, my best guess is that growth for all of 2013, measured on a Q4/Q4 basis, will be near the post-recession average. But I believe a good case can be made that the pace of growth will pick up some in 2014.  The private sector of the economy should continue to heal, while the amount of fiscal drag should subside.  I also expect that, despite the near-term concerns, growth prospects among our major trading partners will improve next year.  And this combination of events is likely to create an environment in which business investment spending will strengthen.  However, the notion that the economy will grow more swiftly remains a forecast rather than a reality at this point. \n\nTurning to the inflation outlook, total inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator, has fluctuated recently with short-term movements in energy prices, but it continues to run below the FOMC’s expressed goal of 2 percent.   Core inflation, that is, excluding food and energy, slowed in late 2012 and early 2013 to well below 2 percent, although it has shown signs of stabilizing in the last couple of months.  \n\nA decomposition of core inflation reveals that the most recent slowing of inflation has been largely confined to core goods, whereas the rate of increase of core services has been relatively steady.  Such was not the case in 2010—the previous instance of a significant slowing of inflation.  In addition, inflation expectations so far have remained relatively stable at levels somewhat above the current inflation rate. This should help prevent an undesirable further drop in inflation relative to our 2 percent objective.  Thus, I anticipate that inflation will firm further in the months ahead and move toward the FOMC’s longer-run objective.  Still, the FOMC recognizes that inflation persistently below 2 percent could pose risks to economic performance.\n\nAs is always the case, there is substantial uncertainty surrounding this forecast. Moreover, there is always the possibility of some unforeseen shock. Thus, we will be monitoring U.S. and global economic conditions very carefully and will adjust our views on the likely path for growth, inflation and the unemployment rate accordingly in response to new information.\n\nSo what does this all portend for monetary policy?  As you are aware, at last week’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee we made no changes to our monetary policy.  In particular, the Committee decided to continue purchasing long-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities at a monthly pace of $45 billion and $40 billion, respectively.  The FOMC statement reaffirmed the Committee’s intention to “continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.”2 \n\nWe also reaffirmed our forward guidance with respect to the federal funds rate.  The statement notes that the Committee “decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.”3 \n\nOne noteworthy question that emerged following the meeting was why the Committee did not begin to reduce the pace of asset purchases. Although I can’t speak for the Committee, I can provide some reasons for my own decision.\n\nTo begin to taper, I have two tests that must be passed: (1) evidence that the labor market has shown improvement, and (2) information about the economy’s forward momentum that makes me confident that labor market improvement will continue in the future. So far, I think we have made progress with respect to these metrics, but have not yet achieved success.\n\nWith respect to the first metric, we have seen labor market improvement since the program began last September. Over this time period, the unemployment rate has declined to 7.3 percent from 8.1 percent.  However, at the same time, this decline in the unemployment rate overstates the degree of improvement. Other metrics of labor market conditions, such as the hiring, job-openings, job-finding rate, quits rate and the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio, collectively indicate a much more modest improvement in labor market conditions compared to that suggested by the decline in the unemployment rate. In particular, it is still hard for those who are unemployed to find jobs. Currently, there are three unemployed workers per job opening, as opposed to an average of two during the period from 2003 to 2007.\n\nWith respect to the second metric—confidence that the economic recovery is strong enough to generate sustained labor market improvement—I don’t think we have yet passed that test. The economy has not picked up forward momentum and a 2 percent growth rate—even if sustained—might not be sufficient to generate further improvement in labor market conditions. Moreover, as I noted earlier, fiscal uncertainties loom very large right now as Congress considers the issues of funding the government and raising the debt limit ceiling.  Assuming no change in my assessment of the efficacy and costs associated with the purchase program, I’d like to see economic news that makes me more confident that we will see continued improvement in the labor market. Then I would feel comfortable that the time had come to cut the pace of asset purchases.4 \n\nRegional Economic Conditions\n\nLet me now turn to economic conditions in the region. The upstate New York economy is continuing to grow, but at a pace somewhat slower than the national economy. In part, this reflects the fact that the U.S. economy is recovering from a much deeper and more severe recession than Upstate New York. As the national economy continues to heal, places like Upstate New York, which didn’t see a huge boom and bust in housing and their economies before the Great Recession, don’t have as much ground to make up.   \n\nBut the region’s slow economic growth during the recovery also reflects the reemergence of historical trends—Upstate New York hasn’t tended to perform as well as the rest of the country during economic expansions. Like many economies in the Northeast, Upstate has tended to grow slowly in recent decades, as the population has shifted to other parts of the country and the once dominant manufacturing industry has shrunk considerably.\n\nThese same trends are playing out in the Syracuse area. Like Upstate New York more generally, the recession in Syracuse was not as deep as the nation’s.  However, the Syracuse area experienced a deeper recession than Upstate as a whole, losing about 13,000 jobs during the downturn.  The area’s recovery has lagged behind Upstate.  So far, Syracuse has gained back less than half of the jobs that it lost.\n\nRecent job growth has been led by the region’s education and health sectors. Together, these sectors have added stability to the local economy and provided a foundation for growth. Over the past several years, during both recession and recovery, these sectors have added about 1,000 jobs each year to the local economy. The leisure and hospitality sector, as well as the retail sector, has also been a solid source of job growth for the area. However, as you probably well know, job losses in the region’s manufacturing industry have weighed against these gains. About 9,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost since the start of the Great Recession. And, while a slow jobs recovery began in the nation’s manufacturing sector in 2010, Syracuse has continued to lose these jobs in recent years—a painful process for the area to continue to endure to be sure.\n\nNonetheless, these trends have resulted in a more diversified economy. In fact, the share of workers employed in the metro area’s manufacturing sector is now just 8 percent, just below the nation’s 9 percent share. The private education and health sectors have emerged as the largest industries, and now employ one in five workers. So, the face of the local economy has changed dramatically through a somewhat painful restructuring process. But I believe this process is reaching its conclusion, and the resulting more diversified local economy is providing a strong foundation on which Syracuse can build going forward.\n\nHence my interest in the collaborative efforts of the business, academic and health sectors to further economic growth. These efforts capitalize on the strengths of the region and may well be a good way to further economic development not only in Syracuse but in Buffalo and Rochester as well. Each metro area has a strong university, a strong health sector and a business community all eager to find ways to leverage local assets and boost economic development.\n\nLooking forward, I believe that the colleges and universities in Syracuse will help drive the region’s economy in the years to come. Syracuse can build on these assets by continuing to make partnerships between industry and higher education a high priority. When companies and universities work together, they can become a powerful engine for innovation and economic growth. These collaborations are a key ingredient to helping improve the competitiveness of local businesses, the universities themselves, and their regions, and we should take every opportunity to exploit these partnerships as much as possible to unleash their full potential.\n\nCollege graduates finding jobs\n\nLet me finish off by saying a few words about the value of education.  There is no doubt that the Great Recession and sluggish recovery that followed has made it difficult for many people to find jobs. I’m sure many of you here today are worried about finding a good job after you graduate, and you may be wondering whether going to college will turn out to have been a good investment.\n\nLet me reassure you, despite the weak labor market conditions that have prevailed since the Great Recession, the benefits of a college degree remain significant. Research we have undertaken at the New York Fed clearly shows that young people with a college degree are more likely to have a job and they tend to earn higher wages than those without degrees—and this is true even for those who may be underemployed initially when they first enter the labor market after graduation. In fact, our research finds that to some extent, it has always proved challenging for college graduates to transition into the labor market, even during economic expansions, but as time passes, and the graduate’s experience grows, the transition generally gets accomplished successfully. Although it is true that the labor market has been more difficult for college graduates in recent years, I am confident that most will find work and transition into higher-skilled jobs as they gain experience and as the labor market improves.\n\nThank you for your kind attention and I will now be happy to take some questions.\n\n1 Based on the CoreLogic home price index including distressed sales.\n\n2 Federal Open Market Committee statement, September 18, 2013\n\n3 Federal Open Market Committee statement, September 18, 2013\n\n4 For more thoughts on the monetary policy outlook, I refer you to the speech made earlier this week: Reflections on the Economic Outlook and the Implications for Monetary Policy."

        "content": "Thank you all for being here to commemorate the opening of the centennial exhibit for the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at the Museum of American Finance, just a few blocks from the New York Fed’s landmark head office at 33 Liberty Street.  I would like to say thank you to our friends at the Museum for their work and interest in the Fed and for supporting us in organizing this event.   \n\nBefore making some brief remarks about the centennial, I would also like to acknowledge some of the people in attendance tonight.  We have two former New York Fed presidents here this evening: Jerry Corrigan and Bill McDonough. \n\nI met Jerry, the seventh president of the Bank, when I was still wet behind the ears.  I was just out of graduate school at the Board of Governors in Washington, but Jerry was already a force to be reckoned with and a part of Paul Volcker’s inner circle.  Jerry’s tenure as president had many memorable moments, including the October 1987 stock market “break”.  Jerry, of course, was instrumental in working with then Chairman Alan Greenspan in devising a response to provide liquidity to the market, and an episode that could have ended in financial crisis soon passed.  Jerry also tackled many other difficult issues during his tenure, including the Latin-American debt crisis and the development of the first Basel accord. \n\nWe also have Bill McDonough, the eighth president of the Bank, who built on the accomplishments of Jerry’s tenure, and made great strides in connecting the New York Fed to the broader region.  At the same time, he helped ensure that the Federal Reserve was prepared to face new, salient challenges presented by developments in the global economic and financial landscape.  During his tenure, the city, the country and the Bank experienced a very significant crisis on September 11, 2001.  Under Bill’s leadership, New York Fed staff worked tirelessly on Liberty Street, supporting the efforts of first responders, while ensuring that financial markets continued to operate and serve their vital function in the U.S. and global economy.  \n\nA number of the members of our Board of Directors, including Chairwoman Rafferty, are with us, as is  one of the Federal Reserve’s friends from the international central banking community: Mervyn King, the recent head of the Bank of England.  Mervyn and his wife recently moved to New York City, so we should extend  a warm welcome to them.  For Mervyn, I am guessing that one hundred years may not seem like a long time, given that the Bank of England is over 300 years old, but I am sure he will graciously allow us our moment.  We are also joined by many other friends and associates of the New York Fed, and a great number of our current and former staff. \n\nFor 100 years the Federal Reserve has been an essential contributor to American economic prosperity and stability and that record is reflected in this fascinating exhibit.  Rather than focus on its achievements during my brief remarks this evening, I thought I’d highlight what I think makes the institution that I have the honor of leading, the New York Fed, such a remarkable place within this extraordinary System. \n\nFirst, we are a bank within government.  That means we not only have researchers, supervisors and market analysts, but we also provide banking services and possess significant operational capabilities.  We accept deposits, make loans and operate the System Open Market Account for the Federal Open Market Committee.  When exigent and unusual circumstances require extraordinary operations, be it in a financial crisis or to implement unconventional monetary policies, we stand ready.  Our operational capabilities complement our more conventional central bank policy role in a way that is, I think, very special within the Federal Reserve System.\n\nSecond, the New York Fed is a vital component of the international role played by the Federal Reserve System.  This can be seen in our Central Bank International Account Services, where we have more than $3 trillion in foreign assets under our management.  Some of those assets glisten on the bedrock of Manhattan.  The gold vault at 33 Liberty Street remains the world’s largest depository of monetary gold held on behalf of foreign governments, central banks and official international organizations.   This international orientation was also very much in evidence during the crisis as we negotiated foreign exchange swap agreements with a number of foreign central banks and then operationalized the provision of dollar liquidity worldwide through a coordinated system of dollar auctions.  \n\nThird, and perhaps most importantly, we have an unusually talented and dedicated group of people working at the Bank who are committed to promoting the mission of the institution and serving the public interest.  While we may not, on occasion, be as nimble as we might like, the attitude of our staff is to always find a way, to do whatever it takes (within the law and the scope of our responsibilities, of course), and to not rest until we have come up with the best plan of action.  That attitude was most clearly and publicly evident during the Bank’s response to the financial crisis, where we played a critical role within the System in preventing a financial panic from turning into a world-wide depression.  We continue to display that spirit each and every day at the Bank.    \n\nAnd it is that attitude, ability and esprit de corps that will no doubt allow us and the System to meet the important challenges on the road ahead.  I will focus briefly on a few such challenges:\n\nThe first will be on the monetary policy front.  The Federal Reserve has engaged in a set of unconventional monetary policies in recent years.  These policies have been necessary because the FOMC could not ease monetary policy further by conventional means—the federal funds rate was constrained by the so-called “zero lower bound”.   Exit from these unconventional set of policies is certainly feasible—the ability to pay interest on excess reserves gives us a viable tool to manage monetary policy even with an enlarged balance sheet, and the New York Fed is prepared to execute on this mission, as we always are.  But we do have to be a bit humble about what we don’t know. There will undoubtedly be communications and operational challenges and unexpected consequences.  We will need to be sufficiently agile so that we can best achieve our dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability. \n\nThe second challenge for us at the New York Fed, and within the regulatory community more generally, will be in staying the course and implementing a regulatory regime in which no institutions are “too big to fail” (TBTF).  TBTF is wrong for several reasons.  It creates an unfair disparity between large and small institutions. In addition to being unfair, it creates greater risks to financial stability by encouraging greater size and complexity.  We have made considerable progress toward ending TBTF—raising capital and liquidity requirements for the largest, most systemic banks—but there is a ways to go.  In particular, to paraphrase former New York Fed President Tim Geithner, while the single point of entry concept “beats no plan”, significant barriers to achieving a cross border resolution remain, and there are still insufficient incentives in place for firms to take corrective actions early on to prevent their failure in the first place.      \n\nThe third challenge for the Federal Reserve is to put financial stability on par with monetary policy.  As our experience from 2007 to 2009 has demonstrated, monetary policy cannot work properly when there is financial instability. When financial instability occurs, it disturbs market functioning and can impair bank balance sheets in a way that disrupts their financial intermediation function, constraining the availability of credit for households and businesses. This, in turn, can lead to further reductions in aggregate demand that put additional stress on the weakened financial system.  Financial stability cannot be subordinated to any other priority. \n\nThe fourth challenge is to sustain and enhance the capabilities of the New York Fed.  This starts most obviously in continuing to attract, develop and retain the best people.  But it also extends to tending to the so-called culture of the institution—for example, ensuring that good ideas rise to the top no matter where they originate, and that people feel comfortable to challenge the conventional wisdom.  \n\nThese challenges are energizing, and that’s why being president of the New York Fed is the greatest job in the world.  And I am confident that, because of the talent and dedication of our staff, the New York Fed will succeed in surmounting the challenges it faces now and will face over the next 100 years.  \n\nAnd to drive home the point of our staff’s dedication, I would like to highlight the efforts of one person, Rosemary Lazenby, who has made this exhibit possible.  Rosemary is the longest tenured employee at the Bank—55 years—she is our resident historian and curator and she has delayed her retirement in order to develop this centennial exhibit.  Her efforts are just another example of what really glistens at 33 Liberty Street (and I am not referring to the gold in our vault).  Thank you Rosemary, and thank you all for coming out this this evening to enjoy the centennial exhibit."

        "content": "Thank you, Dean Gautschi, for that kind introduction.  It is a pleasure to be here today at Fordham University and I thank the Fordham Wall Street Council for hosting me.  This morning my remarks will focus on the U.S. economic outlook. \n\nI am also going to discuss a new tool that the New York Fed will  begin to test—an overnight, fixed-rate full allotment reverse repo facility.  I want to dispel any misconceptions about why we are doing this testing.  The introduction of this facility is not a precursor to a change in the stance of monetary policy.  Instead, the goal of this new facility is to improve our control over overnight interest rates to aid us in the implementation of monetary policy. \n\nAs always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and opinions and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLet me start by summarizing my main points regarding the economic outlook.  In my view, the economy is slowly healing.  But, while significant progress has been made since the end of the recession, there remain a number of headwinds that have offset the improvement in the underlying fundamentals.  As a result, we have yet to see any meaningful pickup in the economy’s forward momentum. \n\nThe most notable recent headwind, of course, has been the large amount of fiscal drag this year from the payroll and income tax increases and the budget sequester.  Also noteworthy is the tightening of financial market conditions that has occurred since May.  As we move into 2014, the fiscal headwinds should abate somewhat.  As that occurs, the improving underlying fundamentals of the economy should begin to dominate, pushing up the overall growth rate. \n\nBut this is just a forecast, it has not been realized yet.  That is one reason why I supported the FOMC’s decision last week to maintain the current pace of our Treasury and mortgage-backed security purchases.  In my view, the economy still needs the support of a very accommodative monetary policy.  Adjustments to that policy need to be anchored in an assessment of how the economy is actually performing, how financial conditions are evolving, and how this affects the longer-term outlook and the risks around it. Our decisions on how to adjust our policy tools—for example, the pace of asset purchases and forward guidance with respect to the level of short-term rates—must be rooted in the ongoing flow of information that informs our judgments about the prospects for a sustainable recovery.  Decisions on the pace of asset purchase and forward guidance must be based on what is most appropriate to achieve our dual mandate objectives of maximum sustainable employment in a context of price stability.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nLet’s dig a bit deeper into the tug- of-war between improving fundamentals and the drag exerted by fiscal policy and tighter financial conditions.  \n\nStarting with the improving underlying fundamentals, one important aspect is the household sector and its balance sheet.  In a number of dimensions, households have made significant progress in repairing their finances.  Prior to the recession, households took on an excessive amount of debt— much in the form of residential mortgages. The process of deleveraging and reducing this debt overhang is now well advanced.  For example, household debt relative to disposable income has declined substantially since it peaked in the third quarter of 2007, bringing it back to levels last seen in early 2003.  Delinquency rates on mortgages, auto loans and credit cards continue to decline. In addition, household wealth relative to disposable income has recovered from the steep decline following the crisis and is now near its 20-year average.  Reflecting this improvement, credit standards are beginning to ease, which should support consumer spending on durable goods.\n\nAnother sector in which the fundamentals have improved is the housing sector.  Most importantly, the excess supply of housing created during the boom appears to have been largely worked off.  As a result, house prices are now rising in most areas of the country and homebuilding activity has strengthened.  Moreover, there is further scope for gains in homebuilding.  After all, the current annualized rate of housing starts—around 900,000—is considerably below the rate consistent with the country’s underlying demographic trends and the expected long-run rate of household formation.  By these metrics, housing starts should ultimately climb back to about a 1.5 million annualized rate.\n\nThe underlying fundamentals supporting business investment are also good.  Profit margins have been high and cash flows strong for some time.  Credit availability has been gradually improving.  For example, the Federal Reserve’s Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey indicates that banks are continuing to gradually ease their lending standards for commercial and industrial loans.  \n\nHowever, against these improving economic fundamentals, we have two important offsets.  The first offset is the unusually high degree of fiscal drag, which the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates at about 1¾ percent of potential GDP in 2013.1  The two most important components of this restraint are the end of the payroll tax holiday and the increase in income tax rates this past January, and, more recently, the government spending cuts resulting from budget sequestration. \n\nAnother new source of drag for the economy is the sharp rise in long-term interest rates, especially residential mortgage rates—that has occurred since May.  So far we don’t have much hard data on how this is affecting the housing sector.  But data through mid-September generally indicate that the rise in rates has cut into the upward momentum of the housing sector.\n\nCurrently, improving economic fundamentals versus fiscal drag and somewhat tighter financial conditions are pulling the economy in opposite directions, roughly cancelling each other. The economy continues to grow and payrolls are rising, but there is little evidence of a pickup in the economy’s forward momentum.  For example, real GDP growth is still stuck close to the 2.2 percent  average annualized growth rate that has prevailed since the beginning of the expansion. \n\nBut, as the degree of fiscal drag and other headwinds lessen, the tug-of-war should begin to shift in favor of higher growth. Absent additional fiscal restraint, a further tightening of financial conditions, or some adverse external shock, I expect the economy to grow a bit faster in 2014.\n\nSo, how compelling is this narrative? In big picture terms, it certainly seems quite reasonable to me. However, no forecast is inevitable and there are some reasons to remain wary.   In particular, although the fiscal drag will likely lessen in 2014, I expect it will still be significant, and the outcome of the current federal budget and debt ceiling debates may affect this assessment.  Moreover, when one drills down and looks at the recent performance and outlook for the economy’s major sectors, additional caution seems warranted.      \n\nTurning first to the outlook for fiscal policy, there are two points worth making.  First, the CBO projects that significant fiscal drag will persist into 2014.  Second, the fact that the degree of restraint lessens next fiscal year could understate the actual impact on the economy because the full impact of some of this year’s cuts may not yet have been fully felt. For example, consider university research spending that depends, in part, on federal grants.  As the grant budget falls under sequestration, this will eventually squeeze university budgets over time and likely lead to additional belt-tightening. \n\nNext, let’s take a deeper look at how the major sectors of the private economy that might play a role in the strengthening story are doing currently: consumption, housing, business investment and trade.  When we’re done, I think you’ll agree that there still are some reasons for caution.\n\nTurning first to consumer spending, such spending has remained fairly subdued outside of interest rate-sensitive consumer durables.  In July, for example, real personal consumption expenditures were flat, and it is unlikely that third quarter consumption growth will be much above a 2 percent annual rate. \n\nMoreover, the drivers of consumer spending do not look particularly supportive.  In particular, real disposable income growth has grown at less than a 1 percent annual pace since March.  Furthermore, the recent data do not yet clearly indicate a firming in the income growth rate, or the two important components of labor income growth—hours and compensation.\n\nThe conundrum for consumers is a simple one:  if consumer spending growth is to exceed 2 percent annualized on a sustained basis at a time when real disposable income growth is below 2 percent then this would require the household saving rate to decline persistently.  But there is little reason to expect such a decline given that the current saving rate is at a level consistent with current level of household wealth relative to income.\n\nWe have a chicken-egg problem.  If the saving rate remains stable, then stronger consumption growth will require a pickup in income growth. But for income to rise, demand must increase.  This suggests that there may need to be an impetus to growth from other sectors of the economy to generate a boost in consumer spending growth. \n\nOne possible source is the housing sector.  As noted earlier, housing starts are still quite low relative to what the country’s demographics should support in the long run.  But there are two difficulties here.   First, the strength of the housing recovery may be blunted by the recent rise in mortgage rates.  For example, before last week’s partial reversal, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate had risen by about 120 basis points since May to more than 4½ percent.  For a household considering buying a house and financing the purchase with a $100,000 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, this rise in mortgage rates would increase their annual payments by more than $800. The increase in financing costs and the rise in home prices has made housing considerably less affordable than it was earlier in the year.  This is illustrated by the National Association of Realtors’ affordability index which has declined by 25 percent over the six months ending in July.\n\nSecond, housing activity has already been contributing significantly to growth.  For example, over the past two years, real residential investment swung from a drag of 1.1 percentage points of GDP to a contribution of 0.4 percentage points.  Together, this suggests that the impetus to growth from housing may moderate rather than strengthen. \n\nPerhaps, the economy can get a boost from business fixed investment.  After all, most of the evidence points towards further improvement.  First, as I noted earlier, profit margins and cash flows are high, and credit availability is improving.  Thus, those businesses with successful track records should be able to readily finance new investments.  Second, business fixed investment is not very high as a share of GDP and overall industrial capacity has been expanding only slowly.  This suggests that this sector is not over extended.  Third, the drop in U.S. energy costs relative to the rest of the world should spur more investment in the U.S. in energy intensive activities such as petrochemicals manufacturing. \n\nHowever, there are also some negatives here as well.   In particular, despite the positive factors I have cited, the growth in manufacturing output has been only moderate, with the overall manufacturing capacity utilization rate still below its pre-recession level.  Thus, outside of the energy intensive sectors, there still appears to be little near-term motivation for firms to invest in order to increase their productive capacity.  Businesses seem to be waiting for stronger demand before they significantly increase their investment outlays.  Thus, we have a second chicken-egg problem. \n\nOn the trade side, the news is mixed.  Although Japanese and European economic activity has picked up recently, the sustainability remains in question.  Even as Europe emerges from its recession, growth is likely to be anemic at best over the next year, constrained by continued fiscal consolidation and tight credit conditions as their banks continue to deleverage. In Japan, the consumption tax is scheduled to increase significantly next year, which is likely to constrain domestic demand. \n\nMoreover, the recent improvement in Europe and Japan has been offset by slowing in some emerging market economies. In fact, some emerging market economies are under pressure because they are running large current account and trade deficits.  Any forced correction among these countries on trade is likely to be a drag on global growth and on U.S. exports over the near term.  On balance, my outlook is that growth in the rest of the world will be roughly the same in 2014 as it is this year, so that the contribution of trade to growth will likely remain quite small.\n\nPutting all these factors together, I still conclude that there is a basis for a pickup in growth as fiscal restraint lessens, but the impulse is not likely to be a particularly powerful one without some unanticipated impetus to growth that solves the chicken-egg problems, especially in the near term. \n\nOn the inflation side of the ledger, inflation remains below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent  longer-run objective for the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) deflator.  The year-over-year change in the total PCE deflator was 1.4 percent in July. This has created some concern that inflation is “too low,” raising real interest rates and making monetary policy less accommodative.  I acknowledge this concern, but I believe it will abate as inflation moves gradually back up towards a 2 percent annualized rate over the next few years. \n\nA number of considerations inform my view. First, a decomposition of core inflation reveals that the most recent slowing in inflation has been largely confined to core goods, whereas the rate of increase of core services has been relatively steady.  Such was not the case in 2010—the previous instance of a significant slowing of inflation.  This suggests that the fall in inflation partly reflects idiosyncratic factors that are not likely to be sustained. \n\nSecond, the recent data suggest that the downtrend in the inflation rate may be coming to an end.  For example, the core personal consumption expenditures deflator rose at a higher rate over the past three months than during any other 3-month period since mid-2012. \n\nThird, measures of longer-term inflation expectations, whether discerned from financial asset prices or from surveys of households or professional forecasters, remain well anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent objective.  This is important because inflation expectations are a major determinant of the inflation process.  As long as inflation expectations stay well-anchored, it will be hard for inflation to fall further.  \n\nPutting these factors together along with my forecast of a gradual pickup in real economic activity, my outlook is for inflation to drift back toward our 2 percent objective over the medium term.  However, much like the case of the real growth outlook, there is significant uncertainty around this forecast.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nSo what does this all imply for monetary policy?  As you are aware, at last week’s FOMC meeting we made no changes to our monetary policy.  In particular, the Committee decided to continue to purchase long-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities at a monthly pace of $45 billion and $40 billion, respectively.   The FOMC statement reaffirmed the Committee’s intention “to continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.”2   \n\nWe also reaffirmed our forward guidance with respect to the federal funds rate.  The statement notes that the Committee, “currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.” 3  \n\nSeveral questions have emerged following the meeting.  Most noteworthy was—given that market expectations were skewed towards anticipating the beginning of a taper at this meeting—why the Committee did not begin to reduce the pace of asset purchases.  Although I can’t speak for the Committee, I can provide some reasons for my own decision.    \n\nTo begin to taper, I have two tests that must be passed:  (1) evidence that the labor market has shown improvement, and (2) information about the economy’s forward momentum that makes me confident that labor market improvement will continue in the future.  So far, I think we have made progress with respect to these metrics, but have not yet achieved success.    \n\nWith respect to the first metric, we have seen labor market improvement since the program began last September. Over this time period, the unemployment rate has declined to 7.3 percent from 8.1 percent.4   However, at the same time, this decline in the unemployment rate overstates the degree of improvement.  Other metrics of labor market conditions, such as the hiring, job-openings, job-finding rate, quits rate and the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio, collectively indicate a much more modest improvement in labor market conditions compared to that suggested by the decline in the unemployment rate.  In particular, it is still hard for those who are unemployed to find jobs.  Currently, there are three unemployed workers per job opening, as opposed to an average of two during the period from 2003 to 2007.\n\nWith respect to the second metric—confidence that the economic recovery is strong enough to generate sustained labor market improvement—I don’t think we have yet passed that test. The economy has not picked up forward momentum and a 2 percent growth rate—even if sustained—might not be sufficient to generate further improvement in labor market conditions.  Moreover, fiscal uncertainties loom very large right now as Congress considers the issues of funding the government and raising the debt limit ceiling.  Assuming no change in my assessment of the efficacy and costs associated with the purchase program, I’d like to see economic news that makes me more confident that we will see continued improvement in the labor market.  Then I would feel comfortable that the time had come to cut the pace of asset purchases. \n\nA few other points with respect to monetary policy are worth emphasizing following last week’s FOMC meeting.  First, as I have noted in earlier remarks, a decision to reduce the rate of asset purchases is not a tightening of monetary policy.  If we are purchasing additional securities we are simply adding accommodation at a slower pace. \n\nSecond, any decision to cut the pace of asset purchases should not be taken as signaling an early exit from this period of unusually low short-term rates.  We have established a threshold of 6.5 percent for the unemployment rate as long as we do not expect inflation to exceed 2 ½ percent at a one-to-two year horizon and inflation expectations remain well-anchored.   It is likely to take a considerable amount of time to reach the 6.5 percent unemployment rate threshold.  Moreover, because the 6.5 percent unemployment rate is a threshold, and not a trigger, depending on the economic circumstances, we might wait a long time after we breach the threshold before we begin to raise our federal funds rate target. \n\nThe point I wish to emphasize is that any decisions on the pace of asset purchases (the rate at which we are adding accommodation) versus liftoff in terms of the federal funds rate (a tightening of monetary policy) should be viewed as largely independent of one another.   One does not foreshadow the other—certainly not in any mechanical way or with a definitive timeframe.   As Chairman Bernanke noted in last week’s press conference, our actions are data dependent and how the data will evolve is uncertain.\n\nIn addition, it is worth explaining why we anticipate the  federal funds rate is still likely to be quite low relative to what Committee participants consider normal over the longer run, even as the Committee gets close to its employment and inflation objectives.  For example, in the September Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection for the federal funds rate in the fourth quarter of 2016 is 2 percent, far below the median long-run federal funds rate projection of 4 percent, at the same time that the unemployment rate and inflation are close to the Committee’s long-run objectives. \n\nHow does one explain this? As noted by Chairman Bernanke in last week’s press conference, the still low federal funds rate projections for 2016 reflect the fact that economic headwinds—such as tight credit standards and ongoing fiscal consolidation—are likely to take a long time to fully abate.  As a result, monetary policy will have to keep short-term interest rates very low for a sustained period in order for the Committee to achieve its objectives.  \n\nMy view is that the neutral federal funds rate consistent with trend growth is currently very low. That’s one reason why the economy is not growing very fast despite the current accommodative stance of monetary policy.  Although the neutral rate should gradually normalize over the long-run as economic fundamentals continue to improve and headwinds abate, this process will likely take many years.  In the meantime, the federal funds rate level consistent with the Committee’s objectives of maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability will likely be well below the long-run level.\n\nFixed-Rate, Full Allotment Overnight Reverse Repo Facility\n\nBefore I conclude, I want to discuss a new tool that the Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) at the New York Fed will be testing and developing in coming months.  The new tool is a fixed-rate, full-allotment overnight reverse repo facility that would be available to a broad range of counterparties—not just open to the primary dealers through which we have historically conducted our open market operations.5  By being available to a much broader array of counterparties, this should allow the Fed to tighten its control over money market rates.\n\nI’ll first explain in plain English what this facility is.  Then I’ll explain why we are testing it and what having such a facility in place might accomplish. \n\nA fixed-rate, full allotment overnight reverse repo facility is a facility in which the Federal Reserve posts a fixed interest rate and accepts cash from counterparties, which include banks, dealers, money market funds, and some government sponsored enterprises (GSEs), on an overnight basis in return for a security.  If implemented, the facility would be “full allotment”—that means the facility would have no cap on the amount of funds accepted from any of its counterparties at the posted overnight interest rate.6  The repo facility is “reverse” because the direction in which the funds and securities move—participants are lending funds to the Fed rather than vice versa. Users of the facility are making the economic equivalent of an overnight collateralized loan of cash to the Federal Reserve.   The amount of funds invested in the facility is likely to be sensitive to the posted interest rate.  The higher the interest rate relative to comparable money market rates, the greater the participation is likely to be and vice versa.   \n\nThere are several reasons motivating our interest in developing such a facility.  First, such a facility should enable the Federal Reserve to improve its control over the level of money market rates.  By offering a new, essentially risk-free investment, one would expect that anyone with access to such a facility would generally be unwilling to lend instead to someone else at a rate below that posted for the facility.  This should help to establish a floor on the level of overnight rates.   Right now, most short-term rates trade between 0 and 25 basis points, but occasionally T-bill and repo rates go negative, for example at quarter-end or when financial stresses increase the demand for very safe assets.  The full allotment element of the reverse repo facility would increase the availability of a risk-free asset, satisfying the demand when the appetite for safe assets increases.  This should help tighten the relationship between these and other money market rates.  These reverse repos would be available to an expanded set of counterparties that includes many of the money market lenders who are ineligible to earn the interest on excess reserves (IOER), such as GSEs and a number of money market funds. Depending on the facility rate, these lenders who cannot earn the IOER rate might get a better rate by investing in the overnight RRPs compared to lending to banks or to broker dealers. This competitive effect could, in and of itself, put a stronger floor on money market rates.\n\nSecond, this new facility is also likely to reduce the volatility of short-term interest rates.  If a lender that cannot earn the IOER rate has an unexpectedly large amount of funds to invest, this lender currently may have to accept an unusually low interest rate.  But with the overnight reverse repo facility in place, this lender could lend as much funds as desired to the facility at a fixed rate and this should reduce the downward pressure on money market rates.  By tightening control and reducing the volatility of short-term rates, such a facility should reassure investors that the Federal Reserve has sufficient tools to manage monetary policy effectively even with a very large balance sheet.\n\nI have told you what this facility is for.  Now let me emphasize what the testing and development of this facility does not foreshadow.  The testing and the development of the facility is not being undertaken to facilitate or expedite exit from our large balance sheet and should not be considered to be an element of the exit process.  The purpose  of the facility is to establish a floor on money market rates and to improve the implementation of monetary policy even when the balance sheet is large.  Even if our balance sheet increases significantly further and stays very large for many years, it will be useful to have this facility available to improve monetary policy control.\n\nIn coming months we will test the facility with two goals in mind.  First, we want to be assured that there are no glitches operationally with somewhat higher transaction volumes than in previous tests, that we can accept cash from a larger array of counterparties, post collateral in the tri-party repo system and reverse the transactions each day smoothly.  Second, while the limited size of the operations during this exercise will prevent the operations from having a significant impact on market rates, we will observe how the facility impacts individual investor demand relative to other market rates.  Additionally, we can see how sensitive that demand is to changes in market conditions such as quarter-end that increase the demand for safe assets.  These observations will give us some insight into how the facility could affect the entire constellation of money market rates.  Only by testing and learning will we be able to assess how best to use the facility.  \n\nIn conclusion, let me turn back to the economic outlook and the role of monetary policy.  I do believe that we are making progress towards our objectives of maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability.  The economic fundamentals are improving and I expect that the healing process will continue in the coming months and years.  At the same time, it is important to recognize that the financial crisis generated significant headwinds that are only slowly abating.  We must push against these headwinds forcefully to best achieve our objectives.   \n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions. \n\n1 This number refers to the change in the high-employment budget deficit for fiscal year 2013 as estimated by the CBO in March.\n\n2 Federal Open Market Committee statement, September 18, 2013\n\n3 Federal Open Market Committee statement, September 18, 2013\n\n4 The 8.1 percent unemployment rate refers to the August 2012 unemployment rate that was the latest information available to the Committee at its September 2012 meeting.\n\n5 The Desk has been conducting operational readiness exercises for the use of reverse repurchase agreements  since late 2009.  At the most recent FOMC meeting last week, the FOMC authorized the Desk to begin another testing program which begins today.  See the Desk’s September 20 announcement of the next round of testing. \n\n6 During the testing phase, a ceiling will be placed on the maximum amount that can be invested per counterparty."

        "content": "It is a pleasure to be here.  Who wouldn’t want to be in Paris—anytime—let alone in September?  My comments today will focus on how over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives reform fits in with the broader financial reform agenda and those aspects of the reform effort in OTC derivatives that could potentially fall short relative to those broader objectives.  My short answer, which I will elaborate on in my remarks, is that the OTC derivatives reform effort fits in very well with the broader reform agenda, but there are significant risks that we will fall short in this arena relative to what we are likely to achieve elsewhere.\n\nAs I see it, the G20 reform effort for OTC derivatives has three broad goals:\n\nSystemic risk is being reduced in a number of different ways.  First, mandating the standardization, whenever possible, and central clearing of OTC derivative trades can reduce risk by transforming a complex web of bilateral firm exposures into a smaller set of net exposures between each dealer and the central counterparty (CCP).  Given their role in fostering financial stability, robust financial market infrastructures (FMIs) that are properly risk-managed can serve as a source of strength in times of stress.  Central clearing can also reduce systemic risk by requiring collateral from the participants.  To the extent that the OTCD reform effort results in the greater use of collateral, that should also help make the system safer.\n\nSecond, increasing capital and liquidity requirements, improving governance, risk management, and resolution and recovery, as well as implementation of the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMIs) promulgated by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) should make FMIs more robust and resilient.  FMIs performed well during the financial crisis, but with OTCD reform, we are asking FMIs to do even more, so the bar needs to be higher. \n\nThird, firm-level risk management is being strengthened in a variety of ways such as requiring mandatory margin requirements for bespoke, non-cleared trades.  Firms need to understand the risks associated with OTC derivatives activity and set aside capital and exchange margin to cover these risks.  Moreover, authorities are developing supervisory approaches to oversee market infrastructures and participants to ensure compliance with evolving regulatory frameworks.\n\nActivity in the OTC derivatives market is gradually being moved into clearer view.  In particular, over time, mandatory reporting to trade repositories (TRs) and access to that data by regulators should facilitate the ability for supervisors and others to assess building risks in the global financial market more quickly and comprehensively. \n\nImproving competition and protecting against market abuse are also important.  These objectives are being accomplished by the increased use of electronic trading platforms and improving access to CCPs.  This should lead to more competitive markets that will offer participants better liquidity and pricing and a greater degree of transparency.\n\nIn general, I think that the first two objectives of OTC derivatives reform fit in well with the goals of the broader financial reform effort undertaken in the wake of the financial crisis.  I would characterize the goals of the broader effort as:\n\nImplementation of OTC derivatives reform should make the markets more resilient and should reduce the risk that they will be a source of contagion in stressed environments.    Also, the risk of funding runs should be reduced by the increase in the quality of information on firm exposures that can be made available to regulators, and, in principle, through increased disclosure to market participants. \n\nI also think that OTC derivatives reform is an important complement to the emphasis placed on strengthening individual institutions, which is part of the broader reform agenda.  Financial stability is not just about individual institutions but also about how the entire system interacts.  For example, are the incentives in the system appropriate and does the system amplify or dampen shocks?  Thus, it is important that reform efforts not concentrate exclusively on the systemically important financial institutions, but also that these efforts focus on the market products and practices and the linkages among markets, market participants and infrastructures.\n\nDespite the progress made to date, I do have some concerns about the OTC derivatives reform effort.  My first concern is about pace.  For example, it seems to me that we have made much more progress in strengthening individual institutions through higher bank capital and liquidity requirements than we have made in reducing risk in the OTCD space.   Now some of this is inevitable because OTCD reform is harder and we are not as far along.  It requires the creation of new institutions to clear such trades or to house the trade information.  It also requires national legislation to be flexible enough so that it can work coherently on a global basis.  The difficulty in harmonizing the regulatory treatment of cross-border OTCD activity is a good example of this.  Parenthetically, I’d add that I am very pleased to see the breakthrough achieved between Europe and the U.S. this summer.\n\nRegardless of the cause, because of the slower pace, we are not yet close to a harmonized, robust OTCD system.  Thus, we can’t ascertain whether we have achieved what we set out to achieve—that is, reducing the amount of risk in the system, making the infrastructure more secure, and increasing the flow of information so that regulators and others can develop a more coherent view of what is happening in the global financial system.\n\nI’m also worried that even when we have finished revamping the architecture and regulation of OTC derivatives activities, reform may not go far enough in a number of respects.  First, I am concerned that trades may not be standardized to the fullest degree possible.  A preliminary analysis undertaken by the Financial Stability Board that compares the costs of clearing and margin requirements of standardized trades versus bespoke trades suggests that the economics with respect to costs favors standardizing OTCD trades whenever possible. However, the wider spreads that might be earned on bespoke trades, because of their greater opacity, could swing the needle the other way, with the higher profits on bespoke trades more than offsetting their higher costs.  It is too soon to say yet, but we should be prepared to push harder for further standardization should the desired degree of standardization that we are striving for not materialize.\n\nI also worry that implementation of the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures could falter over time.  This could happen for several reasons.  In particular, we should recognize that there is a tension between the profit motive of for-profit CCPs and full compliance with the PFMIs.  Put simply, some CCPs will prefer to avoid the full costs of compliance.   In other words, there will always be a risk of a race to the bottom, which we must continually push against. \n\nIn this respect, the effort could also falter if countries were to fail to enact the relevant legislation and policies to put the PFMIs in practice.  For the global system to be robust, the requirements for CCPs will need to be enforced across the different geographic regimes.  I am also worried about fragmentation.  In particular, I worry about the proliferation of TRs and CCPs geographically—in some cases in each of the major asset classes.  In the case of CCPs, fragmentation would bring two costs.  First, the netting benefits would be reduced and, second, the system would be more complex.  In an ideal world, I would prefer very few, very robust CCPs, rather than a proliferation of many, less robust CCPs.  But whether that is what we will get is unclear to me at this point.\n\nFinally, I am worried that we are not going to achieve the full benefits from trade repositories.  Regulators, market participants and TRs must continue to work together to ensure that comprehensive, and meaningful data are being reported to TRs and that authorities have the ability to access and analyze the data from the TRs.  Although authorities currently receive data, the data are often fragmented and reported in different formats or are not comparable across TRs. This poses challenges for regulators and supervisors of market participants and global CCPs as well as authorities more broadly.  Aside from the issues with TR fragmentation, data quality and regulatory access to data, we could be leaving considerable money on the table by not using the TR dataset to increase transparency into the marketplace more broadly.\n\nMoving forward on all of these issues will require global coordination and continued efforts across all stakeholders.  Authorities must continue to coordinate their oversight of global infrastructures.  Where FMIs are “global,” that is providing services across multiple jurisdictions and in multiple currencies, it is important for the relevant authorities to find efficient ways to cooperate with each other to effectively carry out their respective responsibilities.  Additionally, where there are overlapping or contradicting regulations, authorities must provide clear guidance to the market on how regulation will be applied.\n\nOne final point: What matters is not the standardization of OTC derivatives, central clearing or the use of the trade repositories per se, but instead the results that flow from these efforts.  These institutions are just devices to achieve an end—less risk, more robustness and greater transparency.  In the end, we will need to assess our progress on OTCD reforms against those broader qualitative metrics.\n\nThank you very much for your kind attention."

        "content": "Today I want to talk a bit about the outlook for the nation and the region.  As many of you know, I was scheduled to speak at this forum on October 29 of last year but that meeting had to be postponed because of the arrival of Superstorm Sandy which hit on that very day.  The region covered by the New York Fed was at the center of the storm, and Fairfield County, as well as parts of the Connecticut shoreline suffered extensive damage.   \n\nImmediately following the storm, our Regional and Community Outreach function worked with all of the affected areas as part of a needs assessment.  We asked: \"How can the New York Fed best leverage our resources to help our community?”  We heard that it could be challenging to find key recovery information and advice online. So we pulled key resources under one roof—or I should say under one URL.  We developed our Sandy Information Center with the best information we could find for residents and businesses impacted by Sandy—including key deadlines along with expert legal, finance and insurance guidance.\n\nConditions are not entirely back to normal, and restoration and repair activities continue in a number of hard-hit neighborhoods.  Connecticut, along with New York, New Jersey, Maryland and Rhode Island, have been appropriated federal funding for relief efforts and this should help move the area’s recovery forward. I am confident that these areas will recover over the course of the year.  The legislation also contains funding for helping coastal communities to prepare to weather future storms better.\n\nMy meeting with you today is part of our continuing efforts to understand what is going on at the grassroots level of our economy.  Let me offer a few examples from this trip.  Yesterday evening I met with some of Stamford’s business leaders to discuss the local state of economic and business conditions.  This morning I met with Mayor Finch and key economic development staff to discuss Bridgeport’s redevelopment initiatives. Local efforts such as these and your business council are essential complements to the Fed’s support for economic recovery. I applaud the efforts of state and local governments and community leaders to bolster the recovery in Bridgeport, Stamford and elsewhere in the district. \n\nI also met with Joan Carty from the Connecticut Housing Development Fund. We discussed innovative approaches for addressing the foreclosure crisis here and across the state. Housing has been a major impediment to a more rapid economic recovery and we at the Fed have been working hard to help homeowners and the overall housing market recover.  Afterwards, I spoke with small business leaders about the opportunities and challenges they are facing today.  I traveled to Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation with several goals in mind.  I wanted to learn how sequestration was affecting ground-level operations, to understand the local and regional economic impact of Sikorsky, and to view state-of-the-art manufacturing at work. \n\nAfter this program, I will be meeting with Joseph Carbone of The Workplace to discuss best practices and emerging approaches to workforce development, particularly his innovative program for the long-term unemployed which I understand he is piloting in five different cities across the nation.  At the end of the day I will be meeting with University of Connecticut (UConn) Stamford campus staff, your own executive director Chris Bruhl and other officials to learn about the ecosystem that is being created to spur further economic development locally.  I’ll end the day with a meeting with Governor Malloy to better understand the complex issues and opportunities facing the state.   \n\nThe agenda for these visits is always packed, but that’s part of the point—to meet with a diverse array of representatives in order to get a comprehensive picture of what’s happening on Main Street and its interaction with state and national developments.  At the end of my talk I will be happy to answer any questions you have about the economic outlook from my perspective.   \n\nAs always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee, also known as the FOMC.\n\nNational Economic Conditions\n\nI would like to begin by taking stock of where we are at the moment.  Then I will address my expectations for the performance of the economy over the remainder of 2013 and into 2014.\n\nSince the end of the Great Recession in mid-2009, we have had 15 consecutive quarters of positive growth of real GDP.  However, the average annual growth rate over that period has been just 2.1 percent.  Although the unemployment rate has declined by 2.5 percentage points from its peak of 10 percent in October of 2009, much of this decline is due to the fact that the labor force participation rate has fallen by 1.5 percentage points over this period.  Recall that discouraged workers who do not actively look for work are regarded as not participating in the labor force and so are not counted as unemployed even though they are without jobs. Using an alternative measure, the employment to population ratio, which is not influenced by changes in the number of discouraged workers, there has been limited improvement in labor market conditions.  Job loss rates have fallen, but hiring rates remain depressed at low levels.  Taken together, the labor market still cannot be regarded as healthy.  Numerous indicators, including the behavior of labor compensation and household assessments of labor market conditions, are all consistent with the view that there remains a great deal of slack in the economy.\n\nThat being said, I see persuasive evidence of improved underlying fundamentals for much of the private sector of the U.S. economy.  Key measures of household leverage have declined and are now at the lowest levels they have been in well over a decade.  Household net worth, expressed as a percent of disposable income, has increased back to its average of the previous decade, reflecting rising equity and home prices and declining liabilities.  Banks are beginning to ease credit standards somewhat after a prolonged period of tightness.  As a result, we are now experiencing a fairly typical cyclical recovery of consumer spending on durable goods.  For example, light-weight motor vehicles sold at a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 15.3 million in May, not far from the 16.1 million sales in 2007. \n\nSimilarly, after five years in which housing production was well below what is consistent with underlying demographic trends, it now appears that we have worked off the excess supply of housing built up during the boom years of the last decade.  Housing starts and sales are now on a clear upward trend, and a widely followed national home price index is up around 12 percent over the twelve months ending in April.1  Indeed, anecdotal reports suggest that this higher-than-expected increase in home prices is due to a lack of homes for sale.\n\nUnfortunately, the improvements in consumer spending on durable goods and housing are not yet showing through in the overall GDP growth rate due to the significant headwinds that we continue to face.  First, federal fiscal policy has recently become quite contractionary.  Estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) indicate that this fiscal restraint is on the order of 1.75 percentage points of potential GDP this year.  In the period since 1960, there have been only two previous episodes of fiscal contraction of this order of magnitude—1969 and 1987—both of which occurred when the economy was on a more solid footing than it is today.  Second, the euro area is experiencing a protracted recession and growth in many of the largest emerging economies has slowed. This has resulted in a very sharp slowing of U.S. exports, with an associated slowing in production and employment growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector.\n\nThus, I continue to see the economy as being in a tug-of-war between fiscal drag and underlying fundamental improvement, with a great deal of uncertainty over which force will prevail in the near-term.  This tug-of-war is clearly seen in the monthly employment data.  Over April and May, the average monthly gain in employment in the private service-providing sector has been well maintained at 175,000. In contrast, employment in the manufacturing sector and the federal government declined a combined 20,000 per month.  And the resulting uncertainty is, I believe, an important contributing factor behind the relatively sluggish pace of business investment spending.\n\nMy best guess is that growth for all of 2013, measured on a Q4/Q4 basis, will be about what it has been since the end of the recession. But I believe a strong case can be made that the pace of growth will pick up notably in 2014.  The private sector of the economy should continue to heal, while the amount of fiscal drag will begin to subside.  I also see some indications that growth prospects among our major trading partners have begun to improve; for example, the rise in the June euro area composite Purchasing Managers’ Index.  And this combination of events is likely to create an environment in which business investment spending will gather strength.\n\nFinally, I believe this tug-of-war analogy is useful in explaining the recent inflation dynamics.  As is well known, total inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator, has slowed sharply over the past year and is now running below the FOMC’s expressed goal of 2 percent.   Softness in energy prices, resulting from the weakening of global growth mentioned earlier combined with increased energy production here in the U.S. has contributed to the slowing of total inflation.  However, it is also the case that core inflation, that is, excluding food and energy, has slowed sharply as well.   A decomposition of core inflation reveals that some of the decline is due to slowing in the rate of increase in prices of non-food and non-energy goods.  This probably is due in large part to the softening of global demand for goods and the modest appreciation of the dollar that has occurred since mid-2011.  \n\nIn the service sector, the rate of increase in prices of medical services and “non-market” services—the latter includes some financial services—also has slowed notably recently.  In contrast, the rate of increase in prices for other non-energy services has been relatively stable.  Comparing this set of conditions to that in 2010, the recent slowing of inflation has been less widespread across core goods and core services, and inflation expectations so far have declined less appreciably than they did in 2010. Thus, my best guess is that core goods prices will begin to firm in the months ahead as global demand begins to strengthen and inventories get into better alignment with sales.   \n\nAs is always the case, there is substantial uncertainty surrounding this forecast. Moreover, there is always the possibility of some unforeseen shock. Thus, we will be monitoring U.S. and global economic conditions very carefully and will adjust our views on the likely path for growth, inflation and the unemployment rate accordingly in response to new information.\n\nAt its recent meeting, the FOMC decided to continue its accommodative policy stance.  It reaffirmed its expectation that the current low range for the federal funds rate target will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5 percent, so long as inflation and inflation expectations remain well-behaved.  It is important to remember that these conditions are thresholds, not triggers.  The FOMC also maintained its purchases of $40 billion per month in agency MBS and $45 billion per month in Treasury securities, with a stated goal of promoting a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook in a context of price stability.\n\nIn its statement, the FOMC said that it may vary the pace of purchases as economic conditions evolve.  As Chairman Bernanke stated in his press conference following the FOMC meeting, if the economic data over the next year turn out to be broadly consistent with the outlooks that the FOMC sees as most likely, which are roughly similar to the outlook I have already laid out, the FOMC anticipates that it would be appropriate to begin to moderate the pace of purchases later this year.  Under such a scenario, subsequent reductions might occur in measured steps through the first half of next year, and an end to purchases around mid-2014.  Under this scenario, at the time that asset purchases came to an end, the unemployment rate likely would be near 7 percent and the economy’s momentum strengthening, supporting further robust job gains in the future. \n\nAs I noted last week in our regional press briefing, a few points deserve emphasis.   First, the FOMC’s policy depends on the progress we make towards our objectives.  This means that the policy—including the pace of asset purchases—depends on the outlook rather than the calendar.  The scenario I outlined above is only that—one possible outcome.  Economic circumstances could diverge significantly from the FOMC’s expectations.  If labor market conditions and the economy’s growth momentum were to be less favorable than in the FOMC’s outlook—and this is what has happened in recent years—I would expect that the asset purchases would continue at a higher pace for longer.   \n\nSecond, even if this scenario were to occur and the pace of purchases were reduced, it would still be the case that as long as the FOMC continues its asset purchases it is adding monetary policy accommodation, not tightening monetary policy.  As the FOMC adds to its stock of securities, this should continue to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, making monetary policy more accommodative. \n\nThird, the Federal Reserve is likely to keep most of these assets on its balance sheet for a long time.  As Chairman Bernanke noted in his most recent press conference, a strong majority of FOMC participants no longer favor selling agency MBS securities during the monetary policy normalization process.  This implies a bigger balance sheet for longer, which provides additional accommodation today and continuing support for mortgage markets going forward. \n\nFourth, even under this scenario, a rise in short-term rates is very likely to be a long way off.  Not only will it likely take considerable time to reach the FOMC’s 6.5 percent unemployment rate threshold, but also the FOMC could wait considerably longer before raising short-term rates.  The fact that inflation is coming in well below the FOMC’s 2 percent objective is relevant here.  Most FOMC participants currently do not expect short-term rates to begin to rise until 2015. \n\nTo reiterate what I said last week, some commentators have interpreted the recent shift in the market-implied path of short-term interest rates as indicating that market participants now expect the first increases in the federal funds rate target to come much earlier than previously thought.  Setting aside whether this is the correct interpretation of recent price moves, let me emphasize that such an expectation would be quite out of sync with both FOMC statements and the expectations of most FOMC participants.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions\n\nTurning to the regional economy, my colleagues and I at the New York Fed continually track conditions in our District, and we have a number of tools we use for that purpose. \n\nTo promote growth in our local communities, we publish extensive data and analysis on the local economy.  We provide outreach initiatives, such as our workshops on access to global markets to help small businesses learn about loan programs and sources of credit enhancements. We also run an annual video festival for college students in the Second District.  In this program student teams produce videos aimed to help young adults make sound personal financial decisions. A panel of advertising and video professionals selects winning video productions for screening in local movie theaters.\n\nAs you know, even states as wealthy as Connecticut have large pockets of poverty. So, we target some of our work specifically to low- and moderate-income groups.\n\nWe have worked hard to help neighborhoods that face high foreclosure rates.  This work is important obviously because foreclosures are a terrible event for those who lose their homes.  But beyond that, this work is important because high levels of foreclosures affect neighbors’ home values, the local tax base and economic vitality more broadly. We have provided housing counselors and community groups with the latest information on mortgage conditions via mortgage briefs, roundtables, presentations and an interactive web tool that shows very local monthly delinquency and foreclosure conditions. This past fall we hosted a conference on distressed residential real estate to share new expert analysis with senior policymakers and practitioners from across the nation.  Your new Commissioner of Housing—whom I note, formerly worked at the New York Fed—attended that conference.\n\nWe also conduct a periodic poll about the credit needs of small businesses, which are an important source of new jobs in the District.  If you represent a small business and would like to participate in our next poll, please pass your business card to my colleagues, who are in the audience, or see me after the speech.  And if your business is somewhat larger, I urge you to consider becoming one of our business contacts—just indicate your interest to us on your business card.    \n\nSo how is the region doing?  I want to begin by pointing out that Fairfield County has a number of strengths, beginning with a highly-educated workforce:  Two in five adults in the county hold a college degree, nearly twice the nationwide average.  It also has an array of fine educational institutions, including Fairfield University, UConn Stamford, the University of Bridgeport, Sacred Heart University, Western Connecticut State University, Housatonic Community College and Norwalk Community College. \n\nThe industry mix here is quite diverse, with a good representation of jobs in the high-paying finance sector.  In fact, roughly 35,000 jobs in the county, about 9 percent of total employment, are in the finance and insurance industry, a share almost twice as large as in the nation and even slightly higher than in New York City.  Although the sector has shed jobs over the past two years, it remains an important and valuable component of the local economy.  There are also numerous corporate headquarters in the county and a notable manufacturing presence, particularly in the pharmaceuticals, electrical equipment and aerospace industries.    \n\nIn addition, the whole tri-state region has benefited from its proximity to New York City, where the rebound in the economy—and also in employment—has been much stronger.  Fairfield County’s connection to New York City is not quite as strong as Long Island’s or the lower Hudson Valley:  About 7 percent of working residents in the county commute to New York City compared to about 20 percent in those areas.  Still, the city’s strong pace of job creation during the current recovery is supporting incomes in the county. \n\nTurning to the recent performance of the economy, this area is growing pretty much in line with the nation, at least in terms of employment.  That’s a bit of an improvement from 2012 when, after solid gains in 2010 and 2011, job creation in both Fairfield County and Connecticut had stalled.  Some sectors, such as education, health, and professional and business services were adding jobs; but those were offset by job losses not only in finance, but also in the goods-producing and distributing sectors. \n\nAnd at the end of October, Superstorm Sandy hit the region, causing major damage and disruption.  While most of the news focused on New York City, Long Island and New Jersey, parts of Fairfield and New Haven counties—cities and towns like Bridgeport, Stamford, Milford, and Fairfield—were severely affected as well.  Thankfully, Sandy’s disruptive effect on the region’s economy seems to have been short-lived.  Fairfield County did see some job losses during the winter months, and Sandy likely contributed to that.  But, in the spring this area saw a strong and broad-based rebound in employment.  In fact, in May employment in Fairfield County surged to a more than four-year high.    \n\nEven with this recent surge in employment, however, the county has recouped only about 60 percent of the 36,000 jobs lost during the last downturn, whereas the nation has recouped close to three-quarters of its job losses and New York City has more than fully rebounded.  And, at more than 7 percent, the county’s unemployment rate remains high.\n\nAnother dimension of the local economy where we have seen modest improvement is housing.  Homebuilding, as measured by housing permits issued, languished from 2008 through 2011; but last year, multi-family construction picked up noticeably, and this year single-family construction has begun to move up as well.  Home values have also begun to recover.  After falling about 25 percent between 2006 and early 2012, home prices have risen by 5 percent in Fairfield County and 3 percent across Connecticut overall.  While this upturn in home prices is encouraging, it has been considerably weaker than in other parts of our region and also weaker than nationally.\n\nThe New York Fed’s measures of regional credit conditions suggest continued financial challenges for families here. As of the first quarter of 2013, average debt per person was about $60,000 in Connecticut and over $90,000 in Fairfield County—little changed over several years. The county’s delinquency rate on that debt is now 5.7 percent, similar to the national average.  And the mortgage crisis continues to take a toll on local homeowners.  As of the first quarter, about 6 percent of mortgage debt in Fairfield County was 90-plus days delinquent, slightly higher than the national delinquency rate.\n\nIt is also important to recognize the county’s strengths that will support recovery and the rise in household income over the longer term—over and above just being close to a thriving New York City.  In particular, the above-average educational attainment of residents and the numerous educational institutions position the area well to move into the expanding knowledge-based economy.  Also, its diverse industry mix has a good representation of jobs in high-paying sectors and the area maintains its attractiveness as a location for corporate headquarters.\n\nThank you for your kind attention and I will now be happy to take a few questions.\n\n1 CoreLogic Report Shows Home Prices Rise by 12.1 Percent Year Over Year in April"

I am pleased to have this opportunity to talk with the journalists covering our region—and through you to the people in our District.  This morning I will briefly discuss conditions in the national economy and then focus on regional economic conditions, with particular attention to the question of whether recent college graduates are finding good jobs.  We will examine the trends and see how they are playing out in the region.  \n\nAs always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System. \n\nNational Economic Conditions\n\nI would like to begin by taking stock of where we are at the moment.

Housing starts and sales are now on a clear upward trend, and a widely followed national home price index is up around 12 percent over the twelve months ending in April.1  Indeed, anecdotal reports suggest that this higher-than-expected increase in home prices is due to a lack of homes for sale.\n\nUnfortunately, the improvements in consumer spending on durable goods and housing are not yet showing through in the overall GDP growth rate due to the significant headwinds that we continue to face.  First, federal fiscal policy has recently become quite contractionary.  Estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) indicate that this fiscal restraint is on the order of 1.75 percentage points of potential GDP this year.  In the period since 1960, there have been only two previous episodes of fiscal contraction of this order of magnitude—1969 and 1987—both of which occurred when the economy was on a more solid footing than it is today.  Second, the euro area is experiencing a protracted recession and growth in many of the largest emerging economies has slowed. This has resulted in a very sharp slowing of U.S. exports, with an associated slowing in production and employment growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector.\n\nThus, I continue to see the economy as being in a tug-of-war between fiscal drag and underlying fundamental improvement, with a great deal of uncertainty over which force will prevail in the near-term.  This tug-of-war is clearly seen in the monthly employment data.  Over April and May, the average monthly gain in employment in the private service-providing sector has been well maintained at 175,000. In contrast, employment in the manufacturing sector and the federal government declined a combined 20,000 per month.  And the resulting uncertainty is, I believe, an important contributing factor behind the relatively sluggish pace of business investment spending.\n\nMy best guess is that growth for all of 2013, measured on a Q4/Q4 basis, will be about what it has been since the end of the recession. But I believe a strong case can be made that the pace of growth will pick up notably in 2014.  The private sector of the economy should continue to heal, while the amount of fiscal drag will begin to subside.  I also see some indications that growth prospects among our major trading partners have begun to improve; for example, the rise in the June euro area composite Purchasing Managers’ Index.  And this combination of events is likely to create an environment in which business investment spending will gather strength.\n\nFinally, I believe this tug-of-war analogy is useful in explaining the recent inflation dynamics.  As is well known, total inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator, has slowed sharply over the past year and is now running below the FOMC’s expressed goal of 2 percent.  Much of the slowing of total inflation is due to declining energy prices resulting from the weakening of global growth mentioned earlier combined with increased energy production here in the U.S.  However, it is also the case that core inflation, that is, excluding food and energy, has slowed sharply as well.   A decomposition of the slowing in core inflation reveals that some of it is due to slowing in the rate of increase in prices of non-food and non-energy goods.  This probably is due in large part to the softening of global demand for goods and the modest appreciation of the dollar that has occurred since mid-2011. \n\nIn the service sector, the rate of increase in prices of medical services and “non-market” services—the latter includes some financial services—also has slowed notably recently.  In contrast, the rate of increase in prices for other non-energy services has been relatively stable.  Comparing this set of conditions to that in 2010, the recent slowing of inflation has been less widespread across core goods and core services, and inflation expectations so far have declined less appreciably than they did in 2010. Thus, my best guess is that core goods prices will begin to firm in the months ahead as global demand begins to strengthen and inventories get into better alignment with sales.   \n\nAs is always the case, there is substantial uncertainty surrounding this forecast. Moreover, there is always the possibility of some unforeseen shock. Thus, we will be monitoring U.S. and global economic conditions very carefully and will adjust our views on the likely path for growth, inflation and the unemployment rate accordingly in response to new information.\n\nAt its meeting last week, the FOMC decided to continue its accommodative policy stance.  It reaffirmed its expectation that the current low range for the federal funds rate target will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5 percent, so long as inflation and inflation expectations remain well-behaved.  It is important to remember that these conditions are thresholds, not triggers.  The FOMC also maintained its purchases of $40 billion per month in agency MBS and $45 billion per month in Treasury securities, with a stated goal of promoting a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook in a context of price stability.\n\nIn its statement, the FOMC said that it may vary the pace of purchases as economic conditions evolve.  As Chairman Bernanke stated in his press conference following the FOMC meeting, if the economic data over the next year turn out to be broadly consistent with the outlooks that the FOMC sees as most likely, which are roughly similar to the outlook I have already laid out, the FOMC anticipates that it would be appropriate to begin to moderate the pace of purchases later this year.  Under such a scenario, subsequent reductions might occur in measured steps through the first half of next year, and an end to purchases around mid-2014.  Under this scenario, at the time that asset purchases came to an end, the unemployment rate likely would be near 7 percent and the economy’s momentum strengthening, supporting further robust job gains in the future. \n\nHere, a few points deserve emphasis.   First, the FOMC’s policy depends on the progress we make towards our objectives.  This means that the policy—including the pace of asset purchases—depends on the outlook rather than the calendar.  The scenario I outlined above is only that—one possible outcome.  Economic circumstances could diverge significantly from the FOMC’s expectations.  If labor market conditions and the economy’s growth momentum were to be less favorable than in the FOMC’s outlook—and this is what has happened in recent years—I would expect that the asset purchases would continue at a higher pace for longer.   \n\nSecond, even if this scenario were to occur and the pace of purchases were reduced, it would still be the case that as long as the FOMC continues its asset purchases it is adding monetary policy accommodation, not tightening monetary policy.  As the FOMC adds to its stock of securities, this should continue to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, making monetary policy more accommodative. \n\nThird, the Federal Reserve is likely to keep most of these assets on its balance sheet for a long time.  As Chairman Bernanke noted in his press conference last week, a strong majority of FOMC participants no longer favor selling agency MBS securities during the monetary policy normalization process.  This implies a bigger balance sheet for longer, which provides additional accommodation today and continuing support for mortgage markets going forward. \n\nFourth, even under this scenario, a rise in short-term rates is very likely to be a long way off.  Not only will it likely take considerable time to reach the FOMC’s 6.5 percent unemployment rate threshold, but also the FOMC could wait considerably longer before raising short-term rates.  The fact that inflation is coming in well below the FOMC’s 2 percent objective is relevant here.  Most FOMC participants currently do not expect short-term rates to begin to rise until 2015. \n\nSome commentators have interpreted the recent shift in the market-implied path of short-term interest rates as indicating that market participants now expect the first increases in the federal funds rate target to come much earlier than previously thought.  Setting aside whether this is the correct interpretation of recent price moves, let me emphasize that such an expectation would be quite out of sync with both FOMC statements and the expectations of most FOMC participants. \n\nRegional Economic Conditions\n\nLet me turn now to the regional economy, the focus of our presentations today.  Our last briefing on the regional economy took place at a difficult time—soon after Superstorm Sandy.  While economic life has returned to normal across most of the metro area, some of the hardest-hit areas are still struggling to recover and rebuild.  Just blocks from here, in fact, the South Street Seaport business district is still far from business-as-usual.  And there are many such neighborhoods across the metropolitan region, from the low-lying and coastal areas of New Jersey to Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island; from Staten Island to southern Connecticut.  One encouraging sign, though, is that our broader regional economy has shown remarkable resilience.  It has been growing and adding jobs at a reasonably good pace.  Moreover, the rebuilding effort appears to be giving a bit of a boost to the job market in industries such as construction. \n\nAs we’ve discussed before, the New York Fed produces economic activity indexes to help monitor the performance of New York State, New York City and New Jersey.  Based on these measures, New York City has continued to grow strongly, and New Jersey’s economy has seen some pickup in growth since the beginning of this year.  However, growth in New York State has slowed, and Puerto Rico’s economy is not faring well at all; the activity index produced by the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico shows that the Island’s economy has yet to show any signs of bottoming out.    \n\nThe job situation has varied somewhat across our region.  Improvement has generally been broad-based, with New York City and Long Island doing particularly well, though Puerto Rico continues to weaken.  Both Connecticut and New Jersey have recently been growing roughly in line with the nation thus far in 2013.  Unemployment rates across the region are roughly matching the national rate, with the exception of the relatively high rate that has characterized Puerto Rico’s labor market for some time.  Housing continues to be a focus of our regional monitoring efforts and home prices in our region appear to have bottomed.  Our economists will elaborate on these points this morning. \n\nAre Recent College Graduates Finding Good Jobs?\n\nThe special topic of today’s press briefing is a look at how well recent college graduates are faring in the job market, both nationally and here in our region. A college education represents an important investment in one’s human capital, meaning the knowledge and skills people build. Historically, it’s been pretty clear that those who’ve invested in a college education have tended to earn a sizeable economic return. And the benefits of college-educated citizens go well beyond the individual. Regions with a higher concentration of college graduates tend to be more innovative, have higher living standards and experience more rapid economic growth.2 So a college education plays an important role in helping individuals prosper, as well as in strengthening the broader economy.\n\nMore recently, though, rising costs, increasing student debt and widespread reports of recent college graduates not being able to find good jobs have raised some troubling questions about whether going to college is still a good investment. In fact, some of our own research, including material that we discussed at our last press briefing, has shown the dramatic increase in student debt over the past decade.3 In today’s briefing, we’re going to take a close look at the question of just how weak today’s labor market is for new college graduates by putting their recent experience into context using some hard data.\n\nIt is important for us to undertake this kind of analysis because, as we’ll show, newly minted graduates always take some time to transition into the labor market and find jobs that utilize their education. And young people with college degrees still fare far better than those without. At the same time, with the sluggish jobs recovery from the recession, it’s clear that the transition of recent graduates into the labor market is taking longer, and they’ve experienced higher unemployment and higher underemployment than in years past.4 Still, while times have gotten tougher for recent graduates, we shouldn’t be too hasty in concluding that getting a college education won’t help people find good jobs. \n\nI will now ask Jason Bram to present an update of economic conditions in our region.\n\n1 CoreLogic Report Shows Home Prices Rise by 12.1 Percent Year Over Year in April\n\n2See, for example, Edward L.

        "title": "Why Financial Stability is a Necessary Prerequisite for an Effective Monetary Policy",
        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2013/dud130624",
        "content": "This panel is entitled Monetary Policy and Banking.1 That takes in a lot of territory.  Rather than try to cover the waterfront, I am going to start with a single premise: Financial stability is a necessary prerequisite for an effective monetary policy.  There is a critical chain of linkages from monetary policy to banking and onwards to the real economy.  Financial stability is a necessary condition for those linkages to operate effectively.  Thus, it is a necessary condition for monetary policy to be able to achieve its economic objectives.  \n\nI will then outline briefly what I see as some of the major implications that stem from that premise.  These include that the central bank has a major role to play in ensuring financial stability and should evaluate the stance of monetary policy in light of problems in the financial system that may impair the monetary policy transmission mechanism.2 \n\nIn my mind, the biggest lesson of the financial crisis has been that monetary policy cannot work properly when there is financial instability.  When financial instability occurs, it disturbs market functioning and can also impair bank balance sheets.  The result can be disruption to the financial intermediation function with resulting constraints on the availability of credit for households and businesses.  This, in turn, can lead to further reductions in aggregate demand that put additional stress on the weakened financial system.  Obviously, this is not a favorable dynamic.\n\nFinancial instability can impact the conduct of  monetary policy via three major channels.  First, financial instability can generate a sufficiently large shock to aggregate demand that the central bank may encounter the zero lower bound constraint—the constraint that the monetary policy instrument, for example, the federal funds rate—cannot easily be pushed below zero. In such circumstances, it may not be easy to fully offset the shock through the pursuit of a more stimulative monetary policy. At the zero bound, the central bank is not powerless, and may turn to other monetary policy tools such as forward guidance and large scale asset purchases.  But these tools may not be as effective as lowering the short-term rate instrument.  In particular, the central bank may not be willing to use these nonconventional tools to the full extent necessary to provide the same degree of stimulus as it would provide if it could set interest rates at negative levels.  That might be because of uncertainty about how nonconventional tools will work or because of the potential costs associated with the use of such tools in terms of market functioning and the risks of future financial instability.   \n\nSecond, financial instability can impair the linkage between monetary policy and financial conditions.  The central bank may move to a much more accommodative monetary policy stance, but this may not lead to much improvement in financial conditions. We see this clearly in spreads and risk premia during periods of financial stress. Depletion of capital in the banking system or the interaction of frictions and market failures may also lead to constraints on the availability of credit following a financial shock.  As a recent U.S. example of the second issue, households with lower FICO scores have had difficulties in refinancing their mortgages or in obtaining new mortgages to purchase a home.  This stems from worries by lenders about put back risk—that such mortgages might be put back to them by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac should the mortgages become nonperforming.  For any given reduction in mortgage rates relative to normal levels, this reduces the support for the housing sector and consumption.   Thus, another lesson of the crisis is that monetary policymakers need to be more attuned to how the condition of the financial system influences how monetary policy changes affect financial conditions. \n\nThird, the linkage between financial conditions and aggregate demand may also be impaired.  For example, if an asset bubble has caused a buildup of debt that now needs to be reduced significantly, then lower interest rates that ease financial conditions may not stimulate aggregate demand very much.  Separately, in a protracted zero bound episode, the monetary policy impulse may become attenuated over time.  Lower interest rates may make financial conditions easier, lifting wealth, and encouraging households to shift spending from the future to the present.  But when the future arrives, spending may then be lower as a consequence.  The linkage between financial conditions and economic activity may vary depending on how long the accommodative monetary policy regime has been in place.\n\nSo what are the implications that stem from the fact that financial instability can impair the efficacy of monetary policy?   I think there are at least three major implications:\n\nLet me now consider each of these implications in turn.  The first implication, that the central bank has a strong stake in preventing financial instability, has several elements.  The central bank needs to be willing to respond to limit financial market bubbles from developing in the first place. This includes not just paying attention to asset price bubbles, but also to related excesses in leverage and in short-term funding markets.  As I noted in a speech a few years ago, this is difficult to do in practice.3  After all, bubbles are difficult to identify in real time and the central bank’s policy toolkit to deal with bubbles may be limited.  However, this difficulty cannot be an excuse for inaction.  Using the bully pulpit, implementing macroprudential measures, or adjusting monetary policy can generate superior results compared to inaction.     \n\nThe central bank also has to ensure that the financial system is sufficiently robust and resilient so that if there are financial market shocks, the banking system can absorb any shocks and continue to perform its credit intermediation function.  This has many elements including tough capital and liquidity requirements for banks and strong financial market infrastructures.  It also includes taking action to eliminate sources of vulnerabilities whenever they may arise—for example, strengthening the triparty repo system, reducing the vulnerability of money market mutual funds to runs, or forcing derivatives contracts to be standardized and centrally cleared. These actions should be undertaken during “peacetime” rather than when a crisis is already underway.\n\nFinally, the central bank needs to look over the horizon and identify market practices and processes that could make the financial system more vulnerable to shocks or that could amplify such shocks. As an example, a tougher response to the poor mortgage underwriting practices evident during the U.S. housing bubble would have been appropriate in my opinion.  Or more attention to bank compensation practices could have mitigated the incentives for excessive risk-taking.   \n\nThe second implication is that when financial instability does occur, the central bank needs to respond forcefully to mitigate such instability.  This includes ensuring that appropriate liquidity backstops are available.  This is necessary in order to reassure counterparties that solvent institutions will have access to liquidity so that they can repay their obligations regardless of the degree of illiquidity or stress in the financial system.  As we saw in the fall of 2008, without appropriate backstops, markets can seize up completely even when counterparties are perceived as solvent.  That is because market participants tend to hoard liquidity during times of stress and because counterparties may not engage with one another when they are uncertain whether others will do so.  Central bank liquidity backstops act as a coordinating device, solving the collective action problem faced by private market participants.\n\nHowever, in the most serious stress episodes, credible liquidity backstops alone will not always prove sufficient.  It is also necessary to take steps to restore the banking system to health as soon as possible.  This means forcing banks to cut their capital distributions early and to raise new capital in a timely way even if such capital-raising results in the forced dilution of existing shareholders. \n\nWith respect to bank capital, we saw two unwelcome behaviors during the crisis that central banks and other banking regulators need to lean against.  Banks were reluctant to cut their capital distributions because of worries that this would signal weakness.  Of course, these capital distributions just made the banks and the banking system weaker. \n\nAlso, we saw that banks were reluctant to raise capital to guard against particularly bad states of the world because they thought this might unnecessarily dilute their shareholders should such bad states of the world not materialize.  Of course, the collective action of banks to not raise this additional capital made the banking system weaker than it would otherwise have been. This in turn made the possibility of the particularly bad states of the world more likely. In such circumstances—which the U.S. faced in 2009 and arguably the Eurozone faces today—it is essential for the authorities to force sufficient capital into the system. The subtlety here is that in a time of stress it is necessary to overcapitalize the banking system relative to the base case scenario in order to ensure financial stability and an ongoing supply of credit to the real economy in a stress scenario. Doing this makes the bad scenario less likely to materialize and the improvement in credit supply helps to engineer a stronger recovery than would otherwise materialize.4\n\nThe third implication is that the stance of monetary policy needs to be assessed based on the state of the financial system and the real economy.  How the monetary policy impulse is transmitted to the real economy is not immutable but changes depending on how monetary policy affects financial conditions and how financial conditions affect economic activity. \n\nDuring and following financial crises, problems in the financial system can impair the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy.  When this happens, policy may need to be more accommodative than otherwise in order to achieve its objectives. \n\nThe experiences of both Japan and United States are cases in point.5  In retrospect, we know that following the collapse of the property bubble and the investment boom in Japan in the 1990s, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) did not follow a sufficiently accommodative monetary policy to prevent deflation.  Although the BoJ response was appropriate relative to the economic forecasts that prevailed at the time, those forecasts proved much too optimistic. Thus, policy was insufficiently accommodative with the benefit of hindsight.  To a lesser degree, the same critique also applies to the United States.  Despite an aggressive shift towards greater monetary policy accommodation in 2008 and 2009, and ongoing subsequent easing—which has supported a return to growth and helped to facilitate needed adjustments in housing and household balance sheets—the economic recovery has been consistently weaker  than forecast.   As a result, the Federal Reserve has fallen short of meeting its employment and inflation objectives.  This suggests that with the benefit of hindsight, U.S. monetary policy, though aggressive by historic standards, was not sufficiently accommodative relative to the state of the economy.      \n\nIn this regard, I would caution against the mechanical use of monetary policy rules following a financial crisis.  In the United States, the so-called Taylor Rule receives considerable attention as a guide to policy.  But there are a number of reasons to believe that using it mechanically would result in too tight of a monetary policy setting. While discussing the shortcomings of the Taylor Rule is beyond the scope of my remarks today, let me make one simple point.  If the transmission channels of monetary policy are impaired, then the equilibrium real rate associated with monetary policy neutrality is likely to be considerably lower than the 2.25 percent real rate assumption embodied in the typical Taylor Rule formulation.  Monetary policy needs to take this onboard, even before considering other issues such as risk-management at the zero bound.\n\nI have argued today that the central bank needs to have a major role in ensuring that the financial system is sound.  Without this, the central bank cannot ensure that monetary policy will be effective in achieving its objectives. This is the important linkage of monetary policy to banking. \n\nNow some express concern that involvement in banking regulation and supervision may lead a central bank to bias the setting of monetary policy to try to help troubled banks or other institutions. This fear is misplaced. Problems in the financial sector are taken into account for monetary policy purposes only to the extent that they affect the transmission of policy to the real economy. There is a separate tool kit to address problems at the level of the banks themselves.\n\nOthers will argue that having the central bank involved in the oversight and regulation of the financial system puts too much power in the hands of one authority. Another concern is that such a consolidation of responsibilities is dangerous for the central bank because it could threaten the central bank’s independence with respect to monetary policy.  I think these are legitimate issues.  But the bigger risks, in my view, are a monetary policy that fails to accomplish its economic objectives because of financial instability, and difficulties that stem from the inevitably imperfect coordination that takes place between multiple agencies with divided responsibilities during a crisis.  In those cases, not only will the central bank own that bad outcome with the resulting negative consequences for its ongoing credibility and effectiveness, but also the economic consequences will be severe for its citizens.\n\nTo address concerns about central bank power, the best approach is to ensure accountability.  This means appropriate oversight by the legislature and ongoing transparency by the central bank about the motivations for its actions, what it can reasonably expect to accomplish, and an honest assessment of its successes and failures.  \n\nThank you very much for your kind attention.   \n\n1 Krishna Guha, Marc Saidenberg and others on my staff contributed to these remarks\n\n2 As always, what I have to say here today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the FOMC or the Federal Reserve System.\n\n3 See “Asset Bubbles and the Implications for Central Bank Policy”, Economic Club of New York, April 7, 2010.   \n\n4 Ideally, as was the case in the U.S. in 2009, the authorities should require banks to meet their stress scenario capital ratio standards by adding equity capital, with no credit given for reducing assets. This leans against the incentive to deleverage to meet higher capital ratio requirements. \n\n5 See my recent speech “Lessons at the Zero Bound: The Japanese and U.S. Experience”, Japan Society, May 21, 2013."

        "content": "It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak today at the Japan Society.1   Our countries have very close relations and this is particularly true at the central banker level.  I just got back from the BIS last week where I had a chance to spend some time with Governor Kuroda.  \n\nToday, I will discuss the challenge that we both have been working to solve—how best to conduct monetary policy when short-term interest rates are already pinned close to zero, but the economy is still operating well below its potential.   This has required considerable learning.  After all, until Japan’s experience began in the 1990s, no major country had actually faced this problem since the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n\nAs the first nation to experience the zero bound in modern times, Japan was an early pioneer in developing unconventional tools and strategies.  Its experiences, both good and bad, along with lessons from other periods such as the Great Depression, have helped to inform the policies adopted by the United States (U.S.) and other nations in recent years.  The evolution of policy in Japan, in turn, has been informed, in part, by the experience of the U.S. and other nations. \n\nSo what have we learned to date?  Let me highlight six key points.\n\nFirst, and most importantly, managing expectations is critical in the execution of monetary policy at the zero bound.  This includes expectations about the central bank’s objectives for inflation and the economy, and expectations about how the central bank will use its tools in the future to achieve these goals.\n\nSecond, in managing expectations, good communication is essential.  Expectations will not be well anchored when communications are muddled or inconsistent, or when a central bank acts in ways that are not consistent with its guidance.\n\nThird, actions speak louder than words alone.  Thus, there is an important role for asset purchases that ease financial conditions to support growth and keep inflation expectations well anchored.\n\nFourth, the policy instruments interact so that policy as a whole exceeds the sum of its parts. \n\nFifth, at the zero lower bound, risk management becomes extremely important.  In particular, because the costs of getting stuck in a liquidity trap with chronic deflation are high, a central bank should put substantial weight on avoiding this outcome.  \n\nSixth, the constraints imposed by the zero bound limit what monetary policy can accomplish by itself.  This increases the importance of complementary fiscal, financial, and structural policy actions.  Credible fiscal policies, actions to ensure a healthy financial system, and structural reforms that lift the potential for growth are very important.\n\nAs always, what I will say here today represents my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC, Committee) or the Federal Reserve System. \n\nReview of the experience in Japan and the United States\n\nLet me start by briefly reviewing the experience of Japan and the United States.  As you all know, Japan’s rapid economic ascent and investment boom came to an abrupt halt in the early 1990s with the bursting of a gigantic bubble in equities and real estate. \n\nAsset price deflation resulted in a huge decline in wealth.  This led to a sharp fall in demand, a balance sheet squeeze for both businesses and households, and a large increase in problem loans for Japanese financial intermediaries.  By some measures—such as the loss of wealth relative to the size of the economy—this was a bigger shock than the U.S. experienced in 2008.  Growth slowed sharply and inflation fell.\n\nThe Bank of Japan (BoJ) responded by reducing overnight interest rates from a peak of more than 8 percent in early 1991 to ½ a percent by the fall of 1995.2   Most studies of this period suggest that policy was generally appropriate given economic forecasts at the time, but too tight relative to the actual outcomes.3  Economic forecasts for Japan—both by the official community and by private sector agents—were consistently more optimistic than the actual outturns.   It is noteworthy that as late as January 1995—on the eve of deflation—10-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields were still at 4.7 percent.\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, we now understand that the disinflationary consequences of the asset price bust and financial stress where vastly more powerful than was widely realized at the time.  As we later saw in the U.S., the forces of contraction and disinflation operated through many different channels—not just directly on household wealth, for example, but also through the impact of the asset price bust on the health of financial intermediaries and the supply of credit to households and businesses.\n\nOver time, the Japanese banking system came under mounting stress.  This was a slow-motion crisis, as the assets were mainly loans that were not marked-to-market.   Accounting practices and regulatory forbearance allowed banks to delay charging off bad loans and recapitalizing at the cost of impairing the availability of credit to new potential borrowers.   A full-blown banking crisis finally materialized in 1997.  Although some banks were recapitalized in 1999, the full regulatory response took several more years.\n\nThe monetary and fiscal stimulus that was provided helped Japan avoid a deep recession.  But expectations about future nominal income growth for both households and businesses ground lower over time.  With inflation expectations sinking, inflation-adjusted real interest rates rose, and Japan became mired in deflation.\n\nWhile deflation is ultimately a monetary phenomenon, structural elements were also important.  Long-term demographic factors added to the deflationary pressures and structural rigidities, and credit supply problems constrained the reallocation of resources to growth sectors.  These structural factors made it substantially more difficult to escape the deflation trap.  \n\nThe Bank of Japan was active during this period.   From the late 1990s onwards, it pioneered an extremely broad array of innovative tools—many of which were later adopted, in amended form, by the Fed and other major central banks.  These included forward guidance on the future path of the policy rate, quantitative easing through purchases of government securities and private assets including asset-backed securities, equities and real estate investment trusts (REITs), a more quantitative inflation objective, and funding for bank lending.\n\nFrom my perspective, Japan’s experience with forward guidance for the policy rate, asset purchases  and a more formal inflation goal are particularly instructive, as this helped inform the later use of such tools in the United States. \n\nIn early 1999, the Bank of Japan said it would maintain its zero interest rate policy until “deflationary concerns” were “dispelled.”   This commitment was lifted in August 2000, and the BoJ raised the policy rate by a quarter-point.   However, the BoJ was subsequently obliged to reverse course, and reintroduced forward guidance in March 2001.  This guidance was tied to the realization of a new inflation objective.\n\nWith deflation intensifying, the Bank of Japan embarked on a quantitative easing (QE) program in 2001 designed to increase the size of the monetary base.  The Bank of Japan engaged in purchases of JGBs that were large in scale, but confined to short-dated maturities.  This reflected a view that such purchases primarily acted through the liabilities side of the central bank's balance sheet—pushing up the amount of reserves in the banking system.  Because the growth of the monetary base was deemed the goal of policy, it was logical to purchase short-dated assets, which could be allowed to run off once a sustainable recovery was in place.\n\nThe downside of this approach was that the purchases did not change the composition of the private sector’s balance sheet very much because the policy essentially resulted in the exchange of one short-term risk-free asset for another.  As a consequence, the purchases had only modest direct effects on financial conditions.4\n\nStarting in 2006, when the initial wave of QE ended, the BoJ began to formalize its inflation goal in numerical terms. This was initially expressed as an “understanding of medium- to long-term price stability” based on individual policymakers’ views. The inflation objective went through several iterations before being defined in 2012 as a Committee “goal” of a positive range of 2 percent or lower, with a lower interim goal of 1 percent.\n\nFollowing the onset of the global financial crisis in 2007-2008, Japan resumed QE, and gradually tightened the link between its policy actions and its objectives.  By January 2012, the BoJ had committed to keep rates at the zero bound and to continue purchasing assets until the 1 percent goal was “in sight.”\n\nSeveral prominent Japanese experts have argued that there was a “start-stop” aspect to monetary policy during the 1990s and 2000s with reversals in policy beginning before deflationary expectations were eliminated.5   Fiscal policy also reversed abruptly on several occasions before economic recovery was firmly established.  While Japan did enjoy a period of respectable real per capita growth in the mid-2000s, escape from deflation proved elusive.\n\nMore than a decade after Japan’s bubble burst, the U.S. housing bubble burst.  This exposed extensive vulnerabilities in our financial system and triggered a global financial crisis.6 Unlike Japan, we had the advantage of being able to learn from another nation’s recent experience.  We applied what we understood to be the lessons from Japan, though with hindsight, perhaps not in every respect as completely as we could have. \n\nIn particular, Japan’s experience reinforced the lessons of the Great Depression here in the U.S. and made us sensitive to the disinflationary force of an asset price bust and financial crisis. We recognized that we had to be very aggressive to prevent deflation and deflation expectations from becoming well entrenched.\n\nThe Federal Reserve reduced short-term interest rates to nearly zero by late 2008—a little over a year and a half after the initial shock hit in August 2007.   Immediately upon reaching the zero bound, we provided additional stimulus by expanding our balance sheet and deploying forward guidance on the policy rate. These actions, in the context of a strong commitment to both our inflation and employment mandates, succeeded in preventing deflation expectations from taking hold, even though real outcomes were disappointing.  We also took steps to formalize our 2 percent inflation objective.7\n\nThe Fed’s large-scale asset purchase programs differed from those originally undertaken in Japan both in theory and in practice.  They were concentrated in longer-term securities—Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities.  This reflected a different perspective on how purchases affect financial conditions and the economy, as well as the different structure of our financial system.\n\nOur view is that asset purchases work primarily through the asset side of the balance sheet by transferring duration risk from the private sector to the central bank’s balance sheet.  This pushes down risk premia, and prompts private sector investors to move into riskier assets.  As a result, financial market conditions ease, supporting wealth and aggregate demand.  The fact that such purchases increase the amount of reserves in the banking system and the size of the monetary base is a byproduct—not the goal—of these actions.\n\nThe U.S. also moved relatively quickly to recapitalize core financial institutions—partly as a result of good judgment, but also because the intense pressures of a capital markets-based financial system forced us to confront these issues. The Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) in early 2009 identified and addressed the potential capital shortfalls of the major U.S. bank holding companies in a stressed scenario.  The SCAP forced the banks to recapitalize either through the use of private funds or the injection of government convertible preferred equity from the TARP program.\n\nHowever, our policy approach was far from perfect.  Comparing actual growth to the growth projections by FOMC participants in the Summary of Economic Projections shows that we were consistently too optimistic about growth over the 2009-2012 period.  As a result, with the benefit of hindsight, we did not provide enough stimulus.  Perhaps, if we had paid more attention to the persistent divergence between growth forecasts and outturns in Japan in the 1990s, we might have been more skeptical about the prospects for a strong economic recovery, even with a more aggressive monetary policy regime.   \n\nAlso, we could have done better in communicating our intentions and goals.  We put too much emphasis, too early, on the exit.  At an earlier stage, we should have put greater emphasis on our commitment to use all our tools to the fullest extent possible for as long as needed to achieve our dual mandate objectives.\n\nOur policies also had a “start-stop” aspect to them that may have undercut their effectiveness.  For example, until September 2012, our large-scale asset programs generally specified the total size of the program, with a purchase rate and an expected ending date.  This created a void when the programs ended and made our policy response sporadic and hard to forecast.  This limited the scope for market prices to adjust in anticipation of our future actions in ways that would help stabilize the economy.\n\nAnother shortcoming was in our use of forward guidance with respect to the path of short-term interest rates.  Although calendar-based guidance worked reasonably well in influencing expectations about the future path of short-term rates and thus the shape of the yield curve, it was clumsy in a number of respects.  For example, if we moved the forward date guidance out in time, did this reflect a change in our reaction function, the amount of desired policy stimulus or greater pessimism about the outlook?  \n\nOf course, as we have learned, we have acted to rectify these shortcomings.  For example, our asset purchases are now outcome based, tied to the goal of substantial improvement in the labor market outlook, and our forward guidance on short-term rates is tied to unemployment and inflation thresholds rather than to a calendar date.\n\nThe Japanese authorities have also capitalized on our joint experiences and actions.  Thus, we have witnessed a convergence in the monetary policy regimes of our two countries. \n\nToday, the two regimes are quite similar in three important respects.  Both the Fed and the Bank of Japan place considerable emphasis on an explicit inflation objective, commit the central bank to use all available tools to achieve its objectives, and use forward guidance on interest rates and large scale purchases of long duration assets as the main tools to achieve these objectives.   \n\nAlthough there are still some important distinctions in how policy is conducted, much of these relate more to differences in legal frameworks and the current starting point for economic activity and inflation rather than fundamental differences in philosophy.  For example, the BoJ’s asset purchases are broader than the Fed’s, extending to equity ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) and REITs.  This option is not available to the Federal Reserve because the Federal Reserve Act sets tighter limits as to the types of assets that the Federal Reserve can purchase.\n\nSimilarly, current circumstances in the two countries are different, with deflationary expectations still in the process of being dislodged in Japan.  The BoJ needs to push up inflation expectations, whereas in the U.S. the current level of inflation expectations is consistent with the long-term objective of the Fed. Therefore, the BoJ, relative to the respective sizes of the two economies, has adopted a purchase program that is more aggressive that the U.S. program.  This is true whether measured in terms of the amount of duration being pulled out of the market or purchases as a share of total issuance. \n\nLessons learned\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, there have been at least six major areas where there has been significant learning, which has influenced the evolution of policy.  Let me turn to them.\n\nThe importance of managing expectations\n\nManaging expectations is always central to monetary policy.  However, at the zero bound this is even more critical than usual.\n\nThere are two aspects of this.   First, keeping inflation expectations anchored at levels consistent with the central bank’s medium-term inflation objective—2 percent on the personal consumption expenditures deflator in our case—is vitally important. Once deflation expectations become well entrenched, it is very difficult to change them.  And, because inflationary expectations are an important driver of actual inflation outcomes, deflationary expectations can be self-fulfilling in driving actual deflation outcomes.  Also, if inflation expectations were allowed to fall, this would raise the level of expected real interest rates, making monetary policy less accommodative.\n\nConversely, a central bank does not want medium-term inflation expectations to climb above levels consistent with its inflation objective.  If inflation expectations were to become unanchored to the upside, that could damage credibility and result in higher risk premia for financial assets and tighter financial market conditions.  Thus, a policy that maintains medium-term inflation expectations in line with our inflation objective is most consistent with our mandate.8\n\nSecond, at the zero bound, the ability to provide credible forward guidance—both in terms of the future path of the policy rate and the future path of the balance sheet— becomes the predominant vehicle by which a central bank’s actions affect financial market conditions.  If this expectations channel did not work, then it would be very difficult to provide additional monetary accommodation because short-term rates cannot be reduced materially.\n\nIn the U.S., in recent months we have communicated that short-term rates are likely to stay very low for a long time; our balance sheet is likely to increase further in size and then stay large for a long time; and that we will not be overly hasty in tightening monetary policy once the recovery gets well established.  By doing this, we are influencing expectations about the likely future path of short-term rates and the interest rate term premium.  By utilizing the expectations channel in this way, we have been able to make policy more accommodative and generate easier financial market conditions.  \n\nGood communication is essential\n\nTo manage expectations well, both credibility and good communication is essential.  This means explaining clearly the policy framework, the relationship between the use of tools and the central bank’s mandated objectives at the zero bound, and how the use of these tools will evolve with changes in the outlook.\n\nIn this regard, a central bank’s credibility is crucial.  Only if a central bank does what it promises to do will expectations be solidly anchored.  Of course, this does not mean mechanically following a set policy trajectory regardless of how the outlook changes, but it does mean that the stance of policy over time must evolve in ways consistent with the criteria established in the guidance.\n\nIt is important to communicate how policy will respond to changing economic circumstances over time.  This is particularly important when the outlook changes, because expectations about how policy will respond can be an important self-stabilizing element of monetary policy.   In this regard, a framework that ties the use of policy tools explicitly to economic outcomes has many advantages.\n\nGood public communication is also important.   For example, press conferences offer an opportunity to ground the policy actions and stance in a framework that is explicit about how the central bank plans to achieve its mandated objectives. \n\nAsset purchases are an effective tool\n\nCredibility requires taking action in the present as well as providing guidance for the future, and we are fortunate to have learned that asset purchases can indeed be an effective tool to support growth, employment and inflation expectations at the zero bound. While I believe that managing expectations is crucial, I am somewhat skeptical of the view that forward guidance on the policy rate alone is sufficient in these circumstances.  This is particularly the case when guidance extends out several years in the future.  Promises about future actions may be seen as not fully credible given the potential for changes in a central bank’s leadership and policy committee and the degree of uncertainty about economic conditions that will prevail far out in the future.  \n\nIn recent years, we have developed considerable positive experience providing accommodation through changes in the size and composition of the central bank balance sheet.  Taking interest rate risk and mortgage prepayment risk out of private hands has proven to be effective in easing financial conditions, increasing wealth and lowering private sector borrowing costs.9   The impact of purchases may be attenuated to some degree by deleveraging and ongoing adjustments in markets such as real estate. But it is material even in these circumstances, and builds over time as these needed adjustments proceed. \n\nThe sum is greater than its parts                                            \n\nAnother important insight is that each of the components of policy—the current stance in terms of the policy rate and the balance sheet, expectations about the future stance, the degree of commitment to future policy, and the clarity of communications—all interact.  Our tools are more powerful used in combination, and, when their use is explicitly tied to the outcomes we seek to achieve.  As a result, the sum is more powerful than the component parts.\n\nRisk management is particularly important\n\nRisk management is particularly important at the zero bound. At the zero lower bound, once you are caught in deflation, it is very hard to get out.  Thus, policymakers need to put considerable weight on this risk and conduct monetary policy with sufficient aggressiveness to ensure that they avoid such an outcome. \n\nIt is also true that we have less experience with the monetary policy tools used at the zero bound.  As a result, there is greater uncertainty around the efficacy and costs of these tools.   This pushes in the opposite direction of being more cautious. \n\nThis means that risk management is essential—what are the costs of being wrong in either direction?  Sometimes a cautious, incremental approach may not always be the right strategy.\n\nLimits to monetary policy\n\nAt the zero bound, monetary policy encounters additional constraints.  These fall into three broad buckets. \n\nFirst, there are costs associated with non-conventional tools.  This means they cannot simply be used without limit, though the appropriate limit will vary based on the outlook and balance of risks.   The most obvious example of this is our large-scale asset purchase program.  As the balance sheet increases in size, the potential costs increase in terms of market functioning, risks to financial stability, and the path of future remittances to the U.S. Treasury. \n\nSecond, there is a limit on how far the expectations channel can be exploited.  As I discussed earlier, since the current FOMC cannot bind future FOMCs and the economic outlook is highly uncertain, it isn’t reasonable to expect that policies that affect expectations many years in the future will have a powerful impact today.  I believe that the effectiveness of the expectations channel decays as the length of the horizon extends. \n\nThird, monetary policy is only one leg of the stool necessary to generate a vibrant and sustained economic expansion.  In particular, as noted earlier, the health of the financial system is critical.  For without it, the monetary transmission channels will be impaired and monetary policy will be less effective in influencing the cost and availability of credit. Similarly, it is critical that fiscal policy be set appropriately.  This means the short-term impulse needs to be properly calibrated to the current set of economic circumstances (not too much restraint) and the long-run budget trajectory needs to credible and consistent with fiscal sustainability.  Finally, removing structural impediments that hinder growth and economic rebalancing are also important.  In the case of the U.S., this could include changes in immigration policy, infrastructure investments that remove bottlenecks and job training programs that improve the quality of human capital.    \n\nImplications for U.S. monetary policy\n\nUndoubtedly, we will continue to learn as we seek to implement monetary policy most effectively. \n\nLet me give a few examples of how my own thinking may evolve.  In terms of our asset purchase program, I believe we should be prepared to adjust the total amount of purchases to that needed to deliver a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook in the context of price stability.  In doing this, we might adjust the pace of purchases up or down as the labor market and inflation outlook changes in a material way. For me, the base case forecast is not the sole consideration—how confident we are about that outcome is also important.  \n\nBecause the outlook is uncertain, I cannot be sure which way—up or down—the next change will be.  But at some point, I expect to see sufficient evidence to make me more confident about the prospect for substantial improvement in the labor market outlook. At that time, in my view, it will be appropriate to reduce the pace at which we are adding accommodation through asset purchases.  Over the coming months, how well the economy fights its way through the significant fiscal drag currently in force will be an important aspect of this judgment. \n\nWe are also learning about how best to prepare for the eventual normalization of monetary policy. For example, we may need to update our thinking with respect to the so-called exit principles that we published in June 2011 in order to bring them up to date with developments since then, and ensure they do not unnecessarily constrain our ability to conduct policy in the most effective way  today. \n\nThose exit principles stated that we would first stop reinvesting, then raise short-term interest rates, and finally sell agency mortgage backed securities over a three-to-five year period. This seems stale in several respects.  In particular, how does one time the end of reinvestment given that we now have economic thresholds that govern the timing of liftoff?  Also, the thresholds are thresholds, not triggers.  Thus it is hard to link the timing of the end of reinvestment to the unknown liftoff date for short-term rates.\n\nMore broadly, it may be desirable to update our thinking around the path and composition of the balance sheet over time, in light of our capacity to shape this path in a way that mitigates potential costs and risks. For example, the agency MBS portfolio is substantially larger today than it was when the original exit principles were devised. To the extent that the Committee wants to reduce the risk of disrupting market functioning during normalization, it could decide to indicate that it will avoid selling the MBS portfolio during the early stages of the normalization process.  Moreover, to the extent that the Committee wants to mitigate the risk of a sharp increase in long-term rates, it could judge that it would prefer not to commit to agency MBS sales. Expectations about future MBS sales or actual sales have the potential to generate or amplify such an upward spike in long-term rates.  If the Committee believes that it could be costly in terms of credibility to incur a period of no remittances to Treasury—a notion I am personally somewhat skeptical about—avoiding MBS sales would also reduce this risk.  Indeed, the Committee might conclude that it was better on all three counts to allow the agency MBS securities to run off passively over time.10 \n\nAn important challenge for us will be to think carefully about what combination of actions and communications will best ensure that when we do eventually judge that it is appropriate to begin normalizing policy, the initial tightening of financial market conditions is commensurate to what we desire. There is a risk is that market participants could overreact to any move in the process of normalization.  Indeed, there is some risk that market participants could overreact even before normalization begins, when the pace of purchases is adjusted but the level of accommodation is still increasing month by month.11 Not only could such responses threaten financial stability, but also they might make it harder to calibrate monetary policy appropriately to the economic situation. We will need to think long and hard about how best to develop policy in a way that enables us to respond flexibly to a changing economic outlook, but in a way that is not disruptive to the economy.12\n\nBased on what we have learned to date at the zero bound, I believe that it will be important for us to anchor all our communication around the core principle: The path of the policy rate and the size and composition of the balance sheet over time will be driven by our unbending commitment to our dual mandate objectives of maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability.\n\nAs you can see, there will be much more to learn as we go.  Thank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n1 Krishna Guha, Paolo Pesenti, Simon Potter, Jamie McAndrews, Jonathan McCarthy, Lorie Logan, John Clark, Eben Lazarus and others on my staff helped with the preparation of these remarks.\n\n2 Actual overnight rates; the Bank of Japan did not publish its rate target until 1998.\n\n3 See “Preventing Deflation: Lessons from Japan’s Experience in the 1990s, ” Alan Ahearn, Joseph Gagnon, Jane Haltmaier, and Steve Kamin et. al., International Finance Discussion Papers, No 729, June 2002, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n4However, research suggests that the purchases did reinforce the forward commitment.  See, for example, “Policy commitment and expectation formation: Japan’s experience under zero interest rates” Kunio Okina and Shigenori  Shiratsuka North American Journal of Economics and Finance, Vol 15, No 1, pp 75-100.\n\n5 See, for example, “Deleveraging and Monetary Policy: Japan Since the 1990s and the United States Since 2007”, Kazuo Ueda, Journal of Economic Perspectives, Vol 26, No 3, Summer 2012, pp 177-202.\n\n6 Some commentators prefer the term “North Atlantic financial crisis” as the failure and near-failure of financial institutions was concentrated in the U.S. and Europe. However, the crisis was global in the sense that financial markets transmitted the shock throughout the world and this resulted in a severe global economic downturn.\n\n7 Committee members, through their submissions to the Summary of Economic Projections, had already indicated that their inflation objective was close to 2 percent as measured by the personal consumption expenditures deflator; in January 2012 the Committee formalized the inflation objective as a 2 percent “longer run goal” (see http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120125c.htm).\n\n8 In addition to acting to manage inflation expectations, the central bank can also support expectations about the outlook for growth and job creation.  This can be implemented by making it clear that, subject to medium-term price stability, it will seek to stabilize the economy and has the means to do so even at the zero bound.\n\n9 With respect to borrowing costs, this is particularly true in real terms.\n\n10This would also provide additional stimulus at the margin, since the degree of accommodation provided by our balance sheet holdings is related to how long the public expects us to hold the assets.\n\n11 The move to economic thresholds-based guidance for the federal funds rate should help in this regard. While the thresholds are certainly not triggers, they should help market participants adjust expectations about the likely timing of lift-off in a relatively continuous manner and guard against these expectations being pulled further forward in time than is warranted by changes in the economic outlook.\n\n12 Indeed, even when purchases of additional longer-term securities cease, the enlarged balance sheet will provide substantial ongoing stimulus. It is important to recognize that the Fed could remain in this posture with policy “on hold” for a significant period."

        "content": "It is my pleasure to welcome you to today’s conference on transatlantic economic interdependence and policy challenges.  We have a great program today with many distinguished speakers from academia, and the private and public sectors.  In particular, I would highlight the keynote speech following lunch by Olli Rehn, the vice president of the European Commission.\n\nWe live in a global economy with a global financial system, yet macroeconomic policy and regulation and supervision have a decidedly national orientation.  This creates a challenge for all of us as we seek to balance our domestic needs against the benefits from having a harmonized and integrated global system.  We can do better through international cooperation and coordination both on macro policy and on regulation and supervision, rather than trying to “go it alone.” \n\nAs the two largest economies in the world, the United States and the European Union have a shared stake in the vitality of the global economy.  Without growth in both our regions, the global economy will not prosper and we will not be able to satisfy the aspirations of our citizens.\n\nToday I want to focus on some of the challenges that we both face.  As I see it, significant progress has been made in the United States and Europe in recovering from the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression and the deep recession that followed, but more still needs to be done.\n\nOn the regulatory side, there is considerable good news worth highlighting.  In particular, substantial progress has been made in strengthening the global capital and liquidity standards for internationally active banks.  This should make the failure of large firms much less likely.  Also, the financial system is being rebuilt to make it more resilient and robust.  For example, the requirement that over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives be standardized and centrally cleared whenever possible should strengthen the global financial system.  Similarly, the global set of principles for financial market infrastructures has been updated and strengthened. \n\nMoreover, some tentative steps have also been made so we can better deal with the failure of systemically important financial firms on a cross-border basis.  Key attributes for resolution regimes have been promulgated by the Financial Stability Board.  Efforts are underway to implement national regimes consistent with these standards and that can work together in a coordinated way on a global basis. \n\nBut more needs to be done.  The impediments to an orderly cross-border resolution still need to be fully identified and dismantled.  This is necessary to eliminate the so-called “too big to fail” problem. The Basel III capital and liquidity requirements need to be fully implemented.  Also, cross-border regulatory cooperation needs to be further enhanced.  This includes greater exchange of confidential supervisory information so that national regulators can be fully informed about the conditions of the banks that operate within their borders.  It also requires efforts to ensure a level playing field across jurisdictions so that the focus is on promoting safety and stability rather than trying to protect, favor, or shield national champions.\n\nIn terms of the macroeconomy, there is both good and bad news.  In the United States, the good news is that the economic outlook appears to be gradually improving.  The household sector is far along in the deleveraging process, the housing sector is recovering, the banking system is healthier and credit conditions are easing, the corporate sector is highly profitable and awash in cash.\n\nMonetary policy has been effective at fostering easier financial market conditions, even with short-term rates pinned at the zero bound. To provide the appropriate degree of accommodation, the Federal Reserve has recently moved to an outcome-based approach in which the use of our tools is explicitly tied to developments in the economy and economic outlook.  Currently, as part of this strategy, we are purchasing $85 billion of longer-term Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities each month. After reviewing the efficacy and costs of this program, I have concluded that that efficacy has been as high or higher than I expected at the onset of the program and costs the same or lower.\n\nNevertheless, the United States could be doing better.  The U.S. fiscal policy program, for example, does not appear well-calibrated to the current set of economic circumstances. We have too much fiscal restraint in the short term, and too little consolidation in the long term. The degree of fiscal restraint this year (about 1¾ percent of gross domestic product [GDP] in 2013) is quite large relative to the forward momentum of the economy.  Thus, we have a tug-of-war between the improving economy and the current large negative fiscal impulse.  How this tug-of-war gets resolved—which force dominates—won’t be known for some time.  In other words, the level of uncertainty about the near-term outlook in the United States remains quite high.\n\nMeanwhile, the long-term fiscal outlook for the United States is still troubling.  So far, partisan divisions in Washington have limited progress in reaching the type of “grand bargain” needed to put the United States on a sustainable long-term fiscal path, though of late we have at least seen some renewed talk about this.  Nor have we yet deployed a comprehensive set of policies to support the rebalancing of the U.S. economy toward a growth path based more on business investment, trade and broad-based income gains than the type of asset price gains and credit-fuelled consumption, which dominated the last business cycle.\n\nFor Europe, the near term macroeconomic outlook seems less bright.  The good news is that the peripheral countries have made substantial efforts to bring down their structural budget deficits. They have also made some progress in improving their international competitiveness, though there remains an opportunity for further structural reforms in labor and product markets—and not just in the periphery—to increase productivity and strengthen long term growth prospects.\n\nThe European Central Bank’s (ECB) introduction of the outright monetary transactions (OMT) program has reduced financial market tensions considerably in the peripheral countries, so that sovereign debt funding costs in those countries are at more reasonable levels.  The risk that interest rates in the periphery could spiral upward has been significantly diminished.  Also, the commitment to European integration remains strong, a factor that U.S.-based analysts and investors do not always sufficiently appreciate.  Over the past few years, when the situation has been the most bleak, the choice in favor of the Union with the euro at its core has always won out. \n\nThe bad news is that the eurozone is still in a recession and the political support for further rounds of budget-tightening has clearly lessened. The eurozone financial system is being fragmented and the partial easing of pressure on peripheral sovereign debt markets has not translated into a corresponding easing in private-sector borrowing costs in these nations.  If growth does not resume relatively soon, then the political support for continued fiscal and structural adjustment could further erode.\n\nIn Europe, a key challenge is to strengthen the economic foundations of monetary union at the system level.  This needs to be done in a way that combines deeper integration with good incentives and governance so that it can be broadly supported by both the core and peripheral countries.  In this respect, it is important to recall that the architects of EMU from the outset defined it as a project of Economic and Monetary Union.\n\nI view the task of transitioning to a pan-European banking union with the ECB as the primary overseer of the European banking system as a critically important next step.  Successfully moving to a pan-European banking union would generate a large number of benefits:\n\nIn short, banking union has the potential to make a powerful contribution to eurozone stability and growth, both in the short term and in the long term.\n\nNow, will moving to a pan-European banking system be easy?  Of course not.  It will require a common set of standards to be applied across the whole system.  This may well reveal shortcomings among particular banks and the burden is not likely to fall evenly across the European Union.  It will be important to identify the sources of capital that will fill any such holes in order to ensure ongoing stability and to avoid constraining the availability of credit.\n\nThe process of banking union appropriately begins with a single supervisory mechanism.  But, a common resolution authority and integrated deposit insurance framework that is both credible and consistent with good incentives are likely to be required, as well.  The task at hand will likely require each country to give up a small amount of sovereignty with respect to banking oversight so that the outcome  is viewed as fully credible.  In my view, this is a critical next step in the “one money, one market” project underlying the EU agenda. \n\nI’d now like to introduce Ambassador Vale de Almeida as our next speaker.  The ambassador has been here in his current role since August 2010.  Prior to his current appointment, he worked as a director general at the European Commission (EC) and has had a long and distinguished career at the EC dating back to 1982.  So he is extraordinarily well-versed to speak on the issues of interdependence and the policy challenges we face.  Welcome Ambassador Vale de Almeida."

I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the Staten Island Chamber of Commerce and to be part of this distinguished panel. Thank you for inviting me today.\n\nAs you know I have the honor of serving as the president and CEO of the New York Fed, one of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks that together with the Board of Governors in Washington make up the Federal Reserve System, our nation’s central bank. As head of the New York Fed I am vice-chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the body that sets our nation’s monetary policy.\n\nThe Fed was founded 100 years ago in 1913 to advance economic and financial stability. Over this century our nation’s economic output and standard of living has increased greatly, but the United States also faced many different challenges—ranging from the Great Depression of the 1930s to the Great Inflation of the 1970s and most recently the financial crisis.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is independent from politics and the national government but is subject to oversight by Congress, which has set our dual mandate to promote maximum sustainable employment and price stability. The Federal Reserve is structured to ensure that the economic needs of people and businesses in every part of our country are fully considered in our policy deliberations.  What I learn in my visit to Staten Island today is an important input to our policymaking process.  \n\nAs New York Fed president I try to get out of my New York City office as much as I can to get a sense of regional economic conditions across what is known as the second Federal Reserve District. I’ve traveled throughout New York, New Jersey and Puerto Rico in recent years and plan to visit Fairfield County, upstate New York and Queens later this year.\n\nThese visits give me the opportunity to explain what the Federal Reserve is doing and to get your thoughts about the state of our economy and the challenges that you face.\n\nToday, I will focus on the economic outlook regionally and nationally.  After that, I’ll be happy to answer any questions you have about what the Fed does, and about the economic outlook.  As always, my views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the FOMC or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions\n\nThe financial crisis underscored the fact that the world is a complicated place and that the insights of professional economists and financial experts must be supplemented with a broader set of perspectives from households and businesses. Today’s visit is in that spirit—I want to talk about what we are seeing in the economy but also to hear from you firsthand about your assessment of economic conditions. \n\nSo what do we see? Let me start with basic economic characteristics. While Staten Island is the city’s least populous borough, its population has grown steadily and rapidly, more than doubling in the last half-century to close to one-half million residents.  On its own, Staten Island is larger than all other cities in the entire New York-New Jersey region, with the obvious exception of New York City. \n\nIn many ways—homeownership, educational attainment, income, and demographics—Staten Island more closely resembles the nation than the rest of New York City.  For example, the homeownership rate on Staten Island is almost 70 percent, well above the 30 percent average homeownership rate citywide.  Still, with a sizable proportion of the borough’s workers commuting to Manhattan (about ¼ of the island’s workers or more than 50,000 people) Staten Island’s economy is closely tied to the rest of the city’s economy, as well as to northern New Jersey’s.  Thus, when Manhattan sees brisk job growth, the residents of Staten Island have better opportunities. \n\nThe New York City economy continues to rebound strongly from the 2008-09 downturn—more strongly than the nation as a whole.  The New York Fed’s index of economic activity for the city has grown solidly and steadily for the past three years, signaling a robust rebound in the local economy.  This strength is reflected in strong job creation: while the U.S. economy has thus far recovered only about two-thirds of the jobs lost during the recession, New York City has recovered all its lost jobs and then some.  In fact, total employment in the Big Apple recently surpassed not only its pre-crisis peak of 2008 but also its all-time peak of 1969. \n\nHere on Staten Island job creation has not been quite as robust over the past couple years.  It should be recognized, however, that Staten Island’s economy was actually more resilient than Manhattan’s during the recession, experiencing only minimal job losses.  Staten Island’s key industries—local-market sectors like health, education and retail trade—tend to be less susceptible to sharp economic downturns than more cyclical sectors, like manufacturing, construction and finance.\n\nEven so, not all indicators of the local economy are improving.  Unemployment remains stubbornly high, at just over 8 percent.  And home prices, though recovering gradually, are still down about 15 percent from where they were back in 2007.  This compares to nationally where they are down about 25 percent on average.  \n\nThe New York Fed’s quarterly measures of household credit conditions signal some recent improvement, though there clearly remain pockets of financial stress among families here.  At year-end, for those people with a credit report, average debt per person in Staten Island ticked up, rising to about $67,000, after trending down for a number of years.  A similar uptick in debt was observed nationwide, potentially signaling that households are now somewhat more willing to take on debt.  Delinquency rates, however, are still fairly high:  9.7 percent of all debt in the county is seriously delinquent, well above the national rate.  On a more positive note, delinquency rates on Staten Island are declining and are at their lowest level in 3½ years.  Mortgage delinquency rates, though still above the national rate, are also at a 3½-year low.\n\nRecently, of course, Staten Island’s greatest challenge has been the massive disruption and destruction caused by Superstorm Sandy.  While many parts of the New York City metropolitan region were hard-hit by the storm, the devastation was particularly severe here on Staten Island.  And this is something that has had large consequences for some of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  Nearly 150 of our employees call Staten Island their home.  While many, thankfully, were spared the full brunt of the storm, I know quite a few people whose homes were destroyed or severely damaged and others who lost many of their belongings. \n\nImmediately following Sandy, our Regional and Community Outreach function reached out to all of the affected communities as part of a needs assessment. We asked: \"How can the New York Fed best leverage our resources to help our community?\"\n\nAfter dozens of conversations with leaders of the community, we determined that pulling together key service providers under one roof would make a useful contribution. Our outreach team organized a free relief clinic in this very building. We brought together a wide variety of government agency representatives and other service providers.  I would like to acknowledge what is a long list:  Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Small Business Administration (SBA), the Office of the New York Attorney General, the New York State Department of Financial Services, the New York Legal Assistance Group, Staten Island Legal Services, the Legal Aid Society, MFY Legal Services, various bar associations, New York City Department of Small Business Services, Center for New York City Neighborhoods, Neighborhood Housing Services of Staten Island and the Northfield Local Community Development Corporation. I’m proud to say we were able to assist over 150 Staten Islanders, including homeowners, tenants and small business owners.\n\nWe also heard that it could be challenging to find key recovery information and advice online. So once again, we pulled key resources under one roof—or I should say one URL. We developed a Sandy Information Center with the best information we could find for folks impacted by Sandy—including key deadline dates along with expert legal, finance and insurance guidance. Over 2,000 have benefited from our web resources.\n\nWhile we are not yet back to normal in neighborhoods like Midland Beach, Oakwood Beach, New Dorp Beach and Tottenville, the situation is improving and I expect that this recovery will continue over the coming year.  We are going to continue to examine where we can provide assistance in supporting this effort.  One effort, for example, is to provide assistance in collecting detailed data on the areas that were impacted by the storm.   \n\nFrom talking to some local business people late last November, we know that many residents and businesses had to wait a long time for insurance claims and small business loans, as well as to get their heat and power restored.  We also know that eight public schools were closed. \n\nUnfortunately, timely statistics pertaining specifically to Staten Island’s economy are scarce, thus making it hard to accurately gauge the impact from Sandy or the strength and breadth of the ensuing recovery.  So we truly value input from all of you—people on the front lines of the local economy—to assist us in gauging recent trends and developments in Staten Island’s economy.   \n\nNational Economic Conditions\n\nTurning to the national outlook, the U.S. economy remains on the slow growth track that has persisted since the recession ended in mid-2009. In fact, real gross domestic product (GDP) grew just 1.7 percent in 2012, below the 2.2 percent rate of the preceding two years. This lackluster and disappointing performance masks the fact that the underlying conditions that support growth have been gradually improving. However, in the near-term, this improvement in fundamentals is being offset by federal tax increases and spending cuts, which economists call “fiscal drag.”  The most obvious example of this is the end of the partial payroll tax holiday at the beginning of this year.  This reduced the take-home pay for all those that pay into the Social Security system. \n\nIn a recent speech to the Economic Club of New York, I discussed a number of areas where economic fundamentals have improved.  Here, let me concentrate instead on some areas of the economy where the impact of this improvement in fundamentals has been most evident: consumer spending, the housing market, and investment in equipment and software.\n\nDespite the increase in payroll taxes and in high-income tax rates, real—that is, inflation-adjusted—personal consumption expenditures rose solidly in January and February.  As has been the case for some time, the growth of consumer spending has been led by purchases of durable goods.  Car and light truck sales in the first quarter were at the highest pace since the fourth quarter of 2007.  This growth in consumer spending probably is due, in part, to improvements in labor market conditions, household balance sheets and household access to credit.  However, retail sales were quite weak in March, suggesting that the tax increases that occurred at the start of the year may be beginning to have a material effect.  \n\nAfter a long period of being a drag on the economy, the housing market is now providing lift to economic activity, with upward trends evident in housing starts, home sales, and home prices.  To see why this is so important, in 2009 residential investment exerted a 0.4 percentage point drag on GDP growth, while in 2013 it is likely to provide a boost to growth on the order of 0.5 percentage point—a swing of nearly a full percentage point.  In addition, rising home prices can create positive spillovers to the rest of the economy as higher home prices lift household wealth and reduce the number of homeowners with negative equity.\n\nBusiness investment in equipment and software, another component of private final demand, strengthened in the fourth quarter, and shipments and orders for nondefense capital goods suggest further growth in the first quarter.  Moreover, indicators of the U.S. manufacturing sector, including the ISM manufacturing index and most Federal Reserve regional manufacturing indexes, point to continued moderate growth in the sector.  \n\nSo why isn't the U.S. economy growing more quickly? The most important reason is the sharp shift in federal fiscal policy from mild restraint in 2012 to much greater restraint in 2013. The increase in payroll tax rates, the rise in high income tax rates, the increase in taxes associated with the Affordable Care Act, and the sequester will result in fiscal drag of about 1¾ percentage points of GDP in 2013, an unusually large amount of fiscal restraint when the economy doesn’t have strong forward momentum and unemployment is still elevated.\n\nIn terms of the labor market, we have seen only a moderate improvement in labor market conditions over the past six months or so. After an encouraging pick up in the pace of job creation around the turn of the year, the employment report for March showed a gain of only 88,000 jobs. While I don’t want to read too much into a single month’s data, this underscores the need to wait and see how the economy develops before declaring victory prematurely.  I’d note that we saw similar slowdowns in job creation in 2011 and 2012 after pickups in the job creation rate and this, along with the large amount of fiscal restraint hitting the economy now, makes me more cautious.  \n\nSince September, payroll employment has increased an average of 188,000 per month, compared with an average of 172,000 per month over the previous two years.  The unemployment rate has declined from a peak of 10 percent in October 2009 to 7.6 percent in March; however, much of the decrease is due to a fall in the number of people actively looking for a job.  Furthermore, as of March there were still almost 3 million fewer jobs than at the end of 2007, and the ratio of employed Americans to the working age population was actually lower than it was at the end of the recession.  Also, in an indication that employment is far from healthy, job finding rates have changed little since the recession. New York Fed staff research agrees with the broad consensus that cyclical factors are the major reason for the continued weakness in labor market conditions. \n\nIn sum, these developments lead me to expect sluggish real GDP growth over the course of 2013 of about 2 to 2½ percent.  As such, I anticipate that the unemployment rate will decline only modestly through the rest of the year.\n\nIn the near term, there is considerable uncertainty about the outlook, particularly because the multiplier effects from fiscal drag and sequestration are still unclear. This uncertainty should gradually decline—for better or for worse—over the coming months, as the sequester’s impact takes hold and more economic data come in, giving us a clearer picture of the forward momentum of the economy.\n\nInflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditure deflator, is currently well below the Federal Reserve's objective of 2 percent. There is substantial slack in the labor market and in the markets for goods and services, and underlying measures of inflation are subdued.  Moreover, peoples’ expectations of inflation remain well anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent longer-run objective. Thus, I conclude that the risk that inflation could significantly exceed our 2 percent objective is quite low over the next few years, even if the economy were to strengthen considerably.\n\nWith inflation well below its longer-run goal and high unemployment, the FOMC decided at its March meeting to maintain a “highly accommodative” policy stance: a federal funds rate in a range of 0 to 25 basis points with forward guidance based on economic thresholds.   Moreover, to support a stronger economic recovery, the FOMC is purchasing long-term Treasury securities at a rate of $45 billion per month and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) at a rate of $40 billion per month, and will continue purchasing assets until it sees substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, conditional on ongoing assessment of benefits and costs.  Combined, these actions are intended to ease financial conditions and thereby help to establish a self-sustaining economic expansion.\n\nAs I stated in my recent Economic Club speech, the benefits of our asset purchases—as reflected in improving financial conditions and the quickening pace of interest-sensitive spending such as that on consumer durable goods, housing, and capital goods—exceeds the costs.  Furthermore, the labor market outlook has yet to show substantial improvement.  Consequently, I see the current pace of asset purchases as appropriate.\n\nAt some point, I expect that I will see sufficient evidence of improved economic momentum to lead me to favor gradually dialing back the pace of asset purchases.  Of course, any subsequent bad news could lead me to favor dialing them back up again. As Chairman Bernanke said in his press conference following the March FOMC meeting \"when we see that the…situation has changed in a meaningful way, then we may well adjust the pace of purchases in order to keep the level of accommodation consistent with the outlook.\"\n\nConclusion\n\nLet me reiterate how pleased I am to be here on Staten Island and to have the opportunity to speak to the members of the Chamber.  Parts of Staten Island were among the most devastated areas in the region and we at the Federal Reserve Bank are committed to doing all that we can to help people and businesses recover. Many obstacles remain to be overcome but I am confident that Staten Island will meet the challenges that lay ahead."

        "content": "It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak to the Economic Club of New York again.1 Today, I will focus on the economic outlook and the role of monetary policy. I will argue that the fundamentals underpinning the U.S. economy are improving and monetary policy is gaining additional traction. But this may not immediately lead to stronger growth because of the recent increase in fiscal restraint. As a result, I expect that labor market conditions will improve only slowly and that inflation will remain muted. Consequently, it will be appropriate for monetary policy to remain very accommodative. As always, my views are my own and may not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nEconomic Outlook: Tug of War Between Improving Fundamentals and Fiscal Restraint\nThe U.S. economy remains on the slow growth track that has persisted since the recession ended in mid-2009. In fact, in 2012 real GDP grew just 1.6 percent, below the 2.2 percent rate of the preceding two years. This lackluster and disappointing performance masks the fact that the underlying conditions that support growth are gradually improving. However, in the near-term, this improvement in fundamentals is being offset by increased fiscal drag.\n\nLet's first examine the fundamentals, which have improved in at least six ways. First, household deleveraging is now well advanced. Household debt has declined significantly relative to income (Exhibit 1). In the same vein, the household financial obligations ratio has fallen to levels last seen in the early 1980s (Exhibit 2).2\n\nSecond, the structural adjustment in housing has largely run its course. Activity and prices are firming, supported by low interest rates. Over the past four quarters, housing starts rose by 33 percent, existing home sales climbed by 12 percent (Exhibit 3), and home prices, as measured by the CoreLogic national home price index, were up over 7 percent (Exhibit 4). Although the pace of recovery varies regionally, the U.S. housing sector as a whole is now clearly rebounding.\n\nI see the recovery in home prices as particularly important. Houses are a significant component of household wealth. In addition, as home prices begin to rise we are likely to see more transactions and more building activity. Moreover, rising house prices are likely to encourage a further loosening of credit and appraisal standards that remain unduly tight.\n\nThird, the international economic outlook has improved somewhat. Global financial market strains relating to concerns about the euro-area have receded since last summer, though recent developments in Cyprus highlight the challenges that remain. Chinese growth appears to be climbing after a slowdown in 2012 and Japan is making renewed efforts to grow faster and exit from a long period of deflation.\n\nFourth, U.S. corporate profits relative to national income are at an all-time record (Exhibit 5) and cash balances are very high. As uncertainty recedes and the outlook improves, I expect business will increasingly shift towards real investment from mainly buying back shares and hoarding cash.\n\nFifth, the U.S. is in the middle of an energy revolution marked by a steady rise in oil and natural gas production (Exhibit 6). Just as significant, the sharp fall in natural gas prices in the U.S. has created a huge impetus to investment in energy-intensive manufacturing, such as in petrochemicals. Because the lead times on such investment are long, this impulse will likely persist for many years.\n\nSixth, financial conditions have become increasingly accommodative, as monetary easing has passed through to a broad range of financial asset prices. Credit spreads have narrowed and the U.S. equity market has risen sharply (Exhibit 7). The price and availability of some types of consumer loans, notably auto loans, has also improved.\n\nSo why isn't the U.S. economy growing more quickly? The fact that fiscal policy has turned significantly more restrictive is the most important reason. The impulse from state and local governments that subtracted from growth earlier in the recovery has gone from negative to close to neutral. But this has been overwhelmed by the sharp shift in federal fiscal policy from mild restraint in 2012 to much greater restraint in 2013 (Exhibit 8). The increase in payroll tax rates, the rise in high income tax rates, the increase in taxes associated with the Affordable Care Act, and now the sequester—if sustained—will result in fiscal drag of about 1 3/4 percentage points of GDP in 2013.3\n\nI view this as an unfortunate outcome. While the U.S. must put its public finances on a sustainable footing, this should be done in a manner that best achieves both our near-term and long-term objectives. In my opinion, a U.S. fiscal policy well-suited for the current set of circumstances would start with a very mild degree of restraint in the near-term that would credibly build to substantial consolidation over the next several decades. Of course, it is for Congress to judge what combination of tax increases and spending cuts should be undertaken to achieve this. Nevertheless, the aging of our population and simple math suggest that entitlement reform would need to be part of such a plan. Also, in an ideal world, fiscal policy would have broad-based bipartisan support. That would reduce uncertainty and reassure households and businesses that the U.S. was on a sustainable long-term path.\n\nInstead, we have nearly the opposite: significant retrenchment in the near-term, but no credible action over the long-term, with partisan divisions and significant uncertainty about what will happen next. Will the sequester, for example, be sustained or not?\n\nEconomic Outlook\nLooking at the outlook for 2013, I believe that growth in the first half will be sluggish as the fiscal contraction blunts the economy's forward advance. While first quarter GDP growth will likely rebound to a 2 to 3 percent annualized rate following the dip in the fourth quarter, this will be due in large part to temporary factors.4\n\nI'd also emphasize that there remains considerable uncertainty about the outlook. In particular, we can't be confident about how much fiscal drag will blunt growth. Ultimately, though, the drag should abate. When that happens—presumably later this year, the economy should strengthen.\n\nInflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditure deflator, is currently below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent objective (Exhibit 9). Substantial slack remains in labor and product markets, and underlying measures of inflation are subdued. With weak labor compensation growth, the trend growth of unit labor costs is less than 1 percent annualized, which is well below price inflation. Moreover, inflation expectations remain well anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent longer-run objective. Thus, I conclude that the risk that inflation could significantly exceed our 2 percent objective is quite low over the next few years, even if the recovery were to strengthen considerably.\n\nU.S. Monetary Policy Initiatives\nBeginning in September, the FOMC made a number of important changes to monetary policy in order to promote a stronger recovery in the context of price stability. First, the FOMC began purchasing an additional $40 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) each month.5 Second, the FOMC stated, for the first time, that it would continue buying assets and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until there was a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook6. Third, the FOMC stated its intention to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for a considerable time after the recovery strengthens.\n\nTwo additional initiatives followed in December. First, consistent with the September statement, the FOMC began a new purchase program of $45 billion long-dated Treasuries per month. Second, the FOMC shifted to economic thresholds from calendar-based rate guidance.\n\nThe FOMC committed to keep the federal funds rate at its current level of zero to 25 basis points at least as long as unemployment remains above 6.5 percent, projected inflation on a one to two year horizon is below 2.5 percent and inflation expectations stay well anchored. Both elements of the policy stance were reaffirmed at last week's FOMC meeting.\n\nSo why did we make these changes? The additional asset purchases provide further monetary stimulus. This is appropriate given that we were falling short of our objectives.7\n\nMoving to an outcome-based purchase program also has other advantages. In particular, expectations of the ultimate amount of purchases should change as the economic outlook evolves. This acts as an automatic stabilizing mechanism. In particular, the FOMC's statement that purchases will continue until the labor market outlook improves substantially provides additional support for the recovery by reducing downside tail risk.\n\nThe shift to rate guidance based on economic thresholds was not intended to provide additional accommodation at the time it was implemented.8 But, the adoption of thresholds does support the recovery by changing the risk profile in a different way. The thresholds make it clear that short-term rates will not be raised at the first sign of economic improvement, before a sustainable recovery has been secured. As a result, households and businesses should be more confident in undertaking additional spending and investment today.\n\nThe shift to thresholds-based rate guidance has other benefits. Relative to calendar-based guidance, it provides more information about the economic conditions the Fed would need to see before raising rates.9 Importantly, the shift to thresholds should also make the eventual normalization of monetary policy smoother, a subject I will return to later.\n\nBut this raises an obvious question. If quantitative thresholds are good for interest rate guidance, why not also have such thresholds for the asset purchase program? There are two reasons. There is somewhat more uncertainty about the efficacy and costs associated with asset purchases than rate guidance and we are likely to learn more about the efficacy and costs as the program unfolds.\n\nSo what is this likely to mean in practice? In my view, we should calibrate the total amount of purchases to that needed to deliver a substantial improvement in labor market conditions, by allowing the flow rate of purchases to respond to material changes in the labor market outlook. This makes sense because the benefits10 of additional accommodation will gradually diminish as we get closer to our full employment and price stability objectives and become more confident that we will reach them in a timely manner.11 At some point, I expect that I will see sufficient evidence of economic momentum to cause me to favor gradually dialing back the pace of asset purchases. 12\n\nOf course, any subsequent bad news could lead me to favor dialing them back up again. As the Chairman Bernanke said in his press conference last Wednesday \"when we see that the…situation has changed in a meaningful way, then we may well adjust the pace of purchases in order to keep the level of accommodation consistent with the outlook.\"\n\nThe Labor Market Outlook\nSo how are we doing relative to our objective of a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook?\n\nSince we provided additional stimulus in September there has been some improvement in labor market conditions. The unemployment rate is modestly lower and private non-farm payroll growth a bit higher than earlier in 2012, which is certainly welcome. However, other important indicators including the employment-to-population ratio and job-finding rates are essentially unchanged (Exhibit 10). This suggests that the labor market is far from healthy.\n\nMoreover, our policy is based on the outlook for the labor market, not the level of employment or unemployment today. In this context I note that the recent improvement in payroll employment growth, which gets much of the attention, is out-sized relative to the growth rate of economic activity that supports it. We have seen this movie before. When this happened in 2011 and 2012, employment growth subsequently slowed (see Exhibit 11). Because growth this year will be constrained by fiscal consolidation, there is a risk that this could happen again. As a result, it is premature to conclude that we will soon see a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook.\n\nEfficacy of The Asset Purchase Program Exceeds The Costs\nOur asset purchases are also conditional on our ongoing evaluation that the efficacy of the program exceeds the costs. That clearly has been the case to date—affirmed by our policy decisions. Since we put the outcome-based approach in place in September, my assessment is that efficacy has been as high or higher than I expected at the onset of the program, and costs the same or lower.\n\nEfficacy has two components: the effect of the purchases on financial conditions and the effect of financial conditions on the economy. Our latest purchase program has been associated with a substantial easing in financial conditions, higher equity prices, and narrower credit spreads. The resumption of additional agency MBS purchases in September pushed down MBS yields. With some lag, much of the drop in yields has been passed through to primary mortgage rates.\n\nMeanwhile, the impact of the improvement in financial conditions on the real economy has been somewhat stronger than I had expected. Since September we have seen considerable strength in the interest-sensitive sectors of the economy, including housing, autos and durable goods, in spite of the uncertainty and drag from fiscal policy. Improvement in these sectors suggests that monetary policy may be gaining additional traction. This is important because it suggests that the benefit from a given amount of asset purchases has increased.\n\nOn the cost side, I conclude that costs specific to balance sheet expansion have turned out to be no greater than I had anticipated and, because we have less uncertainty about those costs, they are lower than I would have expected in a risk-adjusted sense. Let me start with three commonly cited potential costs—impairment of market functioning, the unanchoring of inflation expectations, and threats to financial stability.\n\nWe carefully monitor financial markets for signs that market functioning has been impaired, looking at metrics such as trading volumes, bid-offer spreads, failures to deliver securities and our own ability to execute transactions. On some of these metrics, market functioning has actually improved in recent months. Of course, we will need to continue to monitor this, particularly if a rise in interest rates leads to less MBS issuance. But so far, so good.\n\nIn terms of inflation expectations, a wide range of measures remain well anchored. For example, the 5-year, 5-year forward measure of inflation expectations calculated from Treasury TIPs versus nominal yields is well within the historical range of recent years (Exhibit 12).\n\nIn contrast, assessing the potential costs in terms of financial stability is more difficult. Indeed, it is not clear to me which way the sign goes. Do asset purchases increase or reduce financial stability risks?\n\nOn the one hand, information received since September suggests there is slightly greater reason for concern about potential excesses in certain corners of the financial markets. In particular, some areas of fixed income—notably high-yield bonds and leveraged loans—do seem somewhat frothy. However, I view the expected cost to society from bad outcomes here as relatively low. The broad and rapid credit creation associated with the most dangerous types of asset bubbles has been absent (Exhibit 13). The size of the asset classes in question is relatively modest and most of the investors in these assets are not highly leveraged. So if asset valuations were to adjust sharply and some investors experienced painful losses, I do not expect that such a shock would threaten financial stability.\n\nNevertheless, we will need to keep a close eye on financial asset prices. As I noted in my first speech to the Economic Club of New York 3 years ago:\n\"Despite the fact that it is hard to discern bubbles, especially in their early stages, I conclude that uncertainty is not grounds for inaction. Instead, the decision whether to act depends on whether appropriate tools can be deployed to limit the size of a bubble and whether the benefits of acting and deploying such tools are likely to exceed the costs.\"13\n\nOn the other hand, there is a financial stability case for doing more purchases in the current context. To the extent that risky behaviors and incipient asset price bubbles are fueled by an expectation that interest rates will be \"low for long,\" asset purchases that strengthen the economic recovery and bring forward the date of liftoff should promote financial stability. Also, to the extent that asset purchases increase the likelihood of a sustainable recovery, this reduces the financial stability risks associated with a Japanese-style outcome of chronic deflation.\n\nAlthough the costs specific to the asset purchase program appear well-contained, it is also true that the costs increase as the program gets larger. In part, this is due to fact that as the balance sheet increases in size, the risk of a period of low or zero remittances to Treasury also increases. As we acquire more longer-dated assets funded with reserves, the Fed takes on more interest rate risk. This is how the policy works. A byproduct is that our net income and remittances will be unusually elevated for a while, then are likely to fall substantially for a period, before returning to more normal levels. This is because our interest expense will increase substantially when we begin normalizing rates. Also, if we were to sell assets in a rising rate environment, we could also experience some capital losses on these sales. In combination, depending on the future trajectory of short and long rates, remittances could even fall to zero for a period.14\n\nThere are several important points to make here. First, the potential impact of the purchase program on future Fed remittances was known at the onset of the program—we have no new information here. The outcome depends on how the economy evolves, how we respond, and whether we decide to sell long-dated assets in the portfolio or not.\n\nSecond, it is important not to put excessive weight on the possibility of a period of zero remittances. Our mandate is economic not fiscal—our job is to return the economy to full employment and price stability. Moreover, in considering the fiscal consequences of our actions, what matters is not what happens to our remittances—that is far too narrow a perspective — but how our actions affect the federal debt-to-GDP ratio over time. This is the metric we should be focusing on in assessing the potential fiscal consequences of our actions.\n\nIn this respect, it is important to note that the narrow impact of Fed remittances on the federal debt-to-GDP ratio depends on the cumulative amount, not the timing of remittances. Cumulative remittances to date have been hundreds of billions of dollars higher, all else equal, compared to if the Federal Reserve had not expanded its balance sheet. And, according to Congressional Budget Office projections, even if remittances drop sharply in future years, cumulative remittances would still likely be higher compared to the counterfactual regime in which the Fed had not expanded its balance sheet (Exhibit 14). In addition, because Fed purchases put downward pressure on long-term interest rates, this generates interest savings for the Treasury, and this benefit should be included in the fiscal cost calculations.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, to the extent that asset purchases are effective in pushing the trajectory of economic growth above what would otherwise have been the case, this will lead to higher federal government tax revenue and lower safety net spending outlays during the recovery period. This means that across a broad range of scenarios, our large-scale asset purchase program is likely to result in a lower federal debt-to-GDP ratio.\n\nTo sum up, the better choice is for the Fed to pursue the policy that best achieves its mandated objectives and puts the U.S. government in a better fiscal position. This dominates a policy of fewer purchases simply so we can avoid potentially having to explain why our remittances may have fallen to zero for a short period.\n\nIssues Associated with the Normalization of Monetary Policy\nFinally, I'd like to talk about some of the other issues associated with the normalization of monetary policy. In general, I think it is premature to spend much time focusing on exit when we have not yet secured a sustainable economic recovery. That's putting the cart before the horse in my opinion. That said, we nevertheless do need to understand the issues surrounding exit so that we can design the best monetary policy regime to achieve our objectives.\n\nOn this topic, let me ease three concerns I hear frequently expressed. The first is that the large amount of excess reserves in the banking system will be \"dry tinder\" and fuel a rise in inflation. As I have mentioned repeatedly, the ability of the Federal Reserve to pay interest on excess reserves ensures that we can control the credit creation process and prevent an upsurge in inflation.\n\nThe second is that when the Fed ultimately raises the rate it pays on excess reserves, it will be providing a subsidy to the banks. IOER is not a subsidy to the banks.15 In attracting deposits or other liabilities, competition among banks16 will ensure that higher interest payments to banks on their reserves will be passed through to bank liability holders.\n\nI look forward to the day when the economy is strong enough for us to raise the interest rate on excess reserves. When that happens, deposit rates will also rise. That will be important because ultra-low rates have been a burden for many seniors and others heavily reliant on this kind of income. When we raise the IOER, it will be my mother and my mother-in-law and others like them, not bankers, who will mainly benefit.\n\nThe third concern is the notion that the Federal Reserve will be slow to tighten monetary policy because this will reduce the amount of our remittances to the Treasury. This does not add up. The Fed is a central bank, not an asset management company—our commitment is to our dual mandate economic objectives—not maximizing net income or remittances. Moreover, even if we were to put any weight on this consideration, the incentives go the other way—our enlarged balance sheet creates an additional reason to tighten monetary policy in a timely way. If the Fed were to delay in raising short-term rates to protect its current earnings, inflation would rise and this would push long-term rates higher. This would just necessitate a bigger rise in short-term interest rates and a greater loss of earnings later.\n\nA much more important issue with respect to policy normalization is moderating the risk of a sharp snapback in longer-term yields. But this has less to do with the size of the balance sheet specifically than the challenge of normalizing the current stance of monetary policy in all its dimensions. There is always a risk that market participants will foreshorten the Fed's actions. Market participants could collapse an extended sequence of steps back to the date of the first move towards normalization resulting in an abrupt tightening of financial conditions.\n\nThe move to economic thresholds-based guidance for the fed funds rate should help in this regard. While the thresholds are certainly not triggers, they should help market participants adjust expectations about the likely timing of liftoff in a relatively continuous manner and guard against these expectations being pulled further forward in time than is warranted by changes in the economic outlook.\n\nNevertheless, we will need to communicate our broader intentions very clearly. Even when purchases cease, the enlarged balance sheet will provide substantial ongoing stimulus. It is important to recognize that the Fed could remain in this posture with policy \"on hold\" for a significant period. As the threshold framework should make clear, there is no fixed time-frame between completing purchases and raising short term rates.\n\nLong-term yields rose sharply in 1994 and 2004 when economic recoveries got underway in earnest after sustained periods of unusually low short-term rates. Compared to those episodes, the risk of a spike in long-dated yields this time around may be somewhat lower for two reasons. First, this risk is receiving much attention. Big market moves are typically associated with surprises. For the market to reprice suddenly, I presume there would need to be some new information that led investors to significantly revise their view of the outlook or the Fed's reaction function.\n\nSecond, the Fed's expansion of its own balance sheet may be a stabilizing influence. For example, the rise in interest rates during the prior episodes was amplified by convexity-related hedging generated by the lengthening of expected mortgage duration. This should be a less powerful force this time around because the Fed holds a substantial portion of the agency MBS market.\n\nHowever, we should keep up our guard. The regulatory community must continue to take steps to mitigate the vulnerability of the economy to a sharp rise in long-term rates. This includes monitoring banks' exposure to duration risk and the quality of their risk management and capital planning, while also looking outside of the banking system because some risks may reside elsewhere. In this regard, agency mortgage REITs and the risk of large outflows from bond mutual funds are issues that deserve ongoing attention.\n\nConclusion\nThe FOMC is committed to the dual objectives of maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability. Currently we are falling well short of our employment objective and the restrictive stance of federal fiscal policy is a factor. On inflation, we are also falling short, but by a considerably smaller margin. As a consequence, we need to keep monetary policy very accommodative.\n\nI do not claim that there are no costs or risks associated with our unconventional monetary policy regime. But I see greater cost and risk in moving prematurely to a policy setting that might not prove sufficiently accommodative to ensure a sustainable, strengthening recovery. I remain confident that the benefits of a stronger and earlier economic recovery will trump the costs associated with our unconventional monetary policy measures.\n\nThanks for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n___________________________________________________\n1 Krishna Guha, Simon Potter, Jamie McAndrews, Lorie Logan, Kevin Stiroh, Paolo Pesenti, Richard Peach, Jonathan McCarthy and others on my staff helped with the preparation of these remarks.\n\n2 The household obligation ratio is the sum of payments on mortgage and nonmortgage debt, automobile lease payments, rental payments on tenant-occupied property, homeowners' insurance, and property tax payments divided by disposable after-tax income.\n\n3 Before taking into account fiscal multipliers.\n\n4 This includes a modest boost from inventory investment following the substantial drag of the prior quarter, a recovery in farm output following last year's drought, and less drag from defense outlays following the steep plunge of the fourth quarter.

In my view, the benefit of additional accommodation would diminish as we get closer to our dual mandate objectives and become more confident in the forecast of a strengthening recovery, even if the assessment of the efficacy and cost of the tool were unchanged.\n\n11 Of course, this expectation assumes no new information on efficacy and costs emerges that fundamentally changes my assessment of the merits of the program.\n\n12 Assuming that the improvement in the outlook is not endogenous to the chosen policy setting to the extent that it would disappear if purchases were slowed.\n\n13 Asset Bubbles and the Implications for Central Bank Policy, Economic Club of New York, April 7, 2010.\n\n14 If the Fed's net income fell below zero in a year it would record a deferred asset that it would redeem with future net income.

In either of these responses, banks experience a cost of managing their reserves.\n\n16 Among many other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act allowed banks to pay interest on corporate deposits, and those depositors, because they deposit large amounts, are likely more interest-sensitive, than individual depositors. Furthermore, the wholesale money market is intensely competitive, and, as evidence that reserves are distributed across banks in a way that reflects competitive considerations, note that currently, reserves are held in disproportionately large amounts by Foreign Banking Organizations. The reason I think this happens is that those FBOs do not have to pay the FDIC assessment fee on their liabilities (as they hold no U.S. deposits). That suggests that all banks face competition in attracting liabilities to match their reserve holdings, and that the FBOs, because they face a lower cost in doing so, have managed to attract those deposits at a faster clip than domestic banks. This is the sort of competition that I expect to see that will result in the interest on reserves being passed through by banks to their customers and to the broader economy.\n\nFor clarification, exhibits 8 and 14 have been revised to indicate that the charts show fiscal years."

        "content": "Thank you for having me here to speak today.  As you all know from daily experience, the financial system plays an essential role in modern economies.  Because financial intermediation is critical to economic activity, disruption to it can cause severe damage to the economy.  The experience of recent years revealed serious flaws in the system.  Risk was mispriced and there was a build-up of excesses before the crisis.  Structural weaknesses in the financial system then amplified the effect of the bursting of the bubble in U.S. house prices, and the result was a widespread financial crisis.\n\nOne critical factor was the extensive use of short-term wholesale funding in the years leading up to the crisis.  Not only did this aspect of our financial system create the potential for a firm to fail in an extraordinarily rapid manner when faced with a loss of market confidence, but it also served as a channel through which the effects of those failures were widely propagated throughout the broader financial system. \n\nAlthough much has been done over the past few years to mitigate the structural flaws that make wholesale funding a point of weakness in the global financial system, some important issues and vulnerabilities remain.  I will focus my remarks today on some of those vulnerabilities—including the areas of tri-party repo and money market mutual funds markets—and discuss what could be done to make wholesale funding markets more stable.1\n\nI will also consider the larger issue of the appropriate role of wholesale funding in the financial system.  How comfortable should we be with a system in which critical financial activities continue to be financed with short-term wholesale funding without the safeguards necessary to reduce the risk of runs and the fire sales of assets that can threaten the stability of the entire financial system?\n\nAs always, my remarks reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System. \n\nWholesale funding as a structural vulnerability\nAs this audience knows, in the two decades before the financial crisis, the global financial system underwent rapid transformation.  During this period, there was a shift from bank-based financial intermediation to capital markets-based financial intermediation,2 and an increase in the scale and complexity of securitization activities.\n\nIn the pre-crisis period the growth of securitization was accompanied by a growing reliance on short-term funds raised in wholesale markets to finance securities and activities essential to securitization.  This ranged from the use of repo3 funding to finance inventories of securities held for market-making4 purposes to the issuance of asset-backed commercial paper by conduits5 created to acquire and hold securities.\n\nThe increased use of short-term wholesale finance was driven both by demand and supply factors.  On the demand side, it was more profitable to use shorter-term funds to finance longer-term assets.  On the supply side, such funding was plentiful because it was viewed as safe and because of the growing institutionalization of savings with corporations and institutional investors in need of deposit-like products in which to place their cash balances.   After all, the funds were only exposed for a short period of time, and in the case of repo, secured by collateral.\n\nThe growing reliance on short-term wholesale funding to finance longer-term assets increased liquidity and maturity mismatch risk.  This was particularly dangerous because many of the assets being financed were structured-credit products, some of which were opaque, difficult to value and illiquid.  \n\nShort-term funding of longer-term assets is inherently unstable particularly in the presence of information and coordination problems.  It can be rational for a provider of funds to supply funds on a short-term basis, reasoning that it can exit if there is any uncertainty over the firm’s continued ability to roll over its funding from other sources. But if the use of short-term funding becomes sufficiently widespread, the firm’s roll-over risk increases.  In this situation, there is a strong incentive for each lender to “run” if there is any uncertainty that could undermine the borrower’s ability to continue to roll over its funding from other sources.  This is the case even if the provider of funds believes that the borrower would remain solvent as long as it retained access to funding on normal terms. \n\nOf course, this insight is not a new one.  Prior to the establishment of a lender of last resort and retail deposit insurance for banks—which came with the quid pro quo of prudential regulation—bank runs were a regular and disruptive feature of our financial system.  These innovations solved the coordination problem and stabilized this source of funding.\n\nWhat was new prior to the crisis was the extent to which maturity transformation and financial intermediation began to take place outside of commercial banks.  This activity occurred largely without the types of safeguards—robust prudential regulation, deposit insurance, lender of last resort—that have safeguarded the commercial banking system from the types of widespread panics and runs that are capable of destabilizing the entire financial system.  The risk created by this gap in coverage was not well recognized by regulators or the private sector.  Market participants had little incentive to internalize the negative externality of run-risk created by their collective choice of finance and made erroneous assumptions about the liquidity of asset markets and the capacity and willingness of banks to distribute central bank liquidity to the wider financial system during periods of stress. \n\nBecause the boom years resulted in strong earnings, low price volatility and few credit losses, firms were able to operate at extreme levels of leverage.  When the housing bubble started to deflate, the vulnerabilities of this type of business model soon became apparent.\n\nHeavy reliance on short-term wholesale funding exposed the system to a series of intertwined downward spirals in asset and funding markets.  This spread in waves, beginning in the market for asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) issued by off-balance-sheet conduits, and spreading via auction-rate securities, to the repo, money market and financial commercial paper markets that formed the core financing for market-based financial intermediation.\n\nInitial declines in asset prices forced leveraged holders with maturity mismatches to sell assets.  This increased price volatility and reduced the value of the assets that collateralized other firms’ borrowings.  Higher volatility led banks and secured lenders to raise margins, while concern about counterparty risk and their own funding needs made banks reluctant to on-lend liquidity. \n\nHigher margins on repo and increased collateral calls due to credit ratings downgrades reduced the quantity of assets that could be financed in repo markets and elsewhere, prompting further asset sales.6  As wholesale investors started to exit, this set in motion a bad dynamic—a fire sale of assets that cut into earnings and capital.  This just increased the incentives of investors to run and for banks to hoard liquidity against the risk that they could themselves face a run.  This downward spiral of fire sales and funding runs was a key feature of the financial crisis.\n\nSpecific institutional weaknesses\nThe fragility of short-term wholesale funding was greatly aggravated by certain critical institutional shortcomings in these markets, particularly in the structure of the tri-party repo system and the U.S. money market mutual fund business.   \n\nThrough the tri-party repo market, the two large clearing banks were providing a large amount of intraday credit to securities firms each day to facilitate the daily “unwind” of the prior day’s transactions.7 In the run-up to the crisis, the daily “unwind” practice helped make tri-party repo look like a very liquid investment while still being an apparently highly durable source of funding.  This masked the underlying risks and contributed to weak risk management practices.\n\nAs the concerns about the U.S. housing market escalated in 2007, participants in the tri-party repo market became increasingly concerned about the liquidity and credit risks that they faced.  The clearing banks became uncomfortable with their large intraday exposures to their tri-party securities firm customers.  After all, if a securities firm were to fail suddenly, the clearing banks could be stuck with huge loans to these counterparties, secured by securities that were not necessarily high quality and liquid.   Thus, as the condition of the most troubled securities firms deteriorated, there was a risk that one morning a clearing bank might decide not to unwind a firm’s tri-party transactions in order to avoid a large intraday exposure.  \n\nThis risk faced by the clearing banks, in turn, unnerved the tri-party repo investors.  After all, if the unwind did not occur, they would be stuck with the collateral securing their loans from the night before.  Most of these investors were not prepared to take possession of and liquidate such collateral, and had no interest in doing so.  The incentives for these investors were to run at the first sign of trouble to avoid getting stuck with the dealer’s collateral. \n\nThis incentive to run was reinforced by the fact that if the investors were stuck with the collateral, they would have strong incentives to sell it quickly in order to generate the liquidity needed to meet redemption calls or to keep their portfolios in line with regulatory guidelines.  Such “fire sales” of assets could result in losses and could be extremely destabilizing to markets.\n\nThe crisis also made it clear that the monies provided to the money market mutual funds by their own investors were also inherently unstable.  This made such funds, in turn, an unreliable source of finance in repo, commercial paper and other markets.  Investors in a fixed net asset value (NAV) money market fund could take their money out on a daily basis at par value, with no redemption penalty.   This could occur even if the money market fund did not have sufficient cash or liquid assets that it could easily sell to meet all potential redemptions.  This created an incentive for investors to be the first to get out whenever there was any uncertainty over the underlying value of the assets in the fund.  By being first in line, they could exit while the fund could still repay at par, leaving others to bear any losses.  The longer the investor waited, the greater the risk that the fund would be forced into the fire sale of assets to meet redemptions and end up “breaking the buck.”\n\nAs the crisis unfolded, the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury and others took a series of actions to contain the spiral of funding runs and asset fire sales.  First, the traditional lender of last resort function was strengthened through the introduction of the Term Auction Facility (TAF) and foreign exchange swaps with foreign central banks.\n\nThen, as the crisis intensified, lender of last resort liquidity provision was extended to directly backstop key wholesale funding markets and opened to certain nonbank firms.  The Federal Reserve created a direct backstop to the tri-party repo system through the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF).  When the Reserve Fund broke the buck after the failure of Lehman Brothers, precipitating a run on money market mutual funds, the Treasury guaranteed money market fund assets and the Fed introduced the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Fund Liquidation Facility (AMLF).  The Fed also backstopped the commercial paper market (formerly funded in large part by money market mutual funds) by introducing the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF).  When wholesale funding for non-residential mortgage securitizations evaporated, the Fed rolled out the Term Asset-Backed Lending Facility (TALF).  \n\nThese actions ultimately stabilized funding markets and crowded back in private funds.  But, they were an emergency response, not a sustainable, long-term solution.  After all, because most of the special Fed liquidity facilities were authorized under Section 13.3 of the Federal Reserve Act  they were required to be temporary in nature and end when times were no longer “unusual and exigent.”\n\nStatus of reforms\nSince the crisis, a number of steps have been taken that reduce the vulnerability of the system to funding runs in short-term wholesale markets.  Capital and liquidity requirements for large complex financial institutions have been raised sharply, the largest broker-dealers have become part of bank holding companies subject to additional regulation, and risk-weights on assets have been adjusted to better capture risks and to reduce the scope for regulatory capital arbitrage by banks.\n\nHigher capital levels for bank holding companies reduce the incentive for providers of funds to run from these firms at the first sign of trouble.  Higher liquidity buffers8 also help so that banks do not have to sell illiquid assets at the first signs of funding difficulties.  This reduces the fire sale risk: that the sale of illiquid assets will depress asset values, potentially turning a solvent firm into an insolvent one. \n\nMeanwhile, the New York Fed has led a Federal Reserve effort to make the tri-party repo system more resilient to stress.  In particular, the Fed has pressed the two large clearing banks to make changes to their settlement processes that will diminish their own intraday exposure and enable the market to operate with much less reliance on intraday credit.9 These efforts are starting to bear fruit: the share of trading activity that requires intraday credit extensions by clearing banks has declined from 100 percent before November 2012 to approximately 80 percent currently, and is expected to fall to 10 percent by the end of next year.10\n\nReducing the market’s dependency on intraday credit will make the market more resilient to future stress events, by forcing all participants to consider the credit and liquidity risks they are exposed to.\n\nMeanwhile, in 2010, the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) tightened the liquidity requirements and concentration limit rules for 2a-7 money market mutual funds and increased the fund manager disclosure requirements.  These changes, which were intended as a first step, make money funds somewhat less risky.  But, they do little to reduce investors’ incentives to run at the first sign of trouble. \n\nWorthwhile as the steps taken thus far are, we have not come close to fixing all the institutional flaws in our wholesale funding markets.  The tri-party repo system and the money fund industry that plays a crucial role financing collateral through it are both still exposed to runs.  In fact, in each of these areas, one could argue that the risks have increased compared to prior to the crisis.  That is because the Dodd-Frank Act raised the hurdle for the Federal Reserve to exercise its Section 13.3 emergency lending authority and because Congress has explicitly precluded the U.S. Treasury from guaranteeing money market mutual fund assets in the future.   With extraordinary interventions ruled out or made much more difficult, this may cause investors to be even more skittish in the future.  This is why it is essential to make the system more stable.\n\nTurning first to the issue of tri-party repo reform, there is still considerable work to do.  In particular, the risk that investors will run at the first sign of trouble persists.  That is because the costs of running are very low relative to the potential costs of staying put.  The potential costs of staying are elevated in part because investors often don’t have the capacity to take possession of the collateral or liquidate the collateral in an orderly way should a large dealer fail.  Both aspects result in run risk, fire sale risk and potential financial instability.\n\nLet me be clear.  We must deal with the fire sale issue in tri-party repo and the heightened run risk it creates.  I believe there are three potential ways forward, all of which are superior to the status quo.   First, tri-party repo transactions could be restricted to open market operations (OMO) eligible collateral.11 Such collateral would likely remain quite liquid during a time of crisis.12 In addition, such collateral could, in a crisis, potentially be passed directly by a broker-dealer to the discount window under Section 13.13 authority, or, because of beneficial treatment under Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act, be financed by a banking affiliate that would then itself borrow at the discount window.  Thus, one could construct an effective lender of last resort backstop for an OMO-eligible- only tri-party repo system. \n\nHowever, there are also some significant disadvantages to such an approach.  The less liquid collateral could just migrate to be financed elsewhere, with associated run and fire sale risks.  Also, given that housing finance reform could cause the agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to be replaced by something different that was not OMO eligible under the Federal Reserve Act, the share of assets that are OMO eligible could diminish over time.  Finally, this approach would do little to mitigate the risk of fire sales of a defaulted dealer’s collateral by its investors once a dealer is bankrupt.\n\nThe second option is to have a mechanism or process to facilitate the orderly liquidation of a defaulted dealer’s collateral.  One could imagine a mechanism that was funded by tri-party repo market participants and potentially backstopped by the central bank.  This would have the advantage of dealing with the entire tri-party repo market and not artificially favoring one type of collateral over another.  It would also push against the underpricing of liquidity and credit risk during good times by forcing market participants to pay for the costs of a liquidation facility up front. \n\nBecause no single market participant has a strong incentive to develop such a mechanism, however, sustained regulatory pressure may be required to reach such a solution.  From the perspective of the tri-party repo borrowers and investors, the status quo undoubtedly is viewed as superior because neither group is forced to fully bear the externalities associated with their actions.  Instead they anticipate that emergency liquidity would be made available in the event of a future systemic crisis.\n \nThird, if borrowers and investors did not embrace an orderly collateral liquidation mechanism, supervisory oversight could be brought to bear to limit the use of tri-party repo funding on the grounds that it is still an unstable source of funds.  For example, the use of tri-party repo could be restricted unless borrowers demonstrated that there was an adequate means of orderly collateral liquidation upon the failure of a major dealer.\n\nTurning next to the issue of money market mutual funds, further reform to directly address the incentive for investors to run is essential for financial stability.\n\nIn November, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) put out for comment three alternative paths forward:13\n\n1. Moving to a floating net asset value (NAV).\n2. Retaining a stable NAV, but adding a new NAV buffer and a minimum balance requirement.  The minimum balance would be at risk for 30 days following withdrawals.  If the fund subsequently “broke the buck” during this period by suffering losses greater than the size of its NAV buffer, the minimum balance would be first in line to absorb these losses.\n3. A larger NAV buffer than in the second alternative, but without a minimum balance at risk buffer.\n\nI have stated my views on money fund reform before.14 Although any of these proposals—depending on the fine print of course—would likely be an improvement over the status quo, the first and third proposals don’t fully eliminate the incentives to run.  In the case of a floating rate NAV, fund managers faced with large redemption requests typically sell their most liquid assets first, leaving the remaining investors with a riskier, less-liquid portfolio and a greater risk of loss. Similarly, with a stable NAV and a capital buffer, unless the capital buffer were very large, there would still be an incentive to run because the buffer might not prove large enough to shield the investor from loss.\n\nBecause the second option is the only one that actually creates a disincentive to run, as I stated before the FSOC proposal, I view it as the best one for financial stability purposes.  The requirement that investors who withdraw funds must maintain a small balance for a short period to absorb near-term losses would deter investors from pulling out at the first glimpse of trouble and make the system safer.  The modest withdrawal restrictions, which create a “minimum balance at risk,” might be set at 5 cents on the dollar, based on the high-water mark of recent holdings, with more favorable treatment for small retail investors.15 \n\nA minimum balance at risk of loss would also increase market discipline. Corporations and other sophisticated investors would have an incentive to monitor risk-taking more carefully, rather than rely on their ability to get out ahead of small retail investors when trouble materializes.\n\nThe larger question\nReforming the tri-party repo system and the money market mutual fund industry is essential and would make the financial system significantly more stable. But even after such reforms, we would still have a system in which a very significant share of financial intermediation activity vital to the economy takes place in markets and through institutions that have no direct access to an effective lender of last resort backstop.16\n\nThe financial crisis clearly demonstrated that we can no longer assume that in periods of stress banks will be willing to access lender of last resort loans and on-lend to the nonbank financial sector at sufficient scale to stabilize the system of market-based financial intermediation, as happened in earlier periods such as the commercial paper crisis in the mid-1970s.\n\nThe financing needs outside the commercial banks may be too large relative to the capacity of the banking system, banks may be reluctant to lend to competitors, be concerned about their own liquidity and funding needs, or simply be deterred by elevated counterparty risk.  \n  \nWe need to consider whether our current architecture is satisfactory.   If we were to decide that the existing state of affairs is not acceptable in financial stability terms, there are two broad paths we could follow.   \n\nThe first option would be to take steps to curtail the extent of short-term wholesale finance in the system.  In principle, regulators across a broader set of institutions and markets could take steps to directly limit the use of short-term wholesale funding to finance longer-term assets, and take actions that reduced the amount of maturity transformation associated with securitization markets.  In other words, regulators could require that a greater proportion of market-based finance be funded by longer-term debt.  Alternatively, additional legislation or regulatory changes could be implemented to reduce the volume of wholesale-funded, capital markets activities.\n\nIt is also true that some of the measures under debate in the area of limiting the scope of activity or the scale of certain financial institutions, three of which were explored by  my colleague Federal Reserve Governor Dan Tarullo in a recent speech, would likely have the effect of reducing the use of short-term wholesale funding relative to the current status quo.17  For example, if regulators were to cap the size of a bank’s overall liabilities relative to gross domestic product (GDP) not only would this have the effect  of capping the size of individual firms, but it also would likely limit the use of short-term wholesale funding by the largest institutions. \n\nThe other path would be to expand the range of financial intermediation activity that is directly backstopped by the central bank’s lender of last resort function. This expanded range could be defined either in terms of access by the types of firms that are systemically important in market-based finance, or by types of activity or assets.\n\nIt is worth pausing here to review in a little more detail the two key functions performed by a lender of last resort.  The first function is to provide a precautionary backstop:  to reduce the risk of a financial panic beginning in the first place by ensuring that collateral can always be financed.18 The first function is important because it makes it less likely that investors will back away from firms because they think others perceive an elevated risk of insolvency, even if they themselves do not share this view. Thus, a lender of last resort facility can reduce the risk of financial instability due to coordination problems even if the lender of last resort is not utilized.19 In contrast, an emergency facility is unlikely to be as effective.  There will be uncertainty around whether it will be deployed, whether it will arrive in time, and how broad it will be.     \n\nThe second function of a lender of last resort is to prevent the fire sale of assets by firms facing a sudden loss of funding from spreading contagion across the system and disrupting the provision of credit to the economy.  This is particularly important during a financial panic, when the demand for liquidity increases sharply.  Only the central bank has the ability to meet this increased demand under any potential circumstances.\n\nWe have banking activity—maturity transformation—taking place today outside commercial banks.   If we believe these activities provide essential credit intermediation services to the real economy that could not be easily replaced by other forms of intermediation, then the same logic that leads us to backstop commercial banking with a lender of last resort might lead us to backstop the banking activity taking place in the markets in a similar way.   \n\nHowever, any expansion of access to a lender of last resort would require legislation and it would be essential to have the right quid pro quo—the commensurate expansion in the scope of prudential oversight.  Substantial prudential regulation of entities—such as broker-dealers20 —that might gain access to an expanded lender of last resort would be required to mitigate moral hazard problems.  For example, firms might take less care in managing liquidity and capital if they know they have a lender of last resort backstop and be subject to less counterparty and creditor discipline.  In addition, the fact that an institution has access to a lender of last resort facility has value to the institution, even if that institution never taps the facility.  Thus, without a corresponding imposition of offsetting obligations and costs, the granting of access would create a significant competitive advantage. \n\nExtension of discount window-type access to a set of nonbank institutions would therefore have to go hand-in-hand with prudential regulation of these institutions.   Many thorny issues would have to be resolved.   For example, who would have access and on what terms and conditions? How would foreign-owned broker-dealers be treated?  Would an insurance-type payment be appropriate for firms that enjoyed lender of last resort access but did not have insured deposits?  How would the Fed’s role, as the lender of last resort, be coordinated with the oversight responsibilities of the primary regulators? \n\nConclusion\nWhich path to go down—limit wholesale funding or backstop it more broadly—would depend in large part on the social value of the capital markets-based activities presently being financed in unstable short-term wholesale markets and the utility of short-term wholesale funding for lenders.\n\nOf course, the choice might not be as black and white as this.  Some activities undertaken by securities firms or other nonbank entities presumably are much more socially useful than others.  In this case, legislators might deem that certain classes of securities firms should be granted access to a lender of last resort facility, but restricted in the scope of their permitted activities to those that do clearly create social value.  \n\nThe sheer size of banking functions undertaken outside commercial banking entities—even now, after the crisis—suggests that this issue must not be ignored.  I don’t think we should be comfortable with a situation in which extensive maturity transformation continues to take place without the appropriate safeguards against runs and fire sales.  Pretending the problem does not exist, or dealing with it only ex post through emergency facilities cannot be consistent with our financial stability objectives.\n\nThe issue of the social value created by market-based financial intermediation and appropriate scope and terms associated with a lender of last resort function are complex ones that require further study and analysis.  However, regardless of where we come out on these questions, we must make the basic structure of the wholesale funding market as sound as possible.  Thus, we must push ahead with tri-party and money fund reform. \n\nThank you for your attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n1 I note that the set of issues relating to wholesale funding are closely related to the challenge of ending ”too big to fail” I discussed in a November 15, 2012, speech (see www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2012/dud121115.html). The more stable the sources of funding, the more resilient each firm would be, and the less the failure of any one firm would disrupt the provision of credit to the economy.\n\n2 Banking groups retained a prominent role in credit supply via nonbank affiliates outside the commercial bank.\n\n3 A repo is a sale of securities coupled with an agreement to repurchase the securities at a specified price on a later date.\n\n4 Market makers are institutions such as securities brokers and dealers that buy and sell securities on behalf of customers. Market making accommodates the asynchronous arrival of sellers and buyers, thus providing liquidity to financial markets.\n\n5 Conduits are bankruptcy-remote, special purpose vehicles that fund pools of securities in short-term funding markets. The securities might consist of loans, mortgages, receivables and securitized products such as asset-backed securities (ABS). The securities in asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduits serve as collateral for the issuance of asset-backed commercial paper, while repo conduits fund in the repo market. Most conduits are so-called single-seller conduits that only serve individual banks or finance companies. Multi-seller conduits provide funding for asset pools of multiple institutions. Conduits are backed by credit lines from commercial banks, which allow the conduits to have a credit rating. Asset-backed commercial paper conduits are also defined in \"Shadow Banking: A Review of the Literature.\" Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Reports, no. 580, (October) 2011. www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr580.pdf.\n\n6 The problem was particularly acute for those firms with large securities trading and over-the-counter derivative businesses operated outside of depository institutions. In the United States, even those securities firms that were part of bank holding companies were vulnerable because Section 23A restrictions in the Federal Reserve Act that govern transactions between the bank and the nonbank affiliates as part of a bank holding company complex sharply limited what assets the securities firm could pass through to the bank and on to the Fed’s discount window facility.\n\n7 In the unwind, cash was transmitted back from securities firms to wholesale investors each morning, to hopefully be reinvested and returned back to the securities firms by the end of the day to finance their inventories of securities.\n\n8 The new global liquidity standards adopted by the Basel Committee provide a global minimum standard.\n\n9 At the end of 2011, the New York Fed disbanded a private-sector taskforce that had generated some good ideas but was running into trouble on implementation, and adopted a supervisory approach to pushing forward further reform.\n\n10 These estimates are based on data from the clearing banks with analysis by New York Fed staff.\n\n11 OMO eligible is collateral that the Fed can purchase or repo in its open market operations.\n\n12 In addition, because the Federal Reserve is authorized to intervene in the Treasury, agency debt, and agency MBS markets, it could act to stabilize these markets during times of stress. This would make it easier to liquidate such collateral without unduly depressing prices.\n\n13Financial Stability Oversight Council. 2012. \"Proposed Recommendations Regarding Money Market Mutual Fund Reform.\" (November).\nhttp://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/Documents/Proposed%20Recommendations%20Regarding%\n20Money%20Market%20Mutual%20Fund%20Reform%20-%20November%2013,%202012.pdf\n\n14 See William C. Dudley. 2012. \"For Stability’s Sake, Reform Money Funds.\" www.bloomberg.com, August 14. http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-14/for-stability-s-sake-reform-money-funds.html.\n\n15 For a more detailed discussion, see “The Minimum Balance at Risk: A Proposal to Mitigate the Systemic Risks Posed by Money Market”. www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr564.pdf\n\n16 Although the largest stand-alone securities firms adopted bank holding company status during the crisis, their non-depository institution arms do not have access to the discount window backstop because Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act restricts the ability of the holding company to transfer assets from the non-depository institution to the commercial bank affiliate that has access to the discount window.\n\n17 See Daniel K. Tarullo. 2012. \"Industry Structure and Systemic Risk Regulation.\" December 4. http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/tarullo20121204a.htm. In this speech, he explores three policy proposals: (1) breaking up large financial institutions by reinstating Glass-Steagall restrictions or by imposing other prohibitions on affiliations of commercial banks with certain business lines; (2) placing a cap on the nondeposit liabilities of financial institutions; and (3) requiring financial institutions above a specified size to hold minimum amounts of long-term debt available for conversion to equity to avoid or facilitate an orderly resolution of a troubled firm\n\n18 A lender of last resort finances with an appropriate haircut.\n\n19 This was demonstrated recently by the European Central Bank’s Outright Monetary Transactions program\n\n20 Several of the largest broker-dealers adopted bank holding company status in recent years, but Section 23A rules restrict the capacity of their banking subsidiaries to channel liquidity to their broker-dealer operations."
