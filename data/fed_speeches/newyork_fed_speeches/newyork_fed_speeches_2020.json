    "content": "Thank you for the kind introduction, Ken, and for the opportunity to speak at today\u2019s forum. I am pleased to join Edwin Schooling Latter of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in offering some remarks, and will focus on the transition from U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR. As always, the views I express today are my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWe will soon cross into 2021, the most consequential year in the wind-down of USD LIBOR. Year-end is often a good moment to take stock of what we have accomplished and set goals for the year ahead. So today I\u2019ll talk about the tremendous progress to date in the global effort to transition away from LIBOR, review recent accomplishments specific to USD LIBOR, and discuss top priorities\u2014or \u201cresolutions\u201d\u2014for the New Year.\n\nIt would be an understatement to say that 2020 has been an extraordinarily challenging year, with the COVID-19 pandemic leading to tremendous human hardship and significant disruptions to firms and financial markets. The pandemic also has further underscored LIBOR\u2019s deficiencies, and strengthened the official sector\u2019s resolve in the area of global interest rate benchmark reform. Progress in transition efforts this year has actually accelerated despite the challenging circumstances. In the past few weeks alone, there have been several major announcements signaling progress toward the end of LIBOR. It\u2019s important to build on that momentum and continue the transition in a timely and orderly manner.\n\nI\u2019ll start today by looking back at important developments before turning to the year ahead. First, I\u2019ll briefly review the global context of the LIBOR transition, including the Alternative Reference Rates Committee\u2019s (ARRC) choice of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its preferred alternative to USD LIBOR. I\u2019ll also discuss progress made on the transition during 2020. Then I\u2019ll turn to the recent announcements on LIBOR\u2019s future by its regulator, the FCA, and its administrator, ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA), along with guidance released by U.S. supervisors. Together, these provide a proposed path for LIBOR\u2019s end.\n\nAs we take stock and then look ahead, I encourage you all to set New Year\u2019s resolutions. And if you set only one for 2021 based on my remarks today, let it be this: No new LIBOR.\n\nThe Global Transition from LIBOR\n\nThe transition from LIBOR is a global challenge, given the widespread usage of the benchmark across five currencies: the U.S. dollar, euro, yen, pound sterling, and Swiss franc. The financial stability risks stemming from LIBOR have prompted reference rate reform efforts worldwide. The New York Fed is directly involved in this effort both domestically and globally\u2014as a co-convener of the ARRC, as a producer of reference rates such as SOFR, and because President John Williams serves as co-chair of the Financial Stability Board\u2019s (FSB) Official Sector Steering Group.\n\nThe FSB recently published a progress report on the global transition from LIBOR.1 The report highlights a common view across jurisdictions that the transition remains a significant priority. It also states that the \u201conus of action\u201d is on firms, and notes that regulators will be monitoring progress closely.2\n\nThe importance of global reform efforts was reinforced by pandemic-related market disruptions. As discussed in the FSB progress report, activity in unsecured term wholesale bank funding markets\u2014which had already experienced a structural decline following the global financial crisis\u2014further dried up last March, forcing some LIBOR benchmarks to rely almost entirely on judgment-based submissions. In USD funding markets, volumes in some segments that LIBOR seeks to measure\u2014such as three-month commercial paper issuance from banks\u2014fell notably while exhibiting wide rate dispersion.3 This further highlighted the fundamental weaknesses of LIBOR.\n\nThe Transition to Alternative Reference Rates in the U.S.\n\nVarious national working groups were born out of global reference rate reform efforts to address the unique transition needs of individual countries and currencies. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve convened the ARRC.\n\nThe first challenge of the ARRC was to recommend an alternative to USD LIBOR. The ARRC developed key criteria to guide its selection of a \u201crobust\u201d benchmark.4 After an extensive evaluation process, the ARRC choose SOFR as its preferred alternative.5\n\nAs U.S. regulators have explained, market participants should seek to transition away from LIBOR in the manner that is most appropriate given their specific circumstances.6 The official sector supports continued innovation and further development of alternative reference rates.7\n\nAmong reference rates, SOFR is robust, is available now, and is already a well-established foundation for the transition from USD LIBOR. While the adoption of SOFR is voluntary, the rate\u2019s characteristics clearly demonstrate why the ARRC selected it as its recommended alternative to USD LIBOR. SOFR is fully transaction-based, produced by the New York Fed in accordance with IOSCO\u2019s Principles for Financial Benchmarks, and draws from a deep underlying market (the U.S. Treasury overnight repurchase agreement market) with substantial transaction volumes and broad participation.8\n\nMilestones for Supporting SOFR Use and Liquidity\n\nThe ARRC has developed a detailed supporting framework for using SOFR, including tools such as fallbacks and recommended conventions for new use of SOFR in various products.9\n\nIn this past year alone, there have been numerous consultations, tools, and recommendations from the ARRC and others that should bolster use of SOFR and keep the industry on track for a smooth transition from USD LIBOR. To highlight a few:\n\nThe End of LIBOR, Coming into Focus\n\nThe architecture for transitioning from LIBOR to SOFR has strengthened in the U.S. and around the globe, and we recently received more clarity on the proposed end of LIBOR.\n\nFollowing a pair of announcements in November,15 IBA released a consultation last week on its intention to cease publication of all non-USD LIBORs and one-week and two-month USD LIBORs after December 31, 2021, while ceasing publication of the remaining USD LIBOR settings (overnight and the one-, three-, six-, and 12-month tenors) after June 30, 2023.16 IBA anticipates there being a representative panel for the continuation of these USD LIBOR settings through to June 30, 2023.\n\nWhen the feedback period concludes in late January, IBA has indicated that it will share the results with the FCA and summarize the results publicly shortly thereafter.\n\nThere have also been key announcements from supervisors related to USD LIBOR:\n\nThese announcements from various stakeholders should be understood as a collective framework that lays out a proposed path to a smooth transition away from USD LIBOR. That framework includes:\n\nAll told, these actions propose a final wind-down and end date for USD LIBOR as a representative, panel-based rate. There will be no guesswork; pending the results of the consultation, the end game would be certain. 19 By end of 2021, new use of LIBOR should stop. And by mid-2023, firms should have cleaned up any remaining legacy contracts. The message is clear: transition efforts cannot be put off.\n\nTop Priorities for 2021\n\nWith that end game in mind, I will suggest three New Year\u2019s resolutions for the transition away from LIBOR:\n\nThe first and most important: No new LIBOR.\n\nAll firms should stop writing new LIBOR contracts as soon as practicable and in any event no later than end-2021. Firms will have to take progressive steps well before then to ensure readiness and build capacity for entering into contracts that use robust alternatives to LIBOR, such as SOFR. The ARRC has laid out best practice dates to accomplish this ahead of the end of 2021.\n\nAccelerating this work is critical for a number of reasons. As U.S. regulators have made clear, supervised firms should stop using LIBOR in new contracts as soon as practicable in the New Year. Firms will need to be prepared both internally and externally to transition their products and services to robust alternatives. When the New Year\u2019s ball drops on LIBOR next year, every bank should be striving for a clean bill of health from their supervisor.\n\nMoving quickly will also avoid making the problem worse. With an estimated $200 trillion in gross exposure to USD LIBOR, there is already an enormous number of contracts that will need to transition from LIBOR, and it is detrimental to add on to that.20 As ARRC Chair Tom Wipf often says, the first step for getting yourself out of a ditch is to stop digging!\n\nThe second resolution, which extends from the first: Build SOFR into your diet.\n\nWith the end of LIBOR in sight, firms should be accelerating plans to transact in SOFR-based cash and derivatives products if they aren\u2019t prepared already. While the use of SOFR as an alternative to LIBOR is voluntary, SOFR-based instruments are already replacing LIBOR in most markets. In derivatives markets, the transition is well underway, and liquidity is growing. Developments such as the CCP discounting change to SOFR are supporting growth of SOFR derivatives. In cash markets, recent floating-rate note issuance has used SOFR more than LIBOR.21 And SOFR will be the basis for future agency adjustable-rate mortgage products.22\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the ARRC has a wide range of resources to help market participants get familiar with and begin adopting SOFR, including conventions for various cash instruments\u2014most recently, conventions for syndicated and bilateral business loans. If firms increasingly use SOFR when writing new cash contracts, that will build demand for SOFR derivatives. In turn, this should enable more SOFR-linked issuance in cash markets\u2014a virtuous cycle. Liquid SOFR derivatives markets are also a necessary criterion for developing forward-looking term SOFR rates, the last step in the ARRC\u2019s Paced Transition Plan.23\n\nThe third and final resolution: Work off those legacy LIBOR exposures.\n\nLast week\u2019s announcements complement existing tools and proposed legislative solutions to support an orderly wind-down. The proposed mid-2023 end date for publishing USD LIBOR\u2019s major tenors will allow the bulk of legacy USD LIBOR exposures to mature. That should significantly narrow the remaining work that needs to be done. Firms should identify contracts that extend past mid-2023 and remediate them. As I mentioned earlier, there are tools in place to incorporate effective fallback language for derivatives and many cash instruments. And for the toughest legacy contracts\u2014those that have no effective means of transition away from LIBOR upon its cessation\u2014there is an important solution in the works. Here, the ARRC has proposed legislation24 that would allow such contracts\u2014largely securitizations and floating-rate notes\u2014to smoothly transition to SOFR.25 The ARRC recently discussed principles that articulate support for an effective legislative solution.26 Further, the ARRC sees the type of legislation it has urged New York State to adopt as the best model for achieving this, whether enacted at the state or federal level, and it encourages all market participants to support the proposal.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe transition from LIBOR is a substantial and complex undertaking. While significant work remains, I am heartened by the progress to date, particularly amid such challenging circumstances. Recent announcements have made the proposed end of LIBOR clear, and firms should stop new use of LIBOR by end-2021. We have already taken many steps to build a strong supporting framework for the transition. As we head into 2021, I encourage each of you to adopt these LIBOR resolutions for your firms, so that when we meet at this time next year, your transition is already done. \n\nHappy holidays, and best wishes for no new LIBOR in the New Year!"

    "content": "Thank you to the Money Marketeers of New York University for inviting me to speak today.1\n\nMoney markets are vital to the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses, and central to the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy implementation. For nearly 75 years, the Money Marketeers has been an essential forum for discussing critical issues related to money markets. I am pleased that this group is continuing to meet virtually in these challenging times, allowing this important dialogue to continue. I look forward to our discussion.\n\nWhen I last spoke with this group in April 2019, I talked about the recent decision by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to maintain an ample reserves regime as its long-run framework for implementing monetary policy.2 An ample reserves regime is a version of a \u201cfloor\u201d system in which reserves are supplied in sufficient quantity to ensure that control over the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve's administered rates. At the time, I noted two key benefits that the FOMC highlighted in choosing this framework. First, it provides effective control over short-term interest rates in a broad range of environments, including during periods when large amounts of liquidity are needed to relieve stress in the financial system or large-scale asset purchases are required to support the U.S. economy.3 And, second, from an operational perspective, a steady-state ample reserves regime can be simple and efficient to operate.\n\nHowever, in March, the global financial system experienced an extraordinary shock, triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, and our focus shifted rapidly. The Federal Reserve took swift and decisive action to address the shift in the economic outlook and deteriorating conditions in financial markets. The FOMC cut the target range for the federal funds rate close to zero, and directed the Desk to conduct repo operations and purchases of Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to support market functioning. The Federal Reserve undertook a wide range of additional steps\u2014many in coordination with the U.S. Treasury\u2014to support the flow of credit to the U.S. economy, and coordinated with foreign central banks to stabilize dollar funding conditions. Some regulations were also temporarily adjusted to encourage bank lending. These measures, alongside swift and forceful fiscal policy action, succeeded in stabilizing financial markets and averted an even deeper collapse in economic activity.4\n\nAlthough the pandemic shock itself was unprecedented, the responses that it required\u2014a rapid increase in assets and expansion of liquidity\u2014were the type of actions the FOMC contemplated when choosing an ample reserves regime. And, as expected, the shift to operating at much higher reserve levels has been smooth, allowing the FOMC to focus on supporting the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Today I\u2019d like to talk about this shift to higher reserve levels and our observations on money markets so far, and explain why the Federal Reserve\u2019s framework is well suited to implement policy in this environment.\n\nLet me note that the views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhat Impact Has the Federal Reserve\u2019s Pandemic Response Had on the Balance Sheet and Reserve Balances?\n\nI would like to start with a review of changes in the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet since March. It is the size of the balance sheet and composition of liabilities that determine the level of reserves in the banking system, which, in turn, has a meaningful influence on money market rates and policy implementation.\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet grew at a historic pace between March and June of this year as a result of the FOMC\u2019s critical actions to support market functioning and the flow of credit to the U.S. economy. Most of the increase resulted from purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS, shown in dark and light blue. Expanded repo operations and central bank liquidity swaps, as well as credit and liquidity facilities established with the support of the U.S. Treasury\u2014collectively shown in gray\u2014also contributed to this growth.5 More recently, the rate of growth in the balance sheet has slowed. With market functioning significantly improved, outstanding balances across funding operations and credit and liquidity facilities have gradually declined, and the pace of net Treasury and agency MBS purchases has been steady since June.\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve expands its assets, reserves in the banking system increase. This is mechanical; for example, when the Desk purchases securities from dealers, the Federal Reserve funds these purchases by crediting the reserve accounts of dealers\u2019 custodian banks.6 As shown in dark blue in Figure 2, reserves in the banking system grew rapidly during the spring, and have reached a level of over $3 trillion, exceeding the prior peak in reserves, which occurred in 2014.7\n\nIn addition to supplying reserves to the banking system, the Federal Reserve maintains an account for the U.S. government, known as the Treasury General Account (TGA), as well as accounts for other domestic and foreign official entities.8 Increases in the balances held in these accounts alter the composition of liabilities on the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet and reduce the level of reserves in the banking system. For example, when investors purchase Treasury debt, funds are transferred from their bank accounts to the TGA.\n\nAs shown in Figure 2, the TGA has risen dramatically since March, as the Treasury Department built cash balances to prepare for potentially unprecedented outflows related to the pandemic response.9 Treasury\u2019s cash management policy is motivated by precautionary risk management and calibrated to allow Treasury to cover outflows in case of a temporary interruption to market access.10 The TGA currently stands at roughly $1.5 trillion, nearly four times its largest size prior to this year. This balance is generally expected to fall in the coming months and, while the extent of the decline is uncertain, most expect the balance to remain well above historical norms.\n\nCurrency in circulation is another liability that affects the level of reserves. The pandemic increased the public\u2019s demand for currency, likely for both precautionary and transactional purposes. As a result, currency has grown at a rapid pace compared to prior years, increasing by approximately $250 billion since March.\n\nGrowth in the TGA, currency, and other non-reserve liabilities has muted the growth in reserves since March; reserve balances would have been about $1.6 trillion higher had these other liabilities remained unchanged. In effect, this increase in non-reserve liabilities has broadened the funding of the expansion in Federal Reserve assets beyond reserves held by the banking system.\n\nBefore I move on, I want to highlight one other Federal Reserve liability: the overnight reverse repo, or ON RRP, which currently has no outstanding balance. Unlike other non-reserve liabilities, the overnight reverse repo is used directly as a tool in the Federal Reserve\u2019s operating framework to ensure effective interest rate control. A broad range of money market participants can invest funds in the ON RRP at a fixed rate, placing a floor under overnight interest rates.\n\nHow Has the Historic Increase in Reserves Affected Money Markets?\n\nTo highlight how reserve supply influences money market rates, Figure 3 shows a stylized depiction of the relationship between the overnight interest rate and banks\u2019 demand for reserves.\n\nPrior to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), the Federal Reserve operated a regime in which just enough reserves were supplied to meet banks\u2019 reserve requirements and payment needs. In this environment, depicted to the left, the marginal bank borrowed at rates above the interest rate earned on reserves\u2014which at the time was zero\u2014to ensure sufficient balances were maintained to cover payment needs.\n\nIn an ample reserves framework, reserves are instead supplied in an amount that leaves most banks with reserve balances above what they need for payments purposes. As a result, many are comfortable investing excess balances when the return on other high-quality liquid assets is above the interest paid on excess reserves (IOER), and also taking deposits at rates near IOER.11 In effect, IOER sets a benchmark for short-term lending and borrowing. This environment is represented by the part of the reserve demand curve that flattens out with rates near IOER, depicted to the right.12\n\nHowever, when reserves are supplied well beyond what banks require for payments purposes, many may perceive increasing balance sheet costs associated with taking on additional reserves. In this environment, the marginal bank borrows at overnight rates below IOER, as it requires additional compensation to grow its balance sheet further.13 We might consider reserves at this point to be in abundant supply. Even when reserves are abundant, IOER retains its strong influence on rates, although federal funds and many other overnight money market instruments trade at a spread below IOER.\n\nSo where are we currently on this graphic?\n\nAs I\u2019ve described, the supply of reserves has been shifting significantly to the right along this curve. Given this, we may have expected money market rates to be lower than they currently are, reflecting more of an abundance of reserves. However, as shown in Figure 4, the effective federal funds rate has remained relatively close to IOER in recent months\u2014much closer than it was when reserves were at similar levels in 2014.\n\nI\u2019d highlight two main factors that are contributing to this difference.\n\nFirst, banks\u2019 reserve management practices appear to have shifted since March. Figure 5 shows federal funds rates relative to IOER for different levels of aggregate reserves, over the last 10 years, with observations this year shown by the light and dark red dots. Since March, rates have been higher relative to IOER than was the case during the earlier period of abundant reserves, shown by the light blue dots representing observations in 2014 and 2015.\n\nSome of the light red dots represent observations during the highly uncertain days of March, when some banks paid elevated rates to maintain precautionary reserve balances in the face of extraordinary customer demand for liquidity. To better understand this dynamic, the Federal Reserve Board included new questions in the most recent Senior Financial Officer Survey (SFOS), which is a survey of commercial banks that collectively hold around three-fourths of the reserves in the system. Banks that increased their reserve balances from February to April confirmed that a strong desire to hold precautionary liquidity against potential customer credit line draws or deposit outflows drove the increase.14 The results of this survey were released to the public yesterday and are available on the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s website.\n\nInterestingly, even as this elevated market uncertainty has receded and reserve levels have continued to increase, rates have remained near IOER, as indicated by the dark red dots. It could be that a greater comfort among domestic banks to hold higher reserve balances, at least for now, is contributing to rates continuing to trade near IOER. In the SFOS, the banks with higher reserve holdings since April indicated that their increase was motivated by a desire to maintain a buffer against deposit outflows, as well as the absence of attractive risk-adjusted investment alternatives.15 As shown in Figure 6, the growth in reserve balances has been particularly notable for the U.S. global systemically important banks (GSIBs) and large domestic banks that typically accumulate deposits.16 These banks collectively hold a much higher share of reserves than during the post-GFC period, when foreign banking organizations (FBOs) absorbed a greater share of the reserve increase.17\n\nA second, and likely important factor, contributing to the higher level of rates relative to IOER is the significant increase in Treasury\u2019s net bill issuance this year to fund fiscal stimulus, shown in Figure 7. Although Treasury bills are external to our stylized reserve demand curve, they are highly liquid and safe investment instruments, and an increase in the supply of Treasury bills tends to raise rates on a range of money market instruments that lenders consider to be substitute investments. Indeed, analysis by New York Fed colleagues finds that, controlling for changes in reserves, an increase of $1 trillion in the supply of short-term Treasury securities raises the spread of the effective federal funds rate relative to IOER by about three basis points.18 This helps explain some of the firmness in money market rates in recent months.\n\nIt is also possible that the configuration of the Federal Reserve\u2019s administered rates within the target range has influenced the relative firmness in rates at times. The current spread between the IOER and ON RRP rates is narrower than during the earlier period of abundant reserves. Because of this, it would not have been possible for the effective federal funds rate to trade as far below IOER as it did during the 2014 to 2016 period, although this does not likely explain why rates are as close to IOER as they currently are.\n\nWhere Do Money Market Rates Go From Here?\n\nReserves over the near term seem likely to continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace than during the spring of this year. The degree and rate of growth will depend, in large part, on the path of asset purchases that the FOMC chooses. For example, in the Desk\u2019s November Surveys of Primary Dealers and Market Participants, the median respondent expected net Treasury and agency MBS purchases to continue at the current pace through the end of next year before slowing in subsequent years. In addition, as I noted above, most market participants expect the Treasury Department to draw down the TGA balance over the medium term. Together, changes in Federal Reserve assets and liabilities such as these could add significant reserves to the banking system.\n\nEven as aggregate reserve levels are expected to grow, many banks have suggested they will increasingly take actions to limit the growth in their own reserves. We have already heard from some banks that compression in net interest margins and changes in their regulatory ratios associated with higher reserve levels are making additional reserve growth less attractive for them.19 Indeed, even as market participants broadly expect reserve levels to increase in coming months, the majority of SFOS respondents expected their own reserve levels to be stable or decline, as shown in Figure 8. Many of these respondents reported that they intend to let wholesale funding and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances run off, and to lower the rates they offer on certain deposits. It is important to note that these types of business changes take time to implement. So, even if reserves were to stay near current levels, these actions could put downward pressure on market rates.\n\nOf course, as I described above, reserves remain in the banking system unless they are absorbed by growth in another Federal Reserve liability, or Federal Reserve assets decrease. The system is closed. Actions taken by individual banks to limit reserve growth can redistribute reserves to banks that have more capacity to absorb them, and money market rates adjust until banks in aggregate eventually demand the total amount of reserves being supplied.\n\nDuring the 2010 to 2014 period, as rates declined, FBOs absorbed a significant amount of reserves, in part by taking on additional deposits from money market mutual funds. FBOs are natural borrowers in wholesale deposit markets and faced lower balance sheet costs associated with reserve growth than domestic depository institutions.20 It remains to be seen, however, if these banks will be as comfortable taking additional reserves in the current environment, or if other banks will step in to absorb reserve growth should rates fall.\n\nGoing forward, it seems likely that some of the factors that have been supporting rates this year\u2014the increase in the TGA, highly elevated bill issuance, and domestic banks\u2019 apparent comfort with reserve growth to date\u2014will moderate or reverse. We will continue to monitor money markets closely to assess evolving conditions.\n\nHow Will the Fed\u2019s Tools Work to Maintain Interest Rate Control?\n\nAs I noted above, the Federal Reserve has two important tools that can help maintain control over the federal funds rate and other short-term rates in this environment. IOER sets a benchmark against which banks evaluate short-term borrowing and lending opportunities, and this in turn passes through to other money market rates. When rates fall below IOER, the ON RRP maintains a floor on overnight rates by offering a broad range of money market investors an alternative risk-free investment option.21\n\nOn occasion, the Federal Reserve has adjusted these administered rates to influence where the effective federal funds rate falls within the target range. Since 2018, the Federal Reserve has made five such adjustments to IOER and, as shown in Figure 9, each time the effective federal funds rate moved in line with the adjustment, demonstrating IOER\u2019s strong influence. In instances where rates have drifted lower relative to IOER, the ON RRP has maintained a strong floor.22 Since 2016, the effective federal funds rate has not traded below the target range, even on balance sheet reporting dates when there can be strong downward pressure on rates.\n\nAs shown in Figure 9, IOER is currently set at 10 basis points, well below the top of the target range. If undue downward pressure on rates were to emerge, the Federal Reserve could adjust IOER higher to lift overnight rates. Even if this downward pressure persisted, the ON RRP would maintain a strong floor by providing an alternative investment for money market participants and, if needed, by reducing the quantity of reserves held by the banking system to relieve pressure on bank balance sheets. The Desk has over 120 counterparties to the ON RRP, representing a large majority of investors in the triparty repo market, giving this tool broad coverage to accomplish these objectives.23\n\nOf course, we will respond to the environment as it evolves. The Federal Reserve stands ready to adjust the terms of the ON RRP and parameters of other tools as needed to ensure their efficacy.\n\nClosing Remarks\n\nIn conclusion, I have been pleased that the FOMC\u2019s implementation framework was able to support actions taken to address the pandemic, by smoothly accommodating a shift to much higher reserve levels. Given this significant increase in reserves, we might have expected money market rates to trade lower in the FOMC\u2019s target range relative to IOER than they have, similar to the earlier experience with abundant reserves.\n\nHowever, the factors that supported rates this year\u2014the increase in the TGA, highly elevated bill issuance, and domestic banks\u2019 apparent comfort with reserve growth to date\u2014may moderate in 2021. As a result, rates could fall, reflecting an abundance of reserves. If this softness in rates emerges, it could help the financial system accommodate the growth in reserves by encouraging some banks to take on additional balances. Even if more persistent downward pressure on rates emerges, we are confident that the Federal Reserve has tools to ensure effective control over the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates across the broad range of potential outcomes.\n\nFigures"

    "content": "Introduction\n\nGood afternoon. It\u2019s a great pleasure to take part in today\u2019s Culture and Conduct Forum. I\u2019m sorry that I can\u2019t be with you \u201clive\u201d today, but appreciate the opportunity to take part in this forum.\n\nI lead the New York Fed\u2019s Initiative on Governance and Culture Reform in the financial services industry. Today I will provide you with an update on the activities of our Initiative so far this year and our plans for the coming months. I will then offer some thoughts on a topic that the COVID\u201319 pandemic has underscored as a key element of a well-functioning workplace culture: psychological safety.\n\nUpdate on Culture Initiative Activities\n\nAs background, the New York Fed\u2019s Culture Initiative began in early 2014 with three primary aims:\n\nOne way we\u2019ve been advancing these aims is through convening relevant stakeholders \u2013 from the industry, official sector and academia \u2013 to build awareness about how culture influences behavior and conduct, and to encourage innovation and the sharing of leading practices.\n\nOne of our most prominent vehicles for that has been our annual Culture Conference, which, unfortunately, we had to cancel this year due to the pandemic. In its place, we are hosting a series of webinars that focus on many of the topics we had planned to explore at the conference.\n\nOctober 19 Webinar: Partnerships in Building Ethical Norms\n\nIn October we hosted our first webinar. Entitled \u201cPartnerships in Building Ethical Norms,\u201d it highlighted two areas in which the New York Fed has worked with the industry to raise standards of conduct. The first area is the FX Global Code, a set of principles for participants in the international foreign exchange market.  The second area is the development of case studies that explore ethical dilemmas in the workplace \u2013 specifically, at financial firms. The case studies are the first work product of a New York Fed sponsored group that grew out of our Initiative, the Education and Industry Forum on Financial Services Culture (the EIF). Members of the EIF include academics and representatives from financial institutions.\n\nThe case studies were written for use by universities with undergraduate and graduate students interested in pursuing a career in financial services, as well as for use with new employees in financial institutions. They cover a range of timely issues, including: the line between exploiting a loophole and cheating; how to approach a business strategy that is \u201ctoo good to be true;\u201d confronting racial bias; and making ethical decisions when there are no clear right or wrong answers.\n\nIf you would like to view it, the webinar is available on the New York Fed\u2019s public website.\n\nYou can also find a link there to the case studies themselves.\n\nFuture Webinars\n\nOur second webinar, which will be held on December 2, is entitled \u201cTrust and Decision Making.\u201d We have assembled an outstanding panel for this event, who will consider questions such as:\n\nWe are currently planning two more webinars for early next year, focusing on \u201cDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\u201d and \u201cPurpose and Stakeholders.\u201d We hope you\u2019ll be able to tune in for each of them. Again, see our public website for details.\n\nPsychological Safety and the Pandemic\n\nTurning to two areas of special attention at this conference \u2013 culture and COVID-19 \u2013 I would like to discuss the importance of psychological safety. As a live example, I will draw on the experience this past spring of the Bank Supervision Group of the New York Fed, our largest division and the area in which I work.\n\nPsychological Safety\n\nThe author Amy Edmondson has defined the term psychological safety as: \u201cA shared belief that a team is safe for interpersonal risk taking...[A] sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject, or punish someone for speaking up. This confidence stems from mutual respect and trust among team members.\u201d1 This concept grew out of research in the 1960s by Edgar Schein on organizational change, which discussed the need to create psychological safety if individuals are to feel secure and capable of changing.2 A safe environment is one in which people are free to express their thoughts, questions, concerns \u2013 as well as admit mistakes. Moreover, as Edmondson noted earlier this year, \u201cThis is vital to leveraging the benefits of diversity, because it can help make inclusion a reality.\u201d3\n\nResearch on psychological safety has also shown its foundational connection with team learning and performance. A few years ago Google asked itself, \u201cWhat makes a team effective?\u201d4 They studied their own teams, and discovered five key dynamics at play:\n\nOf these five factors, psychological safety was by far the most important. The study found that employees on teams with higher psychological safety are more likely to stay at Google, leverage diverse ideas, increase revenue, and are rated twice as effective.\n\nSo, if psychological safety is essential for the highest functioning of teams, how can it be fostered in the workplace? In a TED Talk last year, Edmondson offered three practical suggestions:5\n\nThe Pandemic Experience\n\nWith those concepts and practices in mind, allow me to review the early pandemic experience of my group within the New York Fed. I believe that, even if we were not fully aware of it at the time, our initial response to the crisis resulted in an increase in psychological safety and effectiveness in the group.\n\nIn April, after we had all been working remotely for about a month and COVID-19 infection rates were nearing their zenith in New York, we decided to create a special blog series within the group. The purpose of the blog was to provide a forum for sharing the full range of emotions, challenges, and blessings that people were experiencing. This was highly unusual for a traditionally buttoned-up organization like ours \u2013 central bankers don\u2019t really talk about their feelings much \u2013 and not without its risks. But we recognized that the pandemic was a collective trauma and believed that, at such a time, sharing with others could lead to deeper personal understanding, more compassion for one another, and sustained group cohesion.\n\nThe blog generated over 50 posts and well over 300 comments, conveying five main themes:\n\nAt the end of May, as the most intense period of the COVID-19 crisis receded in New York, it became clear that, for some, the situation had become less overwhelming and more a source of possibility and new opportunity. To conclude the blog, we asked what aspects of the experience people would like to see carried ahead in the group and in their own lives:\n\nChallenges and Conclusion\n\nThe blog revealed important lessons about psychological safety. For one thing, the blog explicitly defined itself as a \u201csafe space.\u201d It invited candor and vulnerability. For another, the bloggers were able to draw on stores of mutual respect and trust that had been built up over many years. Together, these elements worked to facilitate \u201cinterpersonal risk taking\u201d \u2013 speaking up \u2013 without fear of embarrassment, rejection or punishment. What is more, the COVID-19 crisis almost demanded this kind of safe space. The situation was one of \u201cenormous uncertainty and interdependence,\u201d required questioning and learning, and the engagement of multiple voices and views.\n\nSpeaking for myself, I continue to experience the new \u201copenness and connectedness\u201d across the many work teams I\u2019ve been involved with since the pandemic began. People seem freer to say what they really think, are listening more closely to others, and approaching interactions with the assumption of good intent. Deeper values are more daily present than in the past. Many people strongly welcome the atmosphere of greater psychological safety that has emerged at work, and don\u2019t want to lose it. But maintaining and building on it is, of course, not without its challenges, especially in a long term remote working environment.\n\nPerhaps like many of you, for me the most significant inhibitor of this new atmosphere stems from not being physically present with others. I miss all the crucial cues one gains from subtle facial expressions and body language. I also feel \u201csiloed\u201d more than ever, only communicating with those with whom I directly work. I often worry about the lack of natural \u201cflow\u201d in virtual discussions and its impact on sound decision-making. Diversity and inclusion, it seems to me, also become more difficult to encourage and practice through a screen.\n\nI noted a moment ago that an important factor in the development of psychological safety during the pandemic was a deep reservoir of mutual respect and trust that had long existed in the group. People relied on established relationships and shared assumptions from the pre-crisis world. It is unclear how long this \u201cbanked experience\u201d will continue to support a safe and effective working environment.6 Going forward, a central question will be how we can continue to support psychological safety as new work teams are formed and new hires are virtually integrated into the organization. Indeed, this is a key issue we will consider in our next webinar.\n\nOne final reflection. I sometimes wonder whether it is psychological safety that we are most in need of \u2013 or is there something else? When I recall times when I felt most productive and happy at work, I certainly also had an underlying sense of safety. But, there was something more: the environment was not only safe, but generative. That is, the work experience was characterized not only by open expression and easy exchanges with others, but by learning and, most importantly, by change. In the end, I want to suggest that psychological safety should be understood as a necessary condition for effective work. But that we should not lose sight of what we really long for, in work as in our lives: deep human connection and growth."

    "title": "The Impact of the Pandemic on Cultural Capital in the Finance Industry",
    "date": "Nov 16, 2020",
    "speaker": "Kevin Stiroh",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2020/sti201116",
    "content": "Good morning and thank you for the opportunity to participate today, the first day of what looks to be a very interesting four days featuring a range of important and timely discussion items for the financial sector. As I looked through the agenda, I was impressed with the diversity of topics the panels will be covering, including traditional banking risks, emerging risks like climate change, and the industry's response to the pandemic.\n\nToday, I want to focus my time on the importance of a firm's culture in determining business outcomes and how that culture may be impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. Through my remarks today, I will address two core sets of questions. One, what is cultural capital, why does it matter, and how does it evolve? Two, how is cultural capital impacted by the pandemic? I think we'll hear more about how the pandemic is impacting financial firms in a wide variety of ways throughout the conference.\n\nBefore proceeding, I will emphasize that I am speaking for myself and my views do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhat Is Cultural Capital?\n\nFirst, what is cultural capital?\n\nMy colleagues and I introduced the concept of cultural capital for financial firms in a white paper in late 2017 as a type of intangible asset that impacts how a firm operates and ultimately performs.1 Cultural capital is an input into a firm's production process that determines its ability to deliver the products and services that it offers. It is analogous to physical capital like the equipment, buildings and property a firm uses; to human capital, which is the accumulated knowledge and skills of its workers; and to reputational capital, which includes the franchise value or brand recognition of a firm.\n\nMore broadly, culture can be defined as the shared set of norms within a group that influences decision-making and is evidenced through behavior.2 Cultural capital is a conceptual way to link a firm's culture, including its values, assumptions and behavioral norms, to its business outcomes. For financial firms, it is not loss-absorbing in a financial sense like equity capital, but it can be loss-preventing by influencing decisions, behaviors, and outcomes over time. As an intangible asset, we generally see the impact rather than the thing itself. But, its impact can be measured, assessed, and ultimately influenced.\n\nIn an organization with a low level of cultural capital, for example, behavioral risk is high. Behavioral risk refers to behaviors within an organization that could potentially lead to negative business outcomes.3 In such organizations, behavioral risk is not effectively mitigated or even considered, and the stated values of the firm are not reflected in the actions and norms of the organization's members. Group think is prevalent and employees do not speak freely, or are ignored, when they have concerns about the way their group is doing business. The letter of the law may be followed but not the spirit, with illegal activities only coming to light when discovered by authorities. \"Conduct\" is viewed as something that is only the responsibility of the compliance department through a set of rules and controls. The outcomes stemming from high behavioral risk reduce cultural capital, damage the firm and the trustworthiness of the industry over time.\n\nIn an organization with a high level of cultural capital, on the other hand, behavioral risk is low. Employees refrain from taking excessive risks and they are unafraid of \u2013 and rewarded for \u2013 raising issues up the management chain. When they speak up, they believe the organization will take them seriously with meaningful responses. The organization recognizes and rewards employees who understand and internalize the expectations of laws and regulations, and do not view compliance as a checklist. In organizations with a high level of cultural capital, an important factor in advancing to senior leadership is role-modeling behavior consistent with a firm's values, assumptions and behavioral norms. These actions all add to the firm's stock of cultural capital.\n\nLike other forms of tangible and intangible capital, cultural capital grows and shrinks over time \u2013 purposeful investments and managerial focus can add to it, while neglect or misconduct can reduce it. Depletion of cultural capital can adversely impact the firm's productive capacity and value. This reflects, for example, changes to employees' attitudes and practices (\"how we do things\"), as well as their beliefs and values (\"the way things should be done\"). In the Whitepaper, mthey need to recognize the importance of this critical asset, be able to measure it, and understand the types of investment needed to sustain it and the forces that may cause it to depreciate.\n\nSince the New York Fed began to highlight the need for a focus on culture reform in financial services, measurement has consistently been raised as a challenge. While measuring culture may not be as straightforward as measurement approaches for more traditional assets and risks, it is possible to gain valuable insights through a multi-layered and patient approach. Through the use of surveys, interviews, focus groups, behavioral analytics, network analyses, and board effectiveness assessments, firms can triangulate from multiple inputs and develop a view of how high or low their cultural capital is, both in an absolute and relative sense.\n\nAt a 2017 conference, hosted by the New York Fed, representatives from across the industry came together to discuss how boards of directors assess their firms' cultures, hold management accountable, the benefits of data and benchmarking, and finally, the role of performance management and incentives.4 Since then, several firms have started to use big data to perform network analysis to understand how culture is transmitted through an organization. Others have further honed their ability to gather qualitative data and interpret it in new ways.\n\nThere is a greater recognition that there are no simple and straightforward metrics to tell them where they stand vis-\u00e0-vis cultural capital.5 Rather, these firms are regularly experimenting with new ways to identify patterns within complex systems that are continuously evolving. A number of firms have recognized that the data they gather must be contextualized. Cultural capital is not a single statistic; one part of a firm could have generous stores of it, while another department or geography requires more focused investment and attention.\n\nFrom the accumulation perspective, building cultural capital means investing in the way the organization approaches everything it does, including defining its purpose, setting its business strategy and risk appetite, training, communications, decision-making, prioritization, compensation practices, and how employees are incented to interact with colleagues, clients, and customers. A critical part of sustained investment is that business leaders and boards of directors see it as their responsibility to set the tone from the top. Modelling the desired behaviors sets a powerful example and serves as a form of behavioral risk mitigation. All of these actions reflect choices that a firm makes, either implicitly or explicitly, that can build cultural capital.\n\nOn the other hand, cultural capital can also decline or deteriorate as a result of internal choices. For example, overt incidences of misconduct such as a trading scandal or a legal issue, deviations between employees' actual experiences and a firms' stated values, or observations of inappropriate behavior that is tolerated or even rewarded can all contribute to the depreciation of a firm's cultural capital. This decline can be self-reinforcing as certain behaviors are rewarded and individuals advance in an organization, or the composition of the workforce changes as employees choose to work at firms with higher cultural capital.\n\nThe Pandemic's Impact on Cultural Capital\n\nWhile the discussion so far has focused on how internal choices that a firm or its employees make can impact cultural capital, it is equally true that external factors have the potential to have a similar impact. For example, changes to social norms around what constitutes acceptable workplace practices can alter behavioral norms inside a firm. The nation-wide racial justice movement is another example of an external factor that could impact the internal culture, based on the choices a firm makes in its response.\n\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic will also surely impact cultural capital in unpredictable and enduring ways. Since March, our world and the financial industry have changed before our eyes. Our workplaces were transformed overnight from offices to our homes. Our office mates now include our spouses, kids, and roommates. And, our colleagues became voices on the other ends of our phones or faces on our screens.\n\nWhat does all of this externally-driven change do to a firm's culture? In the early days of the pandemic, the financial industry and the official sector responded quickly and forcefully to ensure that the provision of critical financial services continued despite the tragic health crisis, significant economic and financial uncertainty, and substantial operational challenges. Many were focused on solving the immediate problems and figuring out how to work remotely. This proved surprisingly effective, at least in the short run.\n\nFrom the perspective of cultural capital, this sudden and dramatic shift in how we work raises multiple questions. First, how does cultural capital influence outcomes in this new environment? How are we drawing on, or depleting, the cultural capital that already existed? Does this environment pose new challenges regarding behavioral risk? And finally, is it possible to identify new opportunities to build cultural capital in a predominately remote environment?\n\nAs we look across the industry, hear the experiences of firms and read the emerging literature, like the recent report by the UK FCA, one can identify factors that are likely to impact, and possibly erode, cultural capital. 6 I'll outline several areas where these dynamics may be at play, including loss of personal interactions, severed networks, uncertainty, and decreased monitoring and oversight.\n\nLack of personal interaction. The first dynamic is lack of personal interaction, which is critical to forming trusting relationships. As trust, a cornerstone of a good culture, is built through frequent interactions and reliable behavior, the lack of personal interaction at the workplace has the potential to weaken trust between colleagues, within teams, and across organizations.7 Trust is a complex human emotion that allows individuals to have faith in colleagues to do the right thing and not cause harm.8 Is it possible to sustain this 'trust' in colleagues as frequency of interactions decrease and the format of interactions make personal bonding more challenging?\n\nWhile it may still be too early to understand the long-term impact of a fully-remote staffing model on trust, it is interesting to note that over the last few years, a number of large firms that had favored a highly remote workforce, including Yahoo and IBM, had begun to reverse course, asking employees to return to the office to increase personal interaction and collaboration.9 We can perhaps learn by comparing firms that intentionally transitioned to a virtual work environment with limited personal interactions, to those that relied heavily on personal interactions and were forced into a fully remote posture. Indeed, we will explore how proximity impacts trust as part of a panel on trust and decision-making that I'm moderating on December 2 for the New York Fed.\n\nSevered networks. The second dynamic is severed personal networks. Beyond formal networks and hierarchy within an organization, the value of informal networks should not be underestimated. As I mentioned, the financial sector has been quite effective in maintaining core services and operations during the pandemic so far. One hypothesis is that this success reflects, in part, the development of personal relationships, teams, and networks over years, and possibly decades. As people came together during the initial months on the pandemic, it is likely that they relied on their existing networks and leveraged the strength of existing relationships.\n\nWith the elimination of impromptu, spontaneous interactions over coffee, in elevators, and unplanned encounters, organizations need to understand the impact on communication, collaboration, innovation, and comradery. Will networks and relationships depreciate? Is there a heightened risk of silos? Are there missed opportunities for creativity in problem solving? Are there insights and knowledge being overlooked? And how do all these influence dialogue, debate and ultimately outcomes in the organization?\n\nUncertainty. The third dynamic is uncertainty. As many industries and organizations face unprecedented businesses challenges, we know that employees are also facing unique personal challenges related to their health, well-being and job security, both for themselves and their families. While we understand that this level of uncertainty can be paralyzing for individuals,10 we should also be asking how this level of persistent and profound uncertainty may impact a firm's culture. One potential risk is the potential for \"action bias.\" When feeling out of control due to the uncertainty of the environment, people are more likely to act quickly. They do this to feel as though they \"did something about\" an issue when in fact, more thought and analysis would result in a better business outcome.11 Even for organizations that are not as directly impacted by the pandemic, thought should be given to how uncertainty about personal and professional circumstances impacts decision making, relationships, and behaviors in the workplace.\n\nDecreased monitoring/oversight. The final dynamic is monitoring and oversight. Both internal and external monitoring and oversight play an important role in ensuring behavioral norms are maintained, sound processes and procedures are being followed, and there is open communications across reporting lines. Limited contact with managers and leaders within the organization has the potential to leave employees lacking clear guidance, feeling isolated, and willing to take on more risk. In large complex organizations, this is also likely to vary across business lines, heightening the need for clear and consistent leadership and guidance from multiple levels within the organization.\n\nIn response to these dynamics, we have seen financial firms take a number of steps over the past few months focused on mitigating behavioral risk associated with the pandemic and working remotely. For example, some firms have leveraged prominent instances of misconduct and customer abuses of coronavirus relief programs to reiterate clear expectations and standards around integrity and personal accountability for employee actions. Others have intentionally placed cultural leaders over businesses in need of a stronger control environment. This indicates that the pandemic may be leading to opportunities to grow cultural capital, or at least ensure practices are in place to ensure it is not eroded.\n\nFinally, perhaps the experience of shared uncertainty could have a positive impact on culture, particularly with respect to fostering greater empathy. I've certainly seen examples within my own organization of people stepping up when colleagues that are under greater personal pressure need more time to manage their external commitments. There has been much greater openness and vulnerability among work colleagues \u2013 and greater vulnerability tends to encourage higher levels of trust. We should all be thinking about how to ensure that we seize the opportunity to \"bake in\" these positive changes.\n\nConclusions\n\nTo conclude, as we look back on the past eight months and begin building the next normal, I think that the idea of cultural capital will prove to be enduring. The ways in which firms might invest in their culture will undoubtedly change in the new work environment and we'll learn more about the long-term impact of the pandemic, but the basic ideas that culture influences business outcomes, that firms can build their culture through purposeful investment, and that culture can depreciate if left unattended will likely persist.\n\nTo better understand this evolution, we should begin by examining each of the factors that determine a firm's culture, pre-pandemic and post-pandemic, and identify the likelihood of events or practices that have the potential to build or erode their cultural capital.\n\nThank you for your attention."

    "date": "Nov 10, 2020",
    "speaker": "Kevin Stiroh",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2020/sti201110",
    "content": "Introduction\n\nGood morning and thank you for the opportunity to participate in GARP's 2020 Climate Risk Symposium. As shown by the strong turnout today, attention on climate-related financial risks is clearly growing within finance, both for the private sector and the public sector.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll speak about these risks from a microprudential perspective\u2014that is, the impact on specific financial institutions, particularly banks, and how firms are managing those risks. I\u2019ll also provide a short update on some of the work under way through the Basel Committee\u2019s Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Risks\u2014the TFCR.\n\nBefore proceeding, I\u2019ll emphasize that I am speaking only for myself and not necessarily the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nRisk Management Perspective\n\nFrom a supervisory perspective, a primary focus is to ensure that banks operate in a safe and sound manner and manage risks so they are resilient to a range of shocks. As you know, the core of effective risk management includes identifying, measuring, and managing traditional banking risks like credit risk, market risk, operational risk, or liquidity risks. These risks can materialize from a range of shocks\u2014a recession, a geopolitical event, or a bad actor. And climate change. The purpose of bank supervision is to ensure that supervised firms are resilient to all of these risks.1\n\nBanks are becoming increasingly attuned to the heightened financial risks from a changing climate. These risks can manifest in a number of ways: the impairment of collateral due to severe weather events; mark-to-market losses from the devaluation of companies with stranded assets; stress to contractual cash flows as regional shocks are realized; or the reduced provision of financial services as business strategies adapt. All of these are salient concerns for financial firms and their supervisors.\n\nFinancial firms are now incorporating these risks into existing risks management frameworks. Many firms view climate change as a cross-cutting risk driver that spans familiar risk categories, broadly affecting risk management approaches. Moreover, some firms are considering governance issues, the use of scenarios analysis, disclosure options, and thinking about the strategic implications of a transition to a more sustainable economy. Understanding the impact of climate change, however, comes with significant challenges including the long time horizon, data gaps, the need for new model development, inherent complexity and fundamental uncertainty. All of this suggests that there is much work ahead of us.\n\nTaskforce on Climate-Related Financial Risks\n\nJust as banks are building awareness of climate-related risks, the supervisory community is similarly developing capacity in this area. I will now turn my attention to the specific work of the Basel Committee\u2019s Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Risks (TFCR).2 The Committee has noted that climate change may result in physical and transition risks that could impact the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions and have broader financial stability implications for the banking system. In response, the Committee established the TFCR to undertake work on climate-related financial risks in February of 2020. I am acting as a co-chair of the Task Force, along with Frank Elderson, Executive Director of Supervision at the Netherlands Bank.\n\nIn the first phase of work, the TFCR conducted a stock-take of members\u2019 existing regulatory and supervisory initiatives on climate-related financial risks.3 This work highlighted the increasing focus on climate-related risks. To take the work forward, the TFCR is following a gradual and sequential approach from a banking supervisory perspective with a current focus on understanding climate risk transmission channels, as well as methodologies for measuring and assessing these risks. The TFCR plans to complete these fundamental research initiatives by mid-2021.\n\nBuilding on this analytical work, the TFCR will then consider the extent to which climate-related financial risks are incorporated in the existing Basel Framework and identify effective supervisory practices to mitigate such risks. The TFCR does not currently have a view on potential prudential treatments or supervisory expectations related to the mitigation of climate-related financial risks.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe financial sector has taken important steps toward incorporating the financial risks of climate change into risk management frameworks, strategic discussions, and oversight regimes, but I think it is fair to say that this work is still in its early days. We all have much to learn with many challenges ahead of us.\n\nMy perspective reflects, in part, the observation that understanding the impact of climate change from a risk management perspective is both a complex problem and a complicated one.4 It is complex in the sense of many interconnections and feedback loops; the likely existence of non-linearities and tipping points; and massive uncertainty about key factors like the timing of climate impacts, policy choices, technological change, and adaptive responses by consumers and businesses. All of this tests our capacity to understand and manage the risks. At the same time, this is a complicated undertaking from an implementation perspective. Success will require us to process and analyze vast amounts of granular data and aggregate across business lines, sectors, and jurisdictions; to implement new governance and organizational structures; and to invest in our workforce to develop new skills and new expertise.\n\nIn my view, these challenges are not a reason for a cautious approach, but rather a clear signal about the scale of the work to be done. Our shared success will depend on meaningful investments to build capacity and develop new tools, a willingness to innovate and look beyond traditional approaches, and an unwavering commitment to the public good. In particular, I think it will require ongoing collaboration between the private and public sectors to push the industry toward greater resilience to the financial risks of climate change. Discussions like this one are a critical step in that direction.\n\nThank you for your attention."

    "title": "Treasury Market Liquidity and Early Lessons from the Pandemic Shock",
    "date": "Oct 23, 2020",
    "speaker": "Unknown",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2020/log201023",
    "content": "Good morning, and thank you to the Brookings Institution-Chicago Booth Task Force on Financial Stability for convening this discussion on such a critical topic. This has been a year marked by tremendous human suffering related to the pandemic and unprecedented challenges for the global economy and financial markets. The events that unfolded in March and April underscored the importance of understanding market functioning and liquidity so that financial markets continue to serve their important role in supporting the economy.1\n\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the global financial system experienced an extraordinary shock, triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. Asset prices adjusted sharply, reflecting increasing pessimism and uncertainty about the economic outlook as large segments of the economy began to shut down. A spike in financial market volatility, combined with concerns about markets\u2019 ability to function in a remote work environment, resulted in a surge in the demand for cash.\n\nThe Federal Reserve took swift and decisive action in response to both the shift in the economic outlook and deteriorating conditions in financial markets.2 The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) cut the target range for the federal funds rate close to zero, and directed the Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) to conduct repo operations and purchases of Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to support the smooth functioning of these markets. The Federal Reserve undertook a wide range of additional steps\u2014many in coordination with the U.S. Treasury\u2014to support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments. Regulations were also temporarily adjusted to encourage bank lending. These comprehensive actions, alongside swift passage of the CARES Act to support the U.S. economy, were essential for stabilizing U.S. financial markets and averting an even deeper collapse in economic activity.\n\nThe disruption in the U.S. Treasury market was especially notable, as measures of market functioning deteriorated at unparalleled speed to levels not seen since the Global Financial Crisis. The Treasury market is the deepest and most liquid fixed-income market in the world. It serves as a critical benchmark for all other dollar fixed-income markets, both in the U.S. and abroad, including the mortgage, corporate debt, and municipal bond markets that are essential to the flow of credit. Given the importance of the Treasury market, continued dysfunction could have led to an even deeper and broader seizing-up of credit and ultimately worsened the economic hardships that many Americans have been experiencing.\n\nThe Desk initially responded to the severe dysfunction by expanding repo operations, and then, at the direction of the FOMC, by buying a substantial quantity of Treasury securities and agency MBS. The FOMC then demonstrated a more forceful commitment by directing the Desk to purchase these securities \u201cin the amounts needed\u201d to support smooth functioning of these markets. The speed and scale of these actions\u2014and the flexibility with which they were deployed\u2014stabilized and eventually restored market functioning, and in June the FOMC transitioned the objective of purchases to sustaining smooth market functioning. During the period from March to June, the Federal Reserve purchased a total of around $1.6 trillion of Treasuries and $700 billion of agency MBS, as shown in Figure 1.3\n\nIn recent months, the public and private sectors initiated broad-based efforts to better understand the dynamics that led to the Treasury market dislocation in March and April. Ongoing research is helping shape our views of what happened, and last month the New York Fed, along with other Joint Member Agencies, co-hosted the sixth annual U.S. Treasury Market Conference.4 Participants focused on the causes of the Treasury market disruption and potential measures that could be taken to ensure the market\u2019s resilience going forward.\n\nToday, I want to share some observations from our experience executing open market operations on the Desk during this period, and from the developing body of research and discussions. I would note that the views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the New York Fed or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhat Have I Taken Away from the Data and Research So Far?\n\nData and developing research offer perspective on important elements of the events of last spring. Though many aspects of what occurred warrant further study, I would like to focus my remarks on insights that the data and research provide about the exceptional desire to sell Treasury securities, and the capacity of the Treasury market infrastructure to manage these flows.\n\nOn the Desk, we certainly heard from our contacts and observed in the data available to us at the time that there was an extraordinary volume of selling by Treasury investors. Since then, data have confirmed that the size of those sales was unprecedented. As shown in Figure 2, customer transaction volumes reported by primary dealers spiked from an average level of around $400 billion per day in February to a peak of around $650 billion per day in mid-March\u2014an increase of more than 50 percent. The more granular data from the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) confirm that the size of the risk being transferred was exceptional. The top half of Figure 3 shows the volume of daily customer sales of off-the-run Treasury securities expressed in \u201c10-year equivalents,\u201d a measure of the dollar amount of securities normalized by their interest rate risk.5 The bottom half shows customer purchases, net of the Federal Reserve\u2019s purchases. The difference between these, in red, highlights the extraordinary degree of market liquidity being demanded by customers.\n\nWe also observed in March and April that these sales of Treasury securities were coming from a wide range of investors. While some commentary since then has focused on the role of certain investor types and strategies, recent data and work by academics help to dimension the broad-based nature of the selling.6\n\nMutual funds appear to have sold in exceptionally large volumes, as these funds monetized their most liquid asset holdings to prepare for potential redemptions and rebalance their portfolios. As shown in Figure 4, net sales of Treasuries by domestic mutual funds totaled almost $200 billion in the first quarter, the largest quarterly decline on record.7\n\nForeign official accounts, some of which were raising funds to meet actual and anticipated local needs for U.S. dollars, were also large net sellers, as shown by data from official accounts held at the New York Fed depicted in Figure 5. According to data from the Federal Reserve\u2019s Financial Accounts of the United States, shown in Figure 6, foreign accounts, both official and private, sold a meaningful amount of Treasuries in the first quarter, although these data also include funds that operate in the U.S. but are domiciled offshore.\n\nThere has been significant attention on hedge fund sales of Treasury securities, and whether these amplified the stresses in the Treasury market. We heard in March and April that the sharp increase in volatility and futures margins resulted in relative value funds and other levered strategies reducing their positions.8 According to the U.S. Financial Accounts data, net sales of Treasury securities by households\u2014a category that includes private investors domiciled in the U.S.\u2014were notable in the first quarter, shown in Figure 7.9 We also observed that the reduction in net short positions in Treasury futures held by levered accounts accelerated sharply in March, as shown in Figure 8. Some research papers attribute a significant degree of the stress to hedge funds unwinding cash-futures basis positions, while others question whether these strategies were a meaningful contributor to the dynamics.10 This is difficult to judge, in large part because the available data on hedge fund holdings and transactions are incomplete. In the context of broad-based selling pressure, though, I think of these sales as an important contributing factor, but not the sole source of the challenges.\n\nIn addition to giving greater insight into the historic size and breadth of sales, data and recent research shed light on how the Treasury market responded to these extraordinary flows.\n\nBefore diving into this, I\u2019d like to start with some background on the ecosystem of Treasury market intermediation. Broadly speaking, trading takes place in two separate but connected market segments: the dealer-to-client segment, where dealers transact with end-investors, and the interdealer segment, which is generally comprised of dealers and principal trading firms, or \u201cPTFs,\u201d trading with one another in the most liquid securities and largely on electronic limit order books.11 The interdealer segment is critical to the intermediation process, as it allows participants to manage risk and adjust positions rapidly and serves as an important source of price discovery in Treasuries. These features support the intermediation of customer flows and the smooth functioning of the Treasury market overall.12\n\nOur observations in March and April were that these intermediation channels became highly strained. The data show that dealers entered March with inventories of Treasury securities that were already high by historical standards, and, as depicted in Figure 9, those inventories grew as investors sold securities. Our conversations with dealers suggest that, amid a sharp increase in perceived risk, it became increasingly challenging to hold these positions and absorb new ones. In March, volatility in Treasury markets soared to levels not seen since the Global Financial Crisis, as shown in Figure 10.13 Heightened volatility increases the risk that dealers face in intermediating markets, as prices have greater potential to move during the period between the purchase and sale of securities. In this environment, dealers noted that risk measures rose sharply, and many suggested that internal risk management processes developed to ensure compliance with regulations limited the nimbleness with which they could respond to rapidly evolving circumstances.\n\nIn an environment of extraordinary volatility and large Treasury sales, the terms on which dealers were willing to make markets deteriorated sharply. For example, in less liquid off-the-run Treasury securities, bid-ask spreads, which are a measure of the price that investors pay to transact, rose to almost 30 times their normal levels and reached historic wides, as shown in Figure 11.\n\nDeteriorating conditions in the interdealer market likely exacerbated the challenges that dealers faced providing market liquidity to their customers by limiting their ability to efficiently manage risk. As highlighted in a recent note by Federal Reserve economists Dobrislav Dobrev and Andrew Meldrum, market depth in on-the-run Treasury securities fell dramatically compared to typical levels, and standing orders near the top of the order book on electronic systems were not replenished rapidly enough to keep pace with increased trading volumes. Figure 12, reproduced from their note, illustrates this sharp drop in market depth, showing the top level and top three levels of the order book on a normal day, on the left, and on a highly stressed day in mid-March, on the right.14, 15 Liquidity providers in this market\u2014both dealers and PTFs\u2014faced high and unpredictable volatility and flows that made it riskier to maintain or quickly restore standing orders. Overall, PTFs, which are more thinly capitalized and do not typically hold positions overnight, appear to have reduced the competitiveness of their intermediation to a somewhat greater degree, as their share of transaction volume fell, depicted in Figure 13.16\n\nNonetheless, it seems important to note that while the terms on which Treasuries were intermediated deteriorated dramatically, a much higher-than-normal volume of private transactions still occurred. So, while liquidity was severely strained, the volume that intermediaries were managing was still quite high, even in the less liquid market segments such as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and off-the-run Treasury securities.\n\nIn sum, I interpret the work to date as confirming our observations at the time that unprecedented demand for cash led to selling that was historic in size and broad-based in nature. Intermediation activity expanded, but was unable to keep pace, and the market came under severe strain. As a result, the Fed stepped in to buy securities at unprecedented scale and speed, ultimately restoring and sustaining effective market functioning.\n\nWhat Ideas Have Been Raised That Could Make the Market More Resilient?\n\nAt the U.S. Treasury Market Conference, there was an insightful and robust discussion among industry professionals, academics, and policymakers about Treasury market resilience.17 While participants acknowledged that there is still much more to learn about the events of March and April, many shared early ideas on how the resiliency of this critical market might be enhanced over time.\n\nFinancial markets are always evolving in response to changes in the environment, including technology, regulation, and business models. Participants at the conference noted that, in recent years, we have seen substantial growth in the share of electronic intermediation, significant changes in the regulation of key intermediaries, and a meaningful shift in both the outstanding size and holders of Treasury debt.\n\nParticipants highlighted how each of these has brought substantive benefits, but may also present new considerations. Increased volume of electronic trading on central limit order books has contributed to reductions in transaction costs and lowered barriers to entry for new liquidity providers. However, available liquidity can diminish in highly volatile markets, as market makers manage risk and may have less relationship incentive to maintain liquidity provision on anonymous platforms. Regulations have enhanced financial stability by making banks and their broker-dealers more resilient, but conference participants suggested that the manner in which firms implement regulations may reduce their flexibility to respond to rapidly evolving conditions.\n\nFinally, participants highlighted that growth in Treasury issuance has been essential for the U.S. government to support U.S. households and businesses during the pandemic, but, as Darrell Duffie noted in a recent paper, ongoing increases in the stock of Treasuries may result in greater peaks in the demand for intermediation.18 These peaks may be amplified by the reliance of some investors on Treasuries to provide liquidity in portfolios with natural liquidity mismatches, and by the use of leverage in some Treasury investment strategies.19\n\nI was pleased that conference participants also offered some early ideas for enhancing the resiliency of the Treasury market in this evolving environment. Of course, given the complexity associated with changes to Treasury market infrastructure, I would highlight that these ideas are preliminary and all would require further analysis.\n\nFirst, several conference participants suggested that, while Treasury market data has improved markedly in recent years, continuing to enhance transparency could bolster confidence in the ability to transact fairly, particularly in volatile markets.20 For repo markets, providing public data on the opaque uncleared bilateral segment could improve visibility into the size of levered Treasury positions, and data on term repo might give market participants more confidence in pricing. In the Treasury cash market, continuing to refine and increase the availability of the TRACE data would improve our understanding of the market, including the types and prevalence of trading strategies and the methods of execution.21\n\nSecond, conference participants suggested ways to increase the capacity for and flexibility of liquidity provision, so the market can manage peaks in liquidity demand. Expanding access to trading venues and central clearing were both highlighted as potential ideas. Increased central clearing can help market participants manage settlement risk and facilitate more efficient balance sheet usage, and may also pave the way for more direct trading among Treasury market participants.22, 23 Separately, several conference participants thought it might be helpful to explore whether adjustments to certain regulations might enhance banks\u2019 flexibility, while still maintaining their resiliency.\n\nThird, and finally, participants highlighted steps that could help stem the volume of sales during periods of high volatility and stress. Several indicated that greater uniformity or enhanced transparency in margin practices could reduce the need for funds employing certain levered trading strategies to unwind positions amid higher volatility. In addition, some thought further study may be warranted on the role of nonbank financial institutions in this market. With regard to the Federal Reserve, participants suggested that existing repo backstops could be fortified, as these facilities provide confidence in the liquidity of Treasuries, thus reducing the need for outright Treasury sales during stress events.24\n\nConclusion\n\nIn sum, the pandemic created exceptional uncertainty about the economic outlook and concern about financial market functioning, resulting in an intense demand for cash. This desire to raise cash rapidly, combined with extraordinary financial market volatility, resulted in an unprecedented volume of Treasury sales and stresses in the Treasury market. In response, the Federal Reserve stepped in to support the smooth functioning of this vital market in order to maintain the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.\n\nThis was truly an exceptional event. However, while it is tempting to dismiss it as a once-in-a-lifetime shock, it is important to take time to reflect and assess if lessons can be learned that could make the Treasury market even more resilient to future shocks. The situations that require policy intervention should be extraordinarily rare.\n\nIn this regard, I have been heartened by the energy that academics, industry professionals, and public sector officials have brought to understanding the underlying drivers of the stress in March and April. The developing research and discussions are already producing vital insights, and I encourage continued engagement on these issues. I also look forward to working together with other agencies and industry professionals to explore ways to enhance the resilience of the U.S. Treasury market, so that it continues to be the deepest and most liquid fixed-income market in the world.\n\nThank you, and I look forward to the discussion.\n\nFigures"

    "content": "Thank you, Tom, for the invitation to join this event.\n\nAs all of you know, in March the Federal Reserve\u2014with backing from the U.S. Treasury\u2014created a set of facilities to purchase corporate credit for the first time in its history. Many observers have credited the facilities with repairing market functioning in the corporate bond market and restoring the ability of many businesses to finance themselves through the pandemic. But my focus today is not the corporate bond market, credit spreads, or Wall Street. Rather, I\u2019d like to connect the dots by explaining why these facilities were necessary to support jobs and the economic recovery on Main Street, and why transparency, access, and accountability were so critical to their implementation.\n\nBefore I review the initial success of these programs, I want to acknowledge the painful realities that many firms, employees, and households continue to face. For millions of Americans, it\u2019s a long road back to normal.\n\nI should also make it clear that these remarks are my personal views and not necessarily those of the New York Fed or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nThe Shock to U.S. Businesses and Employees\n\nLet\u2019s start with some context and recall why unprecedented action was necessary in March.\n\nAmid a synchronized global demand shock of uncertain length and severity, access to credit takes on outsized importance. Companies that issue public bonds and commercial paper depend on financing to make investments and meet their obligations, including payrolls, and together likely account for nearly one-fourth of all U.S. private sector employment and just under 50 percent of U.S. output.2 Even companies that do not themselves have public bonds are closely linked through the supply chain, as they receive trade credit from or sell to large corporate bond issuers. Research suggests that shocks impacting large businesses spill over to smaller firms, perhaps accounting for 10 percent of the reduction in employment at small firms during the last recession.3\n\nThe unusually high level of uncertainty about the pandemic shock was reflected in the functioning of markets that finance large U.S. employers. Market liquidity\u2014the conditions under which companies\u2019 debt is issued and traded\u2014rapidly deteriorated to levels experienced during the Global Financial Crisis. Even for investment-grade companies, the cost of debt skyrocketed to five times pre-pandemic levels. At the height of the strain, many companies lost access even to short-term financing, and issuance of longer-term corporate bonds declined precipitously. From late February through early March, overall corporate issuance dropped 60 percent year-over-year, with virtually no new issues pricing on several consecutive days.\n\nFirms that could not access capital markets were at risk of being weakened irreparably. As revenues fell and without access to capital markets, companies initially relied on cash buffers and drew down relatively expensive bank-funded credit lines.4 Markets quickly priced in dire outcomes from the unfolding credit crunch. As one illustration, nearly $500 billion of high-yield bonds\u2014or about 40 percent of outstanding issues\u2014were trading at distressed levels in mid-March.5 Considering that corporate bonds typically include cross-default provisions\u2014where a default on one bond issue triggers defaults on all of a company\u2019s outstanding debt\u2014the total amount of public bond claims that could have entered bankruptcy was several multiples of this amount.\n\nWith widespread financial disruptions threatening to spill over into the real economy and putting millions of jobs at risk, a bold and aggressive policy response was required.6\n\nEnter the Corporate Credit Facilities\n\nOn March 23, the Federal Reserve, with support from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, announced a broad set of emergency lending facilities, including the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility (PMCCF) and the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF)\u2014together, the CCFs.\n\nThe ultimate goal of these facilities was to provide a bridge for U.S. companies and their employees to the other side of the pandemic shock. To achieve this goal, it was critical to provide broad support for both the primary market\u2014where companies access credit\u2014and the secondary market\u2014where the debt of large U.S. companies trades. These two markets are linked: the pricing of corporate debt traded in the secondary market informs the cost of financing for newly-issued debt.\n\nThe two facilities differ in terms of mechanics. With the PMCCF, companies must approach the Federal Reserve to finance or participate in the issuance of new bonds. The PMCCF is designed to be a backstop and is priced at a premium to market rates.\n\nBy contrast, purchases through the SMCCF are not initiated by companies. Instead, we purchase small and proportional amounts of outstanding debt of eligible companies at fair market value in the secondary market to provide broad support to the credit market.\n\nIn executing secondary market purchases, we take our cues from market functioning. Our staff conducts rigorous monitoring of credit market conditions, as well as broad outreach to understand the nuances of market dynamics. The pace of SMCCF purchases is dependent on measures of market functioning and market volumes. For a given level of market stress, we set our purchase pace as a share of market volume. The percentage of market volume that we purchase each day is based on a broad set of market functioning indicators that measure the issuance and trading of debt. When there are market disruptions, as in March, the deterioration in liquidity emerges in a number ways, including higher transaction costs and higher volatility.7 Purchases increase during periods of high trading volume (which often coincide with an uptick of market stress) and are dialed back when trading volume is low to ensure we do not crowd out private investors.\n\nThe purchase framework also adjusts the instruments employed according to market functioning. We initially executed in the secondary market by purchasing U.S.-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As direct bond purchases came online and market functioning improved, we scaled back our ETF purchases and stopped buying ETFs altogether in late July. If market stress were to return and our purchase pace were to increase, we would initially focus our support primarily through direct purchases of corporate bonds. And in a scenario of significant market stress, we could buy both bonds and ETFs. By varying both the amount and type of purchases, we are able to provide flexible support to the market.\n\nDesign Matters\n\nLet me now highlight several design features of these facilities that proved critical to their impact.\n\nFirst, the facilities were large enough to demonstrate the Federal Reserve\u2019s resolve in putting a floor on the pandemic\u2019s impact on credit markets. Indeed, the PMCCF and SMCCF have a combined capacity of up to $750 billion\u2014equal to about eight months of investment-grade corporate bond issuance at the pre-pandemic pace.\n\nSecond, close coordination with the U.S. Treasury acted as a force multiplier. The equity committed by the U.S. Treasury facilitated broad support for large employers.8 The facilities\u2019 combined capacity leveraged Treasury\u2019s committed equity contribution of $75 billion by up to 10 times.\n\nThird, the support provided by the facilities is broad. Excluding banks, all U.S. domiciled firms with an investment-grade rating prior to the facilities\u2019 announcement were eligible, thus concentrating support for firms that primarily faced liquidity strains due to the pandemic. The facilities also provide support for firms with ratings just below investment grade to mitigate the \u201ccliff effects\u201d at the boundary of our support.9 Together, these programs backstop about 80 percent of corporate bonds outstanding, excluding those issued by banks.10\n\nFinally, policymakers signaled their willingness to adapt. Even before purchases began, the size of the equity injection and purchasing power of the facility was increased, and the scope was broadened to allow support for \u201cfallen angels,\u201d or bonds downgraded below investment grade (but no lower than BB-) after the CCF announcement.\n\nImplementation Matters\n\nIn addition to program design, the principles that guided the implementation of these facilities\u2014access, transparency, and accountability\u2014reinforced their credibility and impact.\n\nProviding broad access to the facilities for corporate borrowers was essential, both to expand the reach of backstop support for the economy, and to ensure that the facilities avoid the allocation of credit.\n\nOur initial purchases were in a diversified set of ETFs that provide broad exposure to the market for U.S. corporate bonds. Purchasing via ETFs offered efficient and rapid transmission of broad-based support to the secondary market. At the outset of these purchases, we communicated that ETFs would only be used if their purchase is reasonably expected to achieve the objectives of the SMCCF more effectively than the purchase of underlying bonds.11\n\nOne month after starting ETF purchases, the Federal Reserve announced a framework to use corporate bonds as the SMCCF\u2019s primary vehicle for providing support. In preparation, we had created a \u201cBroad Market Index\u201d of eligible corporate bonds, weighted proportionately by amount of debt outstanding from individual companies.12 We then began purchasing bonds across the index in a rules-based manner, taking care that our purchases are neutral toward eligible sectors and companies. I should note that in making an assessment of credit eligibility, we broadened our use of ratings to include perspectives from all Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations.\n\nProviding broad access also applies to the service providers that support the facilities. In early September, we announced the expansion of counterparties to the SMCCF, including several smaller and minority-owned broker-dealers.13 In early October, we announced the launch of our process to re-bid our engagement with the facility\u2019s investment manager. This process has begun with the CCF cash management role, and in the coming weeks and months we will re-bid the remainder of the role. Together, these efforts allow us to expand the reach of our operations while making tangible progress on our commitments to diversity and inclusion, including to minority-, women-, and veteran-owned firms.\n\nLet me now turn to transparency and accountability. In the spirit of these principles, we have reported to the public in near real-time our market activity, including the details of every SMCCF transaction. Our holdings are publicly reported on a weekly basis through the Fed\u2019s H.4.1 release. Every month the Fed publishes the full holdings in a detailed Congressional report. We also provide the attributes of the Broad Market Index, including detailed issuer-level weights.\n\nAside from portfolio activity, we have also disclosed the CCF\u2019s legal agreements. On the New York Fed\u2019s website, you can find all documentation with the Department of Treasury that governs the operation of the facilities, as well as all contracts with external vendors. On the latter, we remain committed to disclosing all fees to service providers as they are paid.\n\nImpact on Credit Conditions\n\nAs you all know, corporate credit conditions have recovered substantially from the worst strains of March. Research from the New York Fed estimates that, within the first three months following the CCF announcement, credit spreads retraced about 90 percent toward pre-pandemic levels, with two-thirds of the improvement occurring on facility announcement dates (i.e., before purchases even began), and that half of the improvement in bid-ask spreads since the peak in March occurred on the initial announcement date itself.14 This provides strong evidence that the market found credible the design the CCFs, as well as the Federal Reserve\u2019s commitment to following through.\n\nImprovements in secondary market conditions pass through to corporate borrowing costs in two ways: directly through borrowing rates that are benchmarked to secondary market yields of similar bonds, and indirectly by increasing the willingness of dealers to underwrite bond issuance.\n\nAnd this is precisely what we\u2019ve observed. Since the CCF announcement, firms have raised about $1.5 trillion in the corporate bond market from investors, or about double last year\u2019s pace. Companies have raised new funds and refinanced maturing debt, helping them to maintain their operations and payrolls and build liquidity buffers against continued uncertainty.\n\nImportantly, the dramatic improvements in credit conditions have come despite an extremely small CCF footprint that has decreased over time. On account of healthy primary markets, the PMCCF has yet to be tapped. And since mid-May, when we began SMCCF purchases, the pace of our buying has fallen steadily in response to improvements in market functioning. In May and June we purchased about $300 million per day, or about one percent of average daily trading volume in the secondary market, and that pace declined to about $20 million per day by September, or less than 0.1 percent. Currently, the SMCCF holds about $13 billion of overall exposure across corporate bonds and corporate bond ETFs. This is less than 0.2 percent of the outstanding bonds in this $8.7 trillion market.15\n\nAs we\u2019ve said previously, if further improvement in market functioning occurs, we could slow SMCCF purchases further and potentially pause daily purchases entirely. Conversely, if market functioning measures indicate deterioration, the SMCCF remains available to ramp up support.\n\nDespite the small footprint of the CCFs, we know the signaling effects have been potent\u2014indeed, this is the main channel through which these facilities have had an impact\u2014and we remain watchful for the risk of creating distortions. One possibility could be that companies issue shorter maturities than they would otherwise to benefit from presence of the CCF backstop. So far, we see no evidence of this behavior; if anything, there has been a tendency toward refinancing maturing debt at longer tenors.16 Another distortion could be excessive amounts of corporate debt issuance based on future expectations of an official sector backstop. This \u201cmoral hazard\u201d risk will bear watching over the coming years, but there are at least a couple of reasons to believe it\u2019s muted in the current circumstance. For one thing, global pandemics are an extremely infrequent occurrence. For another, backstop support from the CCFs has been restricted to investment-grade issuers and fallen angels, thus limiting the incentive to overleverage.17\n\nConnecting the Dots\n\nTo conclude, I\u2019d like to turn from the execution details of these programs to the bigger picture of outcomes in the economy. As I noted at the outset of my remarks, the linkages between capital markets and employment are critical to understanding the purpose of the CCFs. Large companies rely on capital markets to secure ongoing financing to maintain their businesses and meet payrolls. By supporting companies\u2019 access to funding, firms employing millions of Americans are in a better position to keep workers on payrolls and to hire them back as the economy continues to recover.\n\nLet me make three observations in this regard.\n\nFirst, companies that issue public bonds tend to be large employers. U.S. companies with bonds that were due to mature this year and next employ more than 21 million people. Those that have accessed corporate bond markets since March employ more than 16 million people. Without seeking to minimize the stress on those households that have experienced unemployment, I want to highlight that the vast majority of jobs at large corporations have been maintained.\n\nSecond, companies that issue public bonds tend to generate large investments. U.S. companies with near-term bond maturities spent more than $1.1 trillion on capital expenditures last year, just over one-third of the total. This translates into spending that touches multitudes of other firms and their employees throughout the economy, including private and smaller firms.\n\nThird, the removal of tail outcomes in the credit markets matters for employment decisions. Researchers have documented this relationship through an association between credit market sentiment and employment forecasts.18 Holding all else equal, if excess credit risk premia remained at their March highs, the median payroll forecast as of the third quarter of 2020 would be lower by approximately 1.8 million jobs. Meanwhile, at the fifth percentile\u2014a proxy for the adverse tail scenario\u2014payrolls would be lower by seven million jobs.19\n\nYou might interpret these findings as a rough sketch of the counterfactual. Had we not provided a robust funding backstop, how many more companies would have shuttered operations and laid off workers, either out of necessity or out of caution? If companies had been unable to refinance maturing bonds, how would their defaults have cascaded through supply chains and employment outcomes?\n\nWe\u2019ll never know these counterfactual scenarios with precision. Suffice it to say, though, that considering the downside risks to the economy we faced in March, the CCF\u2019s $13 billion of purchases and committed backstops have provided enormous benefits to the country. Access to credit, economic output, and employment outcomes are intimately connected, and it was imperative that the Fed step in to prevent a negative spiral and provide a bridge to the recovery. As Chair Powell has noted, the Federal Reserve remains committed to using its full range of tools to support the economy for as long as is needed, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible.\n\nThank you."

    "date": "Oct 14, 2020",
    "speaker": "Kevin Stiroh",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2020/sti201014",
    "content": "Thank you for the invitation to participate in the 2020 IIF Annual Membership Meeting. I am pleased to share my perspective regarding the current regulatory and policy initiatives in the area of sustainable finance. My remarks are being made in my capacity as co-chair of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Risks (TFCR), which is part of the work of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. I should note that my prepared remarks and subsequent comments made as part of the panel discussion may not necessarily reflect the views of the Basel Committee or its members, or those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe Basel Committee's mandate is to strengthen the regulation, supervision and practices of banks worldwide with the purpose of enhancing financial stability. It is the primary global standard setter for the prudential regulation of banks and provides a forum for cooperation on banking supervisory matters. As part of its work, the Committee exchanges information on developments in the banking sector and financial markets to help identify current or emerging risks for the global financial system.\n\nThe Committee noted that climate change may result in physical and transition risks that could potentially impact the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions and have broader financial stability implications for the banking system.\n\nIn February 2020, the Basel Committee established the TFCR to undertake work on climate-related financial risks. I am acting as a co-chair of the task force, along with Frank Elderson, Executive Director of Supervision at the Netherlands Bank.\n\nIn the first phase of work, the TFCR conducted a stocktake of members' existing regulatory and supervisory initiatives on climate-related financial risks. The results of the stocktake were published in April 2020. I am pleased to share some of the key findings from that work.\n\nAll respondents noted that climate change may result in risks that could potentially have financial stability implications for the banking system. The majority of authorities considered it appropriate to address climate-related financial risks within their existing regulatory and supervisory framework. In addition, a large majority of members have conducted research related to the measurement of climate-related financial risks. At the same time, respondents identified a number of operational challenges in developing a robust framework to assess risks, including data gaps, methodological challenges and difficulties in mapping the transmission of climate risks to the banking system. The report also noted that a majority of authorities have taken measures to raise awareness of climate-related financial risks among banks. Approximately two fifths of members have issued, or are in the process of issuing, more principles-based guidance regarding climate-related financial risks. However, it is important to note that the majority of members have not factored, or have not yet considered factoring, the mitigation of such risks into the prudential capital framework.\n\nThe stocktake was conducted before the pandemic. After the Covid-19 outbreak, we understood that members needed to focus resources on addressing immediate financial stability priorities related to the pandemic. At the same time, Covid-19 further highlighted the importance of mitigating the risks of events with potentially severe global impacts. The Basel Committee is therefore continuing its work in this area.\n\nTo take the work forward, the TFCR is following a gradual and sequential approach from a banking supervisory perspective, with a current focus on understanding climate risk transmission channels as well as methodologies for measuring and assessing these risks. The TFCR plans to complete these fundamental research initiatives by mid-2021.\n\nBuilding on this analytical work, the TFCR will consider the extent to which climate-related financial risks are incorporated in the existing Basel Framework, and identify effective supervisory practices to mitigate such risks. The TFCR does not currently have a view on potential prudential treatments or supervisory expectations related to the mitigation of climate-related financial risks.\n\nAs we are discussing today, there is a multitude of initiatives under way among a wide range of international forums, central banks, academics and private sector stakeholders to study climate-related financial risks, and coordination at the global level would be beneficial. The TFCR is actively monitoring related initiatives in order to leverage such work and facilitate information-sharing across parallel initiatives to the extent possible. The Basel Committee is an observer on the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), which is chaired by Frank Elderson, my co-chair on the TFCR. This allows the two bodies to coordinate and ensure synergies wherever possible. The Committee also engages with the Financial Stability Board and other international standard-setting bodies to share information and contribute to global coordination in the area of climate-related financial risks.\n\nIn order to inform our work, the TFCR is also engaging directly with the private sector. Over the past two days, the TFCR held two industry outreach events with internationally active banks to learn about practices in the banking sector. This dialogue was informative and productive. We learned that banks are attempting to gauge the financial risks arising from climate change, and are trying to integrate oversight of these risks into their overall risk management framework. There are many different instruments and measurement methodologies being considered, including scenario analysis, stress testing and heat maps. As many methodologies are still at an early stage of development, and some might be idiosyncratic and adapted to certain business models, collective efforts will be needed to bridge the knowledge gap and inspire consistent and comparable efforts among stakeholders and jurisdictions.\n\nI am encouraged that the financial sector recognizes the value of coordinated efforts, including through this year's IIF Annual Membership Meeting, which provides us a great opportunity to tackle ESG issues together, exchange information and share knowledge among different stakeholders. The TFCR and the Basel Committee are committed to being part of this important global conversation going forward."

    "content": "It's great to be back in California participating once again in a Hoover Institution monetary policy event, even if only virtually. These conferences have provided an excellent opportunity for academic experts, policymakers, and practitioners to share research and perspectives on critically important issues. John Taylor is both a friend and a mentor, so it's a particular pleasure to be sharing this online platform with him today.\n\nThis summer, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) completed its review of the Fed's monetary policy framework. This culminated in August with the issuance of a new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.1 The FOMC put this strategy into practice in its September policy statement, explicitly tying its policy actions and intentions to the new framework.2\n\nThe new policy framework represents a substantial evolution of the FOMC's thinking and approach since the Committee published its first framework statement in 2012.\n\nToday, I'm going to talk about what these changes mean for policy as the economy recovers from the effects of the pandemic. But what I'm really looking forward to is our conversation around these important issues, so I'll keep my opening remarks brief.\n\nBefore I go any further, I need to give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the FOMC or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nOur Dual Mandate Goals\n\nWhile our monetary policy approach has shifted, our fundamental goals have not. The Fed has two goals set by Congress: maximum employment and price stability. These \"dual mandate\" goals remain on an equal footing, and our commitment to delivering on both has not changed. In addition, our assessment that a 2 percent long-run inflation rate is most consistent with achieving both of our dual mandate goals is unaltered.\n\nWhat has evolved is how we think about best achieving them. Like all institutions, the Federal Reserve must be responsive to changing circumstances and adapt to new realities. Since 2012, we have learned a great deal about the behavior of the economy, employment, and inflation\u2014both in the short and longer run\u2014and these lessons have informed our approach to policy.\n\nThere are three key takeaways worth highlighting: First and foremost is the secular decline in the neutral rate of interest, or r-star, which has brought neutral real interest rates to near zero in the United States. This decline in r-star in turn implies that the constraint on monetary policy from the lower bound on nominal interest rates has become a central aspect of the landscape with which policymakers must contend.\n\nSecond, over the past decade, inflation in the United States has been below our 2 percent longer-run target most of the time, and a number of measures of inflation expectations have drifted down in recent years.3\n\nIt is important to note that these first two observations are closely connected, as emphasized in the paper with Thomas Mertens that I presented at last year's Hoover conference. In a world of low r-star and a lower bound on nominal interest rates, a standard inflation targeting approach can lead to inflation and inflation expectations that are anchored below the targeted level.4\n\nThird, during the long economic recovery following the 2007-09 recession, we saw the unemployment rate reach 50-year lows without causing an undesired rise in inflation. Structural changes in the economy\u2014and in particular the labor market\u2014have greatly expanded the level of employment that can be maintained without creating inflationary pressures. But, changes like those are hard to see in real time, making estimates of the natural rate of unemployment or other barometers of the economy's potential inherently uncertain and subject to change.5\n\nEvolution in Our Thinking\n\nOne clear lesson is the critical importance of formulating a policy approach that effectively and consistently keeps longer-run inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent. Perhaps the most notable change we announced to our framework was explicitly describing success in terms of achieving inflation that averages 2 percent over time. In particular, \"following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.\"6\n\nA second tangible evolution in our approach is that we made explicit that in seeking maximum employment, we are focused on eliminating shortfalls from that goal. We also emphasized the inclusive nature of our maximum employment goal. This means thinking more broadly than the aggregate rate of unemployment and examining the full range of indicators when it comes to assessing shortfalls from maximum employment.\n\nTogether, these changes position us to deliver on our dual mandate goals in a world of very low r-star and persistently low inflation.\n\nWhat Does This Mean for Policy?\n\nMy colleagues at the FOMC and I have talked extensively about the nature of these changes and how we drew our conclusions. But, it's important to apply these decisions to the current situation. The pandemic has presented us with extraordinary and devastating economic circumstances.\n\nThe good news is that the economy has started to recover and the unemployment rate has come down. About half of the jobs lost during March and April have been regained. Despite these improvements, we are nowhere near where we want to be: the total number of nonfarm jobs is still 10.7 million below February's level, and the unemployment rate is nearly 8 percent.\n\nThese overall statistics mask the severity of the health and economic hardships felt by lower-income families and communities of color as a result of the pandemic. To cite just a few statistics, the Black unemployment rate is above 12 percent and the Hispanic unemployment rate is over 10 percent, and Black-owned businesses were shuttered at more than twice the rate of white-owned businesses during the early stages of the pandemic.7\n\nIn terms of monetary policy, the appropriate focus right now is on getting the country back to work. For that reason, policy is supporting very low interest rates to provide stimulus to the economic recovery and keeping inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent.\n\nIn thinking about the future path of policy, it is important to recognize that the pandemic engenders a unique and highly uncertain economic outlook. This is not a standard recession and the economic future is inextricably tied to the spread of the virus, people's behavior in containing that spread, and the development of vaccines and therapeutics.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, transparency and flexibility in our policy approach will enable us to respond to changes in the outlook as they happen. Indeed, these are key features of the forward guidance we issued after the FOMC meeting in September.8\n\nSeptember's FOMC statement clearly linked our policy to the key elements of the new policy framework. In particular, it stated that the Committee expects it will be appropriate to maintain the federal funds rate at its current target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.9\n\nBy linking future policy actions to economic outcomes and ultimately our dual mandate goals, this forward guidance clearly describes the key elements of the FOMC's reaction function to economic developments and a changing outlook.\n\nReady to Adapt\n\nOne of the most important, but perhaps overlooked parts of our August announcement is that we will review our longer-run framework roughly every five years. This represents the Fed's commitment to transparency and our willingness to continue to adapt to changing circumstances. Reviewing our longer-run framework and approach to our goals more frequently will ensure we are well prepared for the future, whatever it may bring.\n\nConclusion\n\nI'll conclude with this: these are extraordinary times. The announcement of changes to our longer-run framework comes during one of the most challenging periods our country and our economy have ever faced. These changes to the framework mean that we are well positioned to deliver on our dual mandate goals and support a strong and sustained economic recovery."

    "content": "Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the sixth annual U.S. Treasury Market Conference. I wish we were able to meet in person at the New York Fed. But, while the location for this year's conference may have moved from an auditorium to your living room, the goal remains the same: To bring together market participants and representatives from five public sector bodies\u2014the New York Fed, the Board of Governors, the Treasury, the SEC, and the CFTC. And, the events of the past year make the conversations we will have today all the more valuable and timely.\n\nToday, I'd like to begin with stressing the importance of well-functioning financial markets and then look at two recent episodes of volatility and the lessons learned. I'll close by explaining the Fed's role to support functioning in this critical part of the financial system.\n\nAt last year's conference, I spoke about the transition away from LIBOR. Because I am certain all of you have committed to memory everything I said then, I'll keep my remarks on LIBOR today short and to the point: We have only 459 days until the availability of LIBOR can no longer be assured, and everyone needs to put their nose to the grindstone in their efforts to prepare for the move off LIBOR. In the immortal words of Captain Jean Luc Picard\u2014make it so!\n\nBefore I continue on to today's topic or quote other favorite Star Trek characters, I need to give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Heart of the Economy\n\nThe markets that are the center of attention today\u2014the Treasury market, the repo market, and the mortgage-backed securities market\u2014represent the heart of the circulatory system of our financial system and our economy, and indeed the global economy. When they are working smoothly, all the other parts of the system can perform as they should.\n\nBut, the opposite is true as well. If these critical markets break down, credit stops flowing, and people can't finance the purchase of a car or a home, businesses can't invest, and the economy suffers, resulting in lost jobs and income.1\n\nFinancial markets aren't static\u2014they evolve over time in response to changes in technology, regulation, and business models. The Treasury market is not immune to this process of change. We have seen the emergence of principal trading firms, changes in regulations of key intermediaries, and the growth of nonbank financial institutions.2 With this evolution, it is vitally important to ensure that safeguards and systems also evolve so that these markets function well in all circumstances and conditions, including unprecedented events like the pandemic.\n\nWe need to reflect on and learn from these experiences and consider ways to make these and other markets more robust, thereby minimizing the potential negative consequences to the economy and the need for extraordinary policy responses.\n\nMarket Conditions in September and March\n\nI know it might seem like a lifetime ago, but allow me take you to mid-September of last year.\n\nA number of otherwise ordinary occurrences\u2014including corporate tax payments and settlement of newly issued Treasuries\u2014were expected to put some upward pressure on short-term rates, but the market response was out of proportion to the magnitude of the shock.\n\nConditions in funding markets became highly volatile, with both secured and unsecured lending rates rising sharply. Indeed, the size of the reaction in repo rates, the spillover to the federal funds market, and the emergence of strains in market functioning were well outside of recent experience. And the market stress was looking to get worse, not better. 3 4\n\nIn response to these developments, the Federal Reserve conducted a series of large-scale repo operations with the aim of calming conditions in funding markets and bringing the federal funds rate within the target range. The provision of liquidity had the desired effect of reducing strains in markets, narrowing the dispersion of rates, and keeping the federal funds rate within the target range.5\n\nMoving to more recent events, in March of this year the global spread of the pandemic led to a rapid and massive movement of funds around the world as investors sought to protect themselves from the highly uncertain and darkening economic outlook. These flows threatened to overwhelm the financial system and resulted in intense strain and disruption in short-term funding markets and markets for Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities.6 Measures of market functioning deteriorated to levels near, or in some cases worse than, those we saw at the peak of the 2008 global financial crisis.7\n\nIn response to the extraordinary volatility and signs of market disruption caused by the pandemic, the Federal Reserve greatly expanded its repo operations and decisively and immediately began purchasing enormous quantities of U.S. Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. Our approach was to deliver a rapid and overwhelming response that would give assurance to market participants that liquidity would be there in the coming days and months.\n\nThese actions, combined with the introduction of emergency lending facilities to provide liquidity to funding and credit markets, proved successful. They quickly restored market functioning and averted what could have been a much more severe pullback from markets and the flow of credit to households and businesses.8 Indeed, the rapid restoration of market functioning helped restore a robust flow of credit at historically low interest rates to the economy, which has provided a boost for the recovery.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nI don't like to be ominous or foreshadow the future. But, if another crisis were to occur, we must to be able to look back on this time and know that we learned everything we could from recent events. After the financial crisis of 2008, a significant amount of work both in the United States and around the world was invested in studying the causes of that crisis and finding ways to make the financial system more resilient.\n\nThe ultimate goal of those reforms was to ensure that the next time the global economy was hit by a major shock, the financial system would be a source of support for the economy, rather than amplify weakness. Those efforts were hugely successful. The resilience of the U.S. banking system in particular has been a key factor in positioning our economy for a strong recovery, despite the enormous challenges posed by the pandemic.\n\nIt's crucial that our financial system can handle shocks and disruption. We must use the opportunity before us and study the events in September and March to identify the root causes for the market stress and disruption.9 We need to understand how changes in the market ecosystem\u2014whether due to regulation, technology, or other factors\u2014have influenced market resilience. Like the post-financial-crisis reforms, this is an opportunity to think hard about what changes will help fortify the financial system against future shocks.\n\nThe Role of Central Banks\n\nDespite our best efforts, we should not fool ourselves that we can design a system that is bulletproof against every circumstance. The events of the past year have demonstrated the critical role central banks can and must play in extraordinary times when market stress and dysfunction threaten to spill over into the economy. No private institution has the ability to provide liquidity at the speed or scale that the Federal Reserve and other central banks have this year.\n\nAlthough we often talk about the Fed in terms of monetary policy and interest rates, the Federal Reserve System was originally created to ensure the stability of the financial system.10 That role is as relevant today as it was 107 years ago, and will continue to be in the future.\n\nConclusion\n\nLet me conclude by returning to my analogy of these critical markets as the heart of our circulatory system. Recent events have reaffirmed what many already knew. Liquid, well-functioning markets for Treasury and related securities are absolutely essential for credit to flow and the economy to prosper. Assuring that these markets are robust and resilient to unknown future circumstances may seem like a daunting task, but as Captain Picard also taught us, \"Things are only impossible until they're not.\"\n\nThank you."

    "title": "The LIBOR Countdown Has Not Stopped",
    "date": "Sep 29, 2020",
    "speaker": "Michael Held",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2020/hel200929",
    "content": "Thank you for that kind introduction, and for the opportunity to speak to you all today. As always, my remarks reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nThe last time I spoke publicly about LIBOR transition was almost 18 months ago,2 when the end of LIBOR still seemed reasonably far away and the world in general seemed much more predictable. I said then that what kept me up most at night was whether my daughter would get into a good kindergarten in Brooklyn, but that reference rate reform was only a little further down the list.\n\nYou\u2019ll be relieved to know that my daughter is now in a great school, and it\u2019s very close to home. In fact, it\u2019s in our living room. A year and a half ago, I never could have anticipated how different and uncertain every single part of our lives would become. Now, there\u2019s a whole host of new worries atop the list of things that keep me up at night. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s true for all of you as well, as individuals and families but also as leaders of institutions dealing with the bizarre and uncertain times we find ourselves in. Those new concerns and risks have understandably pushed many well-laid plans into the background, and the pandemic has had such far-reaching effects that all sorts of things we thought we knew would happen have become uncertain. What I want to do today is remind you all that despite everything else that\u2019s happening, the end of LIBOR is still coming. Exactly how that happens is still uncertain, but the best response to uncertainty about tomorrow is to take decisive action today.\n\nSince my speech last year, there has been substantial progress in addressing some of the uncertainties that surrounded LIBOR transition, even as new uncertainties have arisen. Now, many lawyers love uncertainty. If everything were crystal clear, what would we spend our time arguing about?\n\nI have said before that the end of LIBOR presents a rather frightening\u2014or awe inspiring, depending on your perspective\u2014litigation risk. But it\u2019s not just litigation risk. The LIBOR transition encompasses a whole panoply of risks. Yes, legal risk, but also operational risk, credit risk, regulatory risk, reputational risk, you name it\u2014LIBOR has it all. So the possibility of a failed LIBOR transition is something that should keep all of us up at night.\n\nBut let\u2019s try and stay positive in these rather dark times\u2014let\u2019s talk about what progress has been made, and what you can do now to minimize the uncertainties that remain. My remarks will focus on the transition in the United States for U.S. dollar LIBOR, but I will touch on some international developments that are relevant to that transition.\n\nLIBOR: The End of an Error\n\nSome people have asked whether the end of LIBOR will be pushed out somehow to allow more time for transition. Some people, I suspect, may even hope that this ends up being the case. After all, the task is daunting. But I would remind folks that the adage is not \u201cwhy do today what can be put off until tomorrow?\u201d Quite the opposite. Indeed, the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has reiterated that the pandemic has not altered the central assumption that firms cannot rely on LIBOR being published after the end of 2021.3 In fact, the FCA has said that even though LIBOR will continue until then, announcements about its end could come as early as this November or December.4 The Financial Stability Board (FSB)\u2014which is chaired by Randy Quarles, the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Vice Chair for Supervision\u2014has also emphasized that the pandemic should not prevent firms from removing any remaining dependencies on LIBOR by the end of 2021.5\n\nThe Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), which is the private-sector committee convened by the Federal Reserve to facilitate the transition away from U.S. dollar LIBOR, has recommended that floating-rate notes, syndicated loans, consumer loans, and securitizations should already include definitive fallbacks to cope with the end of LIBOR, and has set target dates by which no new LIBOR-based products should be issued.6 The ARRC also has provided a timeline and resources to ensure that vendors and operational systems are ready for the switch to alternative rates.7 Why? Because having a LIBOR transition office and a high-level plan is not enough. Do not underestimate the operational, technical, legal, communications, and risk management work that will be required to move existing transactions off of LIBOR and prepare to use an alternative rate. It will take time and resources, and the price of failure or delay in any of those areas could be high.\n\nThere Ought to Be a Law\n\nAnother uncertainty is the possibility of legislation in United States, the United Kingdom, or the European Union to ease the transition. In the U.S., the ARRC has proposed that New York State should, by the force of law, substitute a rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate for LIBOR in contracts that would otherwise have no workable fallback when LIBOR ceases.8 But again, this solution is aimed at contracts that don\u2019t specify another fallback and can\u2019t be amended to do so\u2014primarily floating-rate bonds. We can hope that the New York legislature will take up this proposal in its next session, but obviously it has a lot of other pressing business these days, and no one can guarantee that there will be a legislative Hail Mary. And even if there is, it would not displace non-LIBOR fallbacks that are written into existing contracts, which may not be the alternative you\u2019d prefer. The lesson here is that for every exposure you have to LIBOR, do everything you can right now to make sure it provides for the end of LIBOR in clear terms. Do not wait for the state cavalry to ride to your rescue.\n\nIn the UK, the government has said it will give the FCA new powers to smooth the transition,9 and there has been speculation about what the FCA will do with those powers. The UK legislation takes a very different approach from the proposed New York law. It raises the prospect of LIBOR continuing under a new methodology as \u201csynthetic LIBOR,\u201d at least in some currencies. But the FCA itself has warned that whatever it does will not be an alternative to firms\u2019 transition efforts, and that any synthetic continuation of LIBOR will still not be deemed to be a representative rate.10 The FCA has said that any action it takes will be focused on contracts that cannot feasibly be amended by the parties to mitigate the effects of LIBOR cessation. It will not provide a solution for new contracts. And even at that, it will not necessarily address every LIBOR setting or currency. For those it does reach, users will be giving up control of the economics of their contracts to whatever the new methodology may be. In short, if you rely on these new powers to take care of your LIBOR contracts, you may not get what you want, and you may not like what you get. The message is clear: you must still do everything you can, right now, to anticipate the end of LIBOR and take control of your own risks.\n\nIn the European Union, there is draft legislation that is similar in approach to the ARRC\u2019s proposed New York law. 11 For contracts that are in scope for the EU\u2019s existing Benchmarks Regulation, it would replace a benchmark that had ceased publication or become non-representative with one designated by the European Commission. But it would apply only to contracts with an EU-supervised entity and where there is no \u201csuitable\u201d fallback. Like the New York proposal and the UK law, the EU legislation is intended only to provide a fail-safe for contracts that cannot be proactively managed, and the fail-safe rate the European Commission decides on may not be the one that best suits your needs.\n\nAs a last note on the legislative front, the European Commission has also said it will recommend that the various EU member states adopt national-level legislation to address contracts that the EU-level action doesn\u2019t reach. To state what is perhaps obvious, it\u2019s unclear at this point\u2014and will likely remain unclear for some time\u2014how the various legislative efforts in the UK, the EU, the EU members states, and the U.S. will play out, and how they will interact with one another. Every global firm that uses LIBOR anywhere in its operations will need to follow those developments and evaluate carefully what effect this legislation would have on each contract of each of its legal entities. To me, the clearest takeaway from all of that is that you should not wait for these proposals to become law and then decide how they affect you and whether you like the result. There isn\u2019t time for that. Do everything you can now to proactively manage your LIBOR risk across every jurisdiction where you have exposure.\n\nLet\u2019s Stand on Protocol\n\nFor derivatives, which represent by far the largest U.S. dollar LIBOR exposures in the market, there is some good news. Standard derivatives documentation does not have workable fallbacks to accommodate the end of LIBOR, and there is enormous uncertainty about what will happen in this market when LIBOR ceases. That\u2019s not the good news. The good news is that there is a simple action every market participant can take to end that uncertainty right now. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) will be opening a protocol soon that resolves this uncertainty for firms that sign up to it. The ARRC has recommended that all firms adhere to the protocol as a best practice. This is an area where the exposures and the risks to firms and the system as a whole are very large, but there will soon be a clear option for managing those risks. And because ISDA has contracted with Bloomberg to calculate and publish the protocol\u2019s fallback rates beginning now, if you adhere to the protocol you can have a good understanding of the effect of LIBOR\u2019s end on your derivatives well before it actually goes away.12 Even better, the ARRC has announced that its recommended rate for LIBOR products that transition to SOFR will be the same as the ISDA protocol\u2019s fallback rate.13 So you can have that same certainty for cash products as well.\n\nAlso on the derivatives front, clearinghouses LCH and CME will change over discounting and price alignment interest on listed derivatives to SOFR in two weeks\u2019 time, and will incorporate the ISDA transition terms into their standard contracts. That should help increase activity in SOFR derivatives, which, as we\u2019ll see next, should help lay further groundwork for new SOFR-based alternatives.\n\nComing to Terms with SOFR\n\nApart from the overnight and average SOFR rates that are being used right now, there are two other types of rates that some market participants seem to be awaiting. One is the forward-looking term SOFR rate that the ARRC is working on. Earlier this month the ARRC released a request for proposals for the design and production of term SOFR.14 But that doesn\u2019t mean you should wait for it. No one can guarantee that the ARRC will end up recommending a term rate, or when that will happen if it does. Designing a robust new rate is not a quick process, and the ARRC\u2019s first priority will be ensuring that whatever term rate it recommends is robust and durable. The likeliest basis for such a rate is forward derivative contracts on SOFR, which have not yet reached the volume and liquidity that are sufficient to support a widely used term rate. So even once a design is set and an administrator is lined up, it may well be some time before the term rate is ready for prime time. The important point here is that you shouldn\u2019t delay your move off of LIBOR in the hope that a forward-looking term version of SOFR will come along. SOFR is available right now, including 30-, 90- and 180-day compound averages published daily by the New York Fed that are less variable than overnight rates and can be used in all types of cash products. And to make it easier and promote consistency, the ARRC has prepared an extensive set of detailed, product-specific recommendations and conventions for how to do exactly that.\n\nSpread the Credit Around\n\nThe second type of potential rate that has gotten a lot of attention lately is one that incorporates a measure of credit risk, since SOFR is a secured rate. Some banks have expressed concerns about using SOFR in commercial loans without an additional credit component. As part of its work to understand and address any obstacles to the transition away from LIBOR, the New York Fed has hosted a series of four workshops to explore and understand these concerns from both banks\u2019 and borrowers\u2019 points of view.15 The aim of these discussions has been to understand the issues at play. We do not yet know the end result of these workshops, and it would be premature for me to comment on any next steps at this point. But I will say that no one involved in those workshops has suggested that they provide a reason to delay moving away from LIBOR on the timetable that we\u2019re now all too familiar with.\n\nI want to be clear\u2014as the ARRC and the Fed have been from the beginning\u2014that no one is requiring that everyone use SOFR for all purposes or for any specific purpose. There are other alternatives out there, and nothing prevents you from using any rate that\u2019s robust, appropriate for your institution, and fit for the use you\u2019re putting it to. What is most important is that you move off of LIBOR and do it now. But in deciding what to move to, remember that SOFR is the foundation for the transition from U.S. dollar LIBOR because it meets very high standards. The ARRC went through an extensive review and consultation process and got input from a wide range of market participants. It evaluated a number of alternative rates for benchmark quality, methodological quality, accountability, governance, and ease of implementation. SOFR was the clear first choice. It\u2019s produced by the New York Fed and is based on about a trillion dollars\u2019 worth of daily transactions in a broad and liquid market that a wide array of firms of all types have access to. The New York Fed has provided detailed public information about every aspect of SOFR, including historical data and a point-by-point description of how it complies with the benchmark principles set out by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). You should make sure that any other reference rate you use meets similarly high standards, and is fully transparent about how it\u2019s calculated, what it\u2019s based on, and exactly how it complies with the IOSCO principles.\n\nThe ARRC and ISDA also went through an extensive public consultation process in constructing their recommended fallbacks that will kick in when LIBOR becomes unusable. The overriding goal of that process was to minimize value transfer and ensure as much as possible that the transition did not disadvantage borrowers or lenders, or one side of a LIBOR swap. And those are the same fallbacks that will apply under the ARRC\u2019s proposed New York legislation. Anyone considering using different fallbacks should likewise keep those concerns top of mind.\n\nMaking it Official\n\nBefore I wrap up, I\u2019d like to talk about the role of the official sector in the transition. It might seem at times that our role has consisted mostly of forming working groups and giving speeches where we harangue market participants to just get on with it already\u2014kind of like this one. Of course, as I mentioned, the New York Fed has stepped up by producing SOFR, which is key to the transition. But it\u2019s also clear that a significant speed bump in transition is uncertainty about how the switch to new rates will be treated under the huge range of existing regulations that weren\u2019t written with this kind of event in mind. The official sector must pave the way for transition by eliminating that uncertainty. Paving over the speed bumps, if you will. Since my last speech about LIBOR, the official sector has worked closely with the ARRC and others to provide clear guidance and offer the prospect of relief from existing rules. There is a final rule on swap margins for legacy swaps that transition away from LIBOR,16 a proposed CFPB rule on transitioning consumer credit,17 accounting guidance from the FASB and the SEC,18 tax guidance from the IRS,19 and relief from the CFTC.20 The Federal Housing Finance Administration has taken a number of actions, including prohibiting the Federal Home Loan Banks from entering into LIBOR transactions or investments.21 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will stop accepting LIBOR-based ARMs by the end of this year22 and have created new ARM products indexed to the 30-day SOFR average.23\n\nThe supervisory agencies have also eliminated uncertainty about what stance they will be taking on LIBOR transition in their supervisory and examination work\u2014they\u2019ve said very clearly they\u2019ll be focusing on it, and every supervised firm needs to focus on it too. On the international level, the FSB and the Basel Committee have urged the authorities in each jurisdiction to identify the remaining transition issues and increase the intensity of their supervisory actions when the preparations of individual banks are unsatisfactory.24 The Basel Committee has also put out FAQs on benchmark reform under the Basel Framework.25 In the United States, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) has emphasized the financial, legal, operational, and consumer protection risks of the upcoming transition and announced that the supervisory focus on evaluating institutions\u2019 preparedness will increase in the rest of 2020 and 2021.26 And the SEC has identified registrant preparedness for the transition away from LIBOR as an examination program priority for the coming fiscal year.27 So be prepared to answer questions about how you\u2019re planning for the end of LIBOR across your business.\n\nConclusion\n\nGiven how deeply embedded LIBOR is in products and systems across the commercial landscape, the transition away from LIBOR is a huge undertaking that presents a whole array of risks. There remain a host of uncertainties about the end of LIBOR, but very little uncertainty about what firms should do to prepare for it. A year and a half ago, I talked about ongoing consultations and said that the way forward for the vast majority of LIBOR-based instruments was rapidly becoming clear. Well, those consultations have concluded, and the way forward, for all types of LIBOR instruments, is now clear indeed."

    "content": "Hello everyone, and welcome to the New York Fed\u2019s third Economic Inequality Policy Forum. It\u2019s a pleasure to speak with all of you who are joining us for this conversation. For me, today\u2019s event is about sharing research and hearing your recommendations, so I\u2019m going to keep my opening remarks brief.\n\nBefore I continue, let me give the disclaimer that the views I express are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nSince the outbreak of the pandemic, we\u2019ve seen severe economic pain, unprecedented levels of unemployment, and enormous uncertainty about the future. The health and economic effects of COVID-19 have created tremendous hardship for many Americans across the country, but they have been especially painful for communities of color.\n\nWe know that people of color and Black people in particular have experienced higher rates of illness and death. Significant representation in essential services work and insufficient access to healthcare are key factors that have contributed to these outcomes.1 The pandemic\u2019s convergence with a moment of reckoning for the United States around racial justice makes conversations on issues like equitable growth even more important and relevant.\n\nWhen I think about equitable growth, I think about an economy where everyone can realize their full economic potential. While today\u2019s conversation is about equitable recovery, everyone here is aware that an equitable economy did not exist before the pandemic. Another important dimension of equitable growth is equal access. And the pandemic exposed just how dramatic the fault lines in racial disparities are, for access to things like healthcare, credit, and housing.\n\nRecent research by the New York Fed revealed that Black-owned businesses are almost twice as likely to shutter during COVID-19 as white-owned firms. Black-owned businesses are also more likely to be located in coronavirus hot spots.2 I\u2019m hearing about how these statistics are playing out for families through regular conversations with community leaders like many of you in our district and beyond. Far too many are facing unemployment, losing access to their healthcare, and dealing with the threat of eviction.\n\nStructural inequality stifles growth, but there is no single silver bullet that can solve the problems laid bare by the pandemic. As we look ahead to a full recovery from the downturn, we need to set a stronger foundation. We need more investment in health, in education\u2014especially in the earliest years\u2014in infrastructure, and in training and skills for well-paying jobs.\n\nThere is so much work that needs to be done to make sure that we are fostering an equitable recovery and ensuring that everyone is able to fulfill their economic potential.\n\nThat\u2019s why at the New York Fed and across the Federal Reserve System, a key area of focus is to better understand what contributes to economic inequities and to finding solutions.3\n\nOur economic research and analysis, which my colleagues will share shortly, highlights many of these stark disparities.4 In addition, hosting conversations like this one creates dialogue around these issues and builds connections between those working for change.\n\nAnother important role the Federal Reserve plays in promoting economic equity and access is supervising banks with respect to the Community Reinvestment Act. This law requires banks to lend, invest, and offer services to low- and moderate-income communities in areas where the banks operate.\n\nTo emphasize all of our work in this space, the New York Fed recently published a statement reinforcing our commitment to fostering a more equitable economy and society:5\n\nThe New York Fed stands in unity with all those who oppose racism, hate, and violence. We join them in a shared desire to root out the intolerable inequities and injustice grounded in systemic racism that persist in our society. We are firm in the belief that economic equality is a critical component for social justice and that we will never have the truly inclusive and strong economy we seek until access to health, education, safety, and justice knows no racial or other boundaries. We are dedicated to understanding and finding solutions to the numerous forms of inequality that communities of color experience and working with communities in our District to address deep-seated inequities. We are steadfast in our commitment to work for a more equitable economy and society for all, and will redouble our efforts in pursuit of this essential mission.\n\nThe pandemic painfully demonstrates the need for us to redouble our efforts in working with stakeholders from the community, business, nonprofits, and governments to build a stronger, more equitable foundation for our economy\u2019s future. This makes conversations like the ones we are having today so important for us to listen to and learn from. Our shared commitment to an equitable recovery is needed now more than ever."

    "title": "Transitioning Away From LIBOR: Understanding SOFR\u2019s Strengths and Considering the Path Forward",
    "date": "Sep 18, 2020",
    "speaker": "Unknown",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2020/wue200918",
    "content": "Thanks for the kind introduction, Bill, and good morning to everyone joining virtually.\n\nEvents like this play an important role in fostering productive discourse about the transition away from LIBOR, and I am honored to participate in this symposium. As always, the views I express today are my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nRight now, we are 470 days from the end of 2021, after which the existence of LIBOR is no longer guaranteed. That timeline might feel tight, but it has actually taken years of preparation, thoughtful consideration, and countless conversations to reach this point.\n\nThe transition away from LIBOR is arguably one of the most significant and complex challenges that financial markets will ever confront. In the face of this daunting task, it is important to remember why we are transitioning in the first place, and to ensure that we never have to do it again.\n\nWith that in mind, I will start by explaining why the world needs to move from LIBOR to robust alternative reference rates. I will also explain some of the reasons the Alternative Reference Rates Committee chose the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its preferred alternative to U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR. I will conclude by highlighting efforts to understand transition challenges for commercial loan products, in line with the focus of today\u2019s symposium.\n\nWhy the World Needs to Transition Away From LIBOR\n\nConcerns about LIBOR first became known well over a decade ago. LIBOR panel bank submissions were egregiously manipulated, which highlighted the secular decline in its underlying market.\n\nStarting in 2012,2 LIBOR\u2019s financial stability risks triggered reform efforts worldwide. Global regulators worked to coordinate these efforts,3 and groups like the ARRC were born, tasked with addressing the unique needs of financial markets across countries and currencies.\n\nThe ARRC is a diverse group of private market participants convened by the Federal Reserve and responsible for developing the plan to transition away from USD LIBOR.4 Its first task was to recommend an alternative to USD LIBOR. To do so, the ARRC developed key criteria to assess a range of options.\n\nThe ARRC\u2019s criteria5 guided its selection process to make sure it chose a \u201crobust\u201d benchmark. Among other criteria, this included evaluating whether the rate was based on a deep, liquid market, and whether it was designed and administered in a fashion consistent with the IOSCO Principles for Financial Benchmarks.6\n\nThere are many attributes that can help make a reference rate robust, and I encourage everyone here to do some bedtime reading with the IOSCO Principles. In my own view, a robust reference rate has at least three key attributes:\n\nWhen assessed against this last attribute, it is quite clear why LIBOR is inadequate. In particular, over the four decades since LIBOR was formally developed, the wholesale funding market that it seeks to measure has withered. The Global Financial Crisis accelerated the decline of LIBOR\u2019s underlying market, as banks found more stable ways to fund themselves. With so much economic value riding on a thin market, the incentive to manipulate LIBOR increased and\u2014as we all are painfully aware\u2014such exploitation ultimately became a reality.\n\nEven though extensive reforms have been undertaken to make LIBOR more robust, its production primarily relies on expert judgement rather than eligible funding transactions. The U.K.\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, has noted that panel banks, \u201cfeel understandable discomfort about providing submissions.\u201d7 So despite the sprawling use of LIBOR today,8 the FCA has said that LIBOR\u2019s survival is not guaranteed after 2021 and everyone needs to prepare to meet that target date.9\n\nNo one could have anticipated that LIBOR would grow to be so important to financial markets and then abruptly end in this way. But we can avoid repeating past mistakes by choosing reference rates that are robust.\n\nAnd it is this history lesson that makes the choice of selecting alternative reference rates so consequential. Although each market participant must choose which alternative it will use, the ARRC was convened to help in this process by recommending an alternative to USD LIBOR that could help many in the global transition.10 As a result, its decisions needed to be informed by intense study, thorough analysis, and healthy debate, conducted with the input of a broad and diverse set of stakeholders.11 Efforts to select an alternative to USD LIBOR took over three years, and ultimately resulted in the ARRC choosing SOFR as the best option.\n\nWhy the ARRC Chose SOFR as the Foundation for the Transition Away From USD LIBOR\n\nWhy did the ARRC choose SOFR?\n\nSOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight in the U.S. Treasury securities repurchase agreement (repo) market. If you look at how SOFR is produced, what it represents, and the robustness of its underlying market, it is clear why the ARRC selected it.\n\nSOFR is fully transaction-based and is produced by the New York Fed in accordance with the IOSCO Principles.12 It is an accurate and reliable representation of conditions prevailing across three key market segments of the U.S. Treasury repo market.13\n\nThe term \u201cU.S. Treasury repo market\u201d\u2014which refers to the market that underlies SOFR\u2014might sound like jargon. But you do not need to be a repo market participant to understand this rate or use it in contracts.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury repo market undergirds the U.S. and global financial system, and a repo trade is arguably not any more complex than a mortgage. In a mortgage, you borrow cash from a lender collateralized by a house. In a repo, you borrow cash from a lender collateralized by a U.S. Treasury security.\n\nThe market underlying SOFR is incredibly deep and has broad participation, with about $1 trillion in transactions every day and a diverse set of market participants including asset managers, banks, broker dealers, insurance companies, pension funds, and corporate treasurers. And because SOFR captures trades across multiple segments of the repo market, it is well placed to have a deep and liquid transaction base even as financial markets evolve.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury repo market also is broadly accessible and competitive. There are roughly 2,000 entities eligible to transact in the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation-cleared segment alone, and that is just one part of the U.S. Treasury repo market that SOFR measures. In the tri-party segment of the market, there typically are 40 to 50 different firms borrowing cash each day, and roughly 120 firms lending. The top 10 lenders in the market underlying SOFR account for just over half of all lending activity. The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) is a widely used measure of market concentration. For the markets underlying SOFR, the HHI measure is below 600, indicating a competitive market.\n\nGiven all of these attributes, it is no wonder the ARRC chose SOFR as its preferred alternative, since the rate is a strong foundation for the transition away from USD LIBOR.\n\nAll of which raises the question: if SOFR is so great, why are we here?\n\nEfforts to Understand Transition Challenges for Commercial Loan Products\n\nGiven its widespread impacts, it is important for the Federal Reserve and our official sector partners to be fully aware of the challenges to a successful transition. So, as we do with all major policy initiatives, we are holding discussions to understand the perspectives of everyone directly impacted by the transition.\n\nThe ARRC has been working hard to develop tools to facilitate the use of SOFR in all products, coordinating with a wide array of market participants and vendors to develop conventions, resource guides,14 fallback language,15 and more. But this transition is complex, and some banks have highlighted their concerns around using SOFR in commercial loans in the absence of a credit-sensitive spread.\n\nGiven the importance of this market and the banks\u2019 concerns, the New York Fed hosted a series of four working sessions with banks and borrowers to understand their challenges in transitioning commercial lending away from LIBOR in the absence of a credit-sensitive supplement to SOFR.16 The business loan market is the largest of the cash markets transitioning away from LIBOR at around $3.4 trillion.17\n\nThe workshops were intended to explore and understand the nature of the concerns from the perspective of banks and borrowers, and to consider the potential role of a credit-sensitive supplement\u2014but not to recommend a specific credit-sensitive supplement. I\u2019ll highlight a few key takeaways from these sessions.18\n\nThe first workshop brought banks together specifically to understand the nature of the challenge. Participants explained that there could be a mismatch between banks\u2019 unhedged cost of funds and SOFR-based commercial loans during an economic downturn, and that a credit-sensitive supplement could provide a natural hedge. A number of the banks thought such a supplement would be particularly important for revolving lines of credit, commercial real estate loans, and commercial and industrial loans.\n\nThe second and third workshops brought banks together to discuss data and conceptual design considerations for a credit-sensitive supplement. Participants discussed the IOSCO Principles, as well as data sources that could be relevant to constructing a credit-sensitive supplement, including overnight wholesale borrowings, various short-term money market transactions, and longer-term funding transactions.\n\nMany of the banks expressed views that a supplement to SOFR should be credit-sensitive, dynamic, based on unsecured funding, and reflective of marginal bank funding costs. The banks also discussed a range of views on the precise transactions and issuers to include, and an appropriate frequency and observation period for calculations. There was some discussion that funding costs may vary by the size of the bank and the regulatory oversight to which they are subject.\n\nTo increase the robustness of a potential spread, workshop participants discussed broadening the set of eligible transactions, but also noted that this could potentially make a spread less representative of the funding cost for a specific market segment. Participants also discussed the risk of a credit-sensitive supplement being referenced in a broader set of products for which it was not designed or is not sufficiently robust.\n\nThe fourth\u2014and most recent\u2014workshop focused on understanding corporate borrowers\u2019 perspectives on these issues. Some borrowers explained that they carefully and competitively bid out their borrowing activity to banks, taking into consideration the specific credit profile of each bank. Some expressed that their loan pricing should reflect the funding profile of the banks in their banking group and that a broader credit spread might introduce a bank credit risk component that is not actually relevant to their own chosen lenders.\n\nSome participants expressed concerns about how a potential credit sensitive spread would intersect with existing features that banks may use to manage risk, such as commitment fees and interest rate floors. A number of the borrowers viewed the ability to hedge their loans in derivative markets as an important consideration and wondered whether a credit sensitive supplement could impair hedges and hedge effectiveness.\n\nBoth banks and borrowers highlighted the urgency of the timeline for transitioning away from LIBOR, and the complexity of system updates, product adjustments, and other changes.\n\nTogether, the working sessions this summer fostered constructive discussions around the challenges associated with transitioning commercial loans away from LIBOR. It would be premature for me to comment on any next steps at this point, but I am glad to participate in today\u2019s symposium to hear further perspectives on these important matters.\n\nConclusion\n\nStepping back, I realize that everyone joining us today is exceedingly aware of the transition\u2019s complexity and wide-reaching impacts. We welcome conversations around how to overcome the hurdles related to moving away from LIBOR, and we are ready to support the industry as it works toward solutions. In this effort, no one should lose sight of how we arrived here, and how to avoid that outcome in the future\u2014it\u2019s in all of our best interests to move off of LIBOR and onto robust reference rates.\n\nRemember: we are just 470 days away from the end of 2021. Let\u2019s make this transition stick, so that we never have to go through it again."

    "title": "Creating Opportunity out of Crisis: Extending Access to the Fed\u2019s Emergency Facilities",
    "date": "Sep 10, 2020",
    "speaker": "Unknown",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2020/sin200910",
    "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you, Guy, for the kind introduction. I must say, it's a bittersweet feeling to speak before you today. I'm honored to have the privilege of addressing this gathering, and I want to express my deep gratitude to you, Ron Parker, and the entire NASP membership for engaging with the New York Fed in our response to the COVID pandemic. But the context is tragic\u2014we continue to face the worst public health and economic shock of our lifetimes, hitting people of color the hardest during a summer filled with bitter reminders of systemic racism that continues to plague our society.\n\nToday I'll share our ambition to create opportunity out of this multifaceted crisis. As you've heard me say before, we've moved at maximum speed and with maximum care to implement the Federal Reserve's crisis response. In practice, this means our policy execution has been guided by a set of principles, including transparency, governance, accountability, and access. In my remarks, I'll focus on access: what it means, and why it matters in the context of implementing the Fed's emergency facilities. NASP has engaged actively with us in this effort, and I'll explain why we're committed to building on our partnership through and after the crisis.\n\nBefore going any further, though, let me note that I am expressing my personal views and not necessarily those of the New York Fed or the Federal Reserve System. I would also point out that the FOMC will hold a monetary policy meeting next week, which puts us well into the blackout period. This means I'll steer clear of discussing our policy outlook, and I won't be able to take any questions, but I look forward to the day when we can gather in person again for a two-way conversation.\n\nContext: The Unequal Impact of the COVID Pandemic\n\nI'll begin by describing the context. Everyone here is painfully aware that the pandemic has hit the most vulnerable segments of our society the hardest, leading to highly unequal outcomes. Labor market damage has been concentrated among people of color, lower-wage workers, those with the least education, and people with disabilities.\n\nEven after recent improvements, unemployment rates for Asian, Black, and Hispanic Americans all remain in the double digits, rising a cumulative 8.7, 7.6, and 6.6 percentage points, respectively, from their pre-pandemic lows. Reductions in labor force participation for those without a college degree have been more than twice as large as those with a degree. Average hourly earnings growth in lower-wage service sectors, such as leisure and hospitality, is less than 1 percent since February, compared to an overall average of about 3 percent.\n\nMy colleagues in the New York Fed's Research Group have helped us to understand and shine a light on these disparities. I'll give three examples of their recent work.\n\nFirst, they have shown that COVID infection and death rates are highly correlated with race, income1, and financial vulnerability.2 Counties with populations that are low-income, majority-minority, and financially vulnerable have suffered the highest rates of COVID incidence per capita, even after adjusting for population density.\n\nSecond, they have found that jobs requiring close physical proximity to other people are disproportionately held by workers who are poor, nonwhite, and don\u2019t own a home. An outsized share of those jobs have been deemed essential, which has meant increased exposure to the virus for those who are most vulnerable to its effects. For those in jobs not deemed essential, the most disadvantaged workers have suffered much higher job loss rates than those who have the option to work remotely. Workers in occupations that required an on-site presence suffered seasonally adjusted employment losses from February to March of about 10 percent, compared to almost no losses for those who could work remotely.\n\nThird, using county-level data, they have demonstrated that Black-owned firms have been almost twice as likely to shutter as small firms overall. In part, they find this results from location, as two-thirds of counties with high levels of Black business activity pre-COVID are in the top 50 COVID-affected areas. It also reflects thinner financial cushions (e.g., smaller cash positions, weaker bank relationships, pre-existing funding gaps) for many of these businesses entering the crisis.\n\nThe Fed's Policy Response: What We've Done\n\nTurning to the Fed's policy response, there are of course limits to what central banks can do to address the uneven impact of a public health shock, or the structural inequities that were in place long before it hit. But we are determined to do what we can to limit the effects. We know from history and statistical studies that avoiding large and persistent spikes of unemployment is critical to preventing inequality from getting worse. The less advantaged tend to lose their jobs first when a recession hits, and the longer they are separated from the labor force, the harder it becomes to get hired back.\n\nKnowing this pattern, the Fed moved with unprecedented speed and scale when the crisis hit. The FOMC cut the policy rate to essentially zero and conducted asset purchases at a record pace. It also used its lender-of-last-resort powers to provide liquidity to dysfunctional markets. With assistance from the Treasury, we provided trillions of dollars in backstop lending support for households, businesses, and state and local governments. The Fed also took action to encourage banks to use their substantial capital and liquidity buffers to support the economy during this time of hardship. Taken together, these actions helped to stabilize the core of our financial system, support the flow of credit to our economy, and counteract the damaging psychology that was taking hold.\n\nAt the FOMC's direction, the Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) at the New York Fed executed many of these policies at an historic scale through repos, asset purchases, and swaps with foreign central banks. To give you a sense of size, since mid-March, the Desk has made gross purchases of around $1.7 trillion of Treasury securities and $1 trillion of agency MBS, including agency CMBS for the first time. Outstanding repos and swaps peaked at nearly $500 billion and $450 billion, respectively.\n\nIn addition, using emergency lending authorities under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, the Fed has stood up 13 temporary credit and liquidity facilities. Each facility was launched with the approval of Treasury, and in most cases, with an explicit Treasury backstop against potential credit losses. The mechanics and targets of each facility differ, but the underlying purpose is fundamentally the same: to support the flow of credit to households, businesses of all sizes and structures, nonprofits, and state and local governments during a time of extraordinary stress. Why was it necessary to have so many facilities? Our financial system is highly complex, and these facilities backstop the various channels in which credit flows to borrowers in the economy, including through loans from banks and nonbanks, through securities issued in capital markets, and through securitizations.\n\nUsage to date across these facilities has not been particularly high. But as I have explained more fully elsewhere, their impact has been large and sustained, and I continue to attribute much of the facilities' initial success to the size, scope, and flexibility of these backstops.3\n\nWe've seen encouraging progress from these policy actions in recent months. As Chair Powell has noted, though, full recovery will take some time.4 Moreover, the timing for fully achieving our goals will depend on more than just our monetary and financial policies. Most important will be our public health authorities' success in containing the virus itself. And fiscal measures, which helped many smaller firms, the unemployed, and lower income households weather the initial stresses of the crisis, will continue to play a critical role in promoting sustained recovery.\n\nThe Fed's Policy Response: How We Implement Also Matters\n\nI'd like to shift away from the Fed's policy actions and explain why their implementation can also make a difference in addressing the unequal impact of the pandemic. Recall that as we launched the facilities, the principles of transparency, governance, and accountability were at the forefront of our execution strategy.\n\nWhy? The Fed, together with Treasury, has been entrusted to deploy large sums of public resources, and transparency is fundamental to our credibility. In practice, this requires clarity in the terms and conditions of the facilities, timely reporting on facility usage, and publication of vendor contracts, just to list a few aspects. Relatedly, we have an obligation to the public to be accountable for all our actions. To maintain the integrity of our actions, this involves strong governance, risk management, and independent oversight, all of which have been implemented for the facilities.\n\nNow that the facilities are operational, our focus is on extending access to the facilities. Access can take two forms: access for borrowers, and access for service providers. Access in the first sense is important to broaden the reach of the facilities, thereby supporting the flow of credit and strengthening backstop support for the economy. The Municipal Liquidity Facility, for example, broadened the program's eligibility so that smaller cities and counties could qualify to participate, expanding the potential issuers from around 75 in the program's original terms to nearly 400 now. The Main Street Lending Program also eased borrowing terms and expanded participation to include nonprofit organizations, which are playing a critical role in supporting disadvantaged communities during the pandemic.\n\nAccess for service providers also matters, for several reasons. First, expanding the reach of our facilities to borrowers requires a broad-based and diverse set of service providers. Second, having a less concentrated set of service providers reduces the New York Fed's dependency on any individual firm, diversifying our risk exposures and enhancing our operational resilience.\n\nThird, we recognize that establishing a broad and diverse set of service providers may also prove beneficial to the service providers themselves, beyond the purely remunerative aspects. Smaller and midsize firms participating in the facilities can offer additional services to their clients, and more broadly, these firms may develop new business relationships and skills and deepen their expertise when operating in the markets for these facilities.\n\nWith this as the motivation, let me review how we are broadening access to the facilities for two primary types of service providers: vendors and counterparties. Starting with vendors, in our effort to contain the damage from the pandemic and speed the launch of the facilities, the Fed directly negotiated with several outside vendors to accelerate the rollout of various facilities and to supplement our areas of internal expertise. Our initial vendor selections prioritized scale and, in many cases, the ability to dedicate a large team of personnel behind a wall of confidentiality.\n\nThis approach proved successful in launching our facilities at maximum speed, but our strategy from the beginning has been to diversify our vendor base in the post-launch phase. Importantly, all of the contracts the New York Fed has signed are short term; each has a provision to cancel with 30 days' notice. Given this flexibility, we are evaluating all contracts after 90 days, with priority on re-bidding those that were not competitively bid. The New York Fed will shortly commence a competitive bidding process for some of these vendor roles. This process includes a potential modification of the current scope of work for our vendor relationships, with a focus on carving out additional roles that might create new opportunities for a broader group of firms, including smaller vendors. Staff on the facilities are currently finalizing their competitive bidding strategies, and we expect to issue RFPs in the next several weeks.\n\nTurning to counterparties, in late July we announced an initiative to expand the set of counterparties that transact with several of the facilities. Specifically, the New York Fed is seeking to establish roles for non-primary dealer counterparties to serve as commercial paper dealers, eligible sellers, and agents for the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF), the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF), and the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), respectively. These three facilities currently rely exclusively on the New York Fed's primary dealers, but the scale and scope of their activities make them well suited for an expanded counterparty base, particularly as we try to reach broader segments of the economy. This initiative represents a major step forward in our efforts to engage with small-to-midsize broker-dealers, including minority-, women-, and veteran-owned business enterprises (MWVBEs), as well as smaller businesses and investors that transact with these broker-dealers. Indeed, we have explicitly encouraged MWVBEs to apply, and I'm pleased to share that just yesterday we announced the addition of seven new broker-dealers for the SMCCF and two CPFF dealers, including several MWVBEs.\n\nWe have planned an open and rolling application process for these roles and intend to name additional counterparties in the weeks ahead. Complementing this effort, the New York Fed also announced a parallel process last week whereby firms may also apply to become agency CMBS dealers to support the Desk's purchases of agency CMBS.\n\nIn closing, let me finish where I started. In this time of pain and hardship, we have choices to make in how we respond, and the opportunity before us is to create generational opportunities for a broad and inclusive set of businesses to help advance an equitable recovery. I look forward to partnering with you on this work for years to come."

    "date": "Sep 8, 2020",
    "speaker": "Lacey Dingman",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2020/din200908",
    "content": "Chairwoman Beatty, Ranking Member Wagner, and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to discuss the role of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2019s (New York Fed) Office of Minority and Women Inclusion (OMWI) in diversity and inclusion at the New York Fed.  I am Lacey Dingman, Chief Human Resources Officer and OMWI Director at the New York Fed.  My pronouns are she, her, and hers.\n\nIn April of this year, we released our 2019 Annual Report to Congress (Report).1 I am pleased to report that the New York Fed continues to strengthen its diversity and inclusion programs and make progress toward building a more inclusive culture. As New York Fed President and CEO John C. Williams notes in the Report:  \u201c[D]iversity and inclusion are key to effectively fulfilling our public service mission.  Incorporating varied perspectives in our work yields more creative solutions and better results.  Making a difference for those we serve in the community and enhancing the experience for those who work here is a key priority.\u201d\n\nWe have continued to make progress on the three main areas of our diversity and inclusion strategy: our people, our procurement, and our community.  As of 2019, 41% of our new hires were women and 50% were minorities.  We also recently recruited a diverse intern class, 58% of whom were minorities.  Further, we continue to strive for diversity in our Board of Directors\u2014which, as of 2019, included one Hispanic male, one Hispanic female, one Black male, one Black female, four white males, and one white female\u2014and in our team of executive vice presidents\u2014which now includes one Black male, one Black female, one Hispanic male, an Asian American male, three white males, and four white females.  This year, against the backdrop of a global pandemic, we have continued to prioritize and even expand our efforts across the three areas of our diversity and inclusion strategy.\n\nOur People\n\nAt the core of our diversity and inclusion strategy is the New York Fed\u2019s most important asset: our people.  The New York Fed is one of 12 regional Reserve Banks in the Federal Reserve System and serves the Federal Reserve\u2019s Second District.  The New York Fed has approximately 3,100 employees and is the largest Reserve Bank in terms of assets and volume of activity.  Through all of our efforts, we are looking to foster a culture of inclusion that gives our employees the ability to do their best work.  We must recruit, retain, and support a workforce that brings different perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences to bear on our work. Importantly, while we can recognize the progress made on our goals, we must continue to actively push for diversity and inclusion across our workforce and our workplace.\n\nOur diversity recruiting efforts include working with business leaders across the New York Fed to ensure that diverse slates of candidates are considered for open positions and that diverse slates of interviewers are engaged in the recruitment and hiring process.  We have contracts with seven search firms, all of which have strong diversity practices and/or are minority-owned.  In addition, the use of metrics around diversity hiring and retention allows us to better track progress and continue to strive for our goals across the organization and at the business-area level.  We continue to leverage diversity partner organizations (DPOs) and universities to develop a diverse pipeline and build awareness of the New York Fed as an employer of choice.  This year, we partnered with four new DPOs, including Disability:IN, Edge4Vets, Women in Cybersecurity, and Working Mother.   We conduct an annual evaluation of how we can broaden our hiring pools, with the goal of cultivating a diverse pipeline that reflects the skills we need at all levels of experience.  We participate in several national diversity recruiting conferences and host several pipeline programs to recruit diverse candidates.\n\nOur talent development programs build an effective talent pipeline focused on inclusion.  All staff have completed a course that introduces the business case for diversity and helps participants recognize inclusive behaviors.  We have delivered unconscious bias awareness sessions to several business groups.  Through our 10 Resource Networks, we continue to advance the dialogue on inclusion by providing forums where our people can build relationships with one another, host programs throughout the year to discuss timely topics, and work to bring forward key issues to the leadership of the New York Fed.  Our Resource Networks are an integral component of how we work to further inclusion.  We are fortunate in Human Resources to have the support of over 1500 employees in our Resource Networks helping to lead these efforts.\n\nOne challenge with respect to recruitment is the strong competition for diverse talent with specialized skills and/or advanced study within the financial services industry in New York City.  We recognize this challenge and we continue to work to find ways to ensure that we remain an attractive employer for diverse talent.  While we are gratified with the progress we have made in hiring diverse candidates, we have much more work to do to ensure that our workforce reflects the diversity of our communities in the Second District, especially with respect to Black and Hispanic populations.  In addition, recruiting and developing diverse candidates for senior management and senior leadership positions is a high priority.  Our goal beyond hiring diverse talent at all levels is to ensure that we retain diverse talent and that all our employees have opportunities to grow, be challenged, and develop meaningful careers.\n\nOur Procurement\n\nNow I will turn to the New York Fed\u2019s efforts to enhance business and supplier diversity.  We seek to promote an environment that provides access and opportunity for minority- and women-owned business enterprises seeking to do business with the New York Fed.  We continue to engage with diversity business organizations and industry groups, integrate supplier diversity practices into our core procurement processes, and conduct outreach to further develop our database of diverse firms.  We are an active member of nine organizations that support diverse supplier classifications, and we have assigned dedicated staff to each of these organizations in an effort to maximize a strong relationship management model.  We utilize several diverse supplier search databases to identify suppliers to include in our procurement activities.\n\nIn 2019, we provided technical assistance, guidance, and support to small and diverse businesses within the Second District through on-site programs we sponsored.  These events provided a view into our acquisition process and existing procurement opportunities, and offered insights to enable diverse suppliers to improve their respective operating models and business development strategies.  We participated in external outreach events where we engaged with new diverse vendors, and in Federal Reserve System-wide initiatives to achieve greater public awareness of supplier diversity.  We developed a tool to align reporting of supplier diversity across the Federal Reserve System.\n\nMore recently, we have worked to bring our strategy of diversifying business and vendor relationships to the emergency lending facilities established by the Federal Reserve Board under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act (Facilities) and to our open market operations.  The New York Fed is committed to encouraging diversity and inclusion in our implementation of the Facilities.  As we announced on July 23, we are striving to expand the pool of counterparties and agents for the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF), the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF), and the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF).  We engaged in outreach to minority-, women-, and veteran-owned business enterprises (MWVBEs) and encouraged them to apply for these roles.  We expect all applicants to provide information about their equal opportunity and diversity processes, including efforts to promote the fair inclusion of women, minorities, and veterans in their workforces.  We will announce the first wave of expanded counterparties and agents, which will include MWVBEs, in the coming days.  In addition, as noted on our website, we strongly encourage eligible issuers for the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility (PMCCF) to utilize MWVBE underwriters in the PMCCF process where possible.  As we announced last Friday, we also seek to expand the pool of counterparties for our Trading Desk\u2019s agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (Agency CMBS) purchases, and we encourage MWVBEs to apply for these roles.  Last, we are commencing a competitive bidding process for vendor roles for the Facilities and our open market operations, and re-scoping existing roles to make them more accessible to MWVBEs.\n\nWhile we are encouraged by our progress in diversifying our business and vendor relationships, we have much more work to do to increase our partnerships with diverse businesses.  Ensuring that MWVBEs have the opportunity to do business with the New York Fed is a high priority.  We will continue to develop our strategic partnerships with diversity business organizations and look for opportunities to sponsor programs that can help small and diverse businesses access capital and build their capacity.\n\nOur Community\n\nNow I will share our progress in our community development, economic education, and outreach programs.  Our outreach mission furthers the New York Fed\u2019s commitment to the Second District by listening to the communities we serve and developing programs, analysis, and sponsored conferences and clinics to help meet their needs.  Our education programs serve diverse populations, and we continue to focus those efforts on educators and students in low- and moderate-income communities, serving over 100 Title I high school groups.2 We continue to deliver survey data on small businesses, including through special reports on Black- and women-owned firms.  We collaborate on a national survey partnership of the 12 Reserve Banks called the Small Business Credit Survey.  In 2019, we joined the other Reserve Banks to deploy the National Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Survey.  We also launched the Community Development Finance (CoDeFi) Progression Model in Puerto Rico, as well as Investment Connection, which connects financing institutions with organizations that have CRA-eligible community and economic development proposals.\n\nThe New York Fed has also been active in highlighting the impacts of COVID-19 on minority communities.  Since March 2020, our Research Group has devoted its economic research blog, Liberty Street Economics, almost exclusively to COVID-19-related topics, including the disproportionate impacts of the pandemic on minority communities.  We also published a study on the effects of COVID-19 on Black-owned businesses.  For a full list of recent articles that we have published relating to economic conditions in minority communities, please see Appendix A.  This year, we launched a policy series called Economic Inequality, in which policy influencers and practitioners discuss economic inequality and equitable growth.  The next installment will look at the impacts of COVID-19 on communities of color. \n\nWe also supported the System\u2019s responses to workforce development needs during the COVID-19 crisis, and convened specialists across the Federal Reserve System to identify workforce development challenges.  This month, the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation will air a segment on equitable economic recovery, featuring our President, John Williams; the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\u2019s President, Raphael Bostic; and your colleagues, Representatives Alma Adams (D-N.C.), Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.), Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.), and David Scott (D-Ga.).\n\nIn the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the New York Fed has openly embraced its role in promoting a more equitable and inclusive economy by working on these and other diversity and inclusion initiatives.  As we have emphasized to our employees and to the communities we serve, the New York Fed stands with all those who oppose racism, hate, and violence, and joins them in a shared desire to root out the intolerable inequities and injustice grounded in systemic racism that persist in our society.  We are dedicated to understanding and finding solutions to the numerous forms of inequality that communities of color experience and to working with communities in our District to address deep-seated inequities.  We are committed to working for a more equitable economy and society for all. \n\nConclusion\n\nDiversity and inclusion have been and will continue to be core considerations in the New York Fed\u2019s recruitment, procurement practices, outreach, and partnerships across the Second District.  While we have made progress on our goals, we continue to expand our diversity and inclusion objectives, and we strive for continuous improvement.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to testify today about the role of the OMWI in diversity and inclusion at the New York Fed.  I am happy to answer any questions that you may have."

    "content": "Thank you, Bill. It's great to be with you today, at least virtually, and I am looking forward to our discussion. But before we dive in, I thought I would offer some thoughts on the announcement made last week about the completion of the Federal Open Market Committee's review of its monetary policy framework and the issuance of a new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.1\n\nBefore I continue\u2014and you know what comes next, Bill\u2014let me give the usual disclaimer that the views I express are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAllow me to add one last \"before\" caveat. Before I explain the new statement, it is important to reflect on the context in which the original statement was issued. Then I'll share how the monetary policy framework of today positions us best to achieve our goals and manage the very challenging environment that lies ahead.\n\nThe original consensus statement was issued back in January 2012 and represented an important step in the Committee's progress toward greater transparency around its goals and strategy. It incorporated key aspects of flexible inflation targeting, a monetary policy framework that had gained wide acceptance around the world.\n\nThis framework served us well, but the need for change was clear. In the past eight years, basic facts that shaped the original framework have fundamentally changed.\n\nFirst and foremost is the dramatic decline in the neutral interest rate, that is, the short-term interest expected to prevail when the economy is operating at its full potential and inflation is at its longer-run target. Since January 2012, FOMC participants' median estimate of the neutral nominal rate has fallen by 1-3/4 percentage points, from 4.25 percent to 2.5 percent. A similar decline is seen in private sector forecasts and bond yields.2 This secular decline in interest rates is not limited to the United States\u2014we're seeing it across the globe\u2014and it reflects longer-run trends in demographics, productivity, and other factors that are unlikely to reverse anytime soon.3\n\nLower neutral interest rates constrain the ability of monetary policy to offset negative shocks to the economy. This effect has been seen most clearly in the behavior of inflation. Over the past decade, inflation in the United States has been below our 2 percent longer-run target most of the time, and measures of inflation expectations have drifted down.\n\nThese declines in trend inflation and inflation expectations can create a pernicious feedback loop of reduced policy space and even lower inflation expectations. Again, this experience is not unique to the United States, indicating that it stems from factors common across countries, rather than issues unique to our economy. Indeed, most inflation-targeting advanced economies have struggled to achieve their inflation goals on a sustained basis over the past decade.\n\nThis brings us to last week's announcement and the issuance of a new consensus statement of our policy framework. It is a culmination of extensive outreach and conversations with communities and stakeholders across the country, careful and thorough analysis, and active discussion and debate among Committee participants.4,5 We took important lessons from the experience of the past decade, reassessed the evidence, and looked at the challenges ahead of us. All this effort was worth it: this new statement means we are better positioned to achieve our goals. In fact, the process worked so well, we've committed to repeating it roughly every five years!\n\nThe new framework statement directly and effectively addresses the problems caused by a low neutral rate and persistently low inflation.\n\nFirst, it stipulates that, following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, a temporary overshooting of the longer-run inflation target will likely be desirable to keep inflation and inflation expectations centered on 2 percent. Second, it makes clear that we seek inflation that averages 2 percent over time, consistent with our longer-run target. Finally, the statement makes unequivocally clear that we seek maximum employment and will aim to eliminate shortfalls from this broad and inclusive goal. These changes are mutually reinforcing and will meaningfully improve our ability to achieve both of our dual mandate goals in an environment of a very low neutral rate.\n\nI'll conclude with this: The new framework represents both an important evolution in our thinking about how to achieve our goals and another step toward greater transparency. It reaffirms key aspects of the original statement that have stood the test of time and refines others in line with experience and evolving practices. It also makes some more significant changes in light of developments and lessons learned in recent years. And most importantly, it positions us for success in achieving our maximum employment and price stability goals in the future."

    "title": "Recent Global Developments and Central Bank Responsibilities in a Changing Risk Landscape",
    "date": "Aug 5, 2020",
    "speaker": "Unknown",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2020/sin200805",
    "content": "It's an honor to be invited to speak to you.1 Let me begin by offering my best wishes to you and your loved ones in these challenging times.\n\nSince its inception in the early 1980s, SEACEN has been the learning hub for central banks in the Asia-Pacific Region, tasked with the important mission of building capacity in central banking and fostering networking and collaboration. As a strategic partner of SEACEN, the Federal Reserve is a proud supporter of SEACEN's mission and has been a longstanding collaborator on several SEACEN courses.\n\nThis event opens a new chapter in our partnership. Through the coordination of the New York Fed, the world's major reserve currency central banks, which I'll refer to collectively as the Official Sector Service Providers, have collaborated with SEACEN and Bank Negara Malaysia for the first time on a joint training event focused on official cross-border payment operations and risk topics.2 \n\nThe upcoming sessions are timely and relevant for all central banks, but especially those in the Asia-Pacific region. The cross-border payment risk landscape is quickly evolving and all central banks must cooperate to stay ahead of highly adaptive cyber threat actors that, in recent years, have targeted the payment and reserve management operations of central banks. Unprecedented shifts in working arrangements due to COVID-19 only strengthen this imperative, especially in a region with some of the world's largest FX reserve holders.\n\nIn my remarks today, I'll offer some observations on the recent global backdrop and related risks and opportunities. I will then share my view on the responsibilities of, first, OSSPs as your service providers; second, central banks collectively in the current risk environment; and third, account holders in helping OSSPs better secure your reserve assets.\n\nBefore proceeding, let me provide the usual disclaimer that the views expressed here are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Federal Reserve System, or other Official Sector Service Providers.\n\nRecent global macro backdrop, emerging risks and opportunities\nWe meet today as all of our economies seek to recover from the deepest global economic contraction in our living memory, following widespread lockdowns to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe uncertain outlook triggered unprecedented market volatility and the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Advanced economies have seen an historic rise in fiscal deficits and debt issuance to offset sharp contractions in economic activity. Emerging markets faced record capital outflows \u2013 over $80 billion in March alone \u2013 exceeding the pace and scale of any previous stress episode, including the Global Financial Crisis. In the race to safety, U.S. dollars became increasingly scarce, intensifying the stress across global markets as dollar funding and hedging costs spiked, and prompting large-scale liquidations of foreign currency reserves across the globe.\n\nThese challenges reinforced the importance of close cooperation among central banks. To respond to global dollar funding strains, over a span of two weeks in late-March, we took coordinated action with other central banks, including several OSSPs, to enhance the provision of liquidity via our standing U.S. dollar liquidity swap line arrangements, and established temporary swap lines with nine additional central banks. We also established a new FIMA repo facility to support dollar liquidity to a broader range of countries.3 The extension of this umbrella of liquidity was unparalleled in its rapidity and global reach, consistent with a pandemic-induced sudden stop in the global economy and the changed contours of global dollar funding markets over the past decade.4 These actions have helped to restore calm to dollar funding markets and support a return to more normal conditions in global financial markets more generally, permitting a stabilization in global FX reserves.\n\nThe Asia-Pacific region has been on the leading edge of the crisis, offering important lessons for the rest of us. Asia made early progress in flattening the curve of infections and is now further along in its economic recovery. While Asian jurisdictions faced some of the most significant portfolio outflows in March, these have started to rebound and funding stresses have subsided. Nonetheless, collectively, we must remain prepared for the risks of further pressure on all fronts \u2013 including health outcomes, economic performance, and market functioning.\n\nAs we focus on the ongoing crises, I don't want to lose sight of some of the key risks and opportunities facing central banks going forward. I'll highlight two.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic already appears to be accelerating the shift to digital payments, particularly contactless payments, amid public concerns around virus transmission through cash. As this trend proceeds, so will attention on central banks to provide enabling infrastructure and technology to support fast, convenient, and safe digital payments for households and businesses, both domestically and across borders. Recent surveys show that most central banks now are engaged in some form of work on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), including several in the Asia-Pacific region that have announced pilot projects, which could provide important test cases, including on cross-border payments.5 At the Federal Reserve, we are also collaborating with other central banks to advance our collective understanding of CBDCs. Important considerations for any potential CBDC include whether it would reduce operational vulnerabilities and complexity in payments, and also what would be required in terms of cross-border cooperation for CBDCs to address current frictions and reduce costs in cross-border payments.\n\nSeparately, a number of OSSP members have moved to establish faster payments systems domestically. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve last August announced plans to develop a new real-time payments and settlement service called the FedNowSM Service to support faster retail payments in the U.S. and which could also serve as the foundation for future innovation.6\n\nClimate risks, with potential far-reaching implications for our economies, are also increasingly coming onto the agenda of central banks. A recent BIS survey found a large majority of central banks saw scope to include sustainability in their reserve management objectives over time. Of course this would need to be balanced with liquidity, safety and return considerations.7 With many central banks now engaged in corporate bond purchase programs, and markets for green bonds starting to mature \u2013 including with increasing sovereign issuance \u2013 OSSP events such as these could be forums to share experiences and best practices.\n\nResponsibilities of the major reserve currency service providers\nLet me now turn to the role of OSSPs in the current environment. In collaborating on events such as these, OSSPs are keenly aware of the special responsibilities that come along with being issuing authorities for the world's major reserve currencies. These responsibilities can be viewed from two perspectives\u2014one global, one domestic.\n\nThe first responsibility relates to the role of OSSPs in supporting global financial stability. The network of account relationships between OSSPs and their official accountholders, both in Asia and elsewhere, provides vital channels through which global financial stability operations occur. OSSPs have a responsibility to ensure that this network maintains an operational capacity to distribute, when necessary, emergency liquidity to critical segments of the global economy. In exigent circumstances, not having this pre-established and direct transmission capacity could be debilitating for the timely and effective provision of emergency cross-border liquidity.8 This network has proven its value time and time again, both historically and during the current COVID crisis.9\n\nA second responsibility relates to the trust and confidence that the world's central banks place in OSSPs for their self-insurance and investment needs. As you all know, the world's foreign reserve assets are denominated in just a small handful of currencies\u2014those that are issued by the OSSPs, with the U.S. dollar alone accounting for approximately 60% of global FX reserves. A large share of the most liquid of these assets, representing approximately 50% of total global foreign currency reserves, are held directly in accounts with OSSPs. OSSPs also recognize, that for most countries, the foreign reserves held with them comprise a significant portion of their account holders' national wealth and investment capital.10\n\nFor these reasons, OSSPs take their obligations seriously to provide safe, confidential, and reliable services to the global official community. We take seriously our obligation to ensure our services are operationally ready for central banks to execute critical cross-border financial operations. We take seriously our obligation to safeguard valuable national capital upon which can hinge the prosperity of nations. We do this by ensuring high levels of operational resilience and risk management. And we do this by recognizing that the stature of being a reserve currency must be earned through sound policies and institutions and should not be taken for granted.11\n\nResponsibilities of all central banks in the current landscape\nIn the current threat landscape, however, all central banks must continually rededicate themselves to the task of securing their assets and operations. While we have made progress in understanding the nature of the threats, the sophistication of criminal actors means we need to constantly reassess these risks, any potential impact to account operations, and the strength of our defenses. For central banks, as owners, operators, overseers, and users of critical financial market infrastructures, this is a paramount calling.\n\nThe COVID crisis and shifts to alternative working arrangements have only heightened this imperative. While there have been some pleasant surprises in terms of our ability to fall back on contingency postures to support critical operations, we must gird ourselves for the possibility of a new normal in our physical work settings and remote working expectations. We must manage this transition carefully without a lowering of standards and controls for the sake of convenience.\n\nThis might be self-evident to a central banking crowd. We understand that on the issue of strengthening internal controls and cyber defenses, the question is often not one of intentions but one of resources or capabilities. Remediating deficiencies may require a substantial and often challenging re-orientation of priorities and resources. But so long as there is a weak link in the cyber security chain, cybercriminals will seek to exploit it. The cross-jurisdictional nature of the risks, spillovers, and solutions, also requires that central banks be open to stronger international cooperation and dialogue. This forum and the OSSPs' collective presence here are a clear signal of our willingness to engage in such dialogue.\n\nHow customers can work with OSSPs to help themselves better secure their assets\nOver the coming weeks, you will hear many specific messages from the OSSPs on topics ranging from endpoint security, anti-money laundering and sanctions regulations, incident response, third party payments, and others. An overarching message is that we should strengthen collaboration and share experiences to help raise standards internally within our organizations and raise standards externally across the community.\n\nWhat does raising standards within our organizations look like?\n\nIt means areas performing banking operations should first identify and monitor risks and ensure there are robust controls in place to mitigate those risks. This may require pushing for greater accountability through independent assessments. But it also means recognizing that effective risk management requires collaboration across our organizations and outside them. Certain risks may be outside our functional responsibility as banking operations specialists, such as security for information technology systems, but they may greatly impact our ability to conduct business. So collaborate as necessary with other internal departments, other agencies such as ministries of finance, and service providers. Highlight the business in being an active participant in these discussions and in flagging potential vulnerabilities. And be advocates for stronger controls and risk focus more broadly.\n\nRaising internal standards also means preparing and exercising incident response and contingency plans. No matter how much we invest in our defenses, we must assume that not all incidents can be prevented. In such cases, speed is critical to contain the damage and potential financial losses. Make preparations with your service provider; plan outside coordination and communication ahead of time; understand what your service provider can and can't do in an incident; and finally, exercise your playbook. OSSPs would be happy to engage in dialogue with accountholders on how we can support your incident response planning.\n\nWhat does raising standards externally across the community look like?\n\nFirst, it means expecting better and more responsive communication with each other. Reliable communication channels between OSSPs and our accountholders are more essential than ever, not only to respond to time-sensitive matters, but also to address more routine issues.12 The COVID crisis has forced many of us into becoming more familiar with video conferencing. Efforts should be made to make video conferencing even more reliable and routine even after we return to the office.\n\nRaising standards externally also means open and transparent information sharing with each other on our expectations, guidance, and risk management practices and controls.13 It means seeking and sharing important transactional information to support OSSP compliance screening, including completing SWIFT message fields thoroughly and accurately. It means being willing to share insights on the payment origination flow, internal controls, technology systems, and other aspects to support \"know your customer\" (KYC) programs. It means sharing SWIFT Customer Security Program (CSP) data. While greater openness can lead to a sense of vulnerability, it can also inspire greater trust and thus more timely service provision.14\n\nConclusion\nDistinguished participants, let me conclude by wishing you all fruitful meetings and discussions in the weeks ahead.  This forum is a great example of the collective collaboration that will be required to keep our assets and operations secure. The OSSPs come here with a spirit of humbleness and a desire to understand the perspectives of our Asia-Pacific account holders. This is borne out of a keen sense of the trust you place in us as stewards of your foreign reserves and a recognition that we all face similar challenges in protecting ourselves against the threats to our cross-border operations.\n\nThanks for listening."

    "content": "Good morning. Over the past four months we have experienced a series of unprecedented events. The pandemic, social distancing, and the economic fallout have transformed all of our lives. This summer, many Americans will be grieving the loss of loved ones, and many more will be faced with financial hardship and concern about the uncertainty of the future.\n\nThe pandemic has caused a deep recession and levels of unemployment we've not experienced in our lifetimes. At the Federal Reserve, we are working tirelessly to address the economic damage caused by the coronavirus and to put the economy back on a path toward achieving our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nIn the first half of March, as the pandemic began to unfold in the U.S., the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered the federal funds rate effectively to zero. Bringing the policy rate down to this low level reduced interest rates across the economy, making it easier for households and businesses to meet their borrowing needs and fostering favorable financial conditions.\n\nBeyond these monetary policy actions, we have taken many additional measures to promote the stability of the financial system and to support the flow of credit. Today, I'm going to focus my remarks on these measures and detail their significance for supporting the economy.\n\nBut before I continue, let me give the usual disclaimer that the views I express are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nA Lesson from History\n\nEnsuring liquid and smoothly functioning financial markets are essential roles of central banks, like the Federal Reserve. Yet, it's often poorly understood why these roles are so important for the health of the broader economy.\n\nIt was the financial crisis that erupted in 1907 that led to the creation of the Federal Reserve System, and as we've planned and executed our response to the current crisis, it's this history lesson I keep returning to.\n\nA number of shocks, beginning with the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, led to a run on the banks in 1907. The run on the banks was stemmed by emergency loans from a consortium of private banks, called the New York Clearing House. But a run on less regulated trusts, the \"shadow banks\" of that time, could not be similarly curtailed.1\n\nJ.P. Morgan brought together a group of young bankers, including Benjamin Strong, who would go on to become the first head of the New York Fed, to examine the books of the trusts. They made loans to the trusts they judged solvent, but the Knickerbocker Trust, the second-largest in the country, did not make the cut, and its collapse precipitated panic throughout financial markets. To stem that panic, Morgan and his banking colleagues lent more generously to the surviving trusts.\n\nThe consequence of these events was a severe recession, and the U.S. economy contracted more than 10 percent. As a result of the financial sector's inability to contain recurring financial panics, Congress realized the need for the public sector to step in, a process that led in 1913 to the creation of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAn Unprecedented Challenge\n\nReturning to more recent events, as the pandemic began to unfold in the U.S., we saw intense strain and disruption to financial markets. In response, the Federal Reserve has taken a set of strong and decisive actions to supply liquidity and to assure the continued flow of credit in the economy.2\n\nThe unique nature of this recession\u2014a global pandemic\u2014has required us to design an innovative response. Some of our actions have the hallmarks of those taken during the 2008 financial crisis, but many more have required a fresh approach.\n\nAs uncertainty about the coronavirus took hold, we saw disruptions in short-term funding markets. Markets for Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, which are normally highly liquid and form the bedrock of our financial system, nearly buckled under the strain of massive flows of funds in response to the pandemic.3\n\nIt's easy to think of financial markets as somewhat divorced from the real economy\u2014most people will never need to worry about a spike in the repo rate or liquidity in the Treasury market. But the reality is that like the events of 1907\u2014and more recently 2008\u2014turmoil in financial markets can have a devastating impact on the wider economy. If credit isn't flowing, people can't finance the purchase of a home, businesses can't invest, and nonprofit organizations and municipalities can't keep essential services going.\n\nThis is why safeguarding the functioning of financial markets is essential for the health of the broader economy.\n\nIn response to the extraordinary volatility caused by the pandemic, the Fed greatly expanded its repo operations and began purchasing sizable quantities of U.S. Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities.\n\nThese actions to provide massive liquidity have proven successful. They restored market functioning and averted what could have been a much more severe pullback from markets and the flow of credit to households and businesses.4\n\nDeploying Our Tools\n\nIn addition to the repo operations and asset purchases, we have established a number of programs to support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments.5\n\nI won't go into detail about all of the facilities, but I will emphasize two important points. First, they demonstrate the Fed's strong commitment to prevent lasting damage to the economy. Second, the scale and reach of the response is an indication of the gravity and unique nature of the situation we are facing.\n\nAlthough the facilities differ in important ways, reflecting the specifics of markets and sectors, they all share the goal of keeping credit flowing to households, businesses small and large, and other key segments of the economy.\n\nSince the announcements and rollouts of the various facilities, we have seen a significant improvement in the pricing and availability of credit.6\n\nSomewhat paradoxically, despite the clear effect that these facilities have had on the availability of credit, actual take-up of the facilities has been relatively low. But this is in fact a measure of success\u2014the existence of the facilities, even in a backstop role, has helped boost confidence to the point where borrowers are able to access credit from the private market at affordable rates.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Federal Reserve does not act alone. As my colleague Chair Powell says, \"The Fed has lending powers, not spending powers.\"7 Sound healthcare policy and the ability of fiscal authorities to put cash directly in the hands of Americans are both essential for the economy to endure this devastating episode.\n\nConclusion\n\nI'll conclude with this: If the history of central banking teaches us one thing, it's that \"necessity is the mother of invention.\" Severe crises demand innovative and decisive responses, and the Federal Reserve is striving to deliver just that."

    "content": "It is a pleasure to join you virtually today. I\u2019m grateful to SIFMA for the kind invitation to discuss the Federal Reserve\u2019s ongoing asset purchases and to all of you here today for your interest in the smooth functioning of financial markets.1\n\nIn response to the severe economic shock associated with the Covid-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve is committed to using all of its tools to achieve its goals of maximum employment and price stability. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has cut the target range for the federal funds rate close to zero. Additionally, the Fed has taken a wide range of steps\u2014many in coordination with the U.S. Treasury\u2014to support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments. These steps have targeted many different parts of the financial system and economy. Liquidity tools are supporting funding markets. Credit facilities are helping to ensure that small businesses, corporations, and state and local governments have access to credit. And, regulations have been temporarily adjusted to encourage bank lending. Another important measure, and the focus of my talk today, is the asset purchases that we have conducted at an unprecedented scale and speed to support the smooth functioning of markets for Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS)\u2014both of which play crucial roles in the American financial system and economy.\n\nIn early to mid-March, amid extreme volatility across the financial system, the functioning of Treasury and agency MBS markets became severely impaired. Given the importance of these markets, continued dysfunction would have led to an even deeper and broader seizing up of credit markets and ultimately worsened the financial hardships that many Americans have been experiencing as a result of the pandemic.2 The FOMC responded quickly and decisively with substantial purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS, and then demonstrated an even more forceful commitment to market functioning by directing the Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) to make purchases \u201cin the amounts needed to support the smooth functioning of markets\u201d for those securities.3\n\nAsset purchases are a standard tool of monetary policy implementation. Traditionally, the Desk has used Treasury purchases to maintain the supply of reserves in accordance with the FOMC\u2019s policy implementation regime. Following the Global Financial Crisis, the FOMC used asset purchases primarily to exert downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, or in the case of MBS to ease mortgage rates, when the federal funds rate was at its effective lower bound. The purchases during this most recent episode have been distinct in both their purpose, to address disruptions in market functioning, and their scale and speed, which have been unparalleled. As shown in Figure 1, System Open Market Account (SOMA) securities holdings grew at an extraordinary pace, with purchases totaling more than $100 billion on some days. Cumulatively, the purchases since mid-March have totaled $1.7 trillion of Treasuries and more than $800 billion of agency MBS,4 which represents the vast majority of the overall $2.6 trillion increase in the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet since then, as shown in Figure 2.\n\nTo assess the pace of purchases needed to support market functioning, we used extensive metrics along with our best judgment. The initial rapid pace of purchases was motivated by a severe breakdown in the functioning of these markets. As market functioning improved, we substantially slowed our pace of purchases. Most recently, at its June meeting, the FOMC decided to increase holdings of Treasuries and agency MBS \u201cat least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning.\u201d\n\nToday, I\u2019d like to talk about the disruption we saw and the steps we took in response. I will focus on three broad questions. First, what is smooth market functioning and why does it matter? Second, how have our asset purchases supported smooth market functioning? And third, how will we structure purchases to sustain market functioning over coming months and remain vigilant against renewed deterioration? Let me note that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhat Is Smooth Market Functioning, and Why Does it Matter?\n\nBefore I describe our response to the recent crisis, I want to share how we think about smooth functioning in Treasury and agency MBS markets, and why it is so critical to the U.S. economy. I\u2019ll focus on what we perceive as two important characteristics of smoothly functioning markets: liquidity and efficient pricing.5\n\nLiquidity comes in many forms. One form of liquidity is the availability of financing for existing or new positions. I think of this as funding liquidity. Another form of liquidity is the ease with which assets can be bought and sold, often called market liquidity. Although these concepts are distinct, they are related and reinforcing.6 When funding liquidity is abundant, market participants can finance the transactions that produce market liquidity. My comments today focus on how we have used asset purchases to support market liquidity, but I do want to note that the steps the Federal Reserve took at the same time to support funding markets almost certainly contributed to market liquidity. In fact, funding markets are now functioning quite well. As a result, as you can see in Figure 3, which is a close-up of my previous chart, our repo book has rolled off over recent months and is now down to zero, and usage of most other funding programs has also diminished.\n\nLiquid markets allow participants to transact quickly and at low cost, so they can easily adjust their positions in response to their own changing circumstances or broader economic developments. In normal conditions, the markets for Treasury securities and MBS are highly liquid. Confidence in the liquidity of Treasuries persuades investors to accept lower yields on these securities,7 and because Treasury interest rates are a benchmark for many other rates, these lower yields ultimately reduce borrowing costs for families, businesses, and state and local governments. Similarly, the liquidity of agency MBS helps investors to transact quickly and efficiently in residential mortgage loans, which results in lower mortgage interest rates for households. Supporting the liquidity of these markets has been an important component of the Federal Reserve\u2019s actions to bolster the flow of credit and the effective transmission of monetary policy during the pandemic.\n\nTurning to efficient pricing, one can always debate whether any given asset price is right. However, we generally expect prices of instruments with identical or very similar cash flows to be closely connected, so opportunities for arbitrage are limited, and relative value spreads are small. In smoothly functioning markets, if prices of related instruments diverge, arbitrageurs sell the securities with high prices and buy those with low prices, profiting from the difference and pushing the prices back together. When arbitrage breaks down, the resulting mispricings make financial markets less useful for risk management and investment, which can ultimately restrict the flow of capital in the economy.\n\nIn practice, market liquidity is never perfect, and pricing discrepancies are never entirely eliminated. Liquidity providers\u2014who buy securities from clients who wish to sell, and then look for other clients who wish to buy\u2014are compensated for this service in the form of bid-ask spreads or other transaction costs. Likewise, investors do not exploit all arbitrage opportunities, because arbitrage typically requires capital and funding and entails transaction costs, as well as the risk of loss if the price difference widens rather than narrows. As a result, prices of closely related securities can sometimes diverge. Still, when the Treasury and agency MBS markets are functioning smoothly, transaction costs and price divergences should typically be small.\n\nMarkets are complex. No one indicator can show whether a given market is functioning smoothly. On the Desk, we use a suite of complementary categories of indicators to assess the functioning of Treasury and agency MBS markets. Without diving too deeply into these indicators, I\u2019ve summarized the categories in Figure 4. The first category includes direct measures of liquidity, such as bid-ask spreads, price impact coefficients and market depth.8 The second category includes direct measures of relative value, such as the Treasury cash-futures basis, on-the-run spreads, spline errors, and MBS-Treasury yield spreads. The remaining categories contain indirect metrics. Instead of showing how well markets are functioning, these metrics reveal forces that can lead to breakdowns of liquidity and efficient pricing. In particular, we look at measures of trading pressure, which can show whether there is an imbalance between the volume of sales and the volume of purchases, and at the results of our open market operations, which can provide signals about the intensity of market participants\u2019 desire to sell securities as well as other market conditions.\n\nHow Have the Federal Reserve\u2019s Asset Purchases Supported Smooth Market Functioning?\n\nThe extreme shock to the economy and financial markets as the pandemic spread in early March led to a swift and severe deterioration in the functioning of the Treasury and MBS markets. Pessimism and uncertainty about the economic outlook as large segments of the economy were shut down, combined with concerns about markets\u2019 ability to keep functioning in a remote environment, resulted in a strong desire for cash. In addition, the extreme volatility and its effect on risk metrics and margins meant that some normally profitable trades were no longer viable.\n\nInvestors and asset managers responded by rebalancing their portfolios, deleveraging, and acquiring the most liquid short-dated assets. In this environment, we saw a historically large flow of investor sales of Treasuries, as shown in Figure 5, as well as MBS. There were also notable sales by foreign reserve managers, whose Treasury securities held in custody at the Fed, shown in Figure 6, fell sharply during March. The flow strained the capacity of dealers and other liquidity providers to intermediate on normal terms. The challenges were particularly notable in off-the-run Treasuries, a sector where some dealers at times were reportedly reluctant to make markets at all. As a result, market functioning indicators were quite poor, as illustrated in Figure 7. Bid-ask spreads for Treasuries, in the left panel, and for agency MBS, in the right panel, both showed extraordinary increases. Relative value measures also widened notably, with prices appearing to diverge from fundamentals in some cases, as demonstrated by the Treasury cash-futures basis in Figure 8.9\n\nAt the FOMC\u2019s direction, the Desk rapidly ramped up asset purchases to address these conditions. For the first few weeks, we had much to learn about how to maximize the effectiveness of purchases. We quickly adjusted operations based on our observations, and although it\u2019s fair to say that at first we were mostly stabilizing market functioning, the purchases soon began to make meaningful improvements. As I\u2019ll discuss in a moment, I think our flexibility itself played an important role in supporting market confidence.\n\nI\u2019ve been pleased to see that the functioning of Treasury and MBS markets has now rebounded notably. I was also pleased to see that, in the end, financial markets and infrastructures were able to continue operating even as the industry shifted, en masse, to working from home. Measures of market liquidity have uniformly improved and are now well below their worst points, though some remain more stressed than at the start of the year. In talking with our contacts, we hear that the lingering effects of the extraordinary volatility in March and the uncertain financial environment are limiting improvements in some liquidity metrics by reducing the appetite to take the risks associated with making markets. Relative value spreads have also narrowed substantially, though as with liquidity, some metrics remain higher than before the pandemic.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s purchases have supported smooth market functioning through multiple channels. The purchases absorbed some of the flow of sales and helped restore two-way trading, which supports liquidity. In addition to absorbing a flow of securities, the purchases changed the stock of assets held by the private sector. Because the Desk accepts offers on securities with attractive prices, our operations can have the effect of buying undervalued securities and reducing price distortions.10\n\nBut these direct effects are not the only channels through which we think our purchases helped. The design of the purchase program also appeared to reduce market stress. I\u2019d highlight two key aspects of the program in this regard: commitment and flexibility. The FOMC\u2019s unlimited commitment to purchases \u201cin the amounts needed\u201d to support smooth market functioning was essential. Our market intelligence indicated that some investors had been selling not because they needed liquidity immediately, but because they wanted to take precautions against a further deterioration in market functioning. By providing confidence that the Treasury and MBS markets would remain liquid, the FOMC\u2019s commitment to purchases reduced this motive for sales and helped calm the market.\n\nFlexibility, as I noted earlier, has been another hallmark of our purchases that has helped to support confidence in smooth functioning of the Treasury and agency MBS markets. For most of the spring, we issued calendars for our purchases one week at a time, rather than our usual monthly calendars, and revised these plans even daily when necessary. As our indicators showed changes in market functioning, we adapted by adjusting the size of our purchases, the distribution of purchases across sectors, and even the settlement timing of our agency MBS operations.11 This flexibility has allowed us to maximize support for smooth market functioning. Once we saw improvements in market functioning, we began reducing the pace of our purchases starting in late March\u2014but we did so gradually to reduce the chance of renewed disruptions, and we have remained watchful for conditions that would warrant an increase in purchases.\n\nHow Will We Sustain Smooth Market Functioning?\n\nBy the time of the FOMC\u2019s June meeting, we had reduced the pace of purchases to the equivalent of around $80 billion per month in Treasuries and about $40 billion per month, net of reinvestments, in MBS.12 The FOMC directed the Desk in June to continue increasing SOMA holdings at least at this pace to sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.\n\nAlthough market functioning has improved markedly since the period of extreme stress in mid-March, uncertainty about the course of the pandemic makes it prudent to protect against further shocks. There also are still sectors of the market where liquidity and pricing have not fully returned to pre-pandemic conditions. The continued work-from-home posture at many firms, and ongoing uncertainty in the outlook, appear to have made liquidity providers somewhat more cautious. Purchases over coming months will help mitigate risks of renewed stress and sustain continued smooth market functioning.\n\nWith the shift to a program focused on sustaining smooth market functioning, we are now announcing a monthly purchase amount and have lengthened our purchase schedules to semi-monthly periods for both Treasuries and MBS. These longer calendars provide greater foresight into our purchase plans, allowing dealers to prepare for this activity in the context of their customer flows. Importantly, though, we will remain vigilant for signs of deterioration in market functioning and flexible in adjusting our operations as needed. This strategy will allow us to safeguard the gains we\u2019ve made and support the continued flow of credit to American families and businesses.\n\nI\u2019d emphasize in this regard that our assessment of market functioning is focused on indicators of market liquidity and efficient prices\u2014not on the level of yields. It is certainly the case that the FOMC\u2019s purchases have been absorbing duration and prepayment risk from the market. The total duration included in our Treasury purchases so far represents the equivalent of about $1 trillion in 10-year securities. Although term premiums do not appear to have come down significantly relative to just before the pandemic, our usual analysis indicates that our purchases have offset some upward pressure that could otherwise have occurred, for example as a result of the recent increases in Treasury debt issuance. I expect that the ongoing purchases will continue to absorb interest rate risk from the market, and that a wide range of factors other than our purchases will also continue to influence yields as our current purchases proceed.\n\nOverall, I am confident that the full range of Federal Reserve programs, including the Treasury and MBS purchases, will mitigate the ongoing risks to market functioning and sustain the progress we have seen. The economic and financial shocks resulting from the pandemic have been truly extreme. The Federal Reserve\u2019s commitment to smooth market functioning should provide continued confidence amid the ongoing public health and economic uncertainties.\n\nStill, considering the crucial role of the Treasury and MBS markets in the financial system, and their growing size, it is important to ensure that these markets remain resilient to future shocks. What factors made these markets vulnerable to the abrupt deterioration in functioning that we saw in March? Could changes in regulations, data availability, or market infrastructure make market functioning more robust to future shocks? What role do funding markets play? These are challenging questions. They will require careful research and analysis, and they may not have simple answers. Still, the official and private sectors should be prepared to work together to assess them, and to do what it takes to ensure the continued strength and good functioning of these important markets.\n\nThank you.\n\nFigures"

    "content": "It's a great pleasure to be sharing a platform with Andrew Bailey to discuss the transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), a topic of critical importance to the safety and soundness of the financial system.\n\nThe ongoing transition away from LIBOR has ramifications for institutions, markets, and regulators across the globe, making cooperation at the international level of critical importance.\n\nThe last time Andrew and I spoke together on this topic was almost exactly a year ago, when the world was a very different place.1 In the intervening months, we've experienced a devastating pandemic that has caused hardship across the world, and has led to the worst recession in living memory here in the U.S.\n\nSince the advent of the pandemic, this is the first speech I've given on a topic other than the economic outlook and monetary policy. Despite the array of challenges we're facing as a result of the coronavirus, transitioning away from LIBOR continues to be of paramount importance.\n\nToday, I'm going to talk about what the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) and others have achieved in the face of enormous adversity and what still needs to be done between now and the end of next year.\n\nBut before I continue, let me give the usual disclaimer that the views I express are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nA Challenging Year\n\nWith a pandemic that's touched every aspect of our way of life, it's easy to forget why transitioning away from LIBOR is so important.\n\nIt's 13 years since the LIBOR scandal first hit the headlines, and it's still an unreliable reference rate. LIBOR submissions from banks are largely based on judgment, rather than real numbers, making the rate vulnerable to manipulation and fraud, and bringing increased risk with its use in financial contracts.2 In fact, this problem became even more acute this spring during the period of severe market stress, when term lending transactions based on LIBOR became even more scarce than usual. Thus, the urgency to switch to more robust reference rates and deal with legacy contracts has not gone away; if anything, this issue has become more pressing.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the pandemic has caused some reprioritization of work streams as the official sector and market participants adjusted to social distancing restrictions and worked to keep their employees safe.\n\nBut the importance of transitioning from LIBOR is so great that despite the effects of COVID-19, the overall timeline remains the same: There are now 537 days until the existence of LIBOR can no longer be assured. The clock is still ticking, and it's critical that regulators and institutions continue to work together to ensure we are all ready for January 1, 2022.\n\nWhat We've Achieved\n\nEven with the unprecedented situation of a global pandemic, I'm encouraged that a huge amount of progress has been made on the LIBOR transition since the last time Andrew and I spoke.\n\nFar from slowing down, the pace of progress has accelerated.\n\nIn the United States, there have been numerous consultations issued, a raft of recommendations published, and a variety of new tools developed, all to support the transition to more robust reference rates.\n\nThese include a consultation on the recommended spread adjustment methodology for cash products transitioning to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), the publication of recommended fallback language for adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) and student loans, as well as checklists to help different types of institutions navigate the transition.\n\nThere has also been a great deal of interest in the possibility of SOFR-linked Treasury securities, and the U.S. Treasury recently asked for comments on such a concept. The consultation closed last week, and I hope many of the institutions present today shared their views.3\n\nAnother significant milestone is that in March, the New York Fed started the publication of SOFR averages and a SOFR index. The New York Fed now publishes three compound averages of SOFR daily, which are less variable than daily rates and may be useful for some applications.4\n\nSOFR is based on a much higher volume of underlying transactions than LIBOR, making it more representative of market conditions and less vulnerable to manipulation. It's also the rate selected by the ARRC as its preferred replacement for USD LIBOR.\n\nIf the pandemic has confirmed one thing about financial benchmarks, it's the resilience of robust reference rates, including SOFR. On a backdrop of enormous turmoil and uncertainty, both in financial markets and the broader economy, SOFR was a dog that didn't bark (or bite). The New York Fed publishes a number of overnight secured and unsecured funding rates, and during this tumultuous period, they all moved in concert, anchored by the rates set by the Federal Reserve. This success may not have attracted headlines, but it demonstrates the value of robust reference rates that are a fair representation of the underlying market.\n\nIn addition in March, the ARRC proposed draft legislation in New York to deal with legacy contracts\u2014a particularly challenging issue.5\n\nAnd finally, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will stop accepting ARMs based on LIBOR by the end of 2020. And they plan to begin accepting ARMs based on SOFR later this year.6\n\nYes, it's fair to say that a huge amount of progress has been made in many directions over the past 12 months. It's encouraging that even in the face of a global pandemic, neither the official sector, nor the industry, has lost forward momentum.\n\nNext Steps\n\nBut we cannot afford to be complacent. With just 537 days left, there's still much to accomplish.\n\nThis year the ARRC reiterated its commitment to support the industry through the remainder of the transition. In April, the ARRC published its 2020 objectives, which laid out a number of important milestones that need to be achieved.7\n\nKey areas of focus include work to address the challenges associated with legacy contracts, the development of a forward-looking SOFR rate, and finalizing the ARRC-recommended spread adjustment for legacy contracts transitioning to SOFR.\n\nIn May, the ARRC followed up with the publication of recommended best practices for market participants.8 This included timelines for a variety of products, including floating-rate notes, business and consumer loans, securitizations, and derivatives.\n\nIt's critical that market participants meet the milestones set out in the best practices and have a clear understanding of any outstanding exposure they have to LIBOR. There are checklists and implementation guides available for institutions working to adopt SOFR,9 and market participants are encouraged to adhere to the ISDA protocol on a timely basis following its publication.\n\nIt doesn't matter whether you're a large global bank or a local company with a handful of employees, you need to be prepared to manage your institution's transition away from LIBOR. I hope it goes without saying that new use of USD LIBOR in financial contracts should stop. As I've said before, let's not make the existing hole we're trying to climb out of even deeper.10\n\nConclusion\n\nI'll conclude with this: Transitioning away from LIBOR to more robust reference rates is a huge and complex undertaking. It involves numerous jurisdictions, multiple types of institutions, and a raft of financial products. Since July last year, the ARRC, the official sector, and market participants have all made remarkable progress in the most challenging of circumstances to prepare themselves for the end of LIBOR. The ongoing commitment and the forward momentum are welcome, positive signs. As we mark days off the calendar, let's all make sure we use the remaining time wisely and effectively."

    "date": "Jul 8, 2020",
    "speaker": "Unknown",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2020/sin200708",
    "content": "Introduction\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thanks to Jonathan Drapkin and the Hudson Valley Pattern for Progress for inviting me to speak today, and to all of you for being here. During his regional visit last July, New York Fed President John Williams heard from you and others in the area about several key issues\u2014including workforce development, changing demographics, concerns about equitable growth, and a lack of affordable housing and public transportation. I have no doubt all of these issues have become far more acute\u2014while many deeper ones have arisen\u2014because of the tremendous hardship caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Now more than ever, dialogues such as this one provide insight into the extraordinary challenges faced by the communities we serve.1\n\nWith this context in mind, I will briefly review the actions the Federal Reserve has taken to support the U.S. economy in the face of the pandemic, focusing in particular on the facilities that were created under the Federal Reserve\u2019s emergency lending authority. I\u2019ll then explain the effectiveness of these facilities and offer some early lessons learned, and will end by highlighting some challenges and opportunities as we look ahead.\n\nI\u2019d like to emphasize that while many of the tools at our disposal work through financial markets and institutions, the end goal is to achieve maximum employment and stable prices, and you will also hear about new lengths the Federal Reserve has gone to support an inclusive recovery.\n\nI should also make it clear that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s Unprecedented Actions\n\nAs part of a comprehensive government response to the economic distress and profound uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve has taken unprecedented actions in pursuit of its dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices. Chair Powell recently bucketed the Fed\u2019s actions across four areas: open market operations to restore market functioning; actions to improve liquidity conditions in short-term funding markets; programs launched in coordination with the Treasury Department to facilitate the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments; and measures to encourage banks to use their substantial capital and liquidity buffers to support the economy during this time of hardship.2 The Federal Reserve has also made a number of regulatory adjustments to help address the crisis.3\n\nWhile the Federal Reserve has faced many crises in the past, what has distinguished the current situation is both the speed and scale of the economic and market deterioration brought on by the virus\u2014as well as the speed and scale of the response. Over about a three-week period in March and April, the Fed ramped up its use of existing tools to a historic degree and, in coordination with the Treasury Department, invoked its emergency lending authority to launch nine new facilities to support a broad cross section of the economy, all with the intent of supporting economic activity and employment.4 At the same time, robust fiscal support has provided direct relief to those suffering the consequences of the virus.\n\nPolicymakers have made forceful commitments to these facilities, which have a combined capacity of more than $2.6 trillion, easily several times larger than peak facility usage in the Global Financial Crisis.5 Although the challenges of 2008-09 were different from the current shock, that experience left us with blueprints for tools that might be used again, and encouraged us to act creatively in deploying new tools better suited to the current circumstances. In doing so, the Federal Reserve sought to prevent the immense pandemic-induced declines in economic activity from morphing into a full-fledged financial crisis, or producing lasting scars for households and businesses.\n\nUsage of the Facilities\n\nFour months in, all of the emergency credit and liquidity facilities are operational, and we can take stock of how the programs are being used and the impact they\u2019re having. The bottom line is that the impact of the facilities has been large and sustained, while the usage has been generally low.\n\nFigure 1 shows the outstanding balance of loans or asset purchases for each facility as of July 1, and peak outstanding balances since each program was launched. These peaks are well below those seen for similar programs deployed during the Global Financial Crisis.\n\nThe limited usage to date compared to the 2008-09 crisis can be explained in part by the fact that the core of the financial system was in much better condition entering into the current episode\u2014banks themselves were well capitalized, for example. Because the crisis did not originate in the financial sector, markets were able to recover faster from the initial shock and have been highly responsive to the combined fiscal and monetary policy measures. For their part, the backstops established by the emergency facilities have proved especially powerful in restoring confidence for private sector borrowing and lending to resume, which in turn helps the flow of credit to the economy.\n\nThis resilience of financial markets is consistent with the trends seen in Figure 2, showing how facility usage has evolved over time. The first facilities to start operations were the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), Money Market Liquidity Facility (MMLF), and Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF)\u2014the light blue, dark blue, and red areas, respectively. These programs sought to repair short-term wholesale funding markets, which serve as the lifeblood of functioning markets. As those markets recovered with overarching support from the Fed\u2019s actions, usage of the PDCF and MMLF has declined. Similarly, with an easing of pressures in commercial paper markets soon after the CPFF\u2019s announcement, this facility too has seen only limited take-up. This pattern reflects the \u201clender of last resort\u201d design of these programs: they provide a relief valve if market strains re-intensify, but are not expected to be used heavily under less stressful conditions.\n\nThe main source of growth in outstanding balances comes from the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (PPPLF)\u2014shown by the dark gray area. This program bolsters the effectiveness of the Small Business Administration\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program by supplying liquidity to bank and nonbank financial institutions that originate PPP loans. Since its launch in mid-April, PPPLF usage has risen steadily, and outstanding advances are about $70 billion. This amount is still well below the program\u2019s potential take-up, which is equal to the amount of PPP loans extended, currently over $500 billion. Nonetheless, we have heard from PPP lenders that the program bolsters their confidence in making PPP loans to small businesses, as every PPP lender is eligible to use the PPPLF. Well over 600 PPP lenders are currently using the facility across all 12 Reserve Banks.\n\nWe have seen modest starts to several other facilities that recently launched and stand ready to support critical segments of the economy. The gold area is the Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF), which funded $1.2 billion of 12-month notes for the State of Illinois to assist with COVID-19 related cash flow pressures. Not visible is the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), which is designed to improve lending conditions for a range of consumer, small business, and commercial loans. TALF launched last month and has lent about $250 million to date.\n\nAdditionally, lending facilities are now available to help businesses maintain operations and keep employees in their jobs. The Main Street Lending Program (MSLP), which provides loans to small and medium-sized entities, including nonprofits, and the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility (PMCCF), which provides bridge financing to large investment-grade corporate employers if they cannot secure adequate credit elsewhere, both recently opened.\n\nMore sizable, the pink sliver shows balances of corporate debt the Fed has purchased through its Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF), about $10 billion so far. Unlike the other facilities, which establish standing windows for eligible borrowers,6 the Fed sets the pace of corporate debt purchases based on market conditions.7 Since the SMCCF\u2019s launch, as market functioning has improved, we have slowed the pace of purchases, from about $300 million per day to a bit under $200 million a day.8 If market conditions continue to improve, Fed purchases could slow further, potentially reaching very low levels or stopping entirely. This would not be a signal that the SMCCF\u2019s doors were closed, but rather that markets are functioning well. Should conditions deteriorate, purchases would increase.9\n\nImpact of the Facilities\n\nTo reiterate the key point from earlier, despite low usage of the facilities, their impact has been large and sustained. In terms of liquidity and funding conditions, we\u2019ve seen a dramatic recovery since mid-March, as seen in Figure 3. This improvement likely comes from a full array of policy actions deployed in quick succession\u2014not only the facilities I just described, but also the lowering of the Fed\u2019s policy rate to effectively zero, expanded repos and purchases of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, more generous terms for discount window borrowing, and an expansion in the availability of cross-border liquidity.\n\nIn terms of credit conditions, as seen in Figure 4, we\u2019ve also seen a sharp reduction of credit spreads that has broadened over time from investment grade debt, to high yield, to municipal bonds, and asset-backed securities, and this has triggered a surge of issuance across asset classes as borrowing rates have normalized. While there are still pockets of strain in some markets, and in sectors where business models are directly challenged by the virus, even in these areas there are tentative signs of healing.\n\nEarly Lessons Learned\n\nOf course, there are limits on what the central bank can do, and only time will tell the ultimate impact of the facilities on supporting the Fed\u2019s dual-mandate objectives, but I would attribute much of the facilities\u2019 initial success to four main factors: their size and scope, coordination across the government, flexibility, and sustainability.\n\nFirst, the size and scope of the facilities have demonstrated the Fed\u2019s capacity and resolve to blunt the initial economic effects of the pandemic shock. As I mentioned earlier, the potential lending capacity of the facilities is unparalleled. And critically, this lending capacity is being channeled to support a broad cross section of the financial markets and economy\u2014supporting the availability of credit for households, helping small and medium-sized businesses maintain their payroll and employees through new and expanded loans, providing credit to large employers so they are able to pay suppliers and maintain their business operations, and supporting state and local governments experiencing cash flow pressures.\n\nSecond, the facilities represent a full partnership with the Treasury Department, signaling a government-wide effort to cushion the U.S. economy from the shocks caused by the pandemic. The Treasury Secretary approved the Fed\u2019s use of emergency lending authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act to establish the programs, and the Treasury has provided equity investments in many of them, thus absorbing some of the risk of the Fed\u2019s involvement in private credit markets. The close alignment of the Fed and Treasury served as a \u201cforce multiplier\u201d in transmitting stimulus, especially at a time when investors, businesses, and the public at large were looking for signs of a coordinated government response.\n\nThird, the facilities are flexible. Term sheets for each facility have been updated or amended since they were first announced, demonstrating a willingness to adapt program design in response to feedback and changing conditions, and to make the facilities more accessible and inclusive.10 As Fed policymakers have made clear, these programs can be ramped up or refined further as needed, depending on the impact of and lessons learned from the initial rollout.11\n\nLastly, a key success factor has been the sustainability of the facilities. Although the Federal Reserve has moved to implement the facilities at maximum speed, we\u2019ve also done so with maximum care. This means our efforts to launch and operate the facilities are guided by a set of principles that we believe will sustain the public\u2019s trust and confidence in our actions. Transparency, inclusive access, good governance, and accountability are at the forefront of our work to implement the facilities, and I\u2019d like to expand upon each of these principles. 12,13\n\nTransparency\n\nAccess\n\nIn our effort to contain the damage from the virus shock, the Federal Reserve retained several outside vendors to accelerate the facilities\u2019 rollout and to supplement our areas of internal expertise.15 Our initial vendor selections prioritized expertise, scale, and in many cases, the ability to segregate a team of dedicated personnel. We also relied in many cases on existing relationships with primary dealers as financial intermediaries to get up and running quickly. This approach helped to launch our facilities at maximum speed, but our strategy from the start has been to diversify our vendor and counterparty base in the post-launch phase. All of the contracts the New York Fed has signed are short term; each has a provision to cancel with 30 days\u2019 notice. Given this flexibility, we are evaluating all contracts after 90 days, with priority on re-bidding those that were not competitively bid. We\u2019re also actively exploring opportunities to diversify the range of potential vendors and counterparties we work with across facility activities.\n\nGovernance and Accountability\n\nFinally, in pursuing our policy goals, we have an obligation to the public to be accountable for all our actions. We have embedded the facilities into Reserve Bank risk management and control frameworks, while building new layers of governance as added layers of protection. We also remain ready to engage with our oversight bodies and those appointed under the CARES Act to ensure that the American people understand the steps we are taking on their behalf as faithful stewards of the public trust.\n\nChallenges and Opportunities\n\nIn my remaining time, I\u2019ll mention a few of the ongoing challenges and opportunities as we look ahead.\n\nFirst, as President Williams said just last week, the virus has hit the most vulnerable segments of our society the hardest.16 Communities of color and lower-wage workers are facing higher rates of unemployment, limited access to healthcare, and greater exposure to the virus. We need to stay focused on the distributional effects of our actions and challenge ourselves to promote a more equitable recovery, while also understanding the limits of what our monetary policy and lending powers can directly achieve.\n\nSecond, while we can be confident that low facility usage amid generally well-functioning markets reflects the power of backstops, we must remain vigilant for any signs of hesitation of eligible participants to use the facilities out of concerns it sends a signal of weakness. Credible backstops provide confidence that may prevent a severe deterioration of market conditions going forward, but the true test of the facilities\u2019 effectiveness will be if they are used when needed in dysfunctional market conditions. As always, we stand ready to make adjustments to our operations as necessary to meet our objectives.\n\nThird, what does the intensity of market distress and abrupt deleveraging in mid-March tell us about vulnerabilities that were building in the nonbanking sector for many years, particularly for business models that are structured with large amounts of embedded leverage, and those still reliant on short-term wholesale funding?\n\nAnd finally, while we entered this crisis with well-capitalized banks, we need to be watchful of banking sector resilience in the face of potential waves of nonperforming loans and bankruptcies that could challenge asset quality.\n\nAll of this is to remind us of what we already know: there remains tremendous uncertainty about the path ahead, and so we must stay humble in the face of ongoing risks and resolute in our commitment to adapt as needed. I\u2019ll conclude by expressing my deep personal gratitude to the health care professionals and essential workers who put themselves at risk each day to meet the basic needs of others, and to my colleagues at the Federal Reserve, who continue to work tirelessly to help safeguard our economy and financial system. I\u2019m humbled and inspired by their service.\n\nFigures"

    "content": "Thank you for the warm introduction. When the United States entered the pandemic in March, I never expected that three and a half months later I would still be making speeches from my apartment: I look forward to the day when gathering in groups is safe and we can meet in person.\n\nWe're now 17 weeks into a catastrophic pandemic which has cost over 500,000 lives worldwide and has had a devastating effect on economies across the globe.1\n\nToday I'm going to talk about the current state of the U.S. economy, our goals for the recovery, and how the Federal Reserve is responding to the worst recession in living memory.\n\nBefore I continue, let me give the usual disclaimer that the views I express are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nA Different Kind of Recession\n\nThe economic effects of the coronavirus have caused great hardship and created enormous uncertainty. The root of this downturn\u2014a global pandemic\u2014means this is a completely different kind of recession compared to anything we've experienced in the past.\n\nAs the pandemic unfolds, many people are starting to ask questions about our economic future: What will the recovery look like? When will it begin? And how will it be affected by the virus?\n\nIt's easiest to start with the last of these questions first. The virus will continue to be at center stage throughout the economic recovery. We are traveling down a narrow path, balancing a return of economic activity with effective containment of COVID-19.\n\nThe overall unemployment rate reached nearly 15 percent in April, and around 20 million Americans have lost their jobs\u2014numbers I hoped I would never see in my lifetime. These figures understate the full extent of the pandemic's toll on the economy.\n\nThe pandemic and the ensuing economic downturn have done disproportionate harm to communities of color. Black and Hispanic families, as well as lower-wage workers, have suffered the most.2 Those who least can afford it have been hardest hit, making a strong and full economic recovery of paramount importance.\n\nAs the recent surge in cases in some states demonstrates, much is still unknown about how the pandemic will play out in the months ahead. That said, there have been signs that we may be past the worst of the extreme economic distress, and early indications of a recovery have started to emerge.\n\nAs states began to open up and people returned to eating in restaurants and shopping in stores we've seen sizable increases in consumer spending. We've also seen increases in building permits, signaling a turnaround in the construction industry. 3 People have been getting back to work and the unemployment rate has started to edge down. Although this improvement is welcome, the economy is still far from healthy and a full recovery will likely take years to achieve.\n\nOne of the things that's been unique about this recession is the lightning speed of events. Traditional macroeconomic data sources\u2014like the labor market report and GDP\u2014are published with lags of weeks or months and don't typically allow one to see the changes within the month or quarter.\n\nIn response, economists at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere have increasingly turned to analyzing a wide variety of high-frequency data, which\u2014as the name suggests\u2014are published daily or weekly, with only short reporting lags.4 High-frequency data give us more timely and granular information about what's going on in the economy in between the standard macro data releases. They also help us paint a more detailed picture of people's behavior and how it's changing in the midst of unprecedented circumstances.\n\nThese data tell us whether small businesses are hiring and whether people are eating in restaurants, staying in hotels, and boarding airplanes. When states started to reopen, signs from both the standard macro data and the high-frequency granular data have been encouraging. Together, they indicate that we've likely seen the low point of the downturn and that the overall economy has begun to recover.\n\nEven in New York, the hardest hit state, we have seen initial signs of a turnaround. Surveys of manufacturing and services firms rebounded significantly in June, following record lows in April and May, and revenues of small businesses in New York have gradually picked up as well. 5\n\nIn contrast to these positive signs, we are seeing some indications of a slowing in the pace of recovery in states that are currently experiencing large-scale outbreaks. This is a valuable reminder that the economy's fate is inextricably linked to the path of the virus. A strong economic recovery depends on effective and sustained containment of COVID-19.\n\nTurning to the question of what the goals for recovery are: one measure of success is a return to the sustained growth and historically low unemployment that we had attained before the pandemic. I know this seems a long way from where we are today and may seem unreachable during these darkest days of the recession. But history teaches us that the economy can get back to full strength, even after deep downturns.\n\nPolicy Responses\n\nThe unique nature of this recession and the uncertainty that comes with it mean that the policy responses\u2014public health, fiscal, and by the Fed\u2014need to be designed to reflect the nature of the pandemic and the challenges it poses to the economy. Although I will focus on events in the United States, it is important to stress that this is a global health and economic crisis. Most other countries are facing similar challenges and are likewise engaged in a range of policy actions.\n\nOur economic prospects are tied to our ability to contain the spread of the virus, care for those who fall ill, and develop effective treatments. In addition, fiscal policy has played a critically important role in providing financial support to families, small businesses, and those who are out of work during the crisis. This timely support contributed greatly to the rebound in consumer spending and jobs that we have seen over the past two months.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has taken rapid and significant actions to stabilize critical parts of our financial system and to support the flow of credit, thereby helping position the economy for a strong and sustained return to maximum employment and price stability.\n\nIn March, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) brought the target range for the federal funds rate to near zero.6 The FOMC has indicated that it expects to keep interest rates at this level until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.7\n\nBringing interest rates down to near zero makes it easier for households and businesses to meet their borrowing needs and fosters favorable financial conditions that will help promote a rebound in spending and investment.\n\nIn addition, the Fed has been conducting large-scale repo operations and purchasing sizable quantities of U.S. Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities to support market functioning at a time of extraordinary volatility in markets.8 These actions averted a potential shutdown in the availability of credit, which would have made the current economic crisis even more severe.\n\nAlthough functioning in financial markets has improved since March, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it will continue to increase asset holdings to sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.9\n\nIn addition to stabilizing financial markets, the Federal Reserve has instituted a number of programs to support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments. These actions will enable them to continue to do their work, both now and when normal life resumes.10\n\nTaken together, these programs have helped restore the functioning of financial markets, foster favorable financial conditions, and support the continued flow of credit to businesses and households.\n\nConclusion\n\nI'll conclude with this: This pandemic and this recession form a pivotal moment for the Federal Reserve. We are seeing signs that the economy has started to recover. Still, the economic outlook remains highly uncertain and it's going to take considerable time to restore the economy to its full potential. But rest assured, we are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy and bring about a full and robust recovery."

    "date": "Jun 25, 2020",
    "speaker": "Michael Held",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2020/hel200625",
    "content": "Thank you. It's an honor to join you. And, as a central banker, it is a special privilege to speak alongside the Governors of the Central Bank of Egypt and the Central Bank of Tunisia. My topics today are the Federal Reserve's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the challenges that lie ahead. As always, the views I express are my own, not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nPandemic Work of the Federal Reserve\n\nThe challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic are daunting. On a personal level, we fear for the health and livelihoods of ourselves and our loved ones. On a professional level, our organizations face existential challenges largely beyond our creation or control. On a societal level, we see how injustice and inequality have reduced confidence in public institutions and increased polarization\u2014right when we most need to come together.\n\nTo do its part, the Federal Reserve has committed to \"us[e] its full range of tools to support households, businesses, and the U.S. economy overall in this challenging time.\"2\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee lowered the target range for the federal funds rate to 0 to \u00bc percent3 and increased purchases of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities.\n\nThe Board of Governors created new dollar liquidity arrangements with central banks, reflecting the global nature of the pandemic and its economic disruption.4 Together with other Federal banking agencies, the Board issued regulatory relief and guidance to banks encouraging them to meet the changing needs of customers,5 to use their capital and liquidity buffers to facilitate lending,6 and to access the discount window.7\n\nPerhaps most prominently, the Fed has used its emergency powers in Section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act to establish programs and facilities to keep the economy running.8 The Board of Governors created the Primary Dealer Credit Facility,9 the Commercial Paper Funding Facility,10 and the Money Market Liquidity Facility to provide relief for critical wholesale markets.11 Another facility supports lending to small businesses via the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program.12 Two commercial credit facilities provide liquidity for corporate bonds.13 The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility supports the markets for student loans, auto loans, and credit card loans.14 The Municipal Liquidity Facility helps state and local governments and agencies close revenue gaps.15 And facilities specifically targeting \"Main Street\"16 help sustain retail businesses and may expand to assist nonprofit institutions.17\n\nFor the last several months, implementing the Board of Governors' relief initiatives has been the priority of the New York Fed and our sister Reserve Banks. As my colleague Daleep Singh has said, we have adhered to three principles: robust and proactive transparency, strong and effective corporate governance, and accountability to our stakeholders.18 The New York Fed's staff has worked hard\u2014and sometimes around the clock\u2014to give effect to these principles. I am proud of my colleagues, and continue to be humbled and inspired by their deep knowledge of their fields, their brilliant creativity, and their selfless commitment to the Fed's mission\u2014notwithstanding many personal hardships.\n\nReflections on the Fed's Pandemic Response\n\nThe Fed's work is ongoing, but it is worth pausing to reflect on lessons learned from our experience so far.\n\nThe extent of the Fed's efforts raises legitimate questions about the role of the nation's central bank. Some \"Fed watchers\" have opined that the Fed \"has effectively shifted from lender of last resort for banks to a commercial banker of last resort for the broader economy.\"19\n\nI don't know if I would go that far.\n\nThe \"lender of last resort\" function\u2014framed definitively by Walter Bagehot in the late nineteenth century\u2014is not the Federal Reserve's only purpose. As I mentioned earlier, the Fed's job is to support the \"U.S. economy overall.\" The Fed's monetary policy mandate, for example, addresses the national employment and inflation objectives. The Fed runs a payment system, FedWire, on which the global economy depends for clearing U.S. dollar transactions. And the Fed regulates and supervises financial institutions so that, each and together, they safely match savers and borrowers in the real economy.\n\nI sometimes think that theories or expectations of central banking depart from reality. This may be unavoidable. The best theories are simple. The reality of central banking is complicated. The Fed is a complex entity governed by numerous statutes that have changed many times in the last 100 years\u2014and are still changing. The Federal Reserve is not just a concept. It is a creation of Congress. Its job is what Congress tells it to do\u2014to adhere as closely as possible to the will of Congress.\n\nOf course, Congress's instructions sometimes leave room for interpretation and discretion. For example, Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act allows the Board of Governors to provide credit during \"unusual and exigent circumstances.\" What are those? And how do we know when circumstances cease to be unusual and exigent? Theories can help resolve these ambiguities and guide the judgment of policymakers.\n\nOther times, Congress is clear, but its instructions do not fit neatly into theories of central banking. In designing its Section 13(3) facilities, the Board of Governors coordinated its policy decisions with the Department of the Treasury. This was required by law. In the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Congress required the Board of Governors to consult with the Secretary of the Treasury on regulations to implement its emergency powers.20 It also required that the Board of Governors obtain the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury before extending emergency credit.21\n\nTo some extent, the Dodd-Frank Act codified reality. The Board of Governors and the Department of the Treasury worked closely throughout the Financial Crisis of 2008. But Congress formalized a degree of cooperation that can make it hard to draw a theoretical line between monetary and fiscal authority\u2014or between an independent agency and a political department.\n\nI should add that this working relationship between our country's monetary and fiscal authorities deepened following the Coronavirus Aid, Recovery and Economic Stimulus Act\u2014known as the \"CARES Act.\" That statute appropriated roughly $2 trillion in economic relief. Congress sent about a quarter of that money to the Treasury for investments in Federal Reserve programs and facilities.\n\nI look forward, in the fullness of time, to more theoretical discussions about the proper role of a central bank in administering emergency economic relief. Some of this dialogue has already begun.22 Questions that catch my interest include:\n\nThese are interesting theoretical questions. In practice, however, the Federal Reserve is what Congress has made it. Its coordination with Treasury and its administration of economic relief proceed as Congress has directed.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nI would like to leave you with some observations on challenges still ahead of us\u2014in the near term, medium term, and long term.\n\nNear-term challenges\u2014those arising within the next twelve months\u2014are many. To manage them, I commend to you Martin Wolf's advice: \"Above all, make sure we get through this. That is our chief aim.\"24\n\nLike many of you, I have confronted new legal and compliance questions arising from a remote workforce, and have had to balance new priorities against ongoing commitments. To get through this, we have to do both. We have to walk and chew gum at the same time.\n\nFinancial institutions have to sustain\u2014and, in some cases, improve\u2014cyber security and anti-money laundering programs.25 The pandemic is no excuse to lower your guard. If anything, there is a heightened need for cyber vigilance. Many Federal agencies have published warnings of pandemic scams aimed at financial institutions and their customers.26 Among other schemes, hackers and digital con-artists may try to exploit the realities of the \"digital divide.\" Employees and customers without regular internet access at home may resort to connecting from public places. There are inherent risks to viewing or printing confidential information outside of secure locations. Those risks could be magnified in the decentralized environments that now count as our places of business.\n\nIn the medium term\u2014by that I mean over the next couple of years\u2014we need to anticipate the next wave of legal and economic challenges from the pandemic. At the front of my mind is the ongoing transition away from LIBOR.27 Trillions of dollars in global financial assets depend on LIBOR. This pandemic has shown us the importance of contingency planning. Just because a global crisis has been going on does not mean December 2021 will never come.\n\nLIBOR is a known problem with workable solutions. Other challenges, like the volatility of pricing in the oil market, are more uncertain. The current lack of energy consumption is linked, in large part, to whether people feel safe. But when will we feel safe again?\n\nWe also need to consider the cumulative impact of lost jobs, lost customers, and lost tax revenue on households,28 businesses,29 and governments.30 Will they run out of money? If so, when? And what happens then? What will be the scale of defaults and bankruptcies? A group of academics recently alerted Congress to capacity limitations in our bankruptcy courts.31 Delays created by capacity limitations could lead to more liquidations of companies that might otherwise restructure and survive. It is important that all potential participants in bankruptcy proceedings anticipate challenges of overextended courts.\n\nLonger term\u2014say, in the next two to five years\u2014one of my concerns is the role of non-bank financial institutions in the economy. In April, the International Monetary Fund warned about the exposure of non-bank financial institutions to credit risk as a result of the pandemic.32 I worry about how that exposure will affect regulated banks and the real economy\u2014and whether we have sufficient information to assess that impact. Going forward, we may want to consider whether the regulatory perimeter should be expanded to provide greater transparency into non-bank financial companies.\n\nIn addition, I wonder how changes to the workplace and the workforce will affect culture within financial services firms. John Williams, the New York Fed's President and CEO, has observed that it is easy to talk about values and integrity when revenues are flush. Living up to those standards becomes more difficult\u2014and more important\u2014when making a profit is harder.33 Remote workspaces add to this challenge. Successful organizations depend on \"open doors\" to maintain transparency and build trust. But what will \"open doors\" mean to people in future digital work environments? How will the culture of a workplace change if we don't see each other face-to-face as often? In particular, how will we effectively train and mentor junior employees?\n\nFinally, current events demand that we be honest about the times we have not lived up to our own standards of equal justice under law and equal opportunity in our economy. Each of us needs to question our role in allowing systemic racism to persist. Our colleagues, stakeholders, and the public in general will ask how we will do better in the near term and the long term\u2014and then they will hold us to it.\n\nThank you for your kind attention, and thank you again to the Union of Arab Banks for hosting this discussion."

    "content": "Introduction\n\nIt\u2019s a pleasure to be able to join you all from my apartment in Manhattan. I sincerely look forward to the day when we can again meet in person.\n\nIn a short period, our lives have changed in unimaginable ways: things that we took for granted\u2014like eating at a restaurant, or going to a movie\u2014are no longer possible in many places. For the first time in our lifetimes, governments around the world have had to take the extraordinary action of shutting their economies down. Those workers who continue to deliver essential services face very real risks, and my deep gratitude is with all those working in hospitals, law enforcement, transportation, and grocery stores. All essential workers have the thanks of everyone at the New York Fed.\n\nWhat started as a healthcare crisis has had profound consequences for the U.S. and global economies.\n\nWe all know the incredible strain that New York City has been under, with numerous patients still being diagnosed with COVID-19 on a daily basis. But Upstate New York has also been deeply affected\u2014not just by the spread of the virus, but also by the profound economic fallout.\n\nThe cause of this recession\u2014a global pandemic\u2014means that our economic future will be determined in large part by the path of the virus. It\u2019s impossible to know exactly how and when workers and businesses will be fully back to work and when consumers will return to the businesses that are open.\n\nDespite the uncertainty, I\u2019m going to spend some time today discussing what the scale of the challenge looks like for New York State, and for the U.S. economy as a whole. I\u2019m also going to outline the Federal Reserve System\u2019s response. The Fed is well-known for setting interest rates. But we play a number of other roles, and have a key responsibility for ensuring that the financial system is working to support the economy, which has been crucial during this crisis.\n\nBefore I continue, let me give the Fed disclaimer that the views I express are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nA Diverse State\n\nOne of the particular strengths of New York State is its diversity\u2014and this is especially true from an economic perspective. In Western and Central New York there are top-tier universities, manufacturing businesses, a thriving professional services industry, as well as popular tourist destinations.\n\nSince the 2008 financial crisis, the declining population trend in Upstate New York of earlier decades had largely stabilized. In recent years, new businesses had sprung up and unemployment had fallen to historic lows.\n\nAll of this was against the backdrop of a strong national economy. At the start of the year, most forecasts anticipated continued moderate growth throughout 2020 and into 2021.\n\nAccording to the data for April, the unemployment rate now stands at a staggering 14.7 percent\u2014a figure I hoped that I would never see in my lifetime, and one that is sure to get worse before it gets better. If I think back to the economic picture of February, nobody could foresee this would be our reality within a few short months.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that the latest numbers do not reveal the full extent of the financial devastation faced by millions of American families. The data don\u2019t capture those who had to leave their jobs, either for their own health or to take care of loved ones.\n\nMany more people have had their hours reduced or have been forced to take a pay cut. It\u2019s going to be some time before we have a detailed understanding of the full economic effects of the public health measures necessary to combat the coronavirus.\n\nWhat we do know is that the pandemic has put a large question mark over the positive trends experienced in our state, as well as the nation as a whole. As social distancing measures are relaxed, we will get a better understanding of how different industries are affected. We know that travel, hospitality, and retail have all been hard hit.\n\nWhat we don\u2019t know is what the shape or timescale of the recovery will be. It\u2019s going to be some time before we have a clearer view of the effects on other industries, including autos, higher education, manufacturing, and professional services.\n\nOur Response\n\nDespite this extraordinary uncertainty, at the Federal Reserve we worked quickly to put measures in place to support the economy and set the foundation for a strong recovery.\n\nDuring the first half of March, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) brought the target range for the federal funds rate to near zero.1 The FOMC has indicated that it expects to keep interest rates at this level until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.2\n\nBringing interest rates down to near zero serves two purposes. First, low interest rates make it easier for households and businesses to meet their borrowing needs. Second, they foster broader financial conditions that will help promote the rebound in spending and investment needed to return the economy to full strength.\n\nThe New York Fed\n\nThe New York Fed has important and unique responsibilities in supporting liquid and well-functioning financial markets. Working alongside our colleagues in the Federal Reserve and other agencies, we are taking rapid and significant actions to supply liquidity and to stabilize critical parts of our financial system.\n\nBy conducting large-scale repo operations and purchasing sizable quantities of U.S. Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, we are providing funding and stability at a time of extraordinary volatility in markets.3 These actions averted a potential shutdown in the availability of credit, which would have made the current economic crisis even more severe.\n\nIn addition to stabilizing financial markets, the Federal Reserve is standing up programs to support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments. These actions will enable them to continue to do their work, both now and when normal life resumes.4\n\nOur efforts supporting the provision of credit include a number of programs aimed at different parts of the economy and work through different channels. One set of programs supports the availability of credit to households and businesses\u2014importantly, including small and medium-sized businesses. A second set of programs targets the availability of credit to states and municipalities.\n\nFiscal policy is also playing a critically important role. In particular, it can do what monetary policy cannot: provide for the public health response and transfer income to those most affected by the outbreak. Fiscal policy is also a vital partner in the delivery of our own programs, supplying the financial support necessary for the extraordinary scale of the credit facilities we\u2019re operating.\n\nConclusion\n\nI\u2019ll conclude with this: These are extraordinary times, and the Fed is taking extraordinary actions to ease the economic pain. This is anything but a typical recession, and it has called for a new set of measures to address the economic consequences of the virus.\n\nAmid all the change we\u2019re experiencing, you can be assured of one thing: our unwavering commitment to limit the economic damage from the pandemic and foster conditions for a strong and sustained recovery."

    "content": "It's my pleasure to join this panel on \"The Fed and Main Street during the Coronavirus Pandemic.\"  I'd start by simply saying what we already know, that this is an unprecedented situation that is affecting millions of people around the world in so many different and often devastating ways, including economically.\n\nI'll talk today about some of facilities that the Federal Reserve has announced to support the U.S. economy.  As I share with you some insights about how we are leveraging capital allocated by Congress to the US Treasury to help Americans, please note that I am speaking for myself and these views do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In compliance with FOMC Policy during blackout periods, I will not be expressing views or analysis about monetary policy issues.\n\nIn only five minutes I don't have the time to review each of Federal Reserve facilities,1 but I want to begin somewhere counterintuitive, with facilities that may seem distant from Main Street.  Main street borrowing prices are determined by market prices for Treasuries, corporate bonds and funding costs of banks.  Thus ensuring that those markets are functioning is a critical first step in ensuring access to finance at reasonable prices for small businesses and consumers.  Facilities for primary dealers (PDCF)2, commercial paper (CPFF)3 and the corporate credit facilities4 are helping us to achieve that goal. \n\nLet me share with you an overview of four important facilities where the Fed is working to more directly assist households and employers of all sizes and bolster the ability of state and local governments to deliver critical services. \n\nFirst, the Municipal Liquidity Facility5 was designed to help provide states, cities and counties with the funding to provide essential public services. The municipal securities market has been strained as investor concerns about funding the necessary response to the pandemic have grown. At the same time, states, cities, and counties are facing severe cash needs from the increase in spending related to the pandemic and the fall in and delay of tax revenue. The facility will increase funding available to eligible localities through notes that rely on proceeds in anticipation of tax revenues.  Proceeds can be used directly and to support smaller political subdivisions. This facility provides a form of bridge financing so that local governments fund programs even while they can delay taxes.\n\nSecond, the Main Street Lending Program6 enhances support for small and mid-sized businesses that were in good financial standing before the crisis.  In March and April, Fed staff conducted a series of outreach calls to 48 banking organizations and 20 mid-sized businesses to obtain their views on proposed structures for a Main Street Business Lending Program, and what we heard has been instrumental in continuing to shape the facility to meet those needs.\n\nThird, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF)7 supports issuance of new securities backed by student loans, auto loans, credit card loans, small business loans, and other debt. Support for asset backed markets ensures that new loans can be originated and sold, thus reducing borrowing costs and allowing people to finance cars, access credit through credit cards, issue commercial mortgages and fund purchases of equipment.\n\nFinally, the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (PPPLF)8 bolsters the effectiveness of the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program by supplying liquidity to participating financial institutions through two-year loans backed by PPP loans as collateral.   This program exemplifies our mission to help facilitate access to US government programs by ensuring that liquidity constraints do not stop the widest possible mix of financial institutions from extending these programs to borrowers.  \n\nConsidering the speed and scale of damage caused by the virus outbreak and measures to contain it, we are making all efforts to implement these facilities as fast as possible. At the same time, we are listening to the communities that we serve and hearing how difficult the economic shutdown has been for entrepreneurs and households, especially small businesses, those outside of the banking system and already underserved communities.\n\nThe Fed does not act alone in this \u2013 fiscal policy is a key partner in providing for the public health response and transferring income to those most affected by the outbreak.  Congress and the US Treasury are key partners mandating the facilities I described, supplying the financial support necessary for the scale of the facilities were are operating, and it is only with this fiscal support that we can ensure the success of key programs like the PPP.  \n\nWe recognize the differential impact of this public health crisis on many of our communities and the need to ensure that we offer as broad support as possible, and will continue to work tirelessly to support the US economy and the communities that we serve.\n\nThank you."

    "content": "Good afternoon.  Thank you for your critical work and for participating in this important forum on \"The Fed and Main Street during the Coronavirus Pandemic.\" \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is impacting all of us \u2013 first and foremost from a health perspective, but clearly in terms of social and economic impacts.  As has been discussed extensively today, this impact has fallen heavily on low- and moderate-income and minority communities across all three dimensions.\n\nI'll speak about what the Federal Reserve is doing to support the economy and to protect consumers and small businesses through supervisory and regulatory actions.  I'll note that these action are focused on supervised banks and do not address the significant challenges faced by those households and businesses outside of the traditional banking sector and served by socially responsible capital providers such as community development financial institutions (CDFIs), non-profits, foundations, and impact investors.\nBefore proceeding, let me emphasize that I am speaking for myself and that these view do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nProvision of Financial Services\n\nBroadly speaking, the fundamental purpose of banking is to provide financial services such as credit provision, payments, and deposit-taking to support sustained economic growth.  This is true in normal times, and is even more true in the current environment.  The Fed has taken a number of actions to help the U.S. banking sector perform these critical functions through changes to supervision, regulation and the provision of liquidity.  Collectively, these steps are designed to limit the potential for financial channels to amplify the initial economic shock created by the COVID-19 virus.\n\nBeginning with supervision, the federal banking agencies, in consultation with state financial regulators, are encouraging financial institutions to work with borrowers in a safe and sound manner.1  The agencies view prudent loan modification programs as positive and proactive actions that can help both borrowers and lenders.  This approach is consistent with the agencies' longstanding practice of encouraging financial institutions to assist borrowers in times of natural disaster and other extreme events.\n\nThe Fed has also provided information to banks on how we are adjusting our supervisory approach.2  This includes, for example, monitoring and outreach to help banks of all sizes understand current challenges and risks; a temporary reduction in exam activities, particularly for the smallest and lowest risk institutions; and additional time to resolve non-critical existing supervisory findings.  These actions should help financial institutions deploy their resources as efficiently as possible and continue to support their customers and local economies in a prudent and fair manner.\n\nOn the regulatory side, the Fed has taken a number of steps to encourage banks to use their balance sheet to support borrowers.  For community banks, for example, the federal banking agencies are implementing the part of the CARES Act to lower the community bank leverage ratio.3 4\n\nIn terms of liquidity provision, the Fed has actively encouraged banks to use the discount window to help meet the demand for credit from household and businesses.5  To make this more attractive, the Fed has lowered the borrowing rate, extended the term of these loans, and actively signaled support for discount window use.\n\nThe Fed also implemented the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (PPPLF).6  This facility is designed to support the effectiveness of the Paycheck Protection Program, created by the CARES Act and implemented by the Small Business Administration (SBA), by extending credit to financial institutions that make PPP loans.  Supplying financial institutions with additional liquidity will help increase their capacity to make PPP loans.  In term of eligibility for participation in the PPPLF, the Federal Reserve is working to expand eligibility to PPP lenders that are not depository institutions in the near future.7\n\nConsumer Protection\n\nThe Fed has emphasized the importance of consumer protection during this period.  The federal banking agencies, for example, made clear that lenders and servicers should adhere to consumer protection requirements, including fair lending laws, and provide the opportunity for all borrowers to benefit from these arrangements.8\n\nThe federal banking agencies have confirmed that in the context of the Community Reinvestment Act, they willl favorably consider retail banking services and retail lending activities in a financial institution's assessment areas that are responsive to the needs of low- and moderate-income individuals, small businesses, and small farms affected by COVID-19 consistent with safe and sound banking practices.9  This includes, for example, waiving certain fees, easing restrictions on check-cashing, expanding availability of credit, providing alternative service options, and offering alternative payment options.  Prudent efforts to modify terms on new or existing loans will receive favorable CRA consideration.  In addition, financial institutions will receive CRA consideration for community development activities, e.g., activities that help to revitalize or stabilize low- or moderate-income geographies such as support for food services and digital access, as well as lending, investment and service activities that support health care and small businesses, particularly for low- and moderate-income individuals or communities.\n\nIn terms of supervisory focus, the Fed has prioritized monitoring to evaluate the impact on consumers to ensure that banks work in good faith with consumers, apply fair treatment and mitigate consumer harm. We are monitoring consumer loan deferrals and modifications and corresponding servicing activities to ensure banks' responsiveness.  We are also monitoring consumers' needs regarding access to funds, including stimulus payments, through traditional deposit accounts, as well as for individuals without a traditional banking relationship who utilize pre-paid cards.\n\nConclusions\n\nTaken together, these steps demonstrate the Fed's strong commitment to help the U.S. banking system support the U.S. economy and protect consumers during the COVID-19 pandemic.  We are aware, however, that many low- and moderate-income and minority communities remain severely impacted.  The regional partnership between the New York Fed and socially responsible providers of capital continues to inform our understanding of the needs for access to credit for these critical small businesses.  We will continue to work with you to ensure that the financial system acts as a source of strength to support all segments of the U.S. economy.\n\nThank you."

    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2020/sin200417",
    "content": "Good morning everyone. Thanks for being here, and let me begin by offering best wishes for everyone\u2019s health under these difficult circumstances. I should also make clear at the outset that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIn my remarks today I\u2019d like to review the context in which the Federal Reserve launched an unprecedented set of policy actions, and I will then describe our approach to standing up emergency facilities at maximum speed with maximum care as we execute our mission.\n\nContext in Mid-March\n\nAs you will no doubt recall, financial markets in mid-March were seized by the uncertainty caused by virus outbreak, both in terms of the speed and scale of impact on the economic outlook, and for society as a whole. Extreme uncertainty triggered unprecedented market volatility across asset classes, escalating into a system-wide deleveraging event that appeared to overwhelm the capacity of financial intermediaries to absorb and transfer risk in an orderly manner. Liquidity dried up across markets, including in U.S. Treasuries, the benchmark upon which virtually every other asset is priced or hedged, the foundation for the dollar\u2019s primacy as a reserve currency, and the source of funding for our federal government.\n\nAs uncertainty rose and liquidity deteriorated, demand for cash and safe assets rose and demand for assets with any form of credit or liquidity risk plummeted. For a few weeks in March, even Treasury yields began to rise, especially in longer maturities, and so did the cost for almost all forms of household and corporate borrowing. Access to financing beyond overnight tenors became severely impaired, causing acute dislocation across short-term funding markets and triggering outflows across prime money market funds.\n\nIn the race to safety, dollars became increasingly scarce, intensifying the stress across global markets. Emerging market economies experienced an unprecedented outflow of capital from non-residents. Sovereign yields surged in the most indebted European countries. The ominous reality was that a synchronized global selloff had taken on a life of its own, with little prospect for self-correction.\n\nMoving with Maximum Speed\n\nAgainst this backdrop, policymakers at the Federal Reserve acted swiftly and unreservedly in an effort to break the damaging psychology that was taking hold. The series of policy actions announced over the past month \u2013 both conventional and unconventional \u2013 reflected a full recognition that the current shock is qualitatively different from the financial crisis of 2008, without a culprit other than the virus itself. Unconstrained by a diagnosis of who was to blame \u2013 and considering the mounting downside risks \u2013 the speed and scale of the policy response was free to match the dimensions of the unfolding shock.\n\nI won\u2019t review all of the actions that the Fed has taken over the past month \u2013 they are well documented elsewhere - but I would like to note of the breadth of activity to stabilize the financial system and to support the flow of credit, both within and outside banking system.\n\nTo that end, I\u2019ll describe a few of the lending and credit facilities that the New York Fed is charged with standing up to supply credit for households, businesses, and state and local governments:\n\nCommercial Paper Funding Facility\n\nBy the middle of March, unusually high funding needs and pullbacks by key lenders of short-term funds led to surging rates in the market for commercial paper, or short-term IOUs issued by businesses and municipalities. Interest rates on longer-term commercial paper, in particular, rose to levels not seen since the financial crisis of 2008. Many issuers were reportedly unable to place commercial paper with a term of longer than a week, leading to increased risk that companies would not be able to fund basic operational needs, such as meeting payrolls or financing inventories.\n\nWith backing from the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve established the commercial paper funding facility as a funding vehicle that can purchase new issuance of commercial paper from highly rated businesses and municipalities, and certain issuers that were downgraded after the virus shock. By providing assurances to issuers and investors that retiring commercial paper can be replaced with new issuance, the facility will promote confidence in the market and support the flow of credit to businesses and municipalities.\n\nCorporate Credit Facilities (CCFs)\n\nAt the same time that short-term commercial paper markets were nearly frozen, so too were markets for longer-term corporate borrowing \u2013 at precisely the moment when companies most needed a financing buffer. Borrowing rates for investment-grade corporate issuers relative to Treasury securities increased by about 2.5 percentage points in the first half of March, while issuance for companies rated below investment grade came to a halt.\n\nIn this context, the primary market corporate credit facility (PMCCF) was designed to provide funding for highly rated companies that need access to financing in order to maintain business operations during this period of dislocation. Again with backing from the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve will create a funding vehicle to backstop eligible corporate borrowers for up to four years, at an interest rate that is better aligned with corporates\u2019 underlying credit risk than was available through market-based financing during March. This funding can be provided by the PMCCF either through purchases of eligible corporate bonds as the sole investor at issuance, or from purchases of portions of syndications at issuance.\n\nThe secondary market corporate credit facility (SMCCF), also backed by the U.S. Treasury with funding from the Federal Reserve, will play an important complementary role to the PMCCF. Here again, there will be two mechanisms at work: the SMCCF may either purchase eligible corporate bonds with a remaining maturity of 5 years or less, or it can purchase U.S.-listed ETFs. For ETFs, the preponderance of holdings will be of ETFs whose primary investment objective is exposure to U.S. investment-grade corporate bonds, and the remainder will be in ETFs whose primary investment objective is exposure to U.S. high-yield corporate bonds.\n\nTaken together, the corporate credit facilities will have three main objectives when we go live in the coming weeks: first, to provide broad support for market functioning in secondary markets to allow for orderly and timely risk transfer in corporate credit; second, to support primary issuance for businesses at funding costs that better reflect normal liquidity conditions; and third, to reduce the incidence and severity of fire sales and/or indiscriminate liquidation.\n\nMunicipal Liquidity Facility\n\nThe last facility I\u2019ll mention today is the municipal liquidity facility, which was designed to help provide states, cities and counties with the funding needed to provide essential public services to their citizens. Due to the virus outbreak, the municipal securities market has recently been under considerable strain as investors have become reluctant to purchase municipal securities. As a result, interest rates on municipal securities have increased significantly. At the same time, states, cities, and counties are facing severe liquidity constraints resulting from the increase in state and local government expenditures related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the decrease and delay of certain tax revenue. By ensuring the smooth functioning of this market, particularly in times of strain, the Federal Reserve is providing credit that will support families, businesses, and jobs in communities, large and small, across the economy.\n\nThe immediate purpose of the Municipal Liquidity Facility is to enhance the liquidity of the municipal securities market by increasing the availability of funding to eligible States, Cities and Counties through Tax Anticipation Notes (\u201cTANs\u201d), Tax and Revenue Anticipation Notes (\u201cTRANs\u201d), Bond Anticipation Notes (\u201cBANs\u201d), and other similar short-term notes from eligible issuers (collectively, \u201cNotes\u201d). The eligible issuer\u2019s proceeds from its notes sales can in turn be used to support its political subdivisions and instrumentalities, among other uses. This facility will provide a form of bridge financing to eligible issuers, and by addressing the cash management needs of eligible issuers, the facility will also encourage investors to once again engage in the municipal securities market.\n\nOf course what I\u2019ve just covered is not an exhaustive list. The Federal Reserve Board has also announced a number of other programs designed to supply credit directly to households, businesses, and municipalities. These include:\n\nMoving with Maximum Care\n\nConsidering the speed and scale of damage caused by the virus outbreak, we are making all efforts to implement these facilities at maximum speed. At the same time, though, we are moving with maximum care, drawing upon all of the lessons learned since 2008.\n\nFirst and foremost, we know that transparency will be key to sustaining public confidence in our efforts. What does this mean in practice? It means that when we work with outside vendors, we explain why we\u2019re doing so, who we\u2019re working with, and how much we\u2019re paying for their services. It requires if we accelerate the vendor selection process to minimize time to market, we operate under a short-term contract and then open up the process to a competitive range of bidders, looking beyond the largest and most established players and providing broad access to a diverse range of smaller players. It means putting on our website the eligibility of borrowers and laying out the terms and conditions of the facilities as clearly as possible, along with posting FAQs and providing opportunities to ask questions. And it means that we actively explore ways to go beyond what\u2019s required by legislation and proactively report on the usage of the facilities as much as possible, subject to meeting our policy objectives.\n\nIn terms of governance, we will embed the facilities into our existing infrastructure for controls, management, and oversight. We will proactively identify and address conflicts of interest \u2013 real or perceived - for anyone working on the facilities. Personal investment guidelines will be refined as needed, and rules will be clear on the gathering of market intelligence and handling sensitive information related to the facilities. Good governance will also require balancing loss protection with financial stability goals, which requires integration of our risk management team into the full life-cycle of the facilities, from policy design to the eventual wind-down.\n\nAs a concluding thought, we know the ultimate definition of success is accomplishing what we set out to do in support of the American economy. In pursuing this goal, we\u2019ve been entrusted with a great responsibility to deploy large sums of public resources, and we have an obligation to the public to be accountable for all our actions. We look forward to engaging with our oversight bodies and those appointed under the CARES Act to ensure that the American people understand the steps we are taking on their behalf as faithful stewards of the public trust."

    "content": "Introduction\n\nThank you for the kind introduction. Hello, from my apartment in Manhattan. It\u2019s a pleasure to be able to join you today, even under these extraordinary circumstances. I hope that wherever you are watching, you and your loved ones are safe and well.\n\nThe outbreak of the coronavirus and the global pandemic have created an unprecedented situation. Today, I want to talk about what that means for the economy and financial markets, and how the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Federal Reserve System as a whole, are responding to the challenges before us. My colleagues and I are dedicated to doing everything within our power to support the functioning of financial markets and help put the economy on a strong footing once this crisis is behind us.\n\nBefore I continue, let me give the Fed disclaimer that the views I express are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has created circumstances we have never experienced before in our lifetimes. There\u2019s hardly a community in the world that remains unaffected. I want to emphasize that this is first and foremost a public health crisis, and a human tragedy. It\u2019s our doctors, nurses, and healthcare professionals who are on the front lines, fighting this disease and caring for those who are suffering. We owe them a great debt of gratitude. My sincere thanks is also with the grocery store workers, those in law enforcement and transportation, and everyone who continues to carry out essential work each day.\n\nThe Scale of the Challenge\n\nThe necessary actions taken to slow and contain the spread of the coronavirus are not only changing how we live our lives, but are also having a profound effect on the economy and financial markets, both here and abroad.\n\nAlthough many people have drawn comparisons with the financial crisis of 2008, the current turmoil is fundamentally different from recessions of the past. The challenges before us do not stem from vulnerabilities at banks or the bursting of a bubble\u2014I can only liken them to a natural disaster of global proportions.\n\nIf we look back to February, the American economy was strong, with unemployment at historical lows. But, now, social distancing and other restrictions imposed in response to the pandemic are causing severe, rapid declines in jobs and income. Unprecedented numbers have filed for unemployment insurance in the past several weeks alone, and we know that more economic pain is still to come. The reality is that the full scale of the economic consequences is still unknown.\n\nThe economic distress and the extraordinary uncertainty about the future course of the pandemic have set off a tidal wave of flows of money away from riskier investments to the safety of cash. This sudden shift led to an evaporation of liquidity and breakdowns in the functioning of key financial markets. This includes the market for U.S. Treasury securities, the cornerstone of the global financial system. These developments, if left unchecked, threaten to starve our economy of the credit that it badly needs during this difficult time.\n\nThe Response\n\nLast month, as the risks posed by the coronavirus became increasingly apparent, the Federal Reserve took swift and decisive action to support the economy and stabilize financial markets. In two unscheduled meetings in the first half of March, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) quickly brought the target range for the federal funds rate to near zero.1 The FOMC also signaled that it expects to keep interest rates at this level until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve the Fed\u2019s maximum employment and price stability goals.2\n\nThese monetary policy actions serve two purposes. First, low interest rates make it easier for households and businesses to meet their borrowing needs during this time of economic stress. Second, they foster broader financial conditions that will help promote the rebound in spending and investment needed to return the economy to full strength.\n\nThe New York Fed\n\nThe New York Fed has important and unique responsibilities in supporting liquid and well-functioning financial markets. Working alongside our colleagues in the Federal Reserve and other agencies, we are taking rapid and significant actions to supply liquidity and to stabilize critical parts of our financial system. We are conducting large-scale repo operations to assure ample liquidity in money markets.3 In addition, at the direction of the FOMC, we are purchasing sizable quantities of U.S. Treasury securities and agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities to improve functioning in these critical markets.4 To put the current situation in context, we are running more open market operations, for greater sums, than at any time in our history.5\n\nThe Federal Reserve is also making liquidity available to key intermediaries to support market functioning and to keep credit flowing. These actions include offering term loans to depository institutions through the traditional discount window, and the establishment of the Primary Dealer Credit Facility and the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility.6\n\nThese strong and timely actions averted a potential shutdown in the flow of credit and are providing funding and stability at a time of extraordinary volatility in markets. Although stresses in financial markets will not entirely abate until the pandemic is behind us, we have seen material improvements in measures of liquidity and market functioning in key parts of the U.S. financial system.\n\nOur work is not done. The Federal Reserve is also standing up programs to support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments, so that they can weather this storm and continue to do their work, both now and when normal life resumes.7 Last week, we announced more details on these programs, which altogether provide additional funding of up to $2.3 trillion.8 These programs are executed with the full support of the Treasury. We are also deeply committed to providing transparency around matters such as usage, eligibility, governance, vendor selection, and fees for these programs.\n\nThe actions by the Federal Reserve, while sharing some similarities with those undertaken during the financial crisis, are specifically designed to deal with the unique economic challenges posed by the coronavirus.\n\nOur efforts supporting the provision of credit include a number of programs aimed at different parts of the economy and work through different channels. One set of programs supports the availability of credit to businesses\u2014importantly, including small and medium-sized businesses\u2014through loans, commercial paper, and corporate bonds. The second set of programs targets the availability of credit to states and municipalities.\n\nBut we cannot act alone: fiscal policy is also playing a critically important role. In particular, it can do what monetary policy cannot: provide for the public health response and transfer income to those most affected by the outbreak. Fiscal policy is also a vital partner in the delivery of our own programs, supplying the financial support necessary for the extraordinary scale of the credit facilities we\u2019re operating.\n\nAn International Response\n\nThe Federal Reserve is not unique in taking bold actions. Central banks around the world are working to support their economies and stabilize their financial systems. There has been close alignment at the international level about the monetary policy and other actions needed to tackle this period of extraordinary economic pain. Given the central role of the dollar in the global economy, the FOMC has instituted new and enhanced programs to facilitate the ability of other central banks to provide U.S. dollar funding in their countries.9\n\nBold Action\n\nThe economy is under distress in ways we\u2019ve not experienced in our lifetimes. At the New York Fed we are working tirelessly\u2014leveraging our experience, expertise, and ingenuity\u2014to address the economic and financial challenges posed by the pandemic. This crisis requires innovative thinking and bold action. My colleagues and I are dedicated to doing our utmost to lessen the impact of the crisis on families and businesses in our communities, and to restore our nation\u2019s economic prosperity as quickly as possible.\n\nRelated Content"

    "content": "Good afternoon. As members of the Foreign Exchange Committee, you are all well aware of the importance of well-functioning financial markets. I would like to thank you for the commitment you have shown to supporting the smooth functioning of the foreign exchange market. Your continued leadership is especially important in these challenging times. And we are all grateful to those who are putting themselves in harm\u2019s way on the front lines to take care of others during this unprecedented public health emergency.\n\nIn early to mid-March, amid extreme volatility across financial markets triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, several markets at the center of the U.S. financial system were severely disrupted. In short-term funding markets, it was difficult to borrow for longer than overnight. In the usually very liquid markets for Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), trading became impaired. In investment-grade credit markets, even healthy borrowers found that credit was unavailable or very expensive.\n\nThese markets matter not only for those who participate in them, but also\u2014because of their central role in the financial system\u2014for workers and families throughout the United States. Continued disruptions could quickly make it more difficult for families to obtain mortgages at reasonable interest rates, for businesses to fund their operations and pay their workers, and for local, state, and federal governments to pay for essential services. Such a credit crunch would exacerbate the hardships many are experiencing in this period of economic constraint necessary to fight the spread of the coronavirus, and reduce the odds of a strong recovery afterward.\n\nTherefore, it was important for the Federal Reserve to act quickly and decisively to support market functioning and the flow of credit. Over a period of a few weeks, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered the target range for the federal funds rate to near zero. The Federal Reserve also announced a sequence of strong actions to support the flow of funding in short-term markets, the functioning of Treasury and MBS markets, and the availability of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments.\n\nToday, I will provide an overview of these actions to date from my perspective as manager of the System Open Market Account and head of the New York Fed\u2019s Open Market Trading Desk. The Fed\u2019s recent actions have involved an unprecedented array of tools\u2014from standard open market operations conducted by the Desk and deployed on a larger scale than ever before, to new facilities that use the Federal Reserve\u2019s emergency powers with the consent of the Treasury Secretary and financial backing from the Treasury and Congress. Some actions targeted problems in a single market, while others worked to support functioning across many markets. In addition, because they were deployed in close succession, the actions reinforced each other, with improvements in each market supporting the functioning of other markets and the financial system overall. I will speak about recent actions to support liquidity and the flow of credit in four areas: domestic short-term funding markets, international dollar funding markets, markets for Treasuries and MBS, and credit markets.\n\nBefore I proceed, let me note that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nDomestic Short-Term Funding Markets\n\nFunding markets transfer funds from households and businesses that seek safe, easily accessible short-term investments to firms that have short-term borrowing needs. For example, a manufacturing company with a temporary surplus of cash might invest in a money market mutual fund, planning to take the money back out in a few weeks to invest in new equipment. In turn, the money market fund might buy commercial paper issued by another company that needs to cover its payroll, or it might use a repurchase agreement (or \u201crepo\u201d) to lend to a broker-dealer that needs to finance an inventory of Treasury securities. The smooth flow of funds in these markets allows businesses to readily finance their operations and investors to engage in vibrant trading that keeps a wide range of other markets working well.\n\nIn mid-March, short-term funding markets became severely impaired. In repo and commercial paper markets, there was little term funding available. Even for overnight borrowing, some market participants paid much higher rates than usual. Figure 1 shows the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), which is the median rate on certain overnight repos against Treasury collateral, as well as the 75th and 95th percentiles of the distribution of these Treasury repo rates. Ordinarily, this distribution of rates is very tight. However, in the second and third weeks of March, it widened notably, with some borrowers paying dozens of basis points above the median, and well above the FOMC\u2019s target range for the federal funds rate.\n\nThe initial pressures in funding markets led to further strains. Investors became reluctant to buy the commercial paper of healthy issuers, for fear that when the paper came due, the issuers would have difficulty rolling it over into new paper. Prime money market funds\u2014which invest in commercial paper\u2014saw outflows of about $150 billion over the month of March as some investors worried that difficulty selling holdings would eventually prevent the funds from satisfying withdrawals.\n\nStarting March 9, the Federal Reserve launched a series of actions to stabilize funding markets. The first two actions involved expanding the use of standard tools: repo operations by the Desk and discount window lending by all 12 Reserve Banks.\n\nShortly thereafter, several additional actions used emergency tools, based on the Board\u2019s authority to act in unusual and exigent circumstances with consent of the Treasury Secretary and, in some cases, funding as well:\n\nInternational Dollar Funding Markets\n\nAs the world\u2019s preeminent reserve currency, the dollar plays a leading role in trade and investment far beyond our country\u2019s borders. Banks around the world borrow dollars in international markets to finance these activities. In addition, global banks borrow dollars to finance investments in the United States\u2014lending, that is, to American families, companies, and the U.S. government. As members of the FX Committee, you are well versed in the importance of international dollar funding markets.\n\nThese markets, too, came under severe strain in March. Shown in Figure 2, the yen-dollar swap basis spread\u2014a measure of the premium paid to borrow dollars using yen in the foreign exchange market\u2014soared by roughly 200 basis points. Other foreign exchange swap basis spreads also rose sharply, and foreign exchange swap trading volumes declined. These pressures had the potential to spill over to domestic funding markets, as international banks can compete to borrow dollars in the U.S., as well as the potential to disrupt the flow of credit from international financial institutions to domestic borrowers.\n\nTo ease strains in global U.S. dollar funding markets, the Federal Reserve and other central banks took coordinated actions in March to enhance the provision of U.S. dollar liquidity through central bank swap lines around the world. These swap lines are designed to improve liquidity conditions in the United States and abroad by providing foreign central banks with the capacity to deliver dollar funding to institutions in their jurisdictions during times of global funding market stress. This supports activities that rely on access to U.S. dollar funding, including supplying credit to U.S. borrowers. The Federal Reserve and the central banks of Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, Switzerland, and the euro area agreed to lower the pricing on the standing swap lines, to supply dollars at longer tenors in addition to regular one-week operations, and to increase the frequency of one-week operations. The Federal Reserve also established temporary swap lines, limited in size, with nine other central banks around the world.\n\nIn addition to the swap lines, the Federal Reserve established a temporary repo facility to allow foreign and international monetary authorities to temporarily exchange U.S. Treasury securities held in their accounts with the New York Fed for U.S. dollars. This facility provides those central banks with an alternative source of dollar funding that they can then lend to institutions in their jurisdictions. The facility also helps to support the smooth functioning of the market for U.S. Treasury securities by reducing foreign central banks\u2019 need to sell these securities outright when private cash and repo markets become stressed.\n\nMarkets for Treasury and Mortgage-Backed Securities\n\nThe market for U.S. Treasury securities is commonly described as the deepest and most liquid in the world. Ordinarily, it is easy for investors to sell Treasuries quickly and at low cost. This liquidity adds significantly to the value of Treasury securities, helping the U.S. government to borrow at low interest rates. As many other interest rates are priced relative to the safe interest rate on Treasuries, the liquidity of the Treasury market ultimately reduces financing costs for families and firms throughout the economy.\n\nAlthough not as liquid as the Treasury market, the market for agency MBS\u2014pools of residential mortgages backed by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac\u2014is also ordinarily very liquid. This liquidity makes MBS a more attractive investment, supporting low mortgage rates and the flow of mortgage financing to American households.\n\nHowever, in mid-March, liquidity in Treasuries and MBS dried up. The Desk\u2019s market monitoring and data analysis suggest that two key factors were at work. First, amid large moves in asset prices and uncertainty about access to liquidity, many investors sought to sell bond holdings. Some of these investors, such as asset managers that might need to meet redemptions, were seeking to raise cash. Others were rebalancing their portfolios after the sharp fall in equity prices, or exiting positions that were no longer viable in the highly volatile market conditions. These large sales of bonds drove up dealers\u2019 inventories of Treasuries and MBS; facing balance sheet constraints and internal risk limits amid the elevated volatility, dealers had to cut back on intermediation. Second, volatile market conditions led some trading firms to step back from the market, further reducing liquidity. Figure 3 shows the consequences: The average bid-ask spread for Treasury securities, a measure of transactions costs, rose by a factor of about 13 over the first few weeks of March. Many other measures of functioning in the Treasury and MBS markets also deteriorated.\n\nIn response, the Desk, at the direction of the FOMC, is undertaking extensive purchases of Treasuries and MBS to support the functioning of these critical markets. Although asset purchases are a standard Desk tool, the scale of these purchases has been unparalleled, totaling about $1.6 trillion in the past four weeks. Also, we are now buying agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), which are pools of mortgages on apartment buildings and other commercial properties that are backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae. As important as the volume of purchases is the FOMC\u2019s commitment, announced March 23, to purchase whatever amounts are needed to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy.8 Extending a strong commitment to support market functioning has calmed trading conditions and allayed the potentially self-fulfilling fear that conditions might deteriorate further.\n\nI should note that supporting smooth market functioning does not mean restoring every aspect of market functioning to its level before the coronavirus crisis. Some aspects of liquidity\u2014especially aspects related to transactions costs and market depth\u2014are importantly affected by fundamental factors such as how the current extraordinary uncertainty about the economic outlook influences trading behavior. These aspects of market functioning may not return all the way to pre-crisis levels for some time, even as our purchases slow.\n\nNor does supporting smooth market functioning mean eliminating all volatility. In well-functioning markets, prices will respond rapidly and efficiently to new information. During the unprecedented disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic, a great deal of new information arrives every day about the outlook for specific markets, such as housing, and for the economy as a whole. These changes in the outlook should move the Treasury and agency MBS markets irrespective of the Federal Reserve\u2019s purchases.\n\nCredit Markets\n\nIn normal times, credit markets allow households and businesses to finance a vast array of activities: buying a car or a house, attending college, covering a short-term gap between revenue and expenses, or making a long-term investment in new products or factories. In this time of economic stress, credit markets are all the more critical, helping families to borrow rather than forgo necessities, and helping businesses to keep going, cover their payrolls, and, eventually, make the investments needed for a strong recovery.\n\nYet credit markets have come under substantial pressure in recent weeks. For example, the spread of interest rates on investment-grade corporate bonds relative to Treasury securities widened by about 250 basis points from late February to mid-March, as illustrated in Figure 4.\n\nMuch of that pressure results from significant changes in the economic outlook: With many businesses temporarily closed and millions of people losing their jobs, lenders see a greater likelihood that some borrowers will be unable to repay. But impaired market functioning has also contributed to the pressures. For example, borrowers often repay their debts by borrowing anew, but rolling over debt is difficult in a stressed market, so lenders may conclude that market dysfunction will lead to defaults even by financially sound borrowers and respond by reducing lending or seeking higher interest rates. We saw several signs that poor market conditions were contributing to credit stress in March, including a drop-off in corporate and municipal bond issuance and large outflows from bond mutual funds.\n\nMany of the Federal Reserve actions in funding and asset markets that I described earlier are also helping to support credit markets. For example, the PDCF, CPFF, and MMLF can all provide funding for loans to creditworthy borrowers such as households, businesses, or local governments, while MBS purchases support a key market for credit to households.\n\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve Board, with the consent of the Treasury Secretary and backing provided by the Treasury and Congress under the CARES Act, has used its emergency authority to announce numerous steps targeted at other major credit markets. The Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility (PMCCF) will buy newly issued corporate bonds and syndicated loans, while the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF) will give investors an outlet to sell corporate bonds\u2014in both cases supporting a key market for credit to large employers.9 The Board has also announced a Main Street Lending Program that will purchase up to $600 billion in loans to small and midsize businesses, as well as a facility that will support the Small Business Administration\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) by supplying liquidity to financial institutions that make PPP loans to small businesses.10 In addition, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) will support the issuance of securities backed by student loans, auto loans, credit card loans, small business loans, and other debt, while the Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF) will lend up to $500 billion to state and local governments.11 All of these steps will help keep credit markets working and credit flowing to qualified borrowers in response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nConclusion\n\nModern financial markets are closely connected to one another. Stresses in one market can easily lead to stresses in others, raising the risk that the financial system as a whole becomes significantly impaired. For example, if short-term funding markets are disrupted, otherwise creditworthy borrowers may have difficulty rolling over their debts\u2014which can make the borrowers more risky and create pressures in credit markets. The Global Financial Crisis of 2007-\u201908 showed how rapidly problems can spread across financial markets and ultimately damage the economy.\n\nToday\u2019s crisis is different, having originated outside the financial system, in an enormous challenge to public health. Yet the lesson of the previous crisis still applies, and the Federal Reserve has taken it to heart in responding to the recent stresses in funding markets, Treasury and MBS markets, and credit markets. By acting quickly and forcefully to support all of these markets at once, we have been able to stabilize market conditions. Many challenges surely lie ahead for the economy and financial markets. But the past month demonstrates that the Federal Reserve will use its tools aggressively to keep markets working so that credit can flow to households, businesses, and state and local governments throughout our economy.\n\nThank you.\n\nFigures"

    "content": "Good afternoon. I would like to start by thanking Athanasios for inviting me to participate in this event. It is a real honor to highlight the influence of our esteemed colleague Marvin Goodfriend, an outstanding and original researcher, policy advisor, and friend.\n\nMarvin epitomized the role of policy advisor. His research dug deep into the issues, introduced new ideas into the discussion, and developed options for policymakers to consider for the most challenging issues. The fact that we have so many researchers and policymakers here is testament to the importance of his research in shaping the conversations that we are having to this day.\n\nBefore I reflect more on Marvin\u2019s contributions to monetary policy, I should give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIn preparation for what I know will be a stimulating discussion, I\u2019d like to highlight a few of the ways that Marvin changed the conversation in the U.S. about what was then commonly referred to as the zero lower bound on interest rates, or ZLB for short. These show how Marvin\u2019s insights shaped some of the most prominent discussions in monetary policy.\n\nBefore I do so, it\u2019s helpful to look back about 20 years. As the clock ticked down on the 20th century, many people\u2019s attention was not on the ZLB. Most were more concerned about the millennium bug that had the world on high alert.\n\nTruth be told, the ZLB wasn\u2019t perceived to be a looming problem in the United States back in 1999. The economy was doing very well and the target federal funds rate was 5-1/2 percent at the end of the year. Up until then, the only historical reference points for the ZLB were from the Great Depression of the 1930s and, more recently, Japan in the 1990s. It was simply not part of the experience of postwar Europe or the Americas.\n\nHowever, a small group of economists, with Marvin at the forefront, was asking whether the ZLB could pose a challenge here in the U.S. and, if so, what would be the consequences and potential remedies. Researchers and policymakers began to turn the dial up on the discussion around the ZLB.\n\nThe Fed held a conference in Woodstock, Vermont in October 1999 on the ZLB.1 At that conference, Marvin presented his paper \u201cOvercoming the Zero Bound on Interest Rate Policy,\u201d which was subsequently published in the Journal of Money, Credit and Banking (JMCB).2 In January 2002, Marvin briefed the FOMC on aspects of the research that he had presented at the Woodstock conference, as part of a session on the ZLB in which David Reifschneider and I presented our research as well.3 By that point, the federal funds rate had fallen to 1.75 percent, so the ZLB was starting to get on policymakers\u2019 radar screens.\n\nOn those occasions, Marvin emphasized the importance of the ZLB as a constraint on policy and urged us to think differently about how central banks could still carry out their missions, even under that constraint. He developed and analyzed what were then considered \u201coutside the box\u201d options for overcoming the ZLB. These helped lay the groundwork for how economists and policymakers think about these issues in both conceptual and practical terms.\n\nFor example, Marvin was one of the first people to think seriously about how the constraint caused by the ZLB could be relaxed by implementing negative interest rates. Now, I know that the topic of negative interest rates is controversial. But, whatever conclusions you may draw about the relative merits of negative rates, Marvin\u2019s research early on helped identify and explore a broad dimension of issues and potential choices for policymakers.\n\nMarvin\u2019s intellectual pursuit of all aspects of the ZLB logically drove him to explore the possibility for currency to have a digital component. Although many think of central bank digital currencies as a new-fangled idea, Marvin was thinking deeply about the prospect long ago. This has become one of the hot topics in the world of central banks today.\n\nThe conversation that Marvin began in Woodstock in 1999 became the basis for discussions that were had later on at the FOMC meeting in January 2002. At that FOMC meeting, Marvin expanded upon the idea of asset purchases as a policy tool that he had proposed in his paper at the conference in Woodstock.\n\nHe emphasized that the Fed asset purchases can affect financial conditions and thereby the economy. He was expanding the conversation away from thinking about conventional monetary policy to unconventional options, like the balance sheet. Importantly, he distinguished between central bank purchases of short-term government securities, as the Bank of Japan was doing at that time, versus purchases of longer-term securities. Marvin viewed purchases of short-term securities as ineffective under the ZLB, while he saw purchases of longer-duration securities as potentially powerful owing to a \u201cpreferred habitat\u201d motive on the part of investors. Of course, large-scale asset purchases later became a tool of critical importance for easing financial conditions in the United States and abroad.\n\nAlthough the consequences of the predicted Y2K glitch were minimal, the ZLB became a central issue when the financial crisis hit. Thankfully, Marvin, along with others, helped lay the intellectual groundwork and created the vocabulary for us to work through some of the most significant issues facing central banks. His work is a true emblem of how researchers play a vital role in informing and shaping the policy discussion.\n\nI look forward to the upcoming conversation. Thank you."

    "content": "Thank you so much for this award. It\u2019s a genuine honor to be recognized in this way. And allow me to add my congratulations to all the other organizations and individuals that have been commended this evening. The work that you\u2019re doing\u2014particularly in the area of corporate social responsibility\u2014is so important.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point.1 This action was in response to the evolving risks the coronavirus poses to the U.S. economy. Tonight, I\u2019ll use my remarks to provide more context around that decision and about our response as we look ahead.\n\nBut before I give this evening\u2019s remarks I need to give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nTo start, let me emphasize that the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong. We\u2019ve seen continued solid job growth, unemployment is at a historically low level, and we entered 2020 with very good momentum. After a year that was characterized by uncertainties, global growth appeared to be stabilizing, and geopolitical risks receding. And monetary policy was well positioned to support the economic expansion and the achievement of the Fed\u2019s goals of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nRisks to the Economy\n\nHowever, during the past month the outbreak and subsequent spread of the coronavirus has brought with it new risks to the economic outlook. This is first and foremost a human tragedy, and my deepest sympathies are with those who have lost loved ones.\n\nThe virus and the necessary scale of the response to address the public health challenge will have near-term effects on the global economy. These repercussions have been especially strong in the hardest-hit countries, including China, South Korea, Japan, Italy, and Iran. We are now also hearing reports that some businesses here in the United States are being affected by supply disruptions and weakening demand. As people take precautions, we\u2019re seeing concerns around the tourism and travel sectors, in particular.\n\nDisease outbreaks require a multifaceted approach, and the coronavirus is no different. This is primarily a public health issue, which will be fought on the front lines by doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals. Governments will also need to step in to support the healthcare response, and, if needed, to provide targeted relief to affected industries and workers through fiscal measures.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nCentral banks like the Federal Reserve also have an important role to play in addressing the economic effects of the coronavirus, ensuring that financial markets function effectively and providing support to the economy. These actions cannot address the health issues, but can help manage near-term risks to the economy in a highly uncertain time.\n\nEarlier this week, the FOMC voted unanimously to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1 to 1-1/4 percent. This strong policy action provides meaningful support to the economy and will help sustain the economic expansion. The outlook is evolving and highly uncertain. In the weeks and months ahead, we will continue to closely monitor developments and their implications for the economic outlook. We will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy.\n\nAs part of our response, my colleagues and I in the Federal Reserve System are coordinating with our counterparts around the world. Tuesday\u2019s phone call between G7 finance ministers and central bank governors, the subsequent statement, and policy actions by central banks are clear indications of the close alignment at the international level.\n\nFinancial Markets\n\nTurning to the specific responsibilities of the New York Fed, we are tasked with the implementation of monetary policy. Our goals are to keep the federal funds rate within the target range and foster stable conditions in short-term funding markets.\n\nWe will ensure that the supply of reserves in the banking system remains ample, consistent with the FOMC\u2019s direction.2 Treasury bill purchases continue to add to the underlying level of reserves, and repo operations are keeping reserve levels ample. We are monitoring conditions in money markets closely. We remain flexible and ready to make adjustments to our operations as needed to ensure that monetary policy is effectively implemented and transmitted to financial markets and the broader economy.\n\nConclusion\n\nI\u2019ll conclude with this: The coronavirus poses evolving risks to the U.S. economy. Our policy action this week positions us well to support the economic expansion. We are carefully monitoring the effects of the coronavirus on the U.S. economic outlook and will respond as appropriate. Our focus remains trained on serving the American people by pursuing our dual goals of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nOnce again, thank you for this evening\u2019s award."

    "title": "Climate Change and Risk Management in Bank Supervision",
    "date": "Mar 4, 2020",
    "speaker": "Kevin J. Stiroh",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2020/sti200304",
    "content": "Introduction\n\nGood afternoon and thank you for the opportunity to participate in this conference on \u201cRisks, Opportunities, and Investments in the Era of Climate Change,\u201d a topic of critical importance for all of us.\n\nClimate change is already affecting economic and financial outcomes, and projections point to increasingly severe and unpredictable change.1 In recent years, we\u2019ve seen a growing focus of central banks on the financial risks related to climate change. Some may argue that this shift was slow in coming, but the change is striking nevertheless. Beginning with Bank of England Governor Mark Carney\u2019s speech in 20152 , climate change has emerged as a key issue globally. Within the Federal Reserve, Governor Brainard detailed how climate change impacts the Fed\u2019s core objectives around monetary policy, financial stability, financial regulation and supervision, community and consumer affairs, and payments and describes efforts to build capacity to assess these risks.3\n\nToday, I\u2019m going to take a more narrow perspective and talk about climate change from the perspective of risk management. I\u2019ll discuss how the development of new risks associated with climate change is beginning to change the practice of risk management at financial institutions in terms of governance, risk identification and management, scenario analysis and transparency. I\u2019ll also say a few words on why I believe it is appropriate, even critical, for supervisors to focus on this particular risk.\n\nBefore proceeding, I will emphasize that I am speaking for myself and my views do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nClimate Change and Risk Management\n\nThe discussion of climate change and risk management has introduced a new lexicon for risk discussions. Physical risk is the potential for losses as climate-related changes disrupt business operations, destroy capital and interrupt economic activity. Transition risk is the potential for loss resulting from a shift toward a lower-carbon economy as policy, consumer sentiment and technological innovations impact the value of certain assets and liabilities. These effects will be felt across business sectors and asset classes, on strategies and operations, and through the balance sheets and income statements of financial firms.\n\nAt a practical level, risk managers at financial institutions need to develop the appropriate tools to identify, monitor and manage these risks. From one perspective, climate-related risks may manifest as realizations of familiar risks such as credit, market, operational, legal and reputational risk. The tools risk managers use, however, will need to change to reflect new data, changing relationships, and evolving interconnections. Traditional backward-looking models based on historical trends may no longer be reliable, so the development of forward-looking approaches grounded in scenario-based analyses may be necessary.4 Perhaps even more importantly, physical and transition risks will likely introduce new strategic risks associated with the challenges and opportunities of sectoral reallocations of economic activity, new production patterns and evolving industry exposures.\n\nRange of Practices\n\nGiven these emerging risks, what are large financial institutions actually doing to identify, monitor, and manage them? This is a new and rapidly evolving field, so we are far from coalescing around best practices or industry standards. Nevertheless, some emerging themes are emerging from the largest, most complex financial institutions. I will touch on governance, risk identification and management, scenario analysis, and transparency.\n\nI\u2019ll begin with governance. Boards of directors and senior management are increasingly attuned to the risks posed by climate change as pressure from various stakeholders intensifies. For example, some firms are establishing internal climate-related working groups to develop enterprise-wide climate frameworks and to ensure climate considerations such as geographic concentrations or regulatory changes are better integrated into strategic decision-making. Some senior leaders are discussing risk materiality in geographic and sectoral reviews and results of forward-looking climate scenario analyses. Few firms, however, have formally modified or qualified enterprise-wide risk appetite statements to acknowledge climate to date, although some are considering this. Based on our observations, information flows and detailed climate reporting appear more prevalent at the management committee level rather than boards of directors.\n\nIn terms of risk identification and management, some firms are beginning to assess how gradual changes in climate impact operational resilience and the potential for business disruption. Several conduct periodic disruption simulations with predictive weather modeling as part of their resiliency programs. This work builds on experience managing risks posed by disaster events, including severe weather, to their operations and infrastructure such as branches, equipment and data centers. This includes updating disaster response playbooks and business continuity plans to address the resultant operational risks.\n\nIn terms of credit and market risk, some firms are building ex-ante climate risk assessments into sectoral or industry reviews, while others are considering the role of climate change within traditional ex-post assessments of exposures and loss estimates related to severe weather events like wildfires, hurricanes, and flooding. Examples include: heightened monitoring of mortgage concentrations in high-risk areas, modified risk limits or reduced tenors for transactions to certain carbon-intensive sectors, and consideration of climate risk disclosures in offering documents.\n\nClimate-related scenario analysis is an emerging practice at multiple firms to identify lending portfolio sensitivity to both physical and transition risks. For physical risk scenarios, this might include stressing mortgage lending in discrete geographies against both publically available natural hazard scenarios and internally generated severe weather simulations. For transition risk scenarios, some firms are using their energy lending portfolios as a starting point to model transition mechanisms. Additionally, some firms are considering how to expand analysis to more indirectly impacted sectors, such as transportation and industrials, or to move beyond lending exposures to trading positions.\n\nFinally, firms are evaluating how to best execute on public commitments to transparency in the climate space. Nearly all global systemically important banks, including all eight U.S. G-SIBS, have signed onto the Task-Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and many of these have started disclosing under this framework to various extents.5 Firms continue to be challenged in the identification and measurement of climate risk embedded in their portfolios, however, so these disclosures may take some time to develop as the industry considers how to establish common standards.\n\nRole of Supervision\n\nI\u2019ll turn now to the perspective of a bank supervisor.6 In the context of climate change, in my view, bank supervision should focus on ensuring that appropriate risk management frameworks are in place, rather than using supervisory tools for broader objectives. That is, supervisors can focus on identifying and managing risks, both microprudential and macroprudential, that emerge along a transition path to a more sustainable economy. Bank supervisors, however, are not in the position to advocate for, or provide incentives for, a particular policy outcome. Those broader policy goals are the purview of elected officials and governments, and policymakers. Supervisors can and should use our oversight tools to ensure financial institutions are prepared for and resilient to all types of relevant risks, including climate-related events.\n\nFrom that perspective, climate change introduces challenges for supervisors related to time horizon, data limitations, and inherent complexity.7 One question that gets particular attention centers on time horizon and prioritization. More specifically, given the many risks that financial firms face\u2014cybersecurity, geopolitical uncertainty, and the credit cycle to name a few\u2014and the relatively long time horizon around climate change, why should supervisors focus on this particular risk? I think that is a fair question and there are good answers.\n\nFirst, we are already observing the impacts of climate change on financial firms. Evidence continues to grow that climate change is affecting economic and financial outcomes.8 Moreover, evidence from climate science suggests that some further physical climate impacts are locked-in due to past emissions.9 Some investors consider an assessment of sustainability to be integral to their fiduciary responsibilities.10 And, as I described earlier, supervised firms are choosing to build capacity in this areas, so supervisors need to understand and assess these changes. This is a risk management question for today with direct implications for safety and soundness.\n\nSecond, given the complexity of the problem, we all need time to build data, models, and intellectual capacity to address risks as they arise in the future. It took the better part of a decade to approach a steady-state in central bank stress testing capabilities for more familiar and arguably less complex risks like credit card losses or shocks to asset values from interest rate spikes. The economics of climate change are more complex with feedback effects, non-linearities and massive uncertainty that will require substantial investments to understand.11\n\nThird, financial markets and institutions face the potential for a \u201cMinsky moment\u201d related to climate change\u2014an abrupt repricing of assets in response to a catastrophic event or change in investor perceptions.12 Financial firms and supervisors need to consider the potential and impact of this type of sudden event.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn closing, the impact of climate change on the structure and performance of the economy and the financial sector is happening now and will continue. Conferences like this certainly help to further our awareness and understanding of this critical issue. I am confident that risk managers and central banks will continue to invest and build capacity to understand and mitigate these risks in order to make the financial sector more resilient.\n\nI look forward to hearing the insights from across the financial sector in the remainder of this conference.\n\nThank you for your attention."

    "title": "Opening Remarks: Heterogeneity Blog Series Webinar",
    "date": "Mar 4, 2020",
    "speaker": "Beverly Hirtle",
    "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2020/hir200304",
    "content": "I am delighted to be here today to introduce this webinar about our Liberty Street Economics blog series on heterogeneity in labor market outcomes. These blogs describe several ways that the forces shaping U.S. labor markets cause the experiences of workers to vary for different cohorts of individuals, including for women as compared to men; for high-wage versus lower-wage workers; and for workers who face more or less stringent constraints on their ability to borrow. These posts are based on research and analysis being conducted by New York Fed economists, part of continuing efforts by our economists to understand how economic outcomes vary for different groups in the economy. This series follows our inaugural set of posts on heterogeneity in October of last year, in what we hope will be an on-going discussion of work being done at the New York Fed and elsewhere to understand these important topics.\n\nIn recent years, we have devoted considerable time and resources here at the New York Fed to develop data and analytical approaches to gain deeper insights into the experiences of workers and consumers. For instance, we sponsor the Consumer Credit Panel, or CCP, a quarterly report on household credit based on a large sample of credit data from Equifax. We have also developed the Survey of Consumer Expectations, or SCE, a monthly survey of consumer expectations about inflation, the labor market and household finance. These reports and summary data are available from the New York Fed\u2019s Center for Microeconomic Data, which can be accessed on the Bank\u2019s website, newyorkfed.org.\n\nAside from producing these public reports, New York Fed researchers also use the underlying data to do detailed econometric analysis, some of which forms the basis of the blog series you\u2019ll hear about today. In some cases, we are able to link the CCP, SCE and other data sets to derive insights into a wider set of factors affecting workers and consumers, such as educational attainment, student debt burden, job satisfaction, job transitions, access to credit and housing choices\u2014and consumer expectations about many of these factors.\n\nWhy do we do this? Why is it important to generate insights about individual workers rather than relying just on analysis of the aggregate data? The first, and most obvious, point is that the aggregate masks the experiences of individuals. Not all workers and consumers experience the economy in the same way. Employment, wage and income growth, housing, education, credit and a host of other outcomes vary significantly across different cohorts of individuals and these differences in turn can vary over the business cycle. To understand important economic concepts like full employment, financial security, productivity growth and the impact of education, it is vital to understand not just the average experience but rather how all cohorts of the population are faring.\n\nThis understanding is important in and of itself, especially in evaluating the impact of critical trends affecting the economy, like technological innovation or demographics, as well as the policies intended to respond to the impacts of those trends. We cannot fully understand whether policies have improved social welfare unless we understand how the impact of those policies varies across individuals.\n\nBut understanding heterogeneity is important even if we are just examining policy impact in the aggregate. The most innovative macroeconomic models, those at the frontier of current economic work, recognize heterogeneity across consumers in assessing how monetary and fiscal policy changes are transmitted through the economy. These models incorporate individuals with different marginal propensities to consume, with different amounts of wealth or access to borrowing, or who face different risk exposures, such as the chance they become unemployed, over the business cycle. Incorporating these factors can yield quite distinct insights about how changes in monetary or fiscal policy can affect growth, employment, wages and inflation. For those who want to know more, we published a blog post on Monday of last week that describes the output of just such a model. Regardless of the specific details, the key is that differences across individuals can be important for understanding how the economy works, even in the aggregate.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Research group at the New York Fed is committed to continue our work on heterogeneity, across several dimensions of what we do. We are always looking for ways to expand and deepen our knowledge, to enhance the data that is available to our economists and others to do deep, sophisticated research on these topics, and, critically, to publish the work so that we are adding to the store of knowledge both among academic researchers and among policymakers. We are well-placed to understand what the important questions are, to generate the data needed to answer them and to speak to diverse audiences about the results. This webinar and blog series are important parts of our strategy for communicating about our work and for advancing thought about the critical role that heterogeneity plays in our economy.\n\nThank you."

    "content": "Thank you for the warm introduction. It\u2019s an absolute pleasure to be back at the London School of Economics, where I completed my Master\u2019s degree in the late 1980s. Studying at the LSE, with remarkable professors like Richard Layard, Chris Pissarides, George Evans, and the late Tony Atkinson, inspired me to pursue a career in economics and public policy. I owe a great debt of gratitude to this institution and am in awe of how it has evolved and grown in the past 30 years.\n\nI will say that there are a few things I have not missed since my days in London: the food (yes, that has changed!), the high cost of living (some things never change), and the endless studying for and worrying about final exams. But I have missed the dear friends I made, the book shops, and the library.\n\nIt\u2019s ironic that I find myself back at the London School of Economics and NOT talking about economics. The views I bring to today\u2019s discussion come from professional and personal, rather than academic experience.\n\nI\u2019ve now led two major organizations, and culture is both the hardest and the most important thing to get right. Culture is at the heart of behavior and norms, and the single most important factor driving the decision-making of employees. It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that culture is critical\u2014both when things go right, and when they go wrong.\n\nBefore I get any deeper into ideas about culture, I should give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nCulture Shapes Our Working Lives\n\nWhen we talk about company culture in the context of financial services, the first thing that comes to mind is the risky, unethical, and sometimes criminal behavior in the banking industry, particularly during the financial crisis. And 10 years on from the crisis, this behavior persists. Instances of fraud, money laundering, and scandals related to foreign exchange and LIBOR continue to make the headlines.1\n\nThis behavior puts a spotlight on the essential role of robust regulation and strict enforcement.\n\nBut illicit and unethical behavior is rarely the result of an isolated \u201cbad apple.\u201d It\u2019s more often the symptom of a rotten culture. And rotten cultures don\u2019t appear overnight\u2014nor for that matter do positive, inclusive ones, where people feel empowered and accountable to upholding the values of the organization.\n\nCulture is created\u2014intentionally or otherwise\u2014by the structures, incentives, and behavioral norms that shape our working lives.\n\nToday I want to move our attention away from the extreme behavior that makes the headlines, and think more deeply about organizational cultures.\n\nWhat does a good culture look like? How can leaders in the industry establish a positive culture within their firms? And perhaps hardest of all, how do you ensure that a firm\u2019s culture adapts to the changing world, but still stays true to its values and purpose?\n\nAn Ethical Dilemma\n\nConsider this:2\n\nA junior banker on a successful real estate investment team is asked to run projections for future rental income for a mall in Hong Kong. As part of her research she notices a number in a spreadsheet that inflates future cash flows by 4 percent. She asks a senior analyst if the number should be flagged as an optimistic assumption, so it\u2019s clear it\u2019s not based on evidence. The senior analyst responds by saying the number is a more conservative estimate than many. He says it\u2019s a \u201cjudgment call\u201d and that they can discuss it once the project has concluded.\n\nBut the project comes and goes, everyone is busy, and the senior analyst doesn\u2019t bring it up again.\n\nThis scenario raises numerous questions: Should the junior team member raise the issue again or should she let it go? What was driving the behavior of the senior analyst? And why did no one else on the team view the situation as an ethical dilemma?\n\nThese are the kinds of issues that people often face in a work environment. And this example demonstrates many of the ways culture influences behavior.\n\nEmployees may enter an organization with a strong sense of right and wrong. What they may not realize is that group norms can exert a powerful magnetic pull on their moral compass.\n\nThe junior banker knew the way the number was being presented was unethical, and yet she complied with her boss. The response from the senior analyst, describing the situation as a \u201cjudgment call,\u201d is a common phenomenon. Using a euphemism to describe the inflated statistic camouflages the wrongdoing and makes it sound more acceptable to others.\n\nWe see it in our daily lives\u2014terms like \u201ctroublemaker\u201d and \u201cnot being a team player\u201d are often used to shift the onus from the person whose behavior is being challenged to the challenger.\n\nAnn Tenbrunsel\u2019s work has been very important for revealing how we use language to disguise or excuse behavior we know to be unacceptable.3\n\nOne of the other issues this example illustrates is how organizational norms affect our own sense of what\u2019s right and wrong and whether to speak up.\n\nMany of you here today will be familiar with the Asch experiment, where students participated in a vision test. There was a control line and three other lines labelled A, B, and C. Participants had to state aloud which line was the same length as the control. But they had to do so after a group of actors had given an incorrect answer.4\n\nAbout one third of participants went along with the majority, even though it was readily apparent their answers were incorrect.5 When asked why they went along with the group they said it was because they wanted to fit in, or because they believed the group was better informed than they were.\n\nDoes the junior banker drop the issue in an effort to fit in? Does she raise the issue in private, or does she call a company hotline? The answer depends on the complex relationship between the individual and the culture in which they work.\n\nI\u2019m particularly looking forward to hearing from Celia Moore. She spoke at the New York Fed last year and discussed how organizations set goals and motivate people to achieve them. Praise, penalties, and rewards all influence an individual\u2019s behavior. Signals from the organization\u2019s leadership also have a major role to play: do the higher echelons of management value divergent views? Do they foster a culture where people feel empowered to speak up?6\n\nAll of these things shape how an individual will respond to an ethical dilemma, whether they will acknowledge it as such, and how they will lead others as they move up in an organization.\n\nAs financial services professionals with great technical expertise, we often fall into the trap of thinking we can solve all of our problems on our own. But we have so much to learn from experts in other fields.\n\nStrengths as Blind Spots\n\nOne of the most important lessons I\u2019ve learned as a CEO is that there\u2019s no fixed endpoint when it comes to shaping an organization\u2019s culture. You can never take a step back and say, \u201cWe\u2019ve finished the culture project. Well done! Now it\u2019s time to focus our efforts elsewhere.\u201d\n\nCulture is constantly evolving, and therefore needs to be constantly nurtured. One of the most challenging elements is that there\u2019s no clear benchmark for success. And sometimes your greatest strengths can become your blind spots.\n\nAs an organization with a public mission and regulatory responsibilities, the Fed needs to have a particular focus on compliance. But cultures with a heavy focus on compliance can breed a sense that individuals aren\u2019t responsible for their actions.\n\nAs a CEO, I\u2019ve tackled these issues by focusing on principles and values rather than writing extensive policies that try to cover every potential decision. This puts a premium on individual accountability to do what\u2019s right and creating an environment where everyone has the ability and responsibility to speak up. Somewhat paradoxically, focusing on principled decision making and accountability, rather than relying exclusively on rules and policies, can be the most effective safeguard against wrongdoing and unethical behavior.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Way Forward?\n\nCreating a positive work culture is challenging and ongoing work. And there\u2019s no silver bullet that can solve cultural problems overnight.\n\nIn terms of how to move forward I\u2019d like to make three brief points before I close:\n\nFirst, the fact that we\u2019re all sitting here in this room is a very positive sign. That so many leaders from major firms are here today, engaged in these issues, is a symbol of how organizational culture is moving up the agenda.\n\nThe second is that the Banking Standards Board survey is a terrific tool for getting a snapshot of what your organization\u2019s culture looks like and how it\u2019s changing over time. It goes far beyond typical engagement questionnaires and provides powerful insights into the values of employees and the characteristics of an organization.7 It\u2019s impossible to make progress if you don\u2019t have an accurate picture of your starting point.\n\nThe third is that when it comes to culture, I encourage everyone to look beyond their own lens of expertise. The Fed couldn\u2019t do its work without the deep knowledge of economists, lawyers, and statisticians. But the solutions to challenges related to a firm\u2019s culture are unlikely to be found if we keep our focus narrowly trained on our own specialties. We have so much to learn from experts in psychology, ethics, and management.\n\nThat\u2019s one reason I\u2019ve been so looking forward to today\u2019s panel discussion. It brings together experts from many of these fields, whose combined insights are the key to moving us all toward the business culture we want to see.\n\nLearn more about the New York Fed\u2019s work on governance and culture reform."

    "content": "Introduction\n\nGood afternoon, and happy new year.\n\nMonetary policy frameworks are complex, technical, and rarely make it into the public consciousness. But they are of vital importance to economic prosperity. And as we stand on the brink of a new decade, it is critically important that we understand how the frameworks central banks choose influence economic outcomes, both today and in the future.\n\nWhen Andy Haldane invited me to be on the panel, he posed the provocative question: What will monetary policy frameworks look like 30 years from now?\n\nAs a policymaker, I try to avoid making predictions for the future. But given that I will assuredly be an ex-central banker in the year 2050, I think I\u2019m safe to have free rein!\n\nThat said, I should still give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIn my remarks today, I\u2019ll discuss how the monetary policy landscape has evolved, and what that means for inflation targeting in 2020, 2050, and beyond.\n\nThe History of Inflation Targeting\n\nBefore I look forward, it\u2019s worth looking back and highlighting that it\u2019s now 30 years since the inception of inflation targeting.\n\nIn 1989, the central bank of the small country of New Zealand announced that the main objective of its monetary policy was to target the inflation rate.1 In the subsequent decades, most central banks in major economies coalesced around this approach of aiming for a low, publicly announced inflation rate.\n\nFor the past three decades, this approach has been remarkably successful at keeping inflation low and stable.2 The inflation targets have acted as a nominal anchor for inflation expectations, which play a big role in determining actual inflation.\n\nFor anyone who was trying to get a mortgage at a double-digit interest rate or seeing prices go up and up back in the days of high inflation, it\u2019s almost unthinkable that in 2020 central banks are pondering the opposite challenge: how to prevent inflation from being too low.\n\nBut it\u2019s the reality most policymakers face, and the one our monetary policy frameworks will need to grapple with long into the future.\n\nThe Future of Inflation\n\nSo, how did we arrive where we are today? Why is low inflation the current challenge, and why will that likely persist?\n\nTo answer these questions, we need to look at r-star, or the longer-run neutral rate of interest.\n\nOne estimate of r-star in the United States, from a model developed by Holston, Laubach, and myself, is around half a percent in the United States. That\u2019s actually now lower than at any time before the Great Recession.3 We\u2019ve seen similar declines in r-star in other advanced economies, including in Japan and the euro area.\n\nIn fact, the GDP-weighted average of estimates of r-star for Canada, the euro area, the United Kingdom, and the United States is now also half a percent, nearly 2 percentage points below where it stood at the turn of this century.4\n\nThese very low neutral rates are largely a result of global, longer-term structural factors. They\u2019re driven by demographic changes, slow productivity growth, and demand for safe assets\u2014all of which are unlikely to reverse any time soon.5\n\nOne key takeaway from these global trends is that interest rates and inflation are going to stay lower than we\u2019ve come to expect in the past.6 This means that monetary policy will likely be more frequently constrained by the lower bound, or LB for short, creating a set of challenges for policymakers. In particular, life near the LB means central banks have much less room to maneuver using adjustments in short-term interest rates when faced with a downturn.\n\nThe Fundamentals of Inflation Targeting\n\nGiven that inflation targeting was designed in a world where inflation was undesirably high, does it still work for a world with the opposite problem?\n\nAs I peer into the future, the question is not so much what is wrong with inflation targeting, but rather what we need to preserve and, in fact, strengthen it. Any evolution of the current framework should involve doubling down on fundamental principles that have proven to be successful.\n\nWhat do I mean by that? There are three fundamental elements of inflation targeting that will be crucial as central banks work to prevent inflation from drifting too low: well-anchored inflation expectations, accountability, and transparency.\n\nInflation Expectations, Accountability, and Transparency\n\nThe most critical element is anchoring inflation expectations at the right level. For those of you who lived through the 1970s and 1980s, the specter of high inflation probably still looms large. But millennials and Generation Z have never faced the prospect of paying 15 percent on a mortgage.\n\nIt\u2019s often claimed that we don\u2019t really understand what drives inflation expectations. But, in fact, researchers have made significant progress on this topic. Research using a number of approaches has found that the history of inflation plays a big role in inflation expectations.\n\nNow, this does not mean that expectations are a mechanical average of past inflation, like in traditional versions of adaptive expectations. Instead, the key finding of this research is that inflation expectations depend on the historical behavior of inflation as shaped by the conduct of monetary policy.\n\nFor example, recent work using the New York Fed\u2019s Survey of Consumer Expectations shows a decline in longer-run inflation expectations by nearly half a percentage point over the last six years, to about 2-1/4 percent.7 This decline reflects both the low CPI inflation of recent years and demographic shifts, where members of older cohorts with high expectations (I\u2019m afraid to say) die off.\n\nIf inflation continues to underrun target levels similar to the past six years, the downward trend in inflation expectations will likely continue. But there is still time to avert this fate\u2014in this case, it\u2019s fortunate that the young are impressionable. If inflation is sustained at target levels consistently, a further downward trend in expectations can be forestalled.\n\nBut expectations depend on deeds, not just words, which brings me to the issue of accountability. One reason inflation targeting has been so successful at keeping inflation low and stable is that policymakers held themselves accountable for consistently delivering low inflation near the target.\n\nFinally, as well as holding ourselves accountable, policymakers need to be transparent and communicate their actions and the rationale behind them. Much has been made about whether central banks can credibly commit to future actions and outcomes, but the experience with inflation targeting gives me encouragement. Inflation-targeting central banks have proved beyond a doubt that they could bring inflation down and keep it low and stable. This was not a foregone conclusion, and initially there were doubts about whether inflation targeting would succeed.\n\nIn addition, forward guidance delivered in the years following the financial crisis had a clear and direct effect on driving policy expectations and financial conditions. Keeping inflation expectations anchored at the right point will depend not just on policymakers holding themselves accountable for inflation, but on their ability to clearly execute and communicate their policies.\n\nConclusion\n\nI\u2019ll finish with this. It\u2019s risky to make predictions about the future. But in many ways the future is already here. Low r-star and declining inflation expectations are clear indicators of what\u2019s to come. There\u2019s been a great deal of discussion about how central banks around the world, and the Federal Reserve in particular, are going to deal with the challenges that lie ahead.\n\nAs the FOMC engages on its ongoing framework review, it is important to state again that any changes to our monetary policy framework must and will be carefully and thoughtfully considered. As long as we double down on the fundamentals of inflation targeting by anchoring inflation expectations at the target level, holding ourselves accountable to delivering on our objectives, and being transparent about our actions, we will be well positioned to handle whatever the future might bring.\n\nThank you."
