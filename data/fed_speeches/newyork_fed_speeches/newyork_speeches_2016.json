        "title": "The U.S. Economic Outlook and the Implications for Monetary Policy",
        "content": "It is a great pleasure to be here and have the opportunity to talk about the U.S. economic outlook. I want to thank the Association for a Better New York (ABNY) for sponsoring today’s event. This is an excellent venue to speak about what we can do to improve our country’s economic performance. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nThe U.S. economy—supported by solid gains in household spending—has expanded at a moderate rate in 2016. Job gains have been sturdy, and we have seen some firming in wage growth as the labor market has continued to tighten. Moreover, as the effects of earlier declines in energy prices have dissipated, the overall inflation rate has begun to move up closer to our 2 percent objective. As a consequence, economic conditions are not far from the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment and price stability. And, I expect that we will make further progress toward these goals in 2017. So, from a cyclical perspective, the economy is in reasonably good shape.\n\nOver the longer term, however, the U.S. economy faces significant challenges. On the positive side, economic expansions don’t die of old age, and there appear to be few imbalances in the economy that could lead to the current expansion ending. But, in order for this to remain the case, it is important that fiscal policy and monetary policy are well aligned going forward.\n\nIt is also important that the United States retains sufficient fiscal capacity so that fiscal policy can support the economy when the next cyclical downturn does occur. If fiscal policy can play a greater role in promoting macroeconomic stability, it would likely reduce the need for monetary authorities to take extraordinary actions to support economic activity.\n\nThere are other structural issues worth noting. In particular, productivity growth has been anemic over the past few years, while income inequality has increased and income mobility remains low. As a consequence, the gains in living standards generated by the current business expansion have been modest compared to previous expansions, and these gains have not been widely shared. Much more could be done both locally and nationally to increase the economy’s potential to perform better for a broader array of our citizens.\n\nThe Outlook for Growth and Inflation\n\nThe U.S. economy has been expanding at a moderate rate. Growth has averaged about 1.8 percent this year and seems likely to continue at or slightly above this pace in 2017. The main driver of growth in 2016 has been the consumer, as real personal consumption expenditures have increased at a 2.9 percent annual rate during the first three quarters. This solid consumption growth has been supported by sturdy job gains and rising nominal wages. Payroll gains have averaged about 180,000 per month this year. While this is down somewhat from 2015’s monthly pace of nearly 230,000, it is still considerably higher than the 75,000-110,000 monthly pace consistent with the likely long-term growth in the labor force. And wage gains, while still relatively muted, have begun to rise more rapidly as the labor market has continued to tighten.\n\nAnother positive factor for the economy is that household finances generally are in good shape. The household saving rate is 5.9 percent, which is a bit higher than one would expect based on historical relationships between household net worth and disposable income. And, after a long period of deleveraging, household debt has been growing, but very slowly. Over the last four quarters, household debt has risen by 2.4 percent. This slow pace, combined with low borrowing rates and an improving labor market, has pushed down the ratio of household debt service to income close to its lowest level since at least 1980. This suggests that households have the financial capacity to sustain their spending.\n\nIn contrast to consumer spending, many other areas of the economy have been considerably softer. Residential investment, after experiencing strong gains in 2015 and in the first quarter of 2016, fell during the past two quarters. However, increases in single-family housing starts and permits in October suggest that we are likely to see a reversal of this trend in the fourth quarter and into next year.\n\nBusiness fixed investment has also been weak for some time. Part of this weakness reflects the collapse in oil and gas drilling activity following the plunge in crude oil prices during the second half of 2014. This adjustment now appears to be over, as oil and gas prices have recovered somewhat. But, even outside of this area, business fixed investment has been disappointing. Several factors may be at play here—including earlier uncertainty surrounding the presidential election outcome and the fact that capacity utilization rates remain unusually low at this point in the economic business cycle. While the election uncertainty has been resolved, I would expect business fixed investment to only rise slowly in the year ahead.\n\nIn contrast, the trade sector has performed surprisingly well in 2016. This sector had to contend with headwinds created by weak growth in final demand by our major foreign trading partners, as well as the impact of earlier dollar strength on the nation’s export competitiveness. However, I’m not sure that I would take much signal from this performance. The improvement in trade seems to have been driven mainly by weakness in imports, particularly for capital goods, and by some one-off factors, such as the surge in soybean exports last quarter—both of which are unlikely to continue.\n\nWith respect to inflation, we are making progress in pushing toward our 2 percent objective. In particular, headline inflation has risen this year as the earlier declines in energy prices have dropped out of the year-over-year figures. And, core inflation has remained broadly steady, running at 1.7 percent over the past year—as measured by the personal consumption expenditures deflator that excludes food and energy. This stability is noteworthy, because one might have anticipated that lower energy prices and a firmer dollar would have pushed core inflation a bit lower. Also, household inflation expectations—which at times in 2015 appeared to be at risk of becoming unanchored to the downside—have been broadly stable. The University of Michigan long-term inflation expectations measure has generally remained in the 2.5-2.8 percent range of recent years. In addition, the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations measure of 3-year median inflation expectations has stabilized in 2016 in a range of 2.5-2.8 percent, after declining modestly over the course of 2014 and 2015.\n\nImplications for Monetary Policy\n\nIf the economy grows at a pace slightly above its sustainable long-term rate, as I expect, the labor market should gradually tighten further, and the resulting pressure on resources should help push inflation toward our 2 percent objective over the next year or two. Assuming the economy stays on this trajectory, I would favor making monetary policy somewhat less accommodative over time by gradually pushing up the level of short-term interest rates.\n\nFollowing this year’s election, we have seen relatively large movements in financial asset prices. In particular, the stock market has firmed, bond yields have risen and the dollar has appreciated. On balance, it appears that financial market conditions have tightened modestly. My personal interpretation of these developments is that market participants now anticipate that fiscal policy will turn more expansionary and that the FOMC will likely respond by tightening monetary policy a bit more quickly than previously anticipated. Assuming this expectation is realized, the recent modest tightening in financial market conditions seems broadly appropriate.\n\nLet me emphasize here that I do not view the recent shift in financial market conditions as one that should prompt great concern. It is important to distinguish between a tightening of financial conditions that is driven by an increase in risk aversion from one that is driven by a greater likelihood of stronger near-term aggregate demand and less downside risk to the growth outlook. We experienced the former at the beginning of 2016, while the latter reflects current expectations of greater fiscal policy stimulus.\n\nObviously, there is still considerable uncertainty about how fiscal policy will evolve over the next few years. At this juncture, it is premature to reach firm conclusions about what will likely occur. As we get greater clarity over the coming year, I will update my assessment of the economic outlook and, with that, my views about the appropriate stance of monetary policy.\n\nMonetary and Fiscal Policy in a Low-Rate Environment\n\nI also would like to highlight the limitations of monetary policy. One important factor contributing to such limits is that the real short-term interest rate consistent over the longer run with a neutral monetary policy stance appears to be very low, and is expected to remain so for some time. This has been helping to keep real inflation-adjusted interest rates lower than they have been historically. In part, this reflects anemic productivity growth as well as the slowing of labor force growth due to the aging of the population. An implication of this environment is that there will likely be less scope than there has been historically for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates when needed in the face of an economic downturn. All else equal, this means a greater risk for short-term interest rates to be pinned at their effective lower bound and for inflation expectations to become unanchored to the downside. Although forward guidance and large scale asset purchase programs have expanded the ways in which the Federal Reserve can provide additional accommodation, these unconventional monetary policy tools also have their own limits. These limits suggest that fiscal policy may need to play a greater role in stabilizing the economy than has been the case in past decades.\n\nWhat I have in mind here is putting in place stronger, more robust automatic fiscal stabilizers that would provide income support during economic downturns. By reducing fluctuations in disposable incomes, these types of fiscal actions would stabilize aggregate demand, thereby limiting the risk of monetary policy getting pinned at the zero lower bound for an extended period and the need for extraordinary monetary policy measures.\n\nI favor automatic, rather than discretionary, fiscal actions because they would typically go into effect more quickly and would be better anticipated. Expectations matter greatly in affecting economic behavior. For example, if the economy were to weaken, the anticipation that strong fiscal stabilizers would kick in to support incomes should lead workers to be less fearful about losing their jobs, and businesses to be less concerned that demand for their products might fall precipitously. This, in turn, would make workers more confident that they could sustain their spending, and would make businesses more confident that they could keep workers on their payrolls.\n\nWhat type of fiscal stabilizers would be most effective? I would turn first to those that Congress has implemented on a discretionary basis during past economic downturns, such as extensions of unemployment compensation and cuts in payroll taxes. For example, when the unemployment rate climbs, extensions of the duration of eligibility for unemployment compensation could be triggered automatically, helping to stabilize household income. Similarly, when the unemployment rate breaches certain thresholds, payroll tax cuts could be triggered, helping to support the disposable income of workers facing reductions in hours. Payroll tax cuts also have the advantage of skewing more toward low- and moderate-income workers, who typically have a higher propensity to consume out of current income.\n\nObviously, it is up to the incoming Administration and Congress to decide on the appropriate fiscal measures. But, the point that I want to highlight is that robust automatic fiscal stabilizers would complement monetary policy, and take some pressure off of the Federal Reserve to undertake extraordinary measures in situations where there is little scope for cutting short-term interest rates. This approach might also be superior to other proposals—such as raising the Federal Reserve’s inflation objective—that are designed to reduce the risk of monetary policy being trapped at the zero lower bound.\n\nFor such fiscal actions to be sustainable over time, it is important that the United States retain sufficient fiscal capacity. This would also ensure that automatic fiscal stabilizers are viewed as fully credible. On this score, while significant progress has been made in recent years in stabilizing the country’s fiscal situation, circumstances are likely to grow more challenging in the years ahead. There are three areas that I would highlight. First, the earnings that Federal Reserve returns to the U.S. Treasury Department each year are likely to fall in the future, as rising short-term interest rates narrow the gap between what the Federal Reserve pays on its liabilities—primarily currency and bank reserves—and what it earns on its portfolio of Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities. In recent years, the Federal Reserve’s remittances to the Treasury have averaged about $90 billion per year, far above the $20-30 billion average prior to the Great Recession. Although the precise trajectory of future reimbursements is highly uncertain, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that Federal Reserve payments to the Treasury will drop from around 0.6 percent of GDP in fiscal 2016 to 0.3 percent of GDP by 2026.\n\nSecond, the Treasury’s debt-service costs will likely grow as interest rates rise and the amount of outstanding debt held by the public continues to increase. While net outstanding Treasury debt held by the public has risen to $14.2 trillion from $4.8 trillion over the past decade, annual debt-service costs have only increased very modestly. Looking ahead, the CBO’s baseline projection is that debt-service costs will rise from 1.4 percent of GDP in fiscal 2016 to 2.6 percent of GDP in 2026.\n\nThird, the retirement of the baby boom generation will put significant upward pressure on Social Security and Medicare expenditures. Although the trend in Medicare expenditures has flattened out in recent years as healthcare inflation has moderated and utilization growth has slowed, the CBO nevertheless projects that such expenditures will rise from 3.2 percent of GDP in 2016 to about 4.0 percent of GDP in 2026. Consequently, significant pressures on the federal budget are still very much in train. It will be important that fiscal policy be managed so it retains the capacity to be used for macroeconomic stabilization.\n\nStructural Challenges\n\nWhile we have made steady progress over the past year toward our twin goals of maximum sustainable employment and price stability, significant challenges remain for the economy that lay largely beyond the scope of monetary policy. The three I would highlight are the sharp slowdown in labor productivity growth, the increase in income inequality and the low rate of income mobility.\n\nI draw attention to the slowdown in productivity growth for two reasons. First, productivity ultimately drives living standards and how people assess their economic well-being. Second, beyond ensuring a stable macroeconomic and financial environment, monetary policy can do little to improve productivity growth.\n\nAnnual productivity growth has averaged only 0.7 percent during the past five years, near the lowest 5-year pace since the early 1980s. There are a number of competing explanations for the slowdown. These include weak capital investment, a flattening out of educational attainment by new labor market entrants, less new business formation, understatement of quality improvements and, hence, output, and fewer ground-breaking innovations. I suspect that all of these factors play a role.\n\nWhat public policy can do to address this issue is to ensure that the economy operates closer to the frontier of what is achievable. For example, more efforts to improve job skills would prove beneficial—through retraining and apprentice programs, and better alignment of education and training with business needs. Also, encouraging small business start-ups would help—by removing barriers for entrepreneurs to establish new businesses, and by creating more start-up incubator programs. I also suspect that well-targeted infrastructure spending would be advantageous if it addresses logistical bottlenecks and enables people to commute to areas with good job opportunities. For example, in the New York City metropolitan region, mass transit is old, slow and crowded. As a New Jersey resident, I’m still waiting for that second set of rail tunnels into New York City that should have been built years ago.\n\nWhile higher productivity growth could support better living standards, the benefits for low- and middle-income households depend, in part, on how those gains are distributed between business and labor, and on how labor income is distributed across the workforce. Moreover, income distribution shouldn’t be viewed as a static concept. It is important that people are able to move upward in income through their careers, regardless of their starting point.\n\nOver the past several decades, three developments have been discouraging. First, the share of labor income relative to business income has fallen. Since 1970, the labor share of GDP in the United States has declined about 5 percentage points. Similar declines are evident in most developed and emerging market economies. Second, the distribution of labor income has become more skewed. Since 1970, the top 1 percent of households in the income distribution has more than doubled its share of the nation’s income. Third, despite the notion of the American dream, income mobility in the United States remains relatively low compared to many other countries. Also, the potential for income mobility is not evenly distributed. Research has shown that where you are born and raised in the United States still has significant implications for your future prospects.\n\nAs a country, we need to address these issues. With respect to the labor share of income, maintaining the U.S. economy at full employment should help. As the unemployment rate has fallen over the past two years, the labor share of income has moved up almost 1.5 percentage points. Supporting maximum sustainable employment is part of the Fed’s dual mandate, so we can play an important role here.\n\nWith respect to the rising concentration of income and the low level of income mobility, I think considerable improvements are also achievable. Income distribution can be influenced by tax policy and by educational opportunities. Income mobility can be influenced by local policies on education and housing. As Raj Chetty’s pathbreaking work makes clear, income mobility depends on where one is born and lives. This suggests quite strongly that improved access to good education, childcare and affordable housing would help.\n\nAs I noted in a recent speech, an important aspect of a city’s vitality is the ability of its residents to develop the skills necessary to be successful and achieve their dreams.2 A big asset for New York City is its access to affordable education. Each year, tens of thousands of low-to-moderate-income New Yorkers send their children to one of the city’s specialized high schools. When it comes time for college, many of these same students have access to the City University of New York (CUNY) and State University of New York (SUNY) systems. A recent highly regarded study assessed how much of an opportunity children born to less advantaged families in different parts of the United States have of moving up in the world. New York City ranked 10th out of the 50 largest U.S. metro areas.3 This is a better than average performance, but I think New York City should aspire to do even better.\n\nTo conclude, while the near-term outlook for the U.S. economy is reasonably good, there is considerable work to do over the longer term to improve our nation’s productive capacity and foster an environment in which the gains are spread more evenly. Monetary policy is limited in what it can do to address these broader structural issues. However, monetary policy will do its part to ensure the macroeconomic and financial stability that can help in achieving progress in these areas. Moreover, even with respect to macroeconomic stability, monetary policy could use an assist from fiscal policy. It is important that monetary policy and fiscal policy work together and not at cross purposes to be able to bolster the economy when it needs support.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions."

        "title": "Remarks on the Panel Financial Regulation Nine Years on from the GFC – Where Do We Stand? at the G30’s 76th Plenary Session",
        "content": "Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this panel discussion.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nIn assessing where we are eight years after the financial crisis, I would make three broad observations.  First, we have made considerable progress in bolstering the safety and soundness of the global financial system.  In the U.S., which was the epicenter of the crisis, the risk of a failure of a systemically important financial firm has declined considerably.  Second, although significant progress has been made toward ending “too big to fail,” there is still much more to do.  While the risk of failure of a global systemically important financial institution has diminished, it has not been eliminated.  Without a well-functioning resolution process, the consequences of such a failure could still be catastrophic.  Much headway has been made in the U.S. in developing a Single Point of Entry resolution regime with a layer of total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) that would facilitate recapitalization and enable an orderly resolution.  However, significant challenges remain, especially on managing resolution on a cross-border basis.  Third, bank leaders still have much to do to rebuild the trustworthiness of their industry.  Long after the financial crisis, conduct failures have persisted.  We need financial firms to foster cultures that are intolerant of bad conduct and that are attentive to incentive structures that may encourage such behaviors.\n\nSo, let me begin with the good news.  The U.S. financial system is much more resilient now than it was a decade ago on the eve of the financial crisis.  This progress reflects a number of initiatives―some focused on the ability of firms to absorb shocks, and others oriented at reducing structural vulnerabilities within the financial system that spanned the activities of firms and their counterparties. \n\nChanges made to capital and liquidity requirements in the U.S. and globally have made banks more resilient and robust.  The major U.S. banking organizations today have much more capital, much higher-quality capital, and much larger liquidity buffers than prior to the crisis.  On the capital side, we have taken a belt-and-suspenders approach.  The Basel III risk-weighted capital standards framework has been significantly strengthened―a stronger belt―and a supplemental leverage ratio requirement has also been imposed on large banks and bank holding companies to restrain overall leverage―the suspenders.  In addition, and perhaps most importantly, the capital requirements have now become much more forward-looking.  Each year a bank’s capital dividend and share-repurchase plan is assessed against the amount of capital the bank would potentially have under an extremely stressed economic and market environment given its portfolio of assets.  The annual Comprehensive Capital and Analysis Review (CCAR) process has pushed U.S. banks to improve their capital planning processes and forced them, when needed, to retain more earnings and to build up their capital.  As a result, these banks are much less risky now than they were prior to the financial crisis, when their vulnerability was masked by a high, but unsustainable, level of profitability.\n\nOn the liquidity side, there has also been significant improvement.  The Liquidity Coverage Ratio and the Net Stable Funding Ratio requirements have forced banks to hold more high-quality liquid assets and have reduced the scope for maturity transformation.  The ability and willingness of banks to finance illiquid, hard-to-value assets with short-term funding was an important element that contributed to the financial crisis.\n\nIn addition, I believe that supervisory oversight has improved.  There is more attention on horizontal evaluations across the systemically important firms and a greater emphasis on bank governance, risk management, cyber security, and bank data and technology capabilities than in the past.\n\nBut the progress has not just been in terms of enhancing the strength of individual institutions. The system as a whole is also stronger because of a number of important initiatives. Due to time constraints, I cannot be exhaustive today.  But, there are four important structural changes to the financial system that are worth highlighting.  First, the tri-party repo system—which matches institutional investors with bank dealers that need to fund their securities portfolios—has been made much safer.  Before the crisis, each morning the two large clearing banks provided huge amounts of intraday credit to their tri-party repo borrowers when cash invested overnight was returned to lenders.  These temporary extensions of credit have been largely eliminated.  This is an important structural reform because these exposures had proven to be destabilizing during the financial crisis.  In particular, when a major dealer became stressed, the clearing banks were motivated to reassess their large overdraft exposures to the dealer, and that turned out to be an important channel of contagion.\n\nAnother important change has been the shift in over-the-counter derivatives activity from bilateral settlement to central clearing.  Although this shift was already underway at the time of the financial crisis, it has now been underpinned by important changes to the capital and collateral regime, which has accelerated the process by strengthening the incentives to structure and clear trades centrally. \n\nWhen banks settle their trades with central counterparties (CCPs), it reduces risk in the system.  Exposures can be netted, and the counterparty risk is shifted from many individual firms to the single CCP that clears the trades.  Although this shift in clearing activity still has some way to go, the proportion of centrally cleared trades will continue to rise as legacy trades mature.\n\nA third important structural change is the increased focus on the strength and resiliency of CCPs.  Because CCPs are now going to play a more significant role, they must be strong and resilient.  There have been many important initiatives in this regard.  Foremost, perhaps, is the promulgation of the international standards embodied in the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI)—which were developed when I chaired the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS)—and the work currently underway on financial market infrastructure resolution.\n\nA fourth significant structural change has been reform of the U.S. money market mutual fund industry.  The October 14th implementation of floating net asset values (NAVs) for prime institutional money market mutual funds has dramatically reduced their use and has encouraged banks and other borrowers to find sources of funding that are less prone to runs.\n\nThe financial crisis exposed two important flaws of the money market mutual fund industry.  First, the fixed NAV structure created a first-mover advantage that encouraged runs.  That is, if a fund came under stress, investors who quickly withdrew their funds received par value.  Second, although money market mutual fund investments are often collateralized, the funds themselves have no desire to take possession of the collateral in a crisis.  Instead, they tend to head for the exits at the first sign of trouble, which makes the financial system less stable.\n\nMuch progress has been made in making the U.S. financial system safer and less prone to panics.  Still, there is more to do before we can say that we have ended “too big to fail.”  This is work that we absolutely must complete.  In particular, U.S. bank holding companies must do more to make their organizations resolvable under either Title I bankruptcy or Title II resolution.  This requires having clean parent holding company structures, less corporate complexity, and essential service and support operations that are able to continue to operate even when the parent company becomes non-viable. \n\nAlso, while there has been significant progress in terms of developing a workable resolution regime—the Single Point of Entry regime established under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act—we still have to ensure that this regime can be safely utilized on a cross-border basis.  This requires fully implementing the TLAC framework, and defining more explicitly the expectations and responsibilities of the different supervisory and regulatory oversight bodies that would have to work together internationally.  In particular, this includes how liquidity would be provided to an insolvent firm during the early stages of resolution, so that the firm’s operations could be wound down in an orderly way without destabilizing the global financial system.\n\nFinally, I would like to address the issue of bank culture and conduct.  Although there has been considerable effort here, there is still much more to do.  Banks must restore their trustworthiness.  Only then can they effectively perform their critical financial intermediation role in funneling funds from savers to borrowers, and in helping firms and households manage their finances and risk exposure.\n\nAs I see it, incentives drive behavior, and behavior establishes the social norms that define culture.  This means that bank leaders need to take a close look at the incentives they put in place with respect to compensation and promotion in particular.\n\nIn addition, bank leaders must foster an atmosphere that encourages people to speak up when they witness questionable behavior.  Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, highlighted the importance of getting people to speak up when he spoke at the New York Fed’s conference on bank culture in October.  He argued—and I agree—that big problems can be nipped in the bud when people speak up and senior management responds appropriately.  Therefore, bank leaders ought to recognize and reward those who speak up.  Actions speak louder than words in shaping culture.  Establishing appropriate incentives and fostering an environment in which people feel they can speak up would go a long way toward bolstering bank culture. \n\nI am gratified that many bank leaders and boards of directors are working hard to improve their firms’ cultures, and I very much appreciate the G30’s efforts in this area.  I think most leaders recognize that good culture is fully consistent with strong financial performance, and that it helps enable banks to attract the talent needed to sustain such performance.  Yet, we could make greater progress more quickly if this effort were coordinated across the industry.  I think bank leaders could benefit from sharing best practices and participating in surveys that would allow them to benchmark their strengths and weaknesses versus others on an ongoing basis.\n\nBuilding a financial system that is more resilient and robust, having a bank resolution regime that credibly ends “too big to fail,” and building strong cultures that restore the trustworthiness of the financial industry are all goals we must continue to pursue.  Without success on all three fronts, I don’t think we can say that we have fully addressed the problems made evident by the financial crisis.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.\n\n1 Beverly Hirtle, Antoine Martin, Susan McLaughlin and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks."

        "content": "I am very pleased to be here and to have this opportunity to speak with representatives of Puerto Rico’s business and academic communities.  In my remarks, I will discuss the lessons learned from municipalities in the United States that have faced crises over the years―such as New York City―and what those outcomes might imply for Puerto Rico as it seeks to restore and sustain economic growth.  I will also touch briefly on the Puerto Rico Small Business Survey, a new survey from the New York Fed that focuses on the business performance, financing needs and borrowing experiences of firms across the Island.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nMy meeting with you today is part of the New York Fed’s continuing efforts to understand what is going on at the grassroots level within our Federal Reserve district.  We plan these trips so we can interact with a diverse group of stakeholders.  These meetings help me get a more complete picture of economic conditions on the Island and a fuller understanding of the major issues and concerns.  This is the third time we have visited Puerto Rico in the past five years.\n\nYesterday, I met with Governor-elect Rosselló to discuss the transition into his new role and the key challenges for his upcoming term.  I also spent time with members of El Colaboratorio, a shared workspace organized by the Foundation for Puerto Rico.  I attended a roundtable discussion with local businesses and spoke with former and current members of several of the New York Fed’s advisory councils.\n\nEarlier this morning, I met with the heads of a number of financial institutions and the University of Puerto Rico’s interim president, Celeste Freytes.  Following this visit, I will meet with the leadership from Parallel18, an economic development initiative that attracts early-stage, high-potential startups to Puerto Rico.  Finally, I will join the leadership of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Puerto Rico for a discussion on the organization’s initiatives and a site visit to one of the clubs to learn about workforce development programs and youth services.\n\nAs we all know, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has been through a very rough 10 years.  The economy has been in a long slump that could easily be called a depression.  Residents have endured a terrible drought, periodic blackouts and a fiscal crisis.  I don’t need to elaborate on all of the struggles Puerto Rico continues to face.  The Island has been suffering from a vicious cycle.  As employment declines, people move to the mainland to find jobs.  Accordingly, economic activity and tax revenues decline, forcing the government to raise taxes and cut spending, which further reduces employment and prompts still more residents to move.  At this point, the outlook for anyone who has been living here must be bleak, and it may be hard to imagine this situation turning around anytime soon.  And yet, history tells us that a turnaround, though not inevitable, is indeed achievable. \n\nLessons from Past Crises\n\nNew York City is probably the most famous example of a municipality that experienced a major fiscal crisis, recovered and is now thriving.  New York City’s experience is viewed, in retrospect, as a major success, and some, including myself, have pointed to it as a hopeful example of what could come to pass in Puerto Rico.  But, there are important caveats to the New York City story and its applicability to the Commonwealth.\n\nLike Puerto Rico, New York City experienced a number of years of both political and economic pain as a result of its fiscal crisis in the 1970s.  On the political side, New York City residents lost a large measure of their ability to chart their own fiscal direction for several years.  Decisions about tax and spending policies were removed from elected city officials.  The Emergency Financial Control Board was empowered to review all fiscal decisions of local officials and demand changes to the city’s budgets.  Part of the city’s tax base was dedicated to bond repayment—essentially handing it over to the city’s creditors.  For 10 years, the city could not access the debt markets without support from the state.\n\nThe economic pain was also very real.  More than 70,000 city government workers were cut from the payrolls in 1975 and 1976.  City residents faced dramatic service reductions—fire houses closed, schools and police precincts had fewer resources, and crime continued to rise for many years.\n\nIt is also important to note that New York isn’t the only U.S. city that has been through a major fiscal crisis.  Cleveland, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C. and, most recently, Detroit have all struggled to manage their budgets, and all ultimately reached a point when they were unable to pay their bills.  As a result, these cities lost their fiscal autonomy to one degree or another.  In the case of New York City, this turned out relatively well, as the short-run loss of decision-making power led to a strong economic rebound that eventually restored the city’s ability to finance its own choices.\n\nSo, is New York City’s experience really all that instructive for Puerto Rico?  With the advantage of hindsight, it now seems almost obvious that New York City’s fiscal crisis was only going to be a detour.  The city’s economy had many fundamental strengths, so it only needed some assistance to get back on track.  Still, it’s worth pointing out that this was by no means clear at the outset the crisis in the mid-1970s.  Then, many commentators looked at New York City and other large cities as outmoded forms of economic activity, unlikely ever to recover.\n\nWhile we do not have great measures of economic activity for cities, population change is a good indicator of how attractive a place seems to be.  By that measure, New York City at the time was seen to have very poor prospects—the city’s population fell by over 10 percent during the 1970s.  So, New York City’s eventual bright future was far from clear as its fiscal crisis was unfolding.\n\nOf course, not every city that has faced a fiscal crisis has the same track record.  Relative to cities that had similarly grim outlooks, New York City’s rebound has been much stronger.  In Detroit, there are hopeful signs, but it’s too soon to tell how things will turn out.  Both Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia experienced multiple decades of population declines leading up to their crises. These population declines reversed in the 2000s.  Washington, D.C.’s population actually grew over 5 percent between 2000 and 2010, a rate even faster than that of New York City.  Cleveland’s fiscal reforms, on the other hand, were less comprehensive, and the city has never really turned itself around.  Its population in 2010 was less than half the level of 1960.\n\nThe different performances across cities reflect the complex interplay of native endowments, economic conditions and fiscal outcomes.  As in Puerto Rico, the fiscal woes of many of our largest cities have been closely related to long-term economic transformations—essentially, changes in the industrial specialization that occurred in those particular places.  In the case of New York City, the transformation was from manufacturing to services, and it took a generation to complete.  The city’s management of that transition was far from perfect, and the fiscal crisis was the major manifestation of that failure.  The institutions set up to respond to the crisis were crucial to ensuring that fiscal policy didn’t continue to amplify the problems associated with the economic transition.  For a city to turn its circumstances around, it must navigate this economic transformation, identify what will define its comparative advantages going forward, and then build anew around those sources of strength.\n\nThe Road to Recovery\n\nA successful fiscal reform first requires a regime in which local officials recognize and accept the reality of the changing economic situation, and set spending budgets accordingly.  This part is fairly straightforward, because it produces the simple policy dictum that borrowing—in all its forms—must be strictly limited.  Of course, knowing what to do and actually getting it done are different things, especially when politics are involved.  As a result, the record suggests that it can be extremely helpful to have some kind of independent fiscal monitor in place on an ongoing basis.  It’s important that this monitor be insulated from the direct influence of politics, giving it freedom to deliver objective analysis that may at times be very unpopular.  In Washington, D.C., this took the form of the Office of the Chief Financial Officer; in New York City it is the Independent Budget Office, which is modeled after the Congressional Budget Office.  These monitors have proven invaluable in keeping policymakers and the public informed on budgetary matters, and in providing apolitical expertise to assist in keeping budgets on a sustainable course. \n\nThe second major component is a successful completion of the economic transformation, which is a critical factor for reversing―rather than simply halting―a city’s decline, establishing a virtuous cycle of rising growth and strengthening fiscal outcomes.  New York City had the huge benefit of its comparative advantage in finance—an industry that was poised for sustained growth in the post-fiscal-crisis period of the 1980s through the 2000s.  Still, the city weathered a lot of shocks during that period, including the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the financial crisis and Hurricane Sandy.  It’s also worth pointing out that New York City is still prospering, even though employment in its finance sector has stagnated.  This illustrates the need for cities to continually look for new areas of growth, such as health care, technology, and leisure and hospitality services.\n\nThis is why PROMESA (the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act) emphasizes long-term growth, and why the New York Fed has been focused on identifying impediments to the Commonwealth’s growth.  Since 2012, we have released two major reports and several shorter analyses—most of which appeared in our Liberty Street Economics blog—presenting ideas that, if implemented, might help to make the Island more competitive and reverse its economic decline.  These ideas have ranged from the very narrow and technical to the very broad—from improving the quality of Commonwealth financial reporting to bolstering growth through education and job training to build the Island’s human capital.\n\nSince I’ve identified managing the ongoing economic transformation as a major component of a successful plan for Puerto Rico, let me summarize a few themes on that front.  Most of these feature an important role for the Commonwealth’s government, underscoring the fundamental importance of getting public policy right as a means of restoring economic growth.\n\nFirst, it is important to reduce the cost of doing business on the Island as a way of encouraging business growth and increasing the demand for labor.  We have put forward many ideas to consider here, ranging from ones targeted at hiring—such as giving Puerto Rico more autonomy over setting its minimum wage policy—to more general ideas like streamlining regulation.  One thing that we’ve repeatedly emphasized is the need to find efficiencies in the Island’s energy industry.  Commercial customers on the Island pay roughly 20 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity—nearly double the mainland average.  Island residents and businesses, as you are well aware, are also burdened with exceptionally high water utility bills.  It is also important to think hard about the supply of labor—the willingness of people to work, and the education and skills that they have to bring to the market.  Labor supply is equally important, but less widely discussed than the demand side of the market.  Labor force participation is lower at all ages in Puerto Rico than on the mainland.  This is a crucial impediment to growth, and addressing it requires innovative policy options.  One idea to address this problem would be to extend the Earned Income Tax Credit to Puerto Rico.  In addition, the structure of the Commonwealth’s tax system creates disincentives to work in the formal sector, and suggests that tax reform could produce a growth dividend as well as a more reliable source of revenue.  On top of the low labor force participation is the well known and deeply concerning high level of out-migration.  In addition to the lack of labor demand, it seems likely that quality-of-life concerns such as high crime rates are playing a role in these decisions.  This underscores the importance of basic public service delivery and is another example of the interplay between fiscal and economic outcomes.\n\nAnother important dimension of labor supply involves the skills that workers bring to the market.  Many of these skills are acquired while in school.  Our research indicates that test scores for school-age children on the Island are low, suggesting that there is an opportunity for improvement in the quality of public education.  One clear lesson from recent research in urban and regional economics is that the collective skills of the people living in an area are a critical ingredient for its growth prospects.  Improving the education available to residents can pay large dividends over time.\n\nI know that this list seems long, and none of issues I have raised are easy to address.  Nonetheless, I am confident that Puerto Rico has started on the road to recovery.  In the current environment, it’s hard to see beyond the immediate crisis to a brighter future for Puerto Rico, but that has been said of other places that have come back stronger than ever.  Getting the fiscal situation in order is an important first step.  The factors leading up to the crisis took many years to develop, and history shows that a successful recovery from a crisis also takes time.  It is important to recognize that fact and to stay the course.\n\nBefore I conclude, let me briefly discuss our new survey.  Earlier this month, the New York Fed released the Puerto Rico Small Business Survey, which focuses on the business performance, financing needs and borrowing experiences of firms across the Island.  The survey is intended to fill important knowledge gaps and flag potential economic growth opportunities for the Commonwealth.  It was designed with input from partners here in Puerto Rico, and we are very grateful for their cooperation.\n\nKey findings reveal that firms are persevering through Puerto Rico's economic crisis, though a majority reported declining revenues.  Managing cash flow is a top concern, ranking above concerns about rising business costs.  There is significant demand for credit, with the most common reason being the need to meet operating expenses.  For about half of all small firms, credit needs were under $25,000.  Lastly, about 80 percent of firms do not sell online or export their wares or services.  Firms see this as a growth opportunity, ranking programs in support of increasing sales—to the federal government, via online commerce and through exports—as their top training need.  We hope that the survey will provide useful insights into a key economic sector and help inform policy to support Puerto Rico’s recovery.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n1 Jason Bram, Tony Davis, Andrew Haughwout and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks."

        "title": "Opening Remarks at the Economic Press Briefing on the Survey of Consumer Expectations",
        "content": "Good morning, and welcome to the New York Fed’s Economic Press Briefing.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak with you today about our Survey of Consumer Expectations.  This is an important source of information that we use in our analysis of current and future economic conditions to help inform our monetary policy decisions.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nIn pursuing its monetary policy objectives, the Federal Reserve relies on a large number of data sources that provide information about recent developments and the current state of the economy.  Most of these data sources are backward looking.  That is, they provide data about past decisions and outcomes.  In contrast, we know relatively little about the forward-looking subjective expectations and intentions of economic agents, which are a key determinant of current and future outcomes.  This information, though, is essential for formulating policy and evaluating its effectiveness.  The macroeconomic outcomes we observe reflect preferences and constraints, as well as beliefs of individual consumers and firms.  Therefore, a fuller understanding of such outcomes requires reliable data on the beliefs and intentions held by economic agents and how they evolve over time.  In particular, consumer expectations influence a variety of considerations, including spending and saving behavior, wage dynamics, job search, housing demand and the demand for credit.  Given their importance in determining U.S. economic activity, consumer expectations are of particular value in assessing the economic outlook and the related risks.\n\nOver the last decade, we have devoted significant resources to improving the measurement of the economic expectations of households.  This work culminated in the creation of the Survey of Consumer Expectations, or SCE, in 2013.  The expectations data collected in our survey give us direct insight into households’ decision-making and consumers’ financial and economic outlooks.  While we monitor expectations on a number of topics, of particular importance are households’ medium-term inflation expectations.  Having reliable measures of inflation expectations is crucial to assess the effectiveness of monetary policy and central bank communications.  Such an assessment focuses on analyzing the extent to which longer-run inflation expectations remain well-anchored, and on learning more about how agents update and revise their expectations in response to new information. The SCE allows us to carry out this sort of analysis.\n\nBesides their obvious policy relevance, the SCE data are also highly valuable for research.  Our economists have shown that the SCE’s expectations data are informative and predictive of respondents’ current and future behavior.  They have also documented the substantial heterogeneity in the formation and updating of expectations across demographic groups.  To facilitate further research, we make the survey data available in the Center for Microeconomic Data section of our website.  Each month we also illustrate the trends in our expectations series through easy-to-use, interactive charts.  Further, a number of our Liberty Street Economics blog posts describe the data and the analysis we have conducted.  We do this because we want researchers, policymakers, commentators and the general public to understand the data and to follow our updates.\n\nLet me now describe our Survey of Consumer Expectations in more detail.\n\nThe Survey of Consumer Expectations\n\nFollowing extensive design and testing, we launched the Survey of Consumer Expectations in June 2013.  The survey has a number of innovative and unique features, three of which I would like to highlight today.  First and foremost, as I mentioned earlier, it collects households’ subjective expectations and intentions on a wide range of economic outcomes and behaviors.  In addition to short- and medium-term inflation expectations, it collects data on households’ expectations regarding the housing, labor and credit markets, as well as households’ financial situations and a host of other macroeconomic variables of interest.  For example, the survey elicits beliefs about future wage growth, house price appreciation, job search and labor market transitions, households’ spending and income growth, and credit applications.  By collecting data on a broad range of expectations, it is possible to analyze how they interact with each other and jointly influence households’ decisions.  We also study how expectations vary with demographics and other household characteristics.\n\nThe broad scope of the SCE allows us to study many questions relevant to economic policy—such as understanding housing market decisions, disentangling credit demand from supply, analyzing job search behavior and measuring wage growth as people transition between jobs.  In addition, the survey has been used to help answer other policy-relevant questions as they have come up in our discussions.  Two examples are households’ spending response to the decrease in gas prices in early 2014, and households’ early experiences and perceptions of the Affordable Care Act following its enactment.  Some of this analysis relies on the ability of our survey to shed light on whether consumers expect a specific change in economic conditions to be temporary or permanent.\n\nA second important feature of the survey is that—in addition to simple point forecasts—for some variables, such as inflation, we get respondents’ entire forecast distributions by asking them to assign probabilities to various ranges of future outcomes.  These so-called density forecasts in turn allow us to measure households’ uncertainty about future events by looking at the spread in their subjective distributions.  Density forecasts also allow us to monitor the perceived likelihood that respondents assign to specific events, such as deflation or a large increase in earnings.\n\nA third important characteristic of the SCE is that it is a rotating panel.  Each month about 1,300 household heads participate in our survey.  This is a nationally representative sample. Respondents remain on the panel for up to 12 months, with a constant fraction entering and rotating out each month.  This allows us to monitor the expectations of the same respondents over time, which provides important benefits.  First, it gives us greater confidence that month-to-month changes in our headline numbers reflect true changes in beliefs, and not just changes in the sample composition.  Second, observing repeated responses by the same individuals allows us to examine how expectations are formed and revised over time.  Third, by following the same people over time, we are able to study how expectations are related to contemporaneous and future economic decisions and outcomes for these respondents.\n\nToday the SCE team will provide further background about the survey, discuss newly released findings for October and recent trends in some of its main indicators.  The team will then present findings from two special components of the SCE: one that covers households’ credit experiences and expectations, and one that deals with labor market behavior and expectations.  Before I pass this on to my colleagues, I would like to comment briefly on these two special surveys.\n\nNew findings on Credit Access\n\nThe SCE Credit Access Survey supplements the information collected in the Federal Reserve Board’s Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, also known as SLOOS.  The SLOOS is a primary source of information on credit standards and credit demand as perceived and reported by banks.  In contrast, the SCE Credit Access Survey, which has been conducted at a four-month frequency since October 2013, measures experiences in credit markets as perceived by households.  The combination of the two data sources provides a more complete picture of household credit access and demand.  Today, we are releasing the October 2016 findings as well as introducing new data from the survey.\n\nA unique feature of the SCE is its measure of latent credit demand—that is, demand that does not lead to an application for credit.  We measure this latent credit demand as the proportion of households who report that, while needing credit, they did not apply because they expected their application to be rejected.  In addition to current credit experiences, we also elicit households’ expectations of their future credit applications and the likelihood of these applications being approved.  As we will show later, the survey provides useful insights into the extent and variation in met and unmet credit needs across households.  Moreover, our analysis indicates that reported expectations are indeed predictive of credit outcomes reported four months later.\n\nNew Findings on Job Search\n\nWhile the SCE Credit Access Survey allows us to track credit market experiences and expectations, the SCE Labor Market Survey gathers information on the job search behavior and expectations of employed and unemployed respondents.  Aggregate labor market statistics on earnings, employment and labor market transitions are readily available, yet relatively little is known about the expectations and search behaviors of labor market participants and how these change over time.  Our SCE Labor Market Survey collects rich information on respondents’ actual and expected wage offers, as well as their reservation wage, which is the lowest wage or salary they say they would accept for a new job.  We also elicit expectations about future labor market transitions, such as the likelihood of staying with the same employer, switching employers, finding a job or being laid off.\n\nOver time, changes in responses to these questions can shed light on how workers’ expectations evolve, and how these changes relate to observed trends in aggregate earnings and employment dynamics. Our preliminary analyses of the data suggest that these expectations measures are predictive of respondents’ subsequent labor market outcomes. In coming years, as we generate a longer time series for the survey, we will be able to explore whether the expectations we collect can be used to construct leading indicators of the job market.\n\nNow, I'd like to turn things over to our economists, beginning with Olivier Armantier, who will provide further background and specifics about our survey.\n\n1 Olivier Armantier, Giorgio Topa, Joseph Tracy, Wilbert van der Klaauw and Basit Zafar assisted in preparing these remarks."

        "content": "Good morning.  I would like to welcome you to this conference on the Evolution of Work.  Today, we will explore how the nature of work is evolving, including the role of technology, shifts in employee work arrangements and employer-employee relationships, and the effects of these changes on workforce development strategies.  We are pleased to host this conference with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Freelancers Union.  We welcome all the leaders from across academia, government, industry, labor and the nonprofit sector assembled here to explore the transformation of the workforce, and the impact this has had on communities and the economy more broadly.  As always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nAs you know, the Federal Reserve monitors the labor market closely, given that maximum sustainable employment is one goal of the Fed’s dual mandate.  The evolving nature of the workplace—and the speed with which it is changing—are therefore important developments that we must continue to monitor.  Traditional nine-to-five jobs are becoming less common, and people are increasingly employed in less traditional work arrangements.  Measuring the creation and destruction of these new jobs is of utmost importance to gain a better assessment of the health of the labor market.  We also need to understand how this evolution is affecting job security and earnings stability.  While these jobs might provide workers with more flexibility, they might also come with increased income volatility and financial vulnerability.  In today’s gathering, we will discuss the measurement challenges we face to better understand this growing segment of the labor market, and we will facilitate a dialogue aimed at developing a workforce aligned with the evolving nature of work. \n\nThe Fed’s efforts to understand labor markets include analyzing the comprehensive data that exist now.  But, in an ever-changing workplace, it is critical that we hear from external stakeholders to understand their views on these changes and to ensure we incorporate them in our assessments.  This is an important part of our discussion.  As technological changes persist, it is inevitable that the nature of our jobs will continue to evolve.  We may not readily recall the days when there was little job flexibility and we did not have today’s technology to assist us in our work.  While technological transformation allows for further growth in productivity and innovation, we must also think through how these changes affect the workforce overall.  We must realign our workforce development strategies with these changes.\n\nToday, we will also focus on what this evolution means for low- and moderate-income households.  One session will explore on-the-ground community development and labor models, with a focus on the implications for low- and moderate-income earners.  This will be an important discussion on how to help workers build the skills necessary to adapt to change—a conversation that should ultimately include workers, their employers, their communities and the public sector, working together.  We all need to share in the responsibility of helping people increase and maintain the skills relevant to contributing valued work.  Again, I wish you a fruitful dialogue, and I commend you for coming together to discuss such important issues and the trends affecting the U.S. workforce.\n\n1Nora Fitzpatrick, Laura Pilossoph, Anika Pratt and Aysegul Sahin assisted in preparing these remarks."

        "title": "Remarks at The Evolving Structure of the U.S. Treasury Market: Second Annual Conference",
        "content": "On behalf of the New York Fed and our co-sponsors, it is my pleasure to welcome you to this second annual conference on the evolving structure of the U.S. Treasury market.  We have the opportunity today to continue the dialogue around the changing nature of the Treasury market, a discussion that grew more urgent following the events of October 15, 2014.1 We have made significant progress since last year’s conference in improving our collective understanding of the Treasury market, and I believe it is important to continue official and private sector collaboration on this topic. Indeed, there is much left to do to ensure the continued integrity and effectiveness of this market, and I look forward to the further progress we will make today.  As always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.2\n\nOver the past year, the Joint Member Agencies3 have engaged with market participants and other members of the public to gain more information on the changing structure of the Treasury market. The Treasury’s Request for Information, and comments on various SEC and CFTC proposals, have provided thoughtful perspectives on the evolution of Treasury market structure. We have also benefited from consultation with groups such as the Treasury Markets Practices Group (TMPG), which is made up of market professionals committed to supporting the integrity and efficiency of the Treasury market.\n\nContinued engagement between the official sector and the public on the Treasury market remains necessary to help to manage its evolution, and to best maintain its efficient function and integrity.  Those of you who transact in this market have a crucial perspective on how the Treasury market works and what information is useful for evaluating its function.  Engagement between the official and private sectors can also facilitate the development of timely solutions to important issues in the industry.  Such efforts include the best practices the TMPG has produced for the Treasury, agency debt and agency MBS markets,4 and the Group of 30’s recommendations on banking culture and conduct5―an issue I believe the financial industry must continue to work on.6 In fact, it is this type of collaboration―between a wide array of market participants and official agencies―that helps different perspectives come together to create effective practices.7\n\nIn addition to engagement with the public, the Joint Member Agencies have continued their inter-agency collaboration.  We have been working together to share information and help shape the most effective path forward for public policy.  These actions include the signing of a memorandum of understanding that further facilitates information sharing related to the Treasury market, and again co-hosting this conference. Going forward, the staff of the Joint Member Agencies will continue to work together on effective and comprehensive data collection, monitoring of market activity and liquidity through the Interagency Working Group, development of principles and best practices for Treasury market data transparency, and the regulatory framework for government securities.\n\nA main focus of recent work by the Joint Member Agencies has been to improve the availability of information to both the official sector and the public. Given this emphasis, it is worth spending a few moments discussing the benefits of obtaining timely and robust data on Treasury market transactions. \n\nData are essential to understanding flash events and market liquidity. Attendees at this conference are very familiar with the events of October 15, 2014, when the 10-year Treasury yield experienced a 37-basis-point trading range over the session.  At that time, market participants struggled to identify what had caused that sharp movement.  Similarly, a flash event occurred in the British pound just this month. The pound depreciated nearly 6 percent, and then largely retraced this move within several minutes, seemingly without a major catalyst. Once the domain of equity markets, flash events have happened with increasing frequency, also occurring in the dollar-yen and euro-dollar currency pairs in recent years. \n\nTreasury and foreign exchange markets share a number of common attributes. They are evolving rapidly, they are highly automated in key market segments, and information on trading activity is not widely available.  As a result, it is challenging for the official sector, market participants, and members of the public to effectively analyze these markets, understand the sources and risks of flash events, and evaluate how liquidity is changing.\n\nGiven the role of the Treasury market as the deepest and most liquid fixed income market in the world, it is clear that both the official sector and the public need improved access to transaction-level data, and I am pleased that we are making real progress on this front. Greater transparency into Treasury market activity is necessary in maintaining the market’s many important roles:  as a risk-free benchmark for financial instruments; as a liquid investment and source of safe collateral; as a channel for the implementation of monetary policy; and, of course, as a tool to help finance U.S. government activities.\n\nAs the Treasury market continues to evolve, several complex questions lie ahead. How should data reporting gaps be closed to ensure that as many relevant Treasury transactions as possible are collected?  What is the proper scope and best process for sharing Treasury market data with the public? How can the Joint Member Agencies and private stakeholders best collaborate to ensure Treasury market stability and efficient market function, even as market structure evolves and new technologies emerge?  What considerations need to be made regarding Treasury market clearance practices given the growth in activity by participants who are not central counterparty members?  Will the evolving settlement marketplace introduce new challenges to Treasury market participants?  How must practices and culture evolve as market structure does?  And, how will the interplay of all of these issues affect the future of the Treasury market?\n\nToday’s conference provides an excellent opportunity to discuss these issues. Thank you for coming. I look forward to today’s dialogue and the ongoing engagement between the Joint Member Agencies and the public as we all strive to ensure the continued sound functioning of this essential marketplace.\n\n1 Joint Staff Report: The U.S. Treasury Market on October 15, 2014, U.S. Department of the Treasury, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, July 13, 2015.\n\n2 Ellen Correia Golay, Frank Keane and Nathaniel Wuerffel assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\n3 The Joint Member Agencies are the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\n4 Best Practices for Treasury, Agency Debt, and Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities Markets, Treasury Markets Practices Group, Revised February 2016.\n\n5 Banking Conduct and Culture, Group of 30, July 2015.\n\n6 Opening Remarks at Reforming Culture and Behavior in the Financial Services Industry: Expanding the Dialogue, William C.

        "title": "Opening Remarks at Reforming Culture and Behavior in the Financial Services Industry: Expanding the Dialogue",
        "content": "Welcome to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and to our third conference focused on culture within the financial services industry.  It is encouraging to see all of you in attendance today—in particular, the many non-executive directors, representatives from the investor community, and foreign supervisors who have joined us to help broaden and deepen the dialogue.  Thank you for your participation.  As always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nThe evidence is pervasive that deep-seated cultural and ethical problems have plagued the financial services industry in recent years.  Bad conduct has occurred in both investment banking and securities market activities as well as in retail banking.2  This has eroded the industry's trustworthiness.\n\nThis erosion impedes the ability of the financial services industry to do its job.  That job is financial intermediation—to facilitate the efficient transfer of resources from savers to borrowers, and to help customers manage the financial risks they face.  Verification—whether through regulation or internal controls—is an expensive substitute for trustworthiness.  Fines for bad behavior drain resources that could be better used to expand access and improve services, but billions of dollars in avoidable penalties are just the start.  The time spent handling a legal crisis is time not spent on more productive pursuits.  Moreover, I worry that, in the long term, an industry that develops a reputation for dubious ethics will not attract the best talent.3 \n\nIn contrast, a trustworthy financial services sector will be more productive and better able to support the economy.  Reliable financial intermediaries can help increase the flow of credit, promote economic growth and make the financial system more stable.  This is why restoring trustworthiness must be the ultimate goal of reforming culture. \n\nThe industry's shared norms—its culture—will not change by mere exhortation to the good, whether from me or from the industry's CEOs.  In my experience, people respond far more to incentives and clear accountability than to statements of virtues and values.  The latter are worthy and necessary, but remain aspirational or even illusory unless they are tied to real consequences.4  What does it mean for a firm to profess to putting the customer first, if employees are compensated and promoted regardless of what's good for customers?  Or, worse, if they are not held to account for activities that can harm customers?  If we focus on nothing else in today's conference, let's explore how best to structure incentives and reinforce accountability to align with core purposes and first principles.\n\nTo put it very simply, incentives drive behavior, and behavior establishes the social norms that drive culture.  If the incentives are wrong and accountability is weak, we will get bad behavior and cultures.  This implies a role for both firms and supervisors.  Firms need to continually assess their incentive regimes so that they are consistent with good conduct and culture.  When they are not consistent, the incentives need to be changed.\n\nSupervisors should also play a role in assessing firms' incentive structures.  For example, they should evaluate:\n\nThe answers to these questions should indicate whether incentives must be changed in order to foster the appropriate behaviors and culture.\n\nThe primary responsibility for reforming culture—and changing incentives—belongs to the industry.  However, the industry does not act alone.  The public sector can play an important role as well.  I'll discuss that issue this morning with my colleagues Norman Chan, chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and Minouche Shafik, deputy governor of the Bank of England.  Later this morning another panel will discuss the ways in which supervision can further contribute to improving bank culture.\n\nLet's also consider ways in which new laws or regulations might help—especially to overcome perennial collective action and first-mover problems that are common across the industry.  Two years ago I proposed solutions to two such obstacles to reforming culture.  First, there should be a database of banker misconduct to combat the problem of \"rolling bad apples.\"5  Second, a baseline assessment of culture is needed in order to measure progress.  I proposed an industry-wide survey, but there may be other good alternatives.  Once again, I invite the industry to take the initiative on these issues, and to look to the public sector for support.\n\nI also hope that we will attend to issues that we may have overlooked in our earlier discussions.  Gillian Tett of the Financial Times argues in her new book, The Silo Effect, that the key to understanding any culture is identifying and explaining \"social silences\"—the issues that are not being discussed.6\n\nWhere do we encounter those issues in reforming the culture of financial services?  One place might be the role of investors in firms.  Are their expectations of returns reasonable and consistent with a trustworthy financial services industry?  Another place might be the boardroom.  Boards should establish and promote a culture based on ethics and respect for law.  Have boards risen to this challenge?  If not, what's needed?  And, going forward, are we thinking hard about how technological change will influence incentives, behavior and culture?  We'll hear these issues discussed in several panels today. \n\nThese issues require thoughtful reflection by the industry.  The need for reflection, though, is not limited to boards, or even to banks.  Regulators and bankers alike can benefit from such a habit.  In that vein, I want to share with you an everyday checklist proposed by Ignazio Angeloni of the European Central Bank.7  He has posed six questions that seek to make responsibility for culture both individual and routine:\n\nI suspect that while seemingly simple, the discipline of asking ourselves these questions on a regular basis and answering them thoughtfully and honestly may be more challenging, thought provoking and effective than one might initially think.\n\nI thank the staff at the New York Fed who put together today's program, and their colleagues who are in the audience and watching today.  The diverse professional training and experience of our staff are among the New York Fed's strengths.  Bank supervisors, risk managers, economists, traders and lawyers contribute insights from their respective professions that lead to better outcomes. \n\nIn the spirit of learning from other disciplines, I am delighted to introduce today's keynote speaker.  Some of you may recall that, two years ago, Sir David Walker opened our first culture conference with the words, \"I am grateful to the philosopher Onora O'Neill for reference to very relevant advice.\"8  Today we have gone to the source. \n\nBaroness O'Neill is professor emeritus of philosophy at the University of Cambridge, former president of the British Academy, and former chair of the United Kingdom's Equality and Human Rights Commission.  She was appointed a life peer and member of the House of Lords in 1999, and, in 2007, was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society.\n\nToday, Baroness O'Neill serves as a member of the Banking Standards Board.  Her 2002 lectures on trustworthiness—reprinted in the book A Question of Trust—have been tremendously influential among New York Fed staff working on culture.  Baroness O'Neill, the floor is yours.\n\n1 Stephanie Chaly, James Hennessy, Jacqueline McCormack, Thomas Noone and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\n2 William C.

        "title": "New York City’s Return from the Brink",
        "content": "It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to speak here this evening at the Lotos Club, one of America’s oldest and most distinguished literary clubs. I am, of course, very happy to participate in tonight’s public affairs dinner and to accept the Lotos Award of Distinction.\n\nTonight I would like to take a moment to discuss some of New York City’s recent history and its return from the economic brink.  Aside from being a story of historical interest, I believe there are lessons embedded in New York City’s experience that are relevant to other cities and municipalities that find themselves struggling today. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily the views of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nGiven the historical relevance of today’s date, it seems appropriate to start by recalling what happened on this day 29 years ago.  In what has come to be known as “Black Monday,” the U.S. equity market suffered one of its steepest one-day drops in history, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 508 points—a decline of more than 20 percent.  This capped one of the worst weeks ever for the U.S. stock market.  Many feared the worst for the U.S. economy—and especially for New York City.  After all, the stock market crash in 1929 was followed by the Great Depression.\n\nAs a young economist working on Wall Street, I certainly was worried—the situation didn’t seem consistent with future job stability.  I went out that evening and bought myself a leather jacket.  If I lost my job, I wanted to leave with something on my back, something tangible.  As it turned out, although the city’s economy and Wall Street did indeed sustain a steep downturn, both were able to recover and to prosper.  Not only was there no depression, the economy avoided falling into recession.  And, importantly to me, I was able to keep both my job and my leather jacket. \n\nIn retrospect, the 1987 crash was just a hiccup in what ultimately turned out to be a remarkable upturn in the city’s performance and prospects.  However, to really understand this story of the city’s resilience, we need to take a look back at one of the darkest periods in New York City’s history: the 1970s. \n\nI remember New York City in the 1970s from my freshman days at Columbia University.  Columbia was a great place to be a young student.  There were engaging professors and I had the opportunity to read the great books of the university’s core contemporary civilization curriculum.  Recognizing the strong literary traditions of the Lotos Club, I would also note that I had the fortune of reading some of the great works of Middle English, including Chaucer.  I also enjoyed being on both the freshman wrestling and golf teams—even if it was an odd pairing and our teams were not very good.  \n\nIn contrast to Columbia, the city seemed much less attractive.  From my perspective as a naïve 17-year-old from suburban Massachusetts, it seemed outright dangerous and dirty.  The danger was driven home immediately.  One of my roommates was robbed his first day during a walk through one of the nearby parks.  He didn’t understand, nor did I at the time, that certain places near Columbia weren’t very safe, even during daylight hours.\n\nWhile you could avoid the crime by being careful where you went in the city, there was no avoiding the pollution.  During this period, New York City still had considerable manufacturing activity, many apartment buildings burned low-grade oil and incinerated trash, and this was before the days of automobile catalytic converters.  This confluence meant that grit was everywhere, and even for the non-fastidious—which I admit I was one—showers were an absolute necessity on a daily basis.  Sometimes it was so bad that you couldn’t see across the Hudson River, which was just a few blocks away! \n\nIn order to understand the situation the city faced in the 1970s, we have to look back a decade earlier.  The 1960s were a time of hope and promise for New York City, with the World’s Fair, the opening of the Verrazano Bridge, and the beginning of construction of the World Trade Center.  The city benefited from a booming stock market and strong overall job growth. \n\nMy memories of New York City during that period were very glowing.  Visiting from Massachusetts, I remember going to the World’s Fair and to a Mets game at the new Shea Stadium—heady stuff for an 11-year-old.  As a boy who planned to be a nuclear physicist when he grew up, I particularly recall the General Electric exhibit at the World’s Fair that highlighted the potential of hydrogen fusion as a future power source.  Although that turned out to be like flying cars—always somewhere just over the horizon—it was exciting to contemplate as an aspiring scientist.  Unbeknownst to me,there were also some ominous signs for the city.  The city’s manufacturing sector was losing jobs at a worrisome pace, population growth had slowed to a crawl, crime was on the rise and racial tensions were growing. \n\nAs the sixties unfolded, there were also a number of major strikes affecting public services, most notably the 1968 teachers’ strike.  Perhaps most importantly, the city’s finances were on a reckless path.  Despite growth in the economy and the tax base, the city was taking on more short-term debt, relying increasingly on state aid and grossly underfunding its pensions.  This is a familiar story where the seeds of future fiscal problems are sown during better economic times.  In effect, a combination of a strong U.S. economy, a bull market on Wall Street and various forms of fiscal gimmickry masked the increasing underlying fiscal stresses that the city was experiencing. \n\nBy 1970, when I arrived, some of this good fortune ended when the U.S economy was hit by recession and a bear market in equities began.  What followed was a massive economic slump in New York City—what would generally be described as a depression.  Some of the numbers are staggering: from 1970 to 1975, New York City saw a 6 percent decline in its population, a 15 percent drop in employment and a 50 percent surge in the murder rate.  The combination of the need to roll over debt from the prior two decades, a shrinking tax base and increased costs of debt—which sometimes had been used to finance operating expenses—caused fiscal problems that forced the city to cut services and raise taxes.  A continued bear market on Wall Street exacerbated the situation.  In effect, New York City looked to be in a vicious cycle with companies shrinking, closing or moving out.  The result was fewer jobs, an exodus of people, declining property values, rising crime rates and eroding tax revenues.  This meant fewer firemen, police and teachers, which led, in turn, to more crime and poorer educational opportunities.  Put simply, it was a horrible dynamic that looked difficult to reverse. \n\nAt the end of 1975, New York City faced perhaps its darkest moment and greatest challenge of the modern era when it ran out of money to pay for basic services.  The city’s persistent deficits caused the financial sector to lose confidence in the city’s ability to repay its debts, and the city lost its ability to borrow.  \n\nYet, this moment—when the outlook appeared bleakest—turned out to be an historic turning point for the city.  The reforms that were subsequently imposed by the state and federal governments through the Emergency Financial Control Board were quite tough in many ways.  There was plenty of pain to go around, and just about every stakeholder―including city officials, lenders, city workers and residents, to name just a few―shared in the sacrifice.\n\nThe city’s extraordinarily large level of short-term debt was refinanced into long-term debt owed to the newly formed Municipal Assistance Corporation (MAC).  To make this debt marketable to the public, MAC was given control over the city’s sales tax.  Revenues from that tax were dedicated to repayment of the MAC debt, and the city could keep only what was left over.\n\nFundamental to the deal was the creation of the Emergency Financial Control Board, which was empowered to monitor proposed city budgets to ensure that they were in balance.  This change alone was very consequential: taxes increased and spending fell sharply over the latter half of the 1970s.  By 1982, the city’s inflation-adjusted wage bill had fallen by almost 30 percent, and real investment in the city’s infrastructure fell by more than three-quarters and didn’t reach its 1974 levels until the early 1990s.\n\nThe city gave up a significant amount of its autonomy in exchange for the relief it received.  Ultimately, however, the reforms that were forced on the city created a responsible and transparent budgeting process that has served the city well to this day. \n\nBy early 1976, the U.S. economy was recovering from a deep recession, and employment in New York City’s financial sector was once again on the rise.  Overall employment in New York City began to recover by 1977, and unemployment began to decline.  By the end of the decade, there were signs of hope, but it wasn’t at all clear yet whether the city was back on solid footing.  While employment did rebound modestly, the city’s population was still declining, crime was still rising and the city was still having trouble borrowing.  It would be 10 years after the initial crisis before the city was able to borrow again on its own in the public markets.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, the resiliency of the city’s economy was becoming more apparent.  City-wide employment barely declined during the wrenching recessions of the early 1980s—the first time in a long while that the city’s economy had out-performed the nation’s.  In the next few years, job growth picked up sharply and real estate markets soared, a clear sign that a growing number of people had regained confidence in the city.  But, even during the booming 1980s, crime rates continued to increase—it wasn’t until 1990 that crime rates peaked and began a long downward trend.\n\nI returned to New York in 1983.  The draw was an employment opportunity in finance.  At the time, the city’s circumstances were improving but crime was still high, and there were still lots of problems caused by years of underinvestment.  For example, I recall that the New York City subway system at the time was a near-wreck, with train speeds sharply reduced in many areas due to poor track conditions and dilapidated infrastructure. \n\nBut, the seeds of improvement were in place.  The financial services industry was beginning a long boom marked by financial market innovation and the rapid development of the nation’s debt capital markets—a boom that ended with the financial crisis.  When I arrived, the build-out of the Battery Park City neighborhood was just starting.  My first year, I lived at Gateway Plaza, which was the first big apartment complex in Battery Park City.  However, it was early days and the nearest grocery store was about half a mile away north on West Street!  \n\nAlthough a major economic downturn throughout the Northeast in the early 1990s took its toll on New York City—especially on employment and home prices—the city’s population continued to grow and its crime rate began to decline.  While the city has had a number of ups and downs since the early 1990s, in tandem with the United States, the general trend has been upwards.  The city withstood a terror attack, financial crisis and natural disaster.  Following the attack on the World Trade Center in 2001, there was uncertainty over whether this would be a permanent setback for the city.  However, the city rebuilt and recovered and Lower Manhattan has evolved into a vibrant commercial, cultural and residential area.  Gateway Plaza is still there, but the Battery Park City neighborhood today is now fully developed and well-established.  There are even several grocery stores!\n\nThe city weathered the recent financial crisis and the Great Recession far better than many would have anticipated.  Although employment in the securities industry has stagnated after the decline due to the Great Recession, the city has found new sources of dynamism, including rapid growth in the technology sector and the further development of tourism.  The number of technology workers in New York City has doubled to about 125,000 in the past decade.  That sector is now is nearly as big as the securities industry.  And New York City had 56 million visitors last year, nearly double the total of 25 years earlier.  \n\nIn 2011, an important milestone was reached: payroll employment surpassed its previous all-time peak, from 1969, and it has grown strongly since then.  Crime rates have fallen significantly across the city since 1990, and real estate values have surged. \n\nOne consistent source of strength for the city has been immigration.  Over this period, New York City benefited from a sizable influx of immigrants, which more than offset out-migration in many neighborhoods.  To illustrate this, let’s take a look at one such neighborhood in Brooklyn, Sunset Park, that was losing residents to the suburbs in the 1960s and 1970s.  As property values fell, new migrants from Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Central America moved in.  By 1990, Hispanics comprised about half of all Sunset Park residents.  These new residents developed a thriving community, which boosted property values.  There was also an influx of Chinese residents, and part of Sunset Park has come to be known as Brooklyn’s Chinatown.  There are many other examples where immigrants revitalized whole neighborhoods: Russian and Ukrainian immigrants in Brighton Beach; Chinese and Korean immigrants in Flushing; and Indian immigrants in Jackson Heights, just to name a few. \n\nSo, has it been all good news for New York City in recent years?  Certainly not.  Many challenges remain.  One by-product of a strong economy and real estate market has been a decline in housing affordability, and an increase in homelessness.  It is estimated that there are over 60,000 homeless people in New York City today—almost double the number from 10 years ago and more than four times as high as in the early 1980s.  Moreover, poverty rates remain high in many parts of the city, and the education system can certainly be improved.  Yet, a strong economy and a sound fiscal position at least provide the means to devote resources to help address these ongoing problems. \n\nThis turnaround of New York City illustrates that reviving a city in trouble is indeed possible. There are some useful lessons from New York City’s experience.  First, it is often darkest before the dawn.  Cities in fiscal distress are like individuals suffering from addiction: they often have to hit bottom and reach out to others for help before they can begin to recover.  New York City hit bottom in 1975, and that created the impetus for reform.  Second, in such situations, cities often have to give up fiscal control for a time.  Accepting a Control Board and operating under its mandates was a painful, but necessary, step toward rebuilding the city’s fiscal health and regaining access to financial markets.  Third, when sound reforms are implemented it still takes a long time to achieve fruitful results, so it is important to stay the course.  Fourth, although a strong economy, good fiscal position and transparency in government will not automatically solve every problem, they provide a strong foundation.\n\nSo, what does the future hold for New York City?  An important aspect of a city’s vitality is the ability of its residents to develop the skills necessary to be successful and to achieve their dreams.  A big asset for the city is its access to affordable education.  Each year, tens of thousands of low-to-moderate-income New Yorkers—many of them immigrants—send their children to one of the city’s specialized high schools.  When it comes time for college, many of these same students have access to universities in the CUNY and SUNY systems.  A recent highly regarded study assessed how much of an opportunity kids born to less advantaged families in different parts of the United States have of moving up in the world.  New York City ranked 10th out of the 50 largest U.S. metro areas.2 The Big Apple should strive to be number one in this ranking by continuing to improve access to quality and affordable education and to job training.  We should all do our part to help make this happen.\n\nAlso, it is important to remember that the measure of a city’s well-being is much broader than how many are employed and the level of economic activity.  As Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, explained:\n\nIn my own philanthropy and business endeavors, I have seen the critical role that the arts play in stimulating creativity and in developing vital communities…the arts have a crucial impact on our economy and are an important catalyst for learning, discovery, and achievement in our country.\n\nThrough the fiscal crisis, into the 1980s and to the present day, the city maintained its status as a center of culture and the arts.  The efforts of the city and the state, starting in the mid-1980s, to redevelop the Theatre District and Times Square area played an important role in revitalizing tourism.  But, of course, the city’s well-deserved reputation for culture and arts goes well beyond Broadway—to the hundreds of Off-Broadway and neighborhood theaters, museums, music venues and organizations like yours.  Supporting this cultural infrastructure is important to maintaining a vibrant economy and a bright future.\n\nThe experience of New York City, which has gone from crisis to vibrancy, shows that the past need not be prologue for the future.  It also shows that a well-managed regime of fiscal control can help begin the process for future recovery.  Other cities and regions are at different points in this journey.  Puerto Rico, for example, which has been in recession for many years and which defaulted on its debt obligations earlier this year, is at a particularly critical juncture.  On the positive side, the fact that Congress has enacted legislation, the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act, or PROMESA, does provide a way forward.  The prospect for good fiscal stewardship has improved and this is an essential first step in the Island’s recovery.  As I have noted elsewhere, there are significant opportunities for action that can leverage the Island’s strengths to foster economic growth.  These include its bilingual adult population, an open economy occupying a central position in the Caribbean, wide experience as host to international corporations and close economic ties to the U.S. mainland.  However, much as New York City took time to recover, so too will it take time for Puerto Rico to recover from its crisis of the last decade.\n\nThe future of Puerto Rico is yet to be determined.  However, the experience of New York City suggests that a turnaround is possible even when underlying conditions appear dire.  New York City is a compelling example of what is possible when you leverage your citizens’ ingenuity and capacity for reinvention.  It shows what can be achieved with the appropriate discipline and effort. \n\nThank you for your kind attention.   \n\n1 Jason Bram, Andrew Haughwout, Joseph Tracy and Luis Uranga assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\n2 Raj Chetty, Nathaniel Hendren, Patrick Kline and Emmanuel Saez. “Where is the Land of Opportunity?

        "title": "Remarks at the 40th Annual Central Banking Seminar",
        "content": "It’s my pleasure to welcome you to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to participate in the 40th anniversary of our Central Banking Seminar.  This year we have 140 participants representing 67 different countries and institutions.  The program is designed to provide a broad view of central banking covering the key areas of monetary policy, supervision, payments and financial stability.  This design reflects our belief that a well-rounded perspective can help us to be more effective in our jobs as central bankers.  We also hope this program provides you with an opportunity during your stay to broaden your network of central bank colleagues.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nThe theme of this year’s seminar is the policy challenges we face in an environment of sluggish economic growth and low inflation.  Central bankers will always be confronted by challenges in carrying out their responsibilities, which will change over time.  This puts a premium on our ability to adapt.  Consider, for example, the contrast between the issues faced by the Federal Reserve in 1976—the inaugural year of our seminar—and today.  In 1976, the U.S. economy was recovering from the first oil price shock and the ensuing recession, which had ended in March 1975.  The FOMC faced the problem of stagflation, as both inflation and unemployment were high—inflation was running around 6 percent and the unemployment rate was nearly 8 percent.  The FOMC’s policy rate—the federal funds rate—was about 5 percent.\n\nCompare that to today’s circumstances.  The U.S. economy has entered its eighth year of expansion following the financial crisis and the Great Recession.  In contrast to 1976, inflation has been below the FOMC’s desired level of 2 percent for most of this expansion.  This year, inflation is running at about 1 percent and the unemployment rate is 4.9 percent.  Monetary policy remains accommodative, with the target range for the federal funds rate at 0.25-0.50 percent.  I doubt that a central banker in 1976 would have viewed the current set of circumstances as even remotely plausible, or would have ever contemplated the types of challenges that we now face. \n\nIn my remarks today, I would like to briefly touch on four topics: (1) the efficacy of monetary policy at the zero lower bound, (2) central bank communications, (3) cyber risk, and (4) market liquidity and regulation.  These have particular relevance for central banks today, and are likely to remain relevant in the years ahead.  The speakers that you will hear over the course of our program will elaborate on some of these topics.\n\nThe financial crisis severely impaired the global financial system, and the resulting recession in the United States was the most severe since the Great Depression.  Based in part on the lessons of the Japanese experience, in which falling inflation expectations undermined the effectiveness of monetary policy, the FOMC responded aggressively as the economy weakened.  It began cutting the policy rate from 5.25 percent in September 2007 and reached the effective zero lower bound in December 2008.  From that point on, the FOMC turned to unconventional monetary policy in order to provide additional stimulus to the economy.\n\nAcademic research indicates that recoveries following financial crises have tended to be shallow and protracted.2  One plausible reason for this pattern is that a financial crisis typically results in headwinds that take time to dissipate—for example, the deleveraging of business and household balance sheets or the tightening of credit standards.  Even so, as the expansion failed to gather momentum and persistently underperformed most forecasts, alternative explanations for the sluggish economic growth―such as secular stagnation―began to receive increased attention.  Wednesday’s session on Global Trends and Risks will more fully explore this debate.  The insights from this debate have important implications for the appropriate path for monetary policy and the question of whether monetary policymakers need additional tools or greater support from the fiscal authorities to avoid being trapped at the zero lower bound for interest rates.\n\nBeyond these factors, the tepid pace of the expansion reflects the fact that monetary policy was constrained by the zero lower bound.  Monetary policy affects the economy mainly through its influence on financial market conditions—including long-term interest rates, credit spreads, exchange rates and equity prices.  However, when the policy rate hits zero, conventional policy is constrained in terms of providing additional accommodation―even recognizing that some central banks have pushed short-term rates into negative territory.  To overcome such constraints, the FOMC used forward guidance—promising to keep rates low for longer—and asset purchases to provide additional stimulus to the economy.  Given the initial novelty of unconventional monetary policy tools, central banks did not have a well-developed body of research to draw on to design the programs and calibrate their impact.  While it will take time to build this body of work, research to date varies in terms of the estimated effectiveness of unconventional policy.  Several studies indicate that the FOMC’s first asset purchase program helped to reduce long-term interest rates, while the subsequent programs had smaller though still significant effects on rates.  However, Professor Summers, who is participating in our program, has recently questioned the effectiveness of the Fed’s asset purchase programs when financial markets are well-functioning.3\n\nThere is a related concern given that the federal funds rate is still close to zero at this point in the expansion.  While I’m on record as saying that expansions do not simply die of old age,4 some economists are concerned that the risk of a recession is increasing.  As I indicated earlier, the FOMC was able to reduce the federal funds rate by more than 5 percentage points in an effort to offset the effects of the last recession.  If another recession were to happen in the next few years, it is likely that the FOMC would be unable to respond with a cut of such magnitude.  In this case, the effectiveness of unconventional monetary policy in providing accommodation would again become a central issue, as Chair Yellen discussed in her recent Jackson Hole speech.5 A risk management approach to monetary policy would suggest that the more concerned one is with the effectiveness of these policies at the zero lower bound, the more cautious one would be in the process of removing accommodation.  So, even though we are now slightly off the zero lower bound, an assessment of the effectiveness of unconventional monetary policy has implications with respect to the current stance of monetary policy.\n\nAnother important challenge for central banks is communication with the public.  It is now accepted that the effectiveness of monetary policy is enhanced when the public has a clear understanding of the goals of monetary policy, and the framework and actions that the central bank will use to attain them.  One important example is inflation expectations, which are important to the dynamics of inflation. Effective communication by the central bank can help to anchor inflation expectations at its target, thereby making it easier for the central bank to attain its inflation objective.\n\nThe use of unconventional monetary policy has also heightened the focus on communication.  In the past, communication almost exclusively focused on the likely short-term path for the central bank’s policy rate.  But, once the zero lower bound became a constraint, forward guidance became an important communication tool to surmount the problems caused by that constraint.  In addition, there are now many more dimensions to the stance of monetary policy, including the size and composition of the central bank’s balance sheet.  When communicating about these various dimensions, it is important for the central bank to demonstrate its commitment to a framework rather than to a specific policy path, since the precise path of policy should be data dependent and the future is uncertain.  Good communication can lead to a clear understanding of the Fed’s framework, which will help the public to assess the data along with the Fed and enable it to better predict how the Fed is likely to adjust policy as the economic outlook changes. \n\nAs I indicated earlier, the challenges the FOMC faced in 1976 were very different from today’s.  In addition, advances in information technology also have changed how we do our work.  However, these advances come with the risk of increased exposure to cyber-attacks.  The various motivations for these attacks include causing embarrassment to the central bank, stealing money, and disrupting critical financial services.  The large sums of money potentially at risk mean that we need very strong defenses to lower the probability of success by cyber attackers in order to deter such efforts.  Attacks can have consequences for a central bank’s reputation and the public’s confidence in it, underscoring the importance of a sturdy set of defenses and response actions.  Protecting against cyber-attacks requires not only investment in the right infrastructure, policies and processes, but also vigilance from central bank employees.  Many attacks involve tricking unsuspecting employees into installing malicious code or revealing key access information.  Since this “phishing” plays on human weaknesses, to which we are all prone, protecting against these tactics requires ongoing training and testing, appropriate access controls, and segregation of duties in the context of critical infrastructures.  Central banks also need reliable channels of communication and cooperation with those agencies that track and combat malicious cyber activity.\n\nThe last topic that I would like to touch on is market liquidity and regulation.  Market liquidity is essential to the proper functioning of financial markets.  I think of it as the cost—both in expense and time—of buying or selling an asset for cash.  Market liquidity is like engine oil, which is essential for engine parts to move properly without generating excessive friction and heat.  Market liquidity reflects many factors, including the expense of conducting a transaction, the price of the transaction relative to the midpoint of the bid-ask spread, any impact of the transaction on the market price, and the speed at which the transaction can be completed.\n\nSome argue that market liquidity has been adversely affected by post-crisis regulation.  For example, the higher capital and liquidity requirements for the largest securities dealers may have impaired market liquidity by reducing the profitability of dealer intermediation activities and raising the cost of dealer balance sheets.  But, before considering whether any regulatory changes would be appropriate, it is important to carefully examine the evidence.  New York Fed staff have been conducting an extensive analysis of empirical measures of market liquidity and the effects certain regulations may have had on it.  The work to date finds little evidence—based on traditional liquidity measures—of any meaningful degradation in market liquidity across key asset classes.  However, there are important data gaps that must be filled in order to have a more complete assessment.  For example, the U.S. Treasury market data capture dealer-to-dealer transactions, but not dealer-to-customer transactions that are typically conducted on an over-the-counter basis.  Moreover, we do see other consequences of regulation, such as the rise in the foreign exchange swap basis and the spread between LIBOR and the federal funds rate, as well as the decline in dealer repo financing activity.  Still, it is important to keep in mind that even if further analysis were to identify a regulatory-related decline in market liquidity, any associated cost would have to be weighed against the benefits of these regulations in terms of a safer and more robust financial system.\n\nIn closing, I hope you will find our program both engaging and challenging.  Don’t be shy—our speakers welcome difficult and thought-provoking questions.  Absorb all you can.  Use this opportunity to network with your colleagues.  Hopefully, this experience will stimulate your thinking and help you be successful in your career as a central banker. \n\n1 Elizabeth Mahoney, Jonathan McCarthy, Nick Stanescu and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\n2 For example, see Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff.

        "title": "Remarks at the New York Fed’s Economic Press Briefing on the Regional Economy",
        "content": "Good morning and welcome to the New York Fed’s Economic Press Briefing. I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak with the journalists covering our region. You are an important communication channel to the people in our District. This morning I want to focus on economic conditions in our region, giving particular attention to job growth. I also want to discuss our ongoing work on Puerto Rico. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nThe New York Fed is deeply committed to serving our region. This commitment manifests itself in several ways. We produce business surveys and local economic indexes to help our constituents track regional economic conditions. My staff writes papers and blog posts on economic issues important to our region. We meet with a number of advisory boards comprised of community and business leaders. And, I regularly visit different parts of our District so that I can meet with local businesses, community development professionals, and the people who live and work here. This on-the-ground intelligence is valuable to me and helps inform my view of the region and the economy, which, in turn, plays an important role in shaping my outlook on policy.\n\nLet me now talk a bit about job growth in our region.\n`\nJob Growth in the Region\n\nNationally, the labor market has added 2.4 million jobs over the past year. And, the strong jobs reports released over the past two months have helped allay concerns that arose earlier this year that job growth was beginning to stall. Indeed, these reports reinforce my view that labor market conditions continue to improve.\n\nTurning to conditions closer to home; job growth in our region has generally been somewhat below the national pace. One important exception is New York City, where job growth has been strong, despite the relatively sluggish performance of the financial services industry. In the past, the City has counted on job growth from Wall Street to fuel economic growth during recoveries and expansions. This time around, however, job gains in the securities industry have been meager. Instead, the City’s job growth has been quite widespread in sectors outside of finance. One that is especially noteworthy is the City’s burgeoning technology sector, which has been creating jobs in industries such as internet publishing, online shopping, and scientific research and development. Growth in these high-paying jobs is picking up much of the slack created by the softness of the securities industry.\n\nIn fact, strong growth in New York City has been helping many of its surrounding areas, including northern New Jersey, Long Island and Fairfield County. Many workers residing in these areas commute to New York City and have access to the City’s vast, diverse and expanding job market. For example, Long Island’s unemployment rate is now below 4 percent, its lowest level in nearly a decade. In Connecticut, Bridgeport has also benefited. When I visited a few months ago, I saw firsthand some of this resurgence. Bridgeport is both the largest and poorest city in Fairfield County, and for decades had seen its population and job base steadily decline. But, since 2000, its population has started to grow again for the first time since the 1940s. Even as other parts of Fairfield County struggle with a number of high-profile corporate relocations, jobs have begun growing and Bridgeport is showing signs of revival.\n\nIn upstate New York, economic growth has generally been modest, with job growth running well below the national pace. This isn’t new, as upstate New York has historically tended to grow much more slowly than the nation. Though growth has been slow for the region as a whole, some places are doing relatively better than others. In particular, job growth has picked up in Buffalo, and the Capital Region continues to see sturdy growth coupled with significant manufacturing job gains.\n\nHowever, not all parts of upstate New York are seeing the same degree of economic progress. There has been little to no growth in the center of the state, and Utica and Binghamton continue to see employment declines. Binghamton stands out as being particularly challenged, as its economy has yet to see any meaningful recovery from the Great Recession. Steep manufacturing job losses have weighed heavily on the area, though these losses appear to be nearing an end. I had the opportunity to visit Binghamton earlier this summer, and I was encouraged by what I saw. The region is making serious efforts to boost economic growth, with Binghamton University playing a key role in fostering local business activity. And, like many places dealing with steep manufacturing job losses, there is a large swath of displaced workers that need assistance returning to the labor market. This has proved challenging and remains a priority.\n\nUpdate on Puerto Rico\n\nOn balance, I think it’s fair to say that the economic news from much of the Second District has been quite positive. An important exception, though, has been the fiscal crisis faced by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, home to 3.5 million U.S. citizens. Unfortunately, Puerto Rico continues to struggle under the weight of economic stagnation, employment declines and outmigration. This year, the government has been unable to make its debt payments on schedule and has lost access to the public debt markets. The pressures that culminated in these missed payments have been building for some time. This is an issue that we have been focused on for several years. We have published a number of reports in order to help highlight challenges and opportunities, to inform the discussion around solutions.\n\nI have visited Puerto Rico on several occasions, and had the opportunity to talk to residents and hear about the challenges they face. As an outgrowth of one of these trips—taken in 2011—I commissioned my staff to produce a report on the competitiveness of the Island’s economy. We released this report in 2012, and it served, I believe, a useful purpose in providing technical analysis and identifying some important issues deserving of policy attention. Over the following two years, the Island’s fiscal problems worsened. Consequently, in 2014 we published an update to the initial report―this time focusing on the Island’s public finances―and again offering suggestions for consideration.\n\nIn June, Congress and the Obama Administration took action providing a framework to help address the Commonwealth’s fiscal crisis. Part of that agreement re-emphasized that the Commonwealth’s fiscal sustainability depends crucially on an expanding economy. In an effort to continue to shed light on the important issues, last week we published in our Liberty Street Economics blog a five-part series entitled “Restoring Economic Growth in Puerto Rico.” Some important conclusions emerged from our analysis, and I want to emphasize those today.\n\nFirst and foremost, Puerto Rico’s current level of public debt is unsustainable. Achieving fiscal sustainability requires real reforms and a significant adjustment to the Commonwealth’s debt burden, as Congress and the Administration have recognized. To illustrate this point, our analysis demonstrates that even if growth were to return to between 2 and 2.5 percent per year—an optimistic scenario—debt as a share of GDP would continue to rise under the current fiscal balance and debt structure. This underscores that the current regime is not sustainable. Second, while fiscal reform is definitely needed, restoring economic growth remains a crucial ingredient to achieving a sustainable fiscal regime. Puerto Rico slipped into recession in 2006, and a decade later a recovery has yet to materialize. Any fixed level of debt will grow even more burdensome if the economy is shrinking. Consequently, this long deep recession has exacerbated the Island’s fiscal woes.\n\nMuch of last week’s analysis focused on a key contributor to economic growth—the labor force—so let me point out a few conclusions that I drew from that work. Puerto Rico’s outmigration remains an important concern, and is both a cause and an effect of the economic decline. Although the skills of those who have migrated to the Mainland look much like those who remain, the departure of tens of thousands of residents each year represents a huge drain on Puerto Rico’s potential growth. Among those who remain on the Island, low labor force participation, an aging population and relatively poor preparation for skilled jobs represent significant headwinds to growth.\n\nWhile our analysis seems to paint a somewhat dark picture of economic conditions on the Island, it’s important to remember that there are significant opportunities for action that can leverage the Island’s strengths to foster economic growth. These include its bilingual adult population, an open economy occupying a central position in the Caribbean, wide experience as host to international corporations, and close economic ties to the U.S. mainland. It is in exactly this spirit that we present this analysis—in the hope that it will help policymakers focus on actions that can help to restore growth and prosperity to the Commonwealth. Going forward, we will stay engaged in this effort.\n\nMiddle-Wage Jobs Returning\n\nLet me conclude by returning to the theme of the labor market. Job growth is essential to the vitality of an expansion, but the types of jobs being created are also important. While the labor market has continued to add jobs at a solid pace, many remain concerned about a lack of job opportunities for the middle class. Indeed, growth of middle-wage jobs has been lackluster for the past few decades, with gains occurring disproportionately in higher-wage and lower-wage sectors. This long-term hollowing out of jobs in the middle of the wage distribution has helped fuel rising wage inequality, and has contributed to a growing sense for some that they are being left behind in the current economic expansion. At a previous press briefing, we showed that many middle-wage jobs disappeared during the Great Recession with very few of these jobs returning during the early stages of the recovery. This made it especially difficult for many workers who lost their jobs to rejoin the economy.\n\nToday, our economists will show that the tide has begun to turn. For the first time in quite a while, gains in middle-wage jobs actually outnumber gains in higher- and lower-wage jobs nationwide. These middle-wage jobs include teachers, construction workers, mechanics, administrative support personnel and truck drivers, just to name a few. I believe this is an important development in the economy, because, if it were to continue, it would create more opportunities for workers and their families who have been struggling up to now. Middle-wage jobs are also being created in our region, though such gains have been more evident in some places than others.\n\nI will now ask Jaison Abel to provide more details about job growth in our region.\n\n1 Jaison Abel, Jason Bram, Hunter Clark, Giacomo De Giorgi, Richard Deitz, Jack Gutt, Andrew Haughwout and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks."

        "title": "The U.S. Economic Outlook and the Implications for Monetary Policy",
        "content": "It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak here in Bali. Today I plan to provide a brief summary of the U.S. economic outlook, incorporating recent U.S. economic data and global and financial market developments. I will then discuss the implications of the outlook for U.S. monetary policy, and explain how international and financial market developments influence my thinking. I will emphasize two key points.\n\nFirst, financial market conditions matter in determining the appropriate stance of monetary policy. Financial conditions affect households’ and firms’ decisions, so that the transmission of U.S. monetary policy to the real economy depends, to a large extent, on how changes in monetary policy help deliver the appropriate financial market conditions to support our objectives of price stability and maximum employment. But financial conditions also evolve in response to domestic and international events. Thus, when I reiterate that U.S. monetary policy is data dependent, that includes not just the information gleaned from important economic releases such as payroll employment and retail sales, but also how financial market conditions react to economic and financial market developments in the global economy.\n\nSecond, external events―such as Brexit―can have effects that go beyond just their impact on global trade. Conversely, what we do in the United States has an impact far beyond our borders, and we need to take that into consideration in how we conduct and communicate monetary policy in the United States. Put simply, monetary policy is a two-way street, and we all need to be cognizant of that.\n\nAs always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nThe U.S. Economic Outlook\n\nDespite the many twists and turns in the road so far, my baseline outlook for growth and inflation in the United States has not changed much in recent months. After a weak first quarter, real GDP continued to grow sluggishly in the second quarter. On the positive side, consumer spending rose more quickly during the second quarter. On the negative side, business fixed-investment spending continued to disappoint, residential investment was weak and inventory investment was a substantial drag on growth.\n\nLooking forward, I expect economic activity to expand at roughly a 2 percent annualized pace over the next 18 months, appreciably above that of the past three quarters. Over the remainder of this year, the economy should continue to get some lift from consumption and from a fiscal policy stance that remains mildly stimulative. Moreover, I anticipate that residential investment will rebound from its decline in the second quarter. This pace of growth would likely be sufficient to continue to absorb any remaining slack in the labor market and to support inflation moving back to our 2 percent objective.\n\nHowever, any forecast is uncertain and growth could end up higher or lower. Let me turn to an assessment of the balance of risks around my growth outlook. I believe that a sizable pickup in the rate of growth of economic activity relative to that in my forecast seems unlikely for a number of reasons. Although consumer spending strengthened substantially in the second quarter, that stronger pace is unlikely to be sustained going forward. That is because the fundamentals supporting consumption have softened somewhat. Real income growth moderated in the second quarter as the pace of job gains slowed and the inflation rate rose, boosted by somewhat higher energy prices. Even with the surprisingly large addition of 287,000 payroll jobs in June, the pace of improvement in the U.S. labor market appears to have slowed somewhat. For example, over the past three months, payroll gains have averaged about 150,000 per month, as compared to an average of more than 200,000 per month over the course of 2015 and the first quarter of this year. But even 150,000 job gains per month would be consistent with gradually using up any remaining slack present in the U.S. labor market.\n\nAlthough I expect business fixed investment to begin to grow again in the second half, it will likely remain soft as profits have stagnated and election year uncertainty could act as an additional depressant. All else equal, investment tends to be weaker when uncertainty rises because this creates an incentive for businesses to delay decisions until the uncertainty is resolved.\n\nAlso, trade seems likely to exert a net drag on growth. There are two factors at play here: the sluggish growth rate of aggregate demand abroad and the continuing impact of earlier dollar appreciation on U.S. export competitiveness.\n\nWith respect to downside risks to the growth outlook, one that is hard to gauge is the potential fallout from the result of the recent U.K. referendum. It is widely anticipated that U.K. growth will slow as a consequence. Although the direct impact of slower U.K. growth on U.S. trade will almost certainly be very small—total U.S. exports to the U.K. are only about 0.7 percent of U.S. GDP—there are a number of other channels that could amplify the impact of the Brexit decision on U.S. economic activity. These include the potential adverse effects on European economic activity, on the perceived health of the global banking system, and on broader financial market conditions.\n\nTo date, the global financial market fallout from the Brexit vote has been short-lived, and U.S. financial market conditions remain supportive to economic growth. Nevertheless, I believe that the potential aftershocks pose medium-term downside risks to the global economy, and that these risks need to be monitored.\n\nWith respect to inflation, I think the outlook has not changed much recently. Headline inflation, as anticipated, has climbed a bit this year as earlier energy price declines have fallen out of the year-over-year inflation calculations. In contrast, core inflation has been broadly stable, with the core PCE deflator rising by 1.6 percent over the past four quarters, moderately below our 2 percent objective.\n\nThe fact that core inflation has been broadly stable over recent months in the face of the earlier declines in energy and non-energy import prices is notable. It makes me somewhat more confident that overall inflation will return to our 2 percent inflation objective over the medium term as long as the economic growth that I expect actually materializes. If the economy were to grow at the pace I discussed earlier, this would likely translate into sufficient job gains to continue to remove any remaining slack in the labor market—which, by my assessment, is already operating quite close to a level that is consistent with what is achievable on a sustainable basis. This would likely lead to further pressure on labor resources, higher wages and, over time, somewhat higher inflation.\n\nIn contrast, if growth were instead to fall below my forecast, then I would be less confident that inflation would return to our 2 percent objective. In addition, I put some weight on the fact that surveys from both the University of Michigan and the New York Fed indicate that household longer-term inflation expectations have declined somewhat over the past year and are in the lower end of their historical ranges. Nevertheless, I am not unduly worried because the magnitude of these declines has been modest, and because the New York Fed’s three-year-ahead inflation measure has been gradually increasing since January and has reversed much of the decline observed in the second half of 2015. Low longer-term inflation expectations, if allowed to become entrenched, would act as a restraint on actual inflation making it more difficult for us to meet our inflation objective.\n\nIn contrast, I put less weight on the significantly larger declines in market-based measures of inflation compensation over the past two years. From my perspective, these declines seem driven more by changes in bond term premia and the relative liquidity characteristics of nominal versus inflation-protected Treasury securities than by sharply falling inflation expectations.\n\nImplications of the Outlook for U.S. Monetary Policy\n\nIf, as I have indicated, the U.S. growth and inflation outlooks have not changed notably, then why have expectations about U.S. monetary policy shifted so much? Compared to the start of the year, the expected timing of any further Fed interest rate hikes has been pushed back, and the expected upward trajectory of U.S. short-term rates is now much flatter.\n\nThere are several reasons to explain these shifts. First, assessments of the neutral real short-term interest rate have declined as economic growth has consistently fallen short of consensus forecasts. With the U.S. economy having grown at only a 2.1 percent annual rate over the past seven years, it has become harder to sustain the view that the neutral real short-term interest rate is close to, or will soon be close to, its historical level of around 2 percent. Estimates of the neutral real short-term interest rate obtained from many of the DSGE models used within the Federal Reserve System are currently clustered around zero, and this seems reasonable to me. An implication is that at present there is only a small gap between the actual real short-term rate of about -1 percent and the neutral real short-term rate. In other words, U.S. monetary policy is accommodative, but only moderately so.\n\nIn addition, I suspect that many have come to question the view that headwinds from the financial crisis are temporarily depressing the neutral short-term rate, and that the neutral short-term rate will significantly rise in the near-future as these headwinds dissipate. If the headwinds have not dissipated to a meaningful degree in the seven years since the recession ended, then why should one expect them to necessarily diminish quickly over the next couple of years? Evidence is accumulating that some of the headwinds are likely to prove more persistent. For example, the reduced availability of mortgage financing for those with lower credit scores seems likely to continue. Lenders now appreciate that home prices can decline significantly. Thus, they cannot rely as much on the value of the housing collateral in securing their mortgage loans, and consequently now put more weight on the credit histories of the borrowers.\n\nMarket participants may also be taking some signal from the gradual decline in the median long-run federal funds rate projection of FOMC participants shown in the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). I think this indicates a growing consensus that the neutral real short-term rate will not return anytime soon to its historical norm of 2 percent.\n\nA second reason for the downward adjustment in U.S. interest rate expectations is that U.S. financial market conditions depend, in part, on the stance of U.S. monetary policy relative to monetary policies abroad. If the economic outlook abroad deteriorates and this causes foreign countries to pursue a more accommodative set of monetary policies, then the dollar would likely appreciate―other things equal― reflecting expectations of lower interest rates abroad relative to U.S. interest rates. In this case, the U.S. may need to adjust its own monetary policy path. If the FOMC did not make this adjustment, the stronger dollar could result in an undesired tightening of U.S. financial conditions. The expected forward interest rate paths in Europe and Japan have fallen considerably this year. If the FOMC had followed the median federal funds rate path from the December 2015 SEP projection, then the U.S. dollar would likely have appreciated much more significantly. Instead, the U.S. interest rate path has come down in tandem with the foreign interest rate paths and the dollar has appreciated only modestly.\n\nThis is a crucial point and I want to make sure there is no misunderstanding. The Federal Reserve is not targeting the exchange value of the U.S. dollar. What the FOMC considers are financial conditions broadly defined, because they affect the saving and investment decisions of households and firms. The dollar is but one component of these financial conditions. The level of short- and long-term rates, credit spreads, and equity prices are also important components of the financial conditions that we closely monitor. If international developments shift U.S. financial market conditions―including the dollar―then we need to take this into consideration in our U.S. monetary policy decisions.\n\nThird, I have found that market participants broadly appreciate that the FOMC needs to take a risk management approach in its conduct of monetary policy. There are at least two important aspects of this approach. The first is whether the balance of risks to the outlooks for either economic growth or inflation are skewed to the upside or downside. The second is whether the efficacy of monetary policy itself is asymmetric when monetary policy is at, or close to, the zero lower bound for interest rates. In this situation, it may be easier to implement a tighter monetary policy through raising rates, than it would be to implement a looser policy using unconventional tools. Also, the effects of a policy of raising rates may be more predictable compared to the effects from using unconventional tools.\n\nAs I noted earlier, I think the medium-term risks to the U.S. economic growth outlook are somewhat skewed to the down side. Thus, this needs to be taken into consideration in terms of the appropriate stance for U.S. monetary policy. With respect to the efficacy of monetary policy, given how close we remain to the zero lower bound for interest rates, I also think the risks are asymmetric. Therefore, we need to be a bit more careful about the risk of tightening monetary policy in a manner that proves to be premature, as compared to the alternative risk of being a little late. If we were to realize that we were slightly late, policy can be adjusted by raising short-term interest rates more quickly.2\n\nAll three of these reasons—evidence that U.S. monetary policy is currently only moderately accommodative, the fact that U.S. financial conditions have been influenced by economic and financial market developments abroad, and risk management considerations—argue, at the moment, for caution in raising U.S. short-term interest rates. So, directionally, the movement in investor expectations towards a flatter path for U.S. short-term interest rates seems broadly appropriate.\n\nThat said, to my eye, market expectations derived from futures prices—which price in about one 25 basis point rate hike through the end of 2017—appear to be too complacent. If the incoming information validates my view of the outlook, then I believe that U.S. monetary policy will likely need to move at a faster pace than implied by futures prices towards a more neutral posture as the labor market tightens further and U.S. inflation rises. Moreover, market expectations may be putting insufficient weight on the possibility that the economy could outperform our expectations, that financial conditions could ease, or that the risks to growth from Brexit and other international developments could fade away. If such events were to occur, this might necessitate a faster pace of adjustment.\n\nFor these reasons, I think it is premature to rule out further monetary policy tightening this year. As I said before, it depends on the data, broadly defined, and, as we all know, that is not something one can predict with any accuracy.\n\nIt’s a Two-Way Street\n\nThe U.S. economy plays a large role in the global economy. Most significantly, the U.S. economy represents a sizable share of world GDP—roughly 25 percent at current exchange rates—and the U.S. dollar is the most important international reserve currency. More than 60 percent of central bank reserve assets are denominated in dollars, and that share has been stable to rising in recent years. Most foreign trade is denominated in dollars and most of the foreign currency debt issued by corporations abroad is denominated in dollars. Thus, what happens to the U.S. economy, U.S. financial asset prices and the exchange value of the dollar has important implications for the global economy.\n\nAt the same time, prosperity is very much a two-way street. Developments outside the United States affect our domestic economic outlook through their impact on trade and financial market conditions, and we have to take such developments into consideration in our monetary policy decision-making.\n\nIn many ways, international linkages have become more important over time. This is because international trade has increased rapidly over the past few decades as the world economy has become more developed and globalized—notwithstanding the flattening of the global trade-to-GDP ratio over the past few years. And, global trade interactions have become more complex as supply chains have become more extensive and intricate, often involving many different countries.\n\nFinancial markets across the globe have also become more integrated. Developments in one market now appear to have larger effects on other markets than was generally the case historically. Consider, for example, how European and Japanese central bank quantitative easing activity has helped drive the sharp decline in long-term U.S. Treasury yields this year. Or, in the other direction, consider the global bond market taper tantrum in 2013. In this case, markets reacted to then-Chairman Bernanke’s musing that the Federal Reserve was beginning to evaluate when the time would be right to begin the tapering of the Fed’s asset purchase program. Or, in a similar vein, consider the international financial market reaction to China’s decision to alter its foreign exchange rate regime and how the RMB is managed relative to the dollar versus a broader basket of foreign currencies.\n\nThe growing interdependence can be seen in the increased correlation of market movements both across countries and across asset classes. Periods of “risk on” versus “risk off” trading now occur on a global basis. For example, equity market movements in developed and emerging markets have exhibited a 76 percent positive correlation over the past six months. This is only slightly below the all-time peak of 82 percent in 2009, and significantly above the 57 percent correlation that prevailed from 1995 through 2007.\n\nCorrelations across asset classes have also been increasing. For example, consider the set of assets comprised of the 10-year U.S. Treasury, U.S. equities, international equities, oil, the VIX, a trade-weighted dollar index and the BAA credit spread. We can construct a variable—called a common factor—to capture as much of the overall movement and co-movements for the series in this set. The more closely the series’ movements are tied together, the greater the explanatory content of the common factor. Currently, the derived common factor accounts for 50 percent of the variation in these financial variables, up from 30 percent in early 2014.\n\nOil, in particular, has become more correlated with other assets. Prior to 2008, oil was virtually uncorrelated with equities and Treasuries. Whereas, in 2016, its correlation with these two asset classes has been more than 45 percent.\n\nThese effects are transmitted via many linkages, not just through trade and financial markets. Consider, the many different channels of potential Brexit influence—not only the impact on international trade and global interest rates and currencies, but also on bank equity prices and on political uncertainty.\n\nGiven this interdependency, what should we do about it? Interdependency and linkages do not mean that U.S. monetary policy should subordinate its domestic goals for international ones. The Federal Reserve has a clear domestic-oriented mandate that was set by the U.S. Congress. Instead, I believe that setting U.S. monetary policy to best achieve our domestic mandate will help to support sustainable growth and development abroad. As I see it, there are two key steps that are essential in the design of an appropriate monetary policy strategy.\n\nStep one is to take an expansive view of the global eco-system in which we all operate. We need to take into consideration that our decisions have broad consequences for the global economy and, conversely, that international developments can have significant consequences for the U.S. economic outlook and therefore the appropriate stance of U.S. monetary policy. As part of this, we need to be nimble in incorporating new developments into our monetary policy decision-making.\n\nStep two is to communicate clearly and consistently. That means clarity about the objectives of monetary policy, how the Fed plans to meet those objectives in light of the economic and financial market environment, and how it formulates its responses to unforeseen circumstances that lead to revisions to its economic forecast.\n\nIn my view the Federal Reserve is making progress in both of these areas. With respect to the first step, I believe we do take an expansive view of those factors that might affect the U.S. outlook and we revise our views accordingly. Our speeches, statements, and actions this year illustrate this is how we operate. For example, after the market turbulence at the start of the year, we kept monetary policy on hold at the March FOMC meeting and explicitly referenced “readings on financial and international developments” in the FOMC statement. Similarly, in speeches prior to the Brexit vote and in the FOMC minutes, we raised our concerns about the risks of disorderly outcomes associated with the U.K. referendum. For instance, the June FOMC minutes state: “Most participants noted that the upcoming British referendum on membership in the European Union could generate financial market turbulence that could adversely affect domestic economic performance.”\n\nIn addition we are doing a reasonably good job incorporating the flow of new information into our forecasts. The fact that the federal funds rate projections from the SEP have changed significantly from quarter to quarter indicates that FOMC participants are responsive to new information.\n\nNow, some have expressed an alternative view that the movement in these rate projections is an indication that the FOMC’s reaction function is unstable and unmoored. I do not see it that way at all. The forecasts of FOMC participants with respect to growth and inflation have not changed much this year. What have changed are expectations about the monetary policy stance that would be appropriate in order to achieve those outcomes. It is important to emphasize that these interest rate projections are not commitments. They are point-in-time views of the appropriate interest rate path and are updated as economic circumstances and financial market conditions change and evolve.\n\nWith respect to communication, in recent years the Federal Reserve has shifted towards much greater transparency. This includes quarterly press conferences by the Fed chair following FOMC meetings; publishing growth, inflation and short-term interest rate forecasts of FOMC participants on a quarterly basis; and a concerted effort to lay out the guideposts that the FOMC will look at in assessing progress towards our dual mandate objectives.\n\nOn the communication front, although we have come a long way, I would admit that there is still room for further improvement. For example, the focus of the SEP on the each participant’s modal forecast does not convey how much uncertainty there is about the economic outlook. Similarly, language used in FOMC statements can become stale over time. We tend to make relatively few changes to the statement language each meeting because of the acute market sensitivity to such changes. One could argue that this might not be the best practice to follow, but we should recognize that there would also be significant transition costs if we were to make more extensive revisions to the statement at each meeting.\n\nFor monetary policy to be effective, it is important to have clarity about what the FOMC can be clear and consistent about—its manner of responses to mitigate the potential harmful effects of disturbances and the goals of policy. In contrast, our monetary policy projections and the actions we take cannot be static. If economic circumstances change, then monetary policy needs to change too. Otherwise, we will not be able to achieve our objectives.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n1Tobias Adrian, Matthew Higgins, Jonathan McCarthy, Paolo Pesenti, Robert Rich, Giorgio Topa, Joseph Tracy and Peter Van Tassel assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\n2Of course, if the economy were to weaken, we still have plenty of tools. Not only could we cut short-term interest rates, but we also could extend the maturity of our Treasury and agency MBS portfolio, purchase additional Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities and engage in forward guidance with respect to the future path of short-term interest rates."

        "content": "In my remarks today, I will focus on why global growth has been so anemic following the financial crisis and what we can do about it.1\n\nI think it is fair to say that the global recovery following the financial crisis has been disappointing. Growth is below pre-crisis levels for the United States, Europe, Japan and China. For example, in the U.S., real GDP growth has averaged only about 2.2 percent per year over the period from 2010 to 2015, below the pre-crisis average of 2.4 percent from 2003 to 2008. This slower growth performance has been accompanied by relatively low inflation rates—persistently below the objectives of the monetary policy authorities in the United States, Europe and Japan.\n\nAs I see it, there are many causes for these persistent shortfalls in growth, and they vary across regions and countries. Let me focus on the reasons for the United States in the post crisis period.\n\nGrowth has been weaker than expected for many reasons. The financial crisis was a searing experience that damaged household and business confidence in a profound way—with a more lasting effect than the typical economic downturn. The housing bust created both a large housing supply overhang and a large number of households that were underwater on their mortgages. Households needed to repair their balance sheets and bring down their debt service burdens to more manageable levels. Higher levels of unemployment further depressed demand.\n\nCredit availability contracted. The tightening of credit standards occurred quite broadly—in housing credit, consumer credit cards and business lending. Some of the credit supply restrictions were imposed by banks that needed to repair their balance sheets, deleveraging by building up capital and working down their bad assets.\n\nFiscal outlays were not high enough to compensate for the contractionary impulse from these first three sources. The crisis led to a significant deterioration in the U.S. federal budget deficit and put pressure on state and local budgets. After the federal budget deficit reached around 10 percent of GDP at the peak, fiscal consolidation occurred at the federal level, as well as at state and local levels, restraining economic activity instead of supporting growth.\n\nProductivity growth has also been quite low. In the period before the crisis (2003 to 2008), U.S. nonfarm productivity growth averaged 2 percent per year. Since 2010, productivity has been closer to 1 percent. While some of this decline can be explained by lower capital spending, the decline is difficult to fully explain.\n\nAnother explanation some have offered is that there is a measurement problem—we are understating output growth and overstating price inflation. This type of issue, long flagged as a hedonic adjustment, seems most credible in particular market segments, such as in healthcare. Alan Blinder has posed this question: Would you rather have 1970 healthcare at 1970 prices or 2016 healthcare at 2016 prices? Based on the measurement of prices, 1970 healthcare is a much better deal. Yet, when offered this choice, almost all choose 2016 healthcare. Why? The reason is that people highly value the advances in healthcare technology, such as in cardiac care, or in the procedures that are practical today, such as hip and knee replacement, that simply weren’t available 50 years ago.\n\nU.S. economic performance has also been held back by developments in the rest of the world. Growth outside of the United States has slowed. In the euro area, comparing the period from 2003 to 2008 to the period from 2010 to 2015, annual real GDP growth slowed from 1.9 percent to 0.8 percent. Japanese growth has remained muted over these periods at 0.1 percent and 1.0 percent respectively. In China, reported growth rates over these two periods slowed from 11.3 percent to 8.3 percent. These developments, along with policy and risk events that have increased demand for U.S. assets, have contributed to significant U.S. dollar appreciation over the last two years. This dollar strength has created competitive challenges for U.S. exporters, especially in manufacturing, and has caused the trade sector to be a drag on U.S. economic activity.\n\nLooking forward, despite the fact that U.S. economic growth has been disappointing, we have actually made considerable progress toward our monetary policy objectives. The United States is quite close to its employment and inflation objectives. On employment, there still seems to be a bit of slack in the U.S. labor market. But, that margin has shrunk greatly over the past few years. Payroll gains have been at least as robust as anticipated.\n\nOn inflation, we are still somewhat below our 2 percent objective. But, even here, I think there has been progress. Despite the strengthening of the dollar and the decline in energy prices, core PCE inflation has been quite stable over the past year—currently running at around 1.6 percent. That is not a tremendous difference from our 2 percent objective.\n\nSo why has the United States done a bit better compared to Europe and Japan in terms of achieving our monetary policy objectives. I think there are a number of contributing factors.\n\nFirst, U.S. household balance sheet repair occurred relatively quickly. This is in part because the housing foreclosure process wiped out many mortgage debts. Part was accomplished by a long period of very slow household debt growth. And part was accomplished by the sharp fall in interest rates that helped cut debt servicing costs.\n\nSecond, in the U.S., the banking system was recapitalized and deleveraging occurred quite quickly following the financial crisis. Capital from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, was put into the large banks and soon many of them replaced this TARP capital by raising new equity. The SCAP stress test in 2009, and the annual CCAR stress tests that followed, worked to constrain the rate of bank capital distributions and, thereby, helped to build up bank capital ratios. And, U.S. banks worked hard to clean up their balance sheets. Poor assets were managed down or run off, and underwriting standards were tightened.\n\nThird, the Federal Reserve was particularly aggressive early on in its pursuit of monetary policy accommodation in order to keep inflation expectations well-anchored. This is a necessary condition, in my view, to maintain the efficacy of monetary policy. If inflation expectations were to get unmoored to the downside, then it becomes more difficult to pursue a stimulative monetary policy.\n\nCould things have been done differently in the U.S. in such a way that would have led to better outcomes? Absolutely. With the benefit of hindsight, we could have and should have been even more aggressive on the monetary policy side. While we made progress with some of the innovations on monetary policy that we eventually introduced—such as the open-ended purchase of $85 billion of Treasury and MBS securities per month—it would have been better if we had done this sooner.\n\nThere is a lot as well that is outside the Fed’s purview that could have been done to make the U.S. economy perform better. This includes tax reform, job retraining programs and infrastructure investment.\n\nSo, what can we do to bolster global growth in the future? The first is to undertake the necessary structural reforms to make our economies more efficient. Productivity growth is not preordained. The steps we take as countries to eliminate and lessen bottlenecks and improve our human and physical capital are important. The second is to ensure that our financial systems are well-functioning. Tremendous progress has been made globally in implementing higher capital and liquidity standards post-crisis. But we still see some important banking systems impaired by bad loans, low profitability and inadequate capital.\n\nThe population aging in the developed world does imply that, purely from the productive factor side, less of the global growth contribution is likely to come from Japan, Europe and the United States. And economies like China are likely to continue to slow as their per capita income increases and they make the transition from investment-to consumption-led growth. But this doesn’t imply a bad outcome. There are many other countries with tremendous potential for growth in areas such as Africa, Asia, and South America. Take, for example, the surge in growth that we are seeing out of India.\n\nI am an optimist. To a large degree we do control our destiny. It is up to us to seize those opportunities.\n\n1Linda Goldberg, Jonathan McCarthy and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks."

        "title": "Opening Remarks at the Economic Press Briefing on the U.S. Economy in a Snapshot",
        "content": "Welcome to our Economic Press Briefing.  Today we are going to introduce you to a data product that we have been making available to the public, U.S. Economy in a Snapshot.  My role is to put this product in the broader context of the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) communication strategy about the economy and policy.  My colleague Robert Rich will then walk you through the structure of the product and discuss excerpts from the May release.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nConventional U.S. monetary policy is conducted by targeting the level of the federal funds rate—an overnight interest rate on bank reserves.  Few participants in our economy have any direct interaction with this interest rate.  How, then, is controlling this interest rate such an important part of setting monetary policy and steering an 18 trillion dollar economy toward the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate objectives of maximum sustainable employment and price stability?\n\nThis is the remarkable aspect of monetary policy.  Just as a pebble dropped into a lake disturbs the water not just at the point of impact but ripples outward far from the origin, changes in the federal funds rate influence the prices of financial assets more broadly and this, in turn, affects the broader economy.  An important insight of modern monetary theory is that this transmission of monetary policy to the broader economy through its many channels works best when the central bank is transparent about its goals, policy strategy and approach to implementing its strategy.  In this case, market participants and households both understand and can anticipate actions by the central bank.  By doing so, the transmission channels of monetary policy are enhanced.  This places considerable importance on effective central bank communication.\n\nRecognizing this, the FOMC has undertaken many initiatives over the years to improve its communications with the public.  These include providing clarification in terms of the goals of monetary policy, discussions of the FOMC’s broad policy strategy, as well as FOMC participants’ ongoing explanations of their views on monetary policy.  As part of this effort, I provide a comprehensive update on my outlook for the economy and monetary policy several times during the year.  Once a year we publish our staff’s judgmental economic forecast.  We have also provided in the Liberty Street Economics blog discussions of an internal staff model-based economic forecast.  In addition, we now regularly release our real-time forecast of “current quarter” real GDP growth.  All of these help the public to understand our assessment of economic conditions through the lenses of these different types of forecasts.\n\nWhen asked about the trajectory for the monetary policy stance, I always point out that it is data dependent.  The FOMC calibrates the stance of monetary policy to best achieve our twin objectives of price stability and maximum sustainable employment, taking into account our forecast for how the economy is evolving.  This forecast reflects the ongoing flow of the data.  Data releases that are close to our expectations have little additional impact on the forecast, while data releases that deviate significantly from our expectations can lead to more significant revisions of the forecast.  It is, therefore, important for market participants and households to be able to follow the data along with the FOMC and to understand how we are likely to interpret and react to incoming data.\n\nWhile market analysts readily have access to economic and financial data, this access is not widely available to everyone.  To help fill this information gap, for the past year we have been making available on our website a monthly publication called U.S. Economy in a Snapshot.  This publication contains a set of key data charts as well as commentary by our staff economists.  The purpose is to provide interested readers easy access to clear and concise presentations of important economic information.  The associated commentary provides some pertinent observations one might draw from the data.\n\nOur goal is to provide information that helps households and businesses follow the data along with the Fed.  If people know more about how the economy is performing and how that is likely to influence our actions, this should make it easier for us to achieve our twin objectives. \n\nI will now turn it over to Rob to discuss the Snapshot in greater detail.\n\n1 Jonathan McCarthy, Paolo Pesenti, Robert Rich and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks."

        "title": "Panel Remarks at the 7th High-Level Conference on the International Monetary System",
        "content": "It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to participate in this panel. To me, the question posed for discussion seems relatively straightforward: Will more reserve currencies strengthen the international monetary system?  My answer can be summed up in one word: “yes.”  I believe that a reserve currency—or at least an enduring and important one—has to have a number of demonstrated attributes.  These include that the reserve currency country has a strong and credible institutional structure; that its policymakers follow a sustainable fiscal regime as well as a monetary policy that keeps inflation low and stable over time; and that the currency is readily convertible and serves as a stable store of value.  These are good attributes for any country—reserve currency or not. The greater the number of countries that have such attributes, the more stable and sound the global financial system is likely to be.  Also, such a regime is desirable because it provides an environment that should encourage international trade and an efficient allocation of resources, which, in turn should lift productivity and living standards.\n\nAs always, what I have to say today reflects my own view and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nAlthough a reserve currency can formally be defined as any currency that is part of a foreign country’s foreign exchange reserve holdings, I do not think this is what we have in mind when we talk about a reserve currency.\n\nWhile the status of being a reserve currency can be conferred, the stature of being a reserve currency must be earned.  As I see it, a successful reserve currency needs to satisfy a number of conditions.  First, the currency needs to be fully convertible—with no risk of restrictions that could limit the ability to convert such holdings into cash denominated in the investors’ domestic currency.  Second, the reserve currency country needs to have deep, liquid and transparent capital markets so that the sovereign debt instruments and other high-quality debt obligations can be bought and sold at narrow bid-ask spreads and easily converted to and from cash.  Third, the assets in the country must be governed by a well-understood, consistent and enforceable legal regime.  This is to ensure that investors’ rights will be well protected, regardless of short-term political developments or changes in the governing regime.  Fourth, the financial system in the country must be strong and stable to ensure that liquidity will be available even during times of stress.  Fifth, the risk of default on the country’s sovereign debt must be viewed as negligible, to ensure both that the currency is a stable store of value and that continuous, deep liquid domestic markets will be available regardless of the economic circumstances.  Sixth, the country must have a credible central bank that is insulated from political interference and committed to keeping inflation low and stable—a necessary condition for a reserve currency to be a reliable store of value.\n\nI think that the U.S. dollar satisfies these general criteria.  That is why over 60 percent of foreign exchange reserve holdings are denominated in dollars—a share that has been quite stable in recent years.  The dollar’s share has remained steady despite the presence of a number of currencies that broadly satisfy the attributes that I have just discussed.\n\nBut should the U.S. be concerned if more countries satisfy the attributes needed to be successful reserve currencies?  Would it be problematic for the United States if the U.S. dollar share of foreign exchange holdings slipped over time because of progress made elsewhere?\n\nI think the answer to both of these questions is “no.”  It would seem positive to me if a decline in the U.S. market share reflected the following developments: a greater number of stable and effective central banks and fiscal authorities, more investors who are reassured about countries’ institutional arrangements and financial stability, and deeper and more liquid capital markets outside the United States.  These attributes are a prerequisite for a vibrant international financial system and are supportive to global trade.  A regime with many reserve currencies would imply a well-governed international economy.  This should facilitate global investment, resulting in rising productivity growth and improving standards of living.  In other words, I don’t see this as a zero-sum game.  If other countries’ currencies emerge to gain stature as reserve currencies, it is not obvious to me that the United States loses.  This is assuming, of course, that the emergence of alternatives is being driven by their progress, rather than by the U.S. doing a poorer job in satisfying the attributes that I discussed earlier.\n\nHaving more countries achieve the stature of having a reserve currency may also be desirable for other reasons.  First, with more reserve currencies available, portfolio diversification opportunities are enhanced. This is desirable because, all else equal, it would allow investors to move further out on the risk/return frontier.  Second, more currencies are likely to be close substitutes, which could dampen currency volatility.  With many viable reserve currencies available, no particular one would necessarily have to bear the bulk of any adjustment.\n\nThe dollar’s dominant reserve currency status has sometimes been referred to as the United States’ “exorbitant privilege,” implying that the U.S. benefits extraordinarily from this privileged status.  I’d argue that the situation is much more nuanced.  Yes, this status does allow the U.S. to benefit from seigniorage.  More than half of all U.S. currency outstanding is held abroad.  But, there are also costs of being the dominant reserve currency.  For example, this can lead to shifts in the valuation of the dollar that are due primarily to developments abroad that affect risk appetites and international capital flows.  In such cases, the dollar’s valuation can be pushed to levels inconsistent with U.S. economic fundamentals.\n\nFor the United States, I believe that the most important goal must be to keep our own house in order.  If we do this, then I expect that the U.S. dollar will earn the right to remain the most important reserve currency in the world.\n\nThe United States has a number of advantages in sustaining the dominant reserve currency status of the U.S. dollar.  First, there is a first-mover advantage.  As the leading reserve currency in the world, there is no strong incentive for countries to move to other currencies as long as the dollar continues to have the attributes I discussed earlier.  The history of reserve currency usage is characterized by considerable inertia.  The U.S. dollar emerged as the leading reserve currency quite a bit after it became the world’s largest economy.  Typically, the loss of dominant reserve currency status requires either substantial economic decline or political instability that motivates foreign counterparties to shift to a new reserve currency. Second, the U.S. has the deepest and most liquid capital markets in the world.  This is important in making U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities attractive holdings as part of countries’ foreign exchange reserve portfolios.  Third, the U.S. has an independent central bank—the Federal Reserve—which has been successful in keeping inflation low and stable.  As a result, the dollar has been a reliable store of value in recent years.\n\nAnother point in the United States’ favor is the considerable steps taken to shore up areas of weakness revealed by the financial crisis.  In particular, the safety and soundness of our financial system has been enhanced. Capital and liquidity requirements for U.S. banks have been raised significantly.  Stress tests have been imposed to enhance the viability of large systemic institutions even in very adverse economic and financial environments.  Reforms have been enacted to facilitate the recovery and resolution of troubled institutions.  This includes living will requirements for the major systemically-important financial institutions, and the development of an improved resolution regime to ensure that institutions that do get into difficulty can be resolved without disrupting the stability of the financial system.\n\nIn conclusion, I welcome other countries’ progress toward achieving the preconditions necessary for their currencies to attain the stature of a reserve currency.  However, we should not act as if this is sufficient to achieve a well-functioning global financial system.  In particular, the current regime is inefficient in a number of important ways.  Countries have found it necessary to self-insure against the risk of large capital flow reversals.  This has led to a very sharp rise in aggregate foreign exchange reserve holdings.  This form of self-insurance is very expensive—especially when the return on the foreign exchange reserve portfolio is less than the cost of the domestic liabilities that fund these holdings.  As I have said in the past, I encourage more work to examine whether there are other more efficient regimes that, for example, would economize on required foreign exchange reserve buffers.  In this regard, I think expanding the capacity of the IMF’s resources and working to further de-stigmatize drawing on the IMF’s liquidity facilities could be worthwhile steps in this direction.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.\n\n1 Linda Goldberg and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks."

        "title": "Market and Funding Liquidity: An Overview",
        "content": "It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to participate in the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s 21st Annual Financial Markets Conference. This year’s topic, focusing on the connection between liquidity and financial stability, is an excellent one. As the first speaker, I thought it would be useful to lay out what I see as some of the key issues. I may raise more questions than provide answers, but, hopefully, my remarks will help to stimulate our discussion and debate over the next two days.\n\nAs I see it, in the context of our financial system there are two distinct types of liquidity. The first is what is typically referred to as market liquidity. I would define market liquidity as the cost—both in expense and time—of buying or selling an asset for cash. Market liquidity reflects a number of factors, including any direct transaction expense, such as brokerage costs; the price the transaction is executed at relative to the midpoint of the bid-ask spread; how much, if at all, the transaction moves the market price; and the immediacy or speediness with which the transaction can be completed.\n\nWith respect to market liquidity, there are a number of important open questions. Has market liquidity declined for some asset classes? If so, what are the causes? In particular, has the increase in the regulatory requirements imposed on systemically-important securities dealers adversely impacted market liquidity? If this is the case, are there adjustments that could be made that might improve market liquidity without impairing financial stability?\n\nThe second important type of liquidity is funding liquidity. By funding liquidity, I mean the ability of a financial entity to raise cash by borrowing on either an unsecured or a secured basis. Although market and funding liquidity are often treated as distinct, they can be closely related. This is especially the case during a financial crisis. If funding liquidity declines because of market stress, for example, this may cause intermediaries to become less willing to provide market liquidity. Declines in market liquidity, in turn, may further impair funding liquidity, creating a negative feedback dynamic.\n\nCapital and liquidity requirements play a role in preventing such a self-reinforcing negative dynamic. The central bank may also have an important role to play as the lender-of-last-resort. When and how the central bank intervenes―and what the appropriate preconditions should be to maintain market discipline and mitigate moral hazard―are important open questions.\n\nAs always what I have to say today represents my own views and not necessarily the views of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nTurning first to the issue of market liquidity, the evidence that market liquidity has diminished is mixed. Some market liquidity metrics have not changed much in recent years. For the U.S. Treasury market, quoted bid-ask spreads in the inter-dealer market have remained stable since 2010 at their pre-crisis levels (Exhibit 1). And, order book depth, while lower now than in 2012 and 2013, does not appear low by historical standards (Exhibit 2).2 For the corporate bond market, some evidence even suggests improving market liquidity. For example, excluding the financial crisis period, the realized bid-ask spread calculated from TRACE data has been trending down since the early 2000s (Exhibit 3).3\n\nBut these metrics don’t tell the whole story. In particular, we have significant data gaps that make it difficult to comprehensively measure market liquidity. For example, in the U.S. Treasury market we have poor visibility into dealer-to-customer transactions. In this market segment, business is conducted bilaterally on an over-the-counter (OTC) basis—typically by phone or through electronic trading platforms like Tradeweb and Bloomberg that are based on the traditional request-for-quote model. The U.S. Treasury has issued a detailed request for information seeking public comment on the many factors that are affecting the structure and liquidity of the U.S. Treasury market, and is seeking comments on the relevant data gaps.4 This is an important step that will help clarify what further work is needed in this area.\n\nEven in the corporate bond market where we have detailed TRACE transaction data, this still tells an incomplete story. TRACE data show what trades have taken place, not what trades have potentially been foregone because of any possible diminution of market liquidity. Gaining a better understanding of this phenomenon is being actively researched by my staff.\n\nIn contrast to the market liquidity metrics such as bid-ask spreads, indirect evidence on market liquidity suggests that there has been a decline. Asset managers report that large blocks of securities are now harder to buy and sell without generating significant movements in prices. Also, average trade sizes have decreased (Exhibit 4) and there is evidence of a growing bifurcation in the corporate bond market, with greater activity and liquidity in those bonds that were issued more recently, larger in size or brought to market by larger issuers.\n\nAlso, capital and liquidity requirements for the largest securities dealers—which have been raised significantly since the financial crisis—might have adversely impacted market liquidity. These regulatory changes likely have affected the profitability of dealer intermediation activities and consequently the provision of market liquidity.\n\nFor the Treasury market, the most important change in regulatory requirements appears to be the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR). The SLR limits the leverage of dealer balance sheets. In the SLR, all assets are treated the same in terms of required regulatory capital. Consequently, the SLR is much tougher on low-risk assets as compared to the risk-based capital measures that it complements. This makes the economics of repo-financing much less attractive. Not surprisingly, we observe significant declines in the quantity of repo financing by dealers (Exhibit 5).\n\nFor the corporate bond market, the most relevant regulatory changes appear to be the increase in the Basel risk-weighted capital ratio, the Comprehensive Capital and Analysis Review (CCAR) stress tests and the Volcker Rule—which prohibits proprietary trading for a number of asset classes such as corporate bonds, albeit not U.S. Treasuries. We do observe significant declines in recent years in securities dealers’ holdings of corporate bonds (Exhibit 6).\n\nIt would be surprising if these declines in repo and corporate bond holdings did not have some consequence for market liquidity. However, we do not observe marked declines in dealer holdings of Treasuries, even as overall dealer assets have stagnated (Exhibit 7). The stagnation in dealer assets might indicate that inventory risk has shifted from dealers to asset managers and other buy-side participants, reflecting a shift in market-making from a “principal” to an “agency” model.\n\nWhile increases in regulatory requirements have undoubtedly played a role, I think that other non-regulatory factors are also important. Liquidity provision is affected by changes in market structure, how trades are executed, and by competition from those operating outside of the regulatory boundaries that have been established for systemically-important financial institutions. Similarly, the demand for liquidity is also evolving with the growth of large asset managers, mutual funds, exchange traded funds (ETFs) and principal trading firms (PTFs)—which are sometimes referred to as high-frequency trading firms. In the U.S. Treasury market, for example, high-frequency trading firms have seized a large proportion of the inter-dealer market in recent years (Exhibit 8). In the credit market, a rapidly rising share of corporate bonds outstanding is now held by mutual funds (Exhibit 9). Because mutual funds are not natural providers of intraday liquidity,5 their rapid growth may have contributed to the decline in secondary market trading activity. Fixed-income market liquidity may also be declining for cyclical reasons. Dealer inventories have historically been sensitive to changes in the size of credit risk-premia and term-premia (Exhibit 10). Finally, the effects of unconventional monetary policy on rate expectations and corporate bond issuance may also be affecting market liquidity. This is an area in need of further study.\n\nTo reiterate, the evidence that market liquidity has diminished is mixed. But even if one agrees with the position that market liquidity has diminished, concluding that tougher regulatory requirements are the most important factor would be premature at this stage. The available evidence and common sense suggest that the changes in the regulatory regime are likely important, but we need to do considerably more work before we reach a definitive conclusion on their relative contribution.\n\nFurthermore, even if additional evidence supported the conclusion that market liquidity has declined due to the increase in the regulatory burden on the major securities firms, this decline would still need to be weighed against the benefits of a more resilient and robust financial system. During the last cycle, market liquidity was plentiful prior to the financial crisis. But, as the financial system became stressed and several large systemic firms teetered on the brink of failure, market liquidity quickly dried up. A somewhat higher cost for the provision of market liquidity during the more benign stages of a financial cycle might be worthwhile if it were accompanied by less volatility and stress when the cycle inevitably turned down. In fact, even if market liquidity costs are now going to be higher on average, this might be a small price to pay for a much more stable financial sector.\n\nAlso, it is important to recognize that market liquidity conditions a few years from now may be very different from the situation today. If the cost of providing liquidity services has increased, this creates strong incentives for innovators to find better ways to match buyers and sellers.\n\nIn my view, this innovative response is already underway. For example, in both the Treasury and corporate bond markets, firms are being established to more efficiently match buyers and sellers of less liquid bonds in order to reduce search costs and the need to carry inventory. Furthermore, execution algorithms have been developed that divide large trades into smaller sizes, thus reducing the costs of moving large blocks of securities. Market liquidity conditions could very well improve over time as innovation occurs in response to this new regime.\n\nLet me now turn to the topic of funding liquidity. I think this issue deserves as much attention as market liquidity. After all, during the financial crisis the demise of several major financial institutions resulted from their inability to finance their long-dated illiquid assets. The deterioration in funding liquidity also increased the degree of systemic stress as firms were forced to sell assets, which depressed their prices, undermining the solvency of firms throughout the financial system.\n\nAs I noted earlier, while funding liquidity can be considered as its own distinct subject, it does have a direct link back to market liquidity. If firms that trade and invest in securities cannot obtain funding liquidity, this will likely lead to less transactions volume, thinner markets and less overall market liquidity. It is also likely to lead to less pricing efficiency resulting in wider and more persistent disparities in the prices of similar assets. Without access to funding, leveraged players, such as hedge funds, will find it more difficult to react to transient dislocations in market prices by engaging in arbitrage—that is, buying the cheaper and selling the more expensive asset. Without a reliable source of short-term funding, market functioning can become impaired, which can further disrupt funding and market liquidity.\n\nThis can be seen by looking at the relationship between the volume of dealer-funded repo backed by U.S. Treasury securities versus the size of Treasury bid-ask spreads (Exhibit 11).6 During times of financial crisis—such as in 2008—sharp deleveraging of dealers’ repo books coincides with an increase in Treasury bid-ask spreads. However, during non-crisis periods, this correlation is quite low. This relationship between funding and market liquidity is also evident when we examine the relationship between the dispersion of Treasury yields relative to a fitted Treasury yield curve and Treasury bid-ask spreads (Exhibit 12). Large dispersions of Treasury yields from what is implied by a fitted yield curve may indicate funding liquidity strains, as market participants find it more difficult to arbitrage relative price distortions.7 Again, we see a strong correlation between the sizes of the yield curve errors and of bid-ask spreads during a financial crisis, but not during non-crisis periods.\n\nThe drop in the availability of dealer-funded repo financing also appears to have led to less efficient arbitrage between closely related asset pairs, such as on-the-run and off-the run Treasuries, corporate bonds and credit default swaps, and Treasuries versus interest rate swaps. The price differences or yield spreads between the more capital intensive and less capital intensive assets have widened.\n\nFor example, we can see this in the difference between the fixed-rate paid on a 10-year interest rate swap and the secondary market yield on a 10-year Treasury note (Exhibit 13). Whereas historically this spread has been positive—reflecting the fact that an interest rate swap has more credit risk than a Treasury security—the spread has been negative since September 2015. Market participants suggest that this shift has occurred because the higher capital requirements have made it unattractive for dealers to arbitrage away this dislocation. Similarly, dealers apparently are unwilling to provide the funding and the balance sheet capacity necessary for their leveraged clients to arbitrage away this dislocation. The degree to which this shift in the yield spread between Treasury and interest rate swap yields is due to the differential capital requirements imposed on cash versus derivative instruments warrants more investigation.\n\nJust as market and funding liquidity are interlinked, so are funding liquidity and capital requirements. All else equal, stronger capital requirements reduce firms’ vulnerability to runs. This suggests that funding liquidity risk can be addressed in many different ways. First, capital requirements can be bolstered to reduce the risk that a firm will become insolvent in particularly bad states of the world. Second, improved reporting and transparency can reduce the degree of uncertainty about whether a firm is solvent, thus reducing the risk that investors might wrongly perceive that a firm is insolvent, when, in fact, it still has adequate capital. Third, liquidity requirements can be increased to reduce the risk that the firm will have to engage in a fire sale of assets that might deplete its capital. Also, a liquidity buffer gives the firm’s management time to respond to bad events without having to resort immediately to selling assets. Fourth, a lender-of-last-resort can provide a liquidity backstop that makes funding liquidity more resilient. Consider the case when a counterparty is uncertain about how other potential lenders view a firm’s solvency. If there is no lender-of-last-resort backstop, this may cause firms to be unwilling to lend, not because they perceive the counterparty as insolvent, but, instead, because they are worried about what others think. That is, I may be unwilling to lend to you, not because I perceive you as insolvent, but because I am uncertain about how others view your solvency. If I do lend and others don’t share my view, will I be able to get my money back? With a lender-of-last-resort added to the picture, I no longer need to know what others think. As long as the lender-of-last-resort is available, if I am correct in my assessment that the firm is solvent, then I can be assured that I will be paid back.\n\nThis issue was particularly relevant during the financial crisis when counterparties even pulled back from firms that were widely viewed as solvent. The Federal Reserve stepped in and created funding backstops for a wide array of assets, such as commercial paper and asset-backed securities. This bolstered the confidence of counterparties in one another and restored market and funding liquidity. Of course, this type of lending is only feasible to an institution that is deemed to be solvent with sufficient collateral available to pledge to the lender-of-last-resort so that it can safely secure its loan.\n\nIn practice, all of these methods are in place to address funding liquidity risk. Capital requirements have been increased; there is much better reporting about how firms will do under significant stress tests; liquidity requirements—such as the liquidity coverage ratio—provide a buffer that allows management more time to respond to problems; and, if necessary, the central bank can act as the lender-of-last-resort to support market confidence and funding liquidity.\n\nSo, should more be done to support funding liquidity? In my view, an important issue is to identify and address gaps in the lender-of-last-resort function. In the U.S., some significant gaps remain. For example, the Federal Reserve has a very limited ability to provide funding to a securities firm, even on a fully collateralized basis. The Discount Window is only available to depository institutions, and Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act severely constrains the ability of a depository institution to pass Discount Window funding along to its securities affiliate. Although the Federal Reserve may be able lend to a securities affiliate under its emergency lending authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, this is not a standing facility—it can only be established if “unusual and exigent” circumstances exist and the program or facility must have broad-based eligibility, among other requirements.8\n\nIn the U.S., given the restrictions on central bank lending, if a securities firm were to lose access to funding the remaining options available would be finding a means of replenishing the firm’s capital, selling assets, or selling all or part of the securities firm’s operations. While this might be manageable in the case of a firm-specific idiosyncratic shock, it might prove more difficult if a common shock was broadly hitting the securities industry. In this circumstance, the failure of one firm could increase the stress on other firms that were facing similar difficulties. If all of the requirements for Section 13(3) are met, the central bank could provide liquidity support. However, since this is not a certainty, it is worth considering possible alternatives. Now that all major securities firms in the U.S. are part of bank holding companies and are subject to enhanced prudential standards as well as capital and liquidity stress tests, providing these firms with access to the Discount Window might be worth exploring. To me, this is a more reasonable proposition now than it was prior to the crisis when the major dealers weren’t subject to those safeguards.\n\nMore generally, I am happy to report that the Committee on the Global Financial System—one of the Bank for International Settlements’ central bank groups—is engaged in a project to determine what lender-of-last-resort gaps currently exist, focusing, in particular, on those that may create vulnerability in terms of financial stability. One area that I anticipate will receive considerable attention is whether there are any gaps with respect to the activities of globally systemic firms that operate on a cross-border basis.\n\nAnother issue that still needs greater attention is the appropriate role for the home- versus host-country supervisor. The regulatory and supervisory responses for large, systemically-important firms that operate on a cross-border basis need to be closely coordinated, especially during times of stress. In particular, expectations about who will be the lender-of-last-resort need to be well understood in both the home and host countries.\n\nWe have made considerable progress in recent years in enhancing the safety and soundness of the U.S. financial system. But there is more that we need to do. In particular, we need to study and understand how market liquidity and funding liquidity conditions are changing and what factors are driving that evolution. Conferences like this one go a long way in that regard. They serve as an important forum for discussing ideas and improving our knowledge and understanding. This will provide a solid foundation for any policy actions.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n1 Tobias Adrian, Nina Boyarchenko, Michael Fleming, Catherine Kung, Ernst Schaumburg, Joseph Tracy, Erik Vogt and Nathaniel Wuerffel assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\n2 See Adrian, Fleming, Stackman, Vogt (2015) Has U.S. Treasury Market Liquidity Deteriorated?, Liberty Street Economics Blog, August 17, for further analysis of Treasury market liquidity.\n\n3 See Adrian, Fleming, Vogt, Wojtowicz (2016) Corporate Bond Market Liquidity Redux: More Price-Based Evidence, Liberty Street Economics Blog, February 9, for further analysis of corporate bond market liquidity.\n\n4 See U.S. Department of Treasury, Notice Seeking Public Comment on the Evolution of the Treasury Market Structure, January 2016.\n\n5 Mizrach, B.

        "title": "Opening Remarks at the Transatlantic Economy: Convergence or Divergence Conference",
        "content": "It is my pleasure to welcome you to today’s conference.  Over the past decade, the New York Fed has been working together with the European Commission and the Centre for Economic Policy Research in sponsoring a number of conferences on interdependencies and policy challenges on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.  Today, as in the past, we have a great program with many distinguished speakers from academia, and the private and public sectors.  In particular, I would highlight the keynote speech following lunch by Pierre Moscovici, European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs.\n\nAs the two largest economies in the world, the United States and the European Union have a shared stake in the vitality of the global economy. Without growth in both our regions, the global economy will not prosper and we will not be able to provide the conditions to enable our citizens to fulfill their aspirations.  Both the United States and Europe suffered large social and economic costs from the financial crisis and the deep recession that followed.  We continue to take steps to minimize the risks that we will ever find ourselves in that situation again.  In many respects, the United States and Europe face similar challenges and have similar goals.\n\nToday I want to focus on some of the challenges.\n\nOn the regulatory side, there is considerable good news.  In particular, substantial progress has been made in strengthening the global banking system. Capital and liquidity standards for internationally active banks have been raised significantly.  This should reduce the risk of failure for these banks. Also, the financial system is being made more resilient and robust.  For example, the global set of principles for financial market infrastructures has been updated and strengthened. \n\nMoreover, some steps have been taken to better deal with the failure of systemically important financial firms on a cross-border basis.  Key attributes for resolution regimes have been promulgated by the Financial Stability Board.  Efforts are underway to improve how we can work together in a coordinated way on a global basis. \n\nBut more needs to be done.  The impediments to an orderly cross-border resolution still need to be fully identified and dismantled.  This is necessary to solve the so-called “too big to fail” problem. Also, cross-border regulatory cooperation needs to be further enhanced.  This includes greater exchange of confidential supervisory information so that national regulators can be fully informed about the conditions of the banks that operate within their borders.  It also requires efforts to ensure a level playing field across jurisdictions so that the focus is on promoting safety and soundness rather than on trying to protect, favor, or shield national champions.\n\nOn the macroeconomic side, the news for the United States is mostly favorable. Labor market conditions have significantly improved over the past few years and unemployment is now around 5 percent.  The household sector is much less leveraged, the housing sector is recovering, the banking system is much healthier, and the corporate sector is highly profitable, even as business fixed investment spending remains quite weak.  Although inflation has fallen short of our objective, I am confident that inflation will return to our 2 percent objective over the next few years as the labor market tightens further and the transitory factors that have held inflation down dissipate.  After years at the effective lower bound for short-term interest rates, economic conditions have finally warranted the start of U.S. monetary policy normalization.  But these monetary policy adjustments are likely to be gradual and cautious, as we continue to face significant uncertainties and the headwinds to growth from the financial crisis have not fully abated.\n\nFor Europe, the economic outlook has started to improve.  The European Union is experiencing a cyclical recovery and the unemployment rate has been steadily declining over the past two years.  The end of fiscal tightening appears to be a key factor in this recovery.  Risks of low inflation, however, remain a concern for the European Central Bank and have motivated their aggressive use of unconventional monetary policy instruments.\n\nToday’s conference touches on a range of interesting questions concerning both regions:  \n\nI would like to thank the participants for addressing these and other questions during today’s three panels, and I look forward to insightful discussion over the course of the day.\n\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce the European Union Ambassador to the United States, His Excellency David O’Sullivan.   The ambassador is extraordinarily well-versed to speak on the issues of interdependence and the policy challenges we face.   Welcome, Ambassador O’ Sullivan."

        "content": "Good morning. I am very pleased to speak at the 6th Annual Community Development Conference.  I would like to give a special thanks to the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development for organizing this conference about issues of importance to the community development industry and to the future of New York City.\n\nAt the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, we develop a wide variety of research and data products to gain a deeper understanding of regional economic conditions.  We track the health of household balance sheets at the state and local level using data from the New York Fed’s Consumer Credit Panel.  We also conduct an annual poll of small businesses to understand their credit needs and credit availability.  My meeting with you today is part of our continuing efforts to understand what is going on at the grassroots level of our economy and to share insights from the New York Fed.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has dual objectives, set by Congress, with respect to monetary policy—maximum sustainable employment and price stability.  I would like to focus my remarks today on the first of these objectives. As always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s employment objective can be viewed both narrowly and broadly. Narrowly, we focus on the degree of slack or tightness in the labor market.  This leads to discussion of many measures of the labor market such as the unemployment rate, the participation rate and the growth of wages. Broadly, the economy’s potential growth rate depends on effectively investing in and taking advantage of all of the resources in the economy—in particular, we need to achieve the full potential of the human capital of all Americans. For the United States to reach its maximum economic potential, all Americans must have the opportunity to reach their potential.\n\nThe United States has always prided itself on being “the land of opportunity.” Parents hope that their children can achieve more than they did. Over the course of our history, immigrants have journeyed to America in search of a better life, a chance to live the “American Dream.”\n\nWhat defines the American Dream? President Reagan thought that one element of the American dream is “the opportunity to grow, create wealth, and build a better life for those who follow,” while President Obama has described it as follows: “A child’s course in life should be determined not by the zip code she’s born in, but by the strength of her work ethic and the scope of her dreams.”  One’s destination in life should not depend on where the journey begins.\n\nEqual opportunity does not imply equal outcomes—some people may work harder, be more fortunate in terms of their disposition and endowments, or just be luckier in how their lives evolve.  But it does require that income mobility—in particular, upward mobility—be widely evident and remain part of the fabric of the nation.  \n\nIt is important to keep in mind the distinction between income mobility and income inequality. Income mobility is a dynamic concept—the degree to which individuals or families can move up or down in the income distribution over time.  Income inequality is a static concept—how unequal are individual or family incomes at a particular point in time.\n\nRecognizing that rising income inequality in the United States is an important issue, my focus today will be mainly on income mobility.  I don’t think the issue of income mobility receives the attention it deserves.  It is a foundational element for a well-functioning democratic society and provides evidence about the ability of an economy to provide opportunities for its citizens.\n\nA standard approach to measuring income mobility is to compare where a child is in the income distribution relative to where the parents were in the income distribution. A striking result is that intergenerational income mobility in the U.S.—a child’s chances of moving up in the income distribution relative to her parents—has remained stable over the past half century. However, because of the increase in income inequality, the consequences of being born to low-versus high-income parents are larger today than in the past.  One explanation for the lack of a correlation between income inequality and income mobility in the U.S. is that income inequality is strongly influenced by the top one percent of the income distribution, but there is little correlation between income mobility and this top income percentile.2\n\nWhile income mobility in the United States has been relatively unchanged, it remains well below several other nations. According to Stanford economist Raj Chetty, the probability of moving from the bottom quintile to the top quintile is 7.5 percent in the United States, as compared to 11.7 percent in Denmark and 13.5 percent in Canada—two countries with relatively high levels of intergenerational mobility.3 So effectively the chance of achieving the American Dream is not the highest for children born in America.\n\nImportantly, Chetty finds even more significant variation in intergenerational mobility across different metro and rural areas within the United States.4  While some regions in the U.S. match the highest mobility levels among developed countries, others persistently offer less mobility than in most other developed countries. Relative income mobility is highest in the Mountain West and the rural Midwest and lowest in the Southeast. Now these differences could be caused by the experience of living in different neighborhoods, but they may also simply reflect differences in the people living in these neighborhoods. In an effort to distinguish between these two possible explanations, Chetty and fellow economists study children from families who changed their neighborhood during childhood and provide evidence that much of the variation in upward mobility reflects the experience of living in particular neighborhoods. Their findings imply that upward mobility depends strongly on where you grow up as a child.\n\nThis research indicates that it is the places themselves, rather than the families who live there, that affect the outcomes for children. An important question is what specific features of neighborhoods are associated with greater upward mobility. Chetty and co-authors find that higher upward mobility is associated with areas that are less residentially segregated by race or income, have lower income inequality (i.e. a bigger middle class), higher quality schools, 5 stronger social networks, higher community involvement and stable family structures. \n\nThe finding that intergenerational mobility is primarily a local problem has two broad policy implications. The first is the need for place-based policies to invest more in at-risk communities to improve their childhood environments. The second is to facilitate families to be able to move into areas with better childhood environments.\n\nWith respect to the first, I would initially like to talk about the importance of schools―and in particular, strong public education.   Consistent with the findings by Chetty, there exists a large literature that has established the importance of high-quality education as a key determinant of economic mobility.  While there are differences of opinions on the most relevant measures of school quality, there is ample evidence that children who attend better schools on average end up with better outcomes later in life—such as higher levels of educational attainment and higher earnings. It is also well known that there exist large disparities in the quality of education by geography and socioeconomic background. Compared to children born to low-income parents, those born to higher-income families can better afford to move and live in areas with high-quality schools.\n\nThe sorting of families by income and their desire for better educational opportunities leads to enclaves of higher-quality and higher-spending schools that are separated from areas of economically less-advantaged populations and lower-quality schools. To a degree, this residential segregation has been perpetuated by our system of school financing that relies heavily on local property tax funding.  Local financing of public schools leads to a bundling of two distinct choices—residential choice and school choice—and increases the degree of socioeconomic segregation across school districts.\n\nWe can promote greater income mobility by unbundling the residential and school choices. This can be done in one of two ways. The first is to work to equalize school quality across location, while the second is to allow parents more choice of schools from a given location. Along the lines of the first approach, New York Fed research has shown that school finance reforms that seek to equalize funding across school districts by reducing the role of local property taxes can go a long way in decreasing residential segregation and equalizing quality of education.6 The key mechanism is that such reforms make underperforming neighborhoods more attractive, thus reducing socioeconomic segregation and leading to consequent gains in peer quality in previously-challenged enclaves. This in turn reduces disparities in school quality stemming from reduced socioeconomic segregation.\n\nOn the second approach, there exists research indicating that school vouchers that enable students to move to private schools or better-quality public schools can lead to improvements in public school quality and student performance by increasing competition among schools.7 It is important to note, though, that not all voucher programs are created equally, and the design of the program matters in how vouchers impact school quality.  Charter schools have provided another source of school choice in education.  More research into evaluating the effectiveness of voucher programs and charter schools at raising student achievement would be desirable in terms of informing public policy choices.8\n\nThe importance of education is not limited to elementary and secondary levels.  In fact, there exists convincing evidence from the child development literature that suggests that educational investments early in childhood have especially large rates of returns in terms of lifetime earnings and other outcomes. Take, for example, the Perry Preschool program for low-income African-American children, a two-year preschool program experiment in the mid-1960s. Recent research shows that this program had very large beneficial long-term effects, with participants experiencing higher rates of high school graduation, higher salaries, higher homeownership, more stable family structures, fewer arrests and lower welfare dependence. The large positive economic externalities from these investments in children imply that such programs more than pay for themselves over the long term. Estimates indicate that the aggregate benefits over the life of a child exceeded by eightfold the program’s per-pupil cost.9 Almost equally-large gains were reported for children who enrolled in Head Start, a federally-funded nationwide preschool program for low-income children.10  \n\nRelated literature on neighborhood effects has found that labor market outcomes for adults are also significantly affected by the type of neighborhoods where people reside.  The role of labor market networks and referrals has been amply-demonstrated as affecting the likelihood of finding a job, the quality of matches between employers and workers, and the earnings associated with these jobs. Several studies show that many of these networks have a significant local neighborhood component. Further, workers who live in neighborhoods with higher-quality networks are more likely to move to jobs with higher wages.11\n\nLet me now turn to policies aimed at improving upward income mobility through increased residential mobility.  There is some striking evidence that shows providing more opportunities for families to move to wealthier areas may improve upward mobility while also being cost-effective.12 In the mid-1990s, as part of a lottery-based housing mobility experiment sponsored by HUD—called the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) experiment—families in high-poverty housing projects were given housing vouchers to move to lower-poverty mixed-income neighborhoods.  While this project appears to have had little impact on the economic outcomes of the adults and older children, the program appears to have had remarkable long-term impacts on children who moved to such neighborhoods at a young age, with the impacts increasing by the number of childhood years they ended up living in the better environment.\n\nAnalysis of the data from the experiment shows that those who moved to lower-poverty areas when they were 12 or younger were found to earn about 30 percent more, on average, in their early- to mid-twenties compared to those who did not move, were 27 percent more likely to have entered college, and 30 percent less likely to be a single parent.  The MTO experiment again illustrates the importance of neighborhood effects on child development early in childhood. It also demonstrates that grants to move families to lower-poverty neighborhoods may reduce the intergenerational persistence of poverty.\n\nOf course, mobility of the sort that Chetty and other researchers have emphasized interacts in a very important way with the availability of affordable housing.  Making high quality neighborhoods accessible to families from all socioeconomic backgrounds is a major challenge for public policy.   Of course, illegal racial and other discrimination has played a role in preventing access to high-quality neighborhoods.  However, part of the challenge arises from the fact that in a free-market economy, the quality of the environment is reflected in the price of land—and thus housing—in that place.  This means that the neighborhoods with the best schools, the best access to jobs, shopping, recreation and other amenities will be the most desirable and will have the highest cost of land and housing.  Simply put, families seeking the upward mobility that better neighborhoods can promote may well find that housing in these neighborhoods is unaffordable.\n\nSome kinds of public policies may exacerbate, rather than lessen, the tendency of the housing market to price some families out of good neighborhoods.  Zoning and other land use regulations are sometimes enacted to artificially reduce the supply of housing, thus driving its price up even further. Take, for example, minimum lot size zoning which specifies a minimum amount of land per housing unit. When this regulation is binding, it reduces the number of housing units that can be built in a given area, and thus introduces artificial scarcity into the housing market, thereby raising prices.\n\nZoning can also be used to promote affordable housing—to include, rather than exclude low-and moderate-income families by setting aside space for those families in exchange for the right to develop market-rate units.  This is a strategy that New York and other large cities have pursued for many years, and in these cities it is easy to point to units that were developed under the program. Nonetheless, these programs are often controversial—some economists and others argue by increasing the cost of development they restrict supply.  Thus, while some percentage of new units developed will be affordable, fewer new units will be developed with uncertain effects on affordability overall.\n\nIt’s perhaps informative to contrast this kind of program with one that has historically been the main mechanism by which the supply of affordable housing has increased. The program I have in mind here isn’t a housing program, but, in my view, it has extremely important effects on the housing market. I’m talking about intra-urban transportation, which can serve to dramatically increase the locations available for development, and thus promote the availability of affordable housing.13 I believe that safe, reliable, affordable and efficient transportation to job locations should be a crucial element in an effective housing policy. Such a program indisputably increases the supply of sites available for development, which is a key way to get the benefits of lower prices to a broader set of families.  Indeed, it is clear that cities’ ability to grow and attract new residents requires them to either increase density—essentially meaning taller buildings—or to expand outwards by increasing transportation access.\n\nAccess to affordable credit is yet another pillar of a policy program that promotes housing affordability.  We at the Federal Reserve have long worked to ensure that credit flows equitably and that financial services are available to all U.S. citizens.  The Fed’s research on these subjects ranges from the pioneering study of redlining by a team of Boston Fed economists, to a very recent New York Fed study on “banking deserts” that appeared in our Liberty Street Economics blog just last month, as well as ongoing community credit work.  We understand the importance of credit in allowing communities to grow, and the importance of the Community Reinvestment Act in requiring financial institutions to make investments in their communities.  But, as my remarks here have indicated, credit is only one factor—and perhaps not the most important one—that affects the affordability of housing in our cities.\n\nI’ve addressed the importance of geographic mobility in supporting income mobility from the perspective of providing parents options for better neighborhoods in which to raise their children. Geographic mobility is also important in terms of individuals receiving the highest return to their human capital. Local economic shocks can depress employment and wages in some labor markets. This creates a strong incentive for individuals to move to an alternative labor market in order to more fully utilize their skills. Financial frictions to geographic mobility can reduce this movement of individuals across labor markets leading to less-efficient outcomes for the economy.  Income mobility can be enhanced through policies that attempt to limit these financial frictions. This argues for avoiding, where possible, policies that create “in-place” subsidies where the household can access the benefits only while remaining in a specific location.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has the twin objectives of maximum sustainable employment and price stability. Achieving the first of our objectives requires that every individual has the opportunity to achieve her full potential in life. Where you happen to be born should not determine your chance of living the American Dream. Research is highlighting possible key determinants of economic opportunity and income mobility. More research is necessary to inform future policy choices in this critical area.\n\nReferences\n\nAngrist, Joshua, Sarah Cohodes, Susan Dynarski, Parag Pathak and Christopher Walters. 2016. “Stand and Deliver: Effects of Boston’s Charter High Schools on College Preparation, Entry, and Choice,” Journal of Labor Economics, 34(2): 275-318.\n\nAslund, Olof, Per-Anders Edin, Peter Fredriksson and Hans Gronqvist. 2011. “Peers, Neighborhoods, and Student Achievement: Evidence From a Placement Policy,” American Economic Journal Applied Economics, 3(2): 67-95.\n\nBaum-Snow, Nathaniel. 2007. “Did Highways Cause Suburbanization?” Quarterly Journal of Economics, 122(2): 775-805.\n\nBayer, Patrick, Steven L.

        "content": "Good morning.  I am very pleased to be in Bridgeport and to speak with you today.  I would like to give a special thanks to the University of Bridgeport for their part in making this event possible.\n\nMy visit today is part of our ongoing efforts at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to better understand the regional economy.  We plan trips like this so that we can meet with a diverse array of stakeholders in the region to gain insights and perspectives on the local economy.  These trips also allow us to hear from Main Street about the major issues and concerns affecting people and businesses in the area.  Fairfield County is our first destination in 2016, and this is the second time we have visited the area in the past three years.\n\nI am looking forward to meeting with a number of different groups today. After starting our day here at the University of Bridgeport, we will meet with an organization called The WorkPlace to hear about some of the nationally-recognized programs they have successfully developed to help the long-term unemployed find jobs.  Long-term unemployment is a significant problem in the broader economy, and something that I will discuss in more detail later in my remarks.  Next, we will take a tour of the American Job Center, an organization that provides workforce assistance to job seekers in conjunction with local businesses.  Later we will attend, a roundtable lunch with members of the Bridgeport Regional Business Community.  And, finally, we will meet with leadership from the Housing Development Fund, New Horizons and NeighborWorks America to hear about the state of affordable housing and community development in Fairfield County.\n\nThese trips are valuable to us, and represent one of the many ways in which the New York Fed engages with people and businesses in our region.  Another one of our efforts in this vein is our Small Business Credit Survey―the latest version of which was released last month.  This survey―which includes responses from across 26 states―helps us understand the challenges facing small businesses in the region, focusing on financing needs and impediments to obtaining credit.  We partnered with multiple organizations throughout Connecticut to produce this survey―some of which are right here in Bridgeport―and received responses from nearly 200 small business owners from around the state.  I’d like to personally thank those who participated in the survey.\n\nThe remainder of my remarks will focus on recent developments in the national and local economy.  As always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nU.S. Economic Outlook\n\nDespite the swings we have seen in financial markets over the past few months and the recent divergences across different economic and financial market indicators, recent developments have not led me to make a fundamental change in my outlook for the U.S. economy.  I continue to expect that the economy will expand over the course of this year at a pace slightly above its long-term trend—sufficient to push the unemployment rate down a bit further and to more fully utilize the nation’s labor resources.  On inflation, although recent data have been somewhat firmer, it still appears that inflation for this year will fall short of our 2 percent objective for the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) deflator.  However, I anticipate an eventual return to our objective as the transitory factors that have held down inflation dissipate over time.\n\nIn assessing the current state of the U.S. economy, recent news has generated divergent signals.  Several sectors have been showing signs of softness.  Real consumer spending growth appears to have moderated somewhat from the relatively robust pace of the second half of 2015.  Both new and existing home sales have flattened since the middle of last year.  Finally, indicators of real business investment spending point to continued softness.  In contrast, manufacturing production—which had been a particular weak spot of the U.S. economy in 2015—rose in the first two months of this year.  Recent survey data, including our own Empire State Manufacturing Survey, indicate further improvement in conditions for the manufacturing sector in March.\n\nThrough it all, the U.S. labor market has remained healthy.  Payroll employment increased an average of about 229,000 per month over the course of 2015, and the gains in the first quarter of this year were nearly as high.  Even though the unemployment rate ticked up in March to 5 percent, the amount of slack in the labor market still appears to be diminishing.  Both the share of the population that is employed and the labor force participation rate have risen a bit over the past several months, with the employment-to-population ratio now at its highest level since the end of the recession.  However, measures of aggregate wage growth have remained quite subdued, which suggests there is still some slack in the labor market.\n\nAn important question is how to reconcile these cross-currents.  I continue to anticipate that consumption and housing activity will expand at a moderate pace this year.  Continued job and wage gains, combined with still-low energy prices, should sustain real disposable income growth and support consumer spending.  The housing market should remain on a solid trajectory, supported by rising employment and low mortgage rates.  In contrast to previous years, fiscal policy should also provide a moderate stimulus this year.  I believe that these positive factors will be sufficient to offset weakness in other areas, such as net exports and fixed business investment that will continue to be adversely impacted by the still-strong dollar, weak foreign growth, and low energy and commodity prices.\n\nPutting this all together, I expect real GDP growth of about 2 percent in 2016, slightly below the average pace of growth in this expansion, but a bit above my estimate of the potential growth of the U.S. economy.  If this materializes, then we should see some further reduction in the unemployment rate to around 4¾ percent—my estimate of the rate that I view as consistent with stable inflation over the long term.\n\nTurning to the outlook for inflation, on a year-over-year basis, both headline and core inflation have recently risen above the low levels that prevailed through most of 2015.  Nevertheless, inflation still remains below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent objective.  As the FOMC noted in its March statement, this continued low inflation is partly due to declines in energy prices and non-energy import prices.  Although energy prices have stopped falling and the dollar has stopped appreciating, earlier movements in these factors still appear to be weighing on inflation.\n\nA concern with this long period of low inflation is that it has the potential to reduce inflation expectations, which, in turn, would tend to continue to hold down inflation.  As past experience shows, it is difficult to push inflation back up to the central bank’s objective if inflation expectations fall meaningfully below that objective.  Japan’s experience is cautionary in this regard.\n\nRecent evidence on inflation expectations suggests some firming, but there is still cause for concern.  Although both measures of longer-term inflation compensation based on nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury securities as well as some survey measures of inflation expectations have risen modestly since mid-February, the levels of many of these measures remain quite low.\n\nNow, as I have noted, the low level of market-based inflation compensation probably reflects factors besides inflation expectations, in particular lower term premiums.  Still, it would be prudent to consider the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations of market participants may have declined somewhat.  Even after a rise in its most recent reading, the median of the three-year inflation expectations from the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations remains near its lowest reading over its short history.  Renewed declines in survey measures would be worrisome.  However, at this point, my conclusion is that inflation expectations have not become unanchored.\n\nIn sum, I anticipate that the combination of decreasing resource slack and anchored longer-term inflation expectations will help push inflation up to our 2 percent objective over the medium term.  The recent rise in inflation and in measures of inflation expectations have increased my confidence around this outlook compared to earlier in the year, but it is still possible that the return of inflation to our objective could take longer than I anticipate.\n\nThe forecast that I have just described is my best assessment of how the U.S. economy will evolve this year.  As always, there is uncertainty and risk relative to this forecast, which also needs to be taken into consideration in assessing the implications of the outlook for monetary policy.  I see the uncertainties around my forecast to be somewhat greater than usual.  This assessment reflects the divergent economic signals I highlighted earlier.  In addition, the factors behind the financial turbulence we saw earlier this year do not yet appear to be resolved fully.\n\nAlthough the downside risks have diminished since earlier in the year, I still judge the balance of risks to my inflation and growth outlooks to be tilted slightly to the downside.  The low levels of energy and commodity prices may signal more persistent disinflationary pressures than I currently anticipate, while renewed tightening of financial market conditions could have a greater negative impact on the U.S. economy. Also, there is significant uncertainty about economic growth prospects abroad and how this will affect the U.S. economic outlook.  I continue to monitor global economic and financial market developments closely to assess their implications for the outlook.\n\nGiven my outlook and risk assessment, I judge that a cautious and gradual approach to policy normalization is appropriate.  Moreover, caution is also called for because of our limited ability to reduce the policy rate to respond to adverse developments, recognizing that we could also use forward guidance and balance sheet policies to provide additional accommodation if that proved warranted.  Of course, the trajectory of short-term interest rates and the timing of future monetary policy adjustments will continue to be informed by the incoming data—both economic and financial—and how that data influences the outlook.\n\nThe Problem of Long-Term Unemployment\n\nBefore turning to the outlook for the local economy, I would like to spend a few minutes talking about the problem of long-term unemployment. The Great Recession was very severe, resulting in a large decline in output and damage to the labor market.  From peak to trough, non-farm payroll employment declined by 8.7 million.  The unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent.  At the same time, the average duration of unemployment increased significantly.  The number of individuals classified as long-term unemployed—that is, those who were unemployed for at least 27 weeks—peaked in December 2010 at 6.4 million, an increase of 5.3 million from the cyclical low in May 2007.  Long-term unemployment as a fraction of total unemployment increased from 16.7 percent to 44.8 percent.  The hardships of prolonged unemployment touched many families around the country and this is tragic.\n\nThe very accommodative monetary policy that we implemented in response was aimed at helping to heal the labor market and promote price stability.  Slowly, the economy began to respond and to recover.  In October 2014, the FOMC announced the end of its latest asset purchase program citing that “there has been substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market since the inception of its current asset purchase program.”  In March 2015, the FOMC set out conditions for the decision to begin to normalize monetary policy, stating “The Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.”  The FOMC judged at its December 2015 meeting that those conditions had been met.\n\nThe improvement that we have seen in the labor market is very welcome. It took until May 2014 for the labor market to recover the jobs lost in the recession, but now there are 5.3 million jobs beyond the prior cyclical peak.  The unemployment rate has declined to 5.0 percent. With this improvement, the number of long-term unemployed has been reduced to 2.2 million.  Despite these gains, it is important to emphasize that more needs to be done to improve the labor market.  The current number of long-term unemployed is still higher than the prior cyclical peak in June 2003, and is more than a million above the prior cyclical low in October 2006.\n\nFurther progress on transitioning these unemployed workers back into jobs requires sustained effort on many fronts.  Essential to this effort are programs such as the Platform to Employment developed by The WorkPlace.  I am looking forward to my visit there later today to hear more about this program.  The Platform to Employment program has been replicated in nearly 20 communities across the country from Newark to San Diego.  Helping the long-term unemployed regain employment needs to be a priority for all of us.\n\nThe ongoing challenge in reducing the number of long-term unemployed is also a reminder of the importance of financial stability and sustainable economic growth.  Recessions can quickly undo years’ worth of hard-earned progress in the labor market.  Making the financial system and the economy more resilient so we can avoid such deep downturns in the future is a responsibility that I take very seriously.\n\nLocal Economic Outlook\n\nTurning now to the region, while Fairfield County’s economy has recovered from the Great Recession, its job growth has lagged behind both New York City and the nation.  Only recently has employment approached its pre-recession levels, and it is still well shy of where it was back in 2000.  Other barometers of the Fairfield County economy, such as home prices, also indicate a slow recovery from the recession.  There are still a sizable number of properties that are either in foreclosure or up for foreclosure sale, which has weighed down the local housing market.  Yet, Fairfield County has not been the only place in the metro region to see a sluggish recovery—notably, both northern New Jersey and the Mid-Hudson Valley have yet to see employment return to their pre-recession peaks.\n\nThis picture is in contrast with New York City’s economic performance, which has been exceptionally strong throughout this expansion, and has been a driver of growth for the whole tri-state region.  Why is New York City seeing so much stronger job growth than Fairfield County?  After all, it wasn’t so long ago that Stamford was attracting finance-sector jobs away from Manhattan.  The answer lies in a mix of cyclical and secular trends. On the cyclical side, while finance employment has been sluggish in both New York City and Fairfield County, New York City is benefiting from strong employment gains in technology, construction, retailing and advertising—sectors that are not contributing to the same degree in Fairfield County.  In addition, Stamford has had to deal with the relocations of UBS and RBS, while Fairfield faces the prospective relocation of GE.\n\nOne potential long-term trend that is likely affecting the region is a renewed urbanization: that is, a gradual but broad-based shift of preferences to urban living, especially for younger generations.  Throughout the second half of the 20th century, we saw a steady and widespread migration from cities to suburbs.  More recently, this suburbanization trend seems to have halted; and there are signs that cities, especially major cities, have been gaining relative to their suburbs.  It’s too early to say if this is the start of a secular trend, and the implications for Fairfield County are unclear.  However, Stamford and Bridgeport stand to benefit from a shift in preferences toward more urban living, given their high population densities and strong transit links to New York City.\n\nEven now, while Fairfield County may have lagged in job growth, population growth has remained quite sturdy—not only across the county, but here in Bridgeport as well.  In fact, Bridgeport’s population has grown by about 6 percent since 2000—its first sustained increase since the 1940s —while Stamford’s has grown by almost 10 percent.  \n\nFairfield County can leverage its proximity to the New York City job market.  While most residents of Fairfield County rely on job opportunities locally, many residents commute to jobs in Manhattan.  So the strength in New York City’s economy should be of significant help to Fairfield County.  Over the past year, New York City’s economy has, on average, added more than twice as many jobs each month as the total expected job losses from the relocations of GE, UBS and RBS.  While a majority of these jobs may not have been in high-paying-industry sectors, some of them were—especially in technology-related industries.  So, as long as New York City keeps adding jobs at such a brisk pace, Fairfield County will benefit.  In addition, research indicates that a strong central city is critical for the well-being of its suburbs, meaning that a healthy and growing New York City economy is critically important to Fairfield County.\n\nWhat else can the region do to foster economic growth going forward?  It certainly helps for cities like Bridgeport and Stamford to be attractive locations for businesses to locate and grow.  It is also important to focus on quality of life issues that make people want to live here—like good schools and low crime, and also amenities ranging from nice parks to good restaurants.  Bridgeport has clearly been making progress in this regard, both along the waterfront at Steelpointe Harbor and along Main Street.  With New York City’s large and booming economy nearby, and Metro North providing a convenient mass transit link, anything that makes people more inclined to live here—and perhaps even set up shop here—is bound to boost the local economy.  And finally, one of the most important ingredients for a healthy urban economy is a well-trained and motivated work force.  It cannot be overstated how important it is to help provide residents with the skills and tools they need to be productive and successful, so that they can realize their full potential.\n\nCollege Graduates Finding Good Jobs\n\nI would like to close with a message for the students in attendance today, especially those of you who will be graduating soon.  If you started college four or five years ago, you may have heard about the difficult time that graduates have had finding good jobs, perhaps even making you wonder about the value of obtaining a college degree.  Indeed, in the years following the Great Recession, unemployment and underemployment among recent college graduates reached highs not seen in decades.  So, it wouldn’t be surprising if many of you are concerned about your ability to find a good job after graduation.\n\nI want to make two points that should temper these concerns.  First, it is not unusual for college graduates to take some time to find the right job when they transition from school to the working world.  In good economic times, as well as in bad times, there is often an adjustment period as newly-minted graduates search for a job that best fits their skills and interests.  Second, as the job market has continued to strengthen through the expansion, it has gotten easier for those graduating from college to find a good job.2\n\nWhile job opportunities for those with a college degree were flat between 2011 and early 2014, demand for college graduates has been on the rise for about two years now.  As a result, for the first time during this recovery, both unemployment and underemployment among recent college graduates has generally been falling.  This means that, not only has it become easier to find a job upon graduation, but more college graduates are taking jobs that better utilize their degrees.  In addition, starting salaries for recent college graduates have been increasing for the past couple of years, reflecting the growing demand for their skills in a tighter job market.\n\nTo conclude, while there are economic challenges facing both the nation and the region, I am optimistic that we will continue to make progress on both fronts over the next few years.  Achieving our dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment and price stability will help those who will graduate soon to achieve their own aspirations.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take some questions.\n\n1 Jaison Abel, Jason Bram, Tony Davis, Richard Deitz, Jonathan McCarthy and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\n2 We have been tracking these developments using data our economists have developed to help us better understand the job prospects facing recent college graduates. These data are available on our website and are updated regularly. See The Labor Market for Recent College Graduates."

        "title": "The Role of the Federal Reserve—Lessons from Financial Crises",
        "content": "It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to speak here today as part of the Virginia Association of Economists annual meeting at Virginia Military Institute and Washington and Lee University.  This is an appropriate setting for the topic I will be addressing—the role of the Federal Reserve as the central bank of the United States.  When the Federal Reserve Act was enacted in 1913, H. Parker Willis, who had been a professor at Washington and Lee University, played a critical role.  He worked closely with Representative Carter Glass of Virginia in crafting the legislative proposal that established the Federal Reserve, and Willis became the first Secretary of the Federal Reserve Board in 1914. \n\nOf course, I’m tackling this subject today not just because H. Parker Willis was a professor here in Lexington.  Instead, I’m addressing this issue because of the ongoing debate about the role of the Federal Reserve and its structure and governance.  My purpose is to demystify the nation’s central bank and to respond to some of the critiques that we continue to face.  I see this as necessary because there is a risk that the Federal Reserve could be changed in ways that might impair our ability to achieve our primary objectives—namely, full employment and price stability.  As always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nThe current debate surrounding this nation’s central bank is not new, but rather dates back to our nation’s independence from Great Britain.  The notion of a central bank in the United States has nearly always been controversial—in concept, design and practice.  So much so that the charters of the first two U.S. central banks, the First and Second Banks of the United States, were allowed to lapse. \n\nThe United States, in contrast to many of our European counterparts, had no central bank from 1836 to 1913.  During this period, the economy was prone to financial panics.  The rapid development of the 19th century American economy, including the westward expansion made possible by railroads, outstripped the ability of the private banking system to satisfy the nation’s needs for an elastic currency and a stable supply of credit. Ultimately, the Panic of 1907―in which J.P. Morgan, the leading financier of the day, played an outsized role in responding to the crisis―was the catalyst that turned the tide back in favor of establishing a central bank. \n\nThe debate preceding the passage of the Federal Reserve Act in 1913 was protracted and intense.  Early drafts of reform proposals were careful not to even mention a “central bank”—the 75-year-old scars from the Second Bank’s failed reauthorization battle had still not fully healed.  Although there was a strong recognition that the country needed a central bank to forestall and mitigate financial panics, there was considerable disagreement about how it should be structured.  Important considerations included what role should be played by private bankers versus government officials, how centralized the new bank should be and the extent of its powers.2  \n\nDuring this period, the U.S. economy was susceptible to financial panics.  Lacking a central bank, the country had no reliable lender of last resort that could provide currency and credit on demand against high-quality assets.  Banks had to self-insure against bank runs by holding a high fraction of deposits as cash, and by entering into private liquidity agreements with other banks.  Self-insurance was not only expensive relative to the cost of a public backstop provided by a central bank, but it was also limited in its effectiveness.  When the business cycle turned down and financial stress intensified, bank runs often ensued as bank customers rushed to convert their deposits into cash.  Without a true lender of last resort, cash that banks individually and collectively kept in reserve often proved inadequate to meet demand.  At that point, a bank under duress had to either close its doors or quickly sell assets.  Of course, either action worked to intensify the panic and to increase the stress on the economy.\n\nThe Federal Reserve was established so that there would be a lender of last resort that could lend against high-quality collateral and provide a reliable and elastic currency.3  The knowledge that such a lender of last resort existed reduced considerably the incentives for depositors to race to their banks to make withdrawals at the first sign of trouble.4   At that time, the provision of an elastic currency was especially important because the agricultural sector represented a significant proportion of the U.S. economy.  As a result, the demand for credit increased significantly each fall when farmers incurred the costs associated with harvesting their crops.  Prior to the establishment of the Federal Reserve, accommodating this seasonal demand necessitated a flow of currency and credit from the major financial markets such as New York and Chicago that put upward pressure on interest rates.  With its ability to provide an elastic currency, the Federal Reserve would be able to dampen such seasonal swings in interest rates. \n\nAt its inception, the Federal Reserve differed from central banks in Europe in that it was decentralized.  The design reflected long-standing concerns in our country about the concentration of power in a single authority. These concerns are reflected in the federated system established by the Constitution in 1787.  Similarly, the design adopted for the central bank in 1913 was also federated, with twelve independent Reserve Banks, each with its own capital and board of directors, overseen by a seven member Federal Reserve Board in Washington, with the Secretary of the Treasury serving as chair of the Board.  This decentralized structure allayed the prevailing fear of concentrating power in either New York or Washington and, especially within the banking community, of ceding too much power to the federal government.\n\nPaul Warburg was an American banker who had emigrated to the United States from Europe.  He was deeply involved in the debate about the appropriate structure of the central bank and described the concern as follows:\n\nThe view was generally held that centralization of banking would inevitably result in one of two alternatives: either complete governmental control, which meant politics in banking, or control by “Wall Street,” which meant banking in politics.5\n\nImportantly, the Federal Reserve was designed to have budgetary independence from the federal government.  The System funds itself through its business operations, and not through Congressional appropriations.6  This formed an important foundation in ensuring that the conduct of monetary policy would be independent from political influence.  A wide range of research has shown that central banks achieve better outcomes with respect to employment and inflation when they are insulated from short-term political pressures in their conduct of monetary policy.7  \n\nThe Federal Reserve System was soon tested, first by the Depression of 1920-21, and then by the Great Depression.  The searing experience of the Great Depression, including the 1933 Banking Holiday and thousands of bank failures, revealed significant shortcomings.  This led to the Banking Act of 1935, which made two important changes—establishing a federal deposit insurance system and making the Federal Reserve System more centralized.  The Great Depression made it clear that having a lender of last resort was not sufficient for preventing bank runs.  Deposit insurance, which had been debated but not adopted during the drafting of the Federal Reserve Act, was instituted with the creation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\n\nA second lesson was that monetary policy would be more effective if it were coordinated at the national level, rather than conducted individually by the Reserve Banks.8  To accomplish this, the Banking Act replaced the Federal Reserve Board with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and established the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to oversee the conduct of monetary policy.  The governors in Washington were made dominant because they were given the majority of votes on the FOMC.9 Over time, the role of the executive branch and the U.S. Treasury was reduced.  Beginning in 1936, the Secretary of the Treasury no longer served on the FOMC.  The Federal Reserve Board moved to its own building in 1937, and the Federal Reserve gained independence in the setting of monetary policy with the Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord in 1951.\n\nA century following the Panic of 1907, another financial crisis led to the Great Recession.  As was the case following the Great Depression, weaknesses exposed by the crisis led to further changes to the Federal Reserve System.  Some of these changes were legislated while others were initiated by the Federal Reserve itself.  \n\nBefore discussing the lessons learned from the financial crisis and the changes that ensued, I think it is important to recount the Fed’s efforts to support the U.S. economy during this recent period of severe economic and financial distress.  As you may recall, the Federal Reserve responded to the financial crisis in two ways.  First, it intervened to prevent the failure of several systemically important institutions, including firms that it did not supervise―namely Bear Stearns and AIG.10   Second, it established a number of special liquidity facilities to ensure that domestic banks, securities dealers, commercial paper issuers, money market mutual funds and foreign banks had sufficient access to dollar liquidity so they could sustain their lending and investment activities, and thereby continue to supply credit to households and businesses. \n\nI strongly believe that these interventions were necessary to prevent a systemic collapse of the global financial system.  If such a collapse had occurred, I am convinced that the consequences would have been a global depression.  If the Federal Reserve hadn’t done everything in its authority to prevent a collapse, we would have been derelict in our duty to the country.\n\nLet me be clear: The interventions by the Federal Reserve during the crisis were designed to safeguard the economy, for the benefit of all Americans, while protecting the taxpayer.  I am proud of our record on both accounts.  In the end, the Federal Reserve’s extraordinary interventions achieved their intended purposes to support economic activity and, incidentally, taxpayers were compensated for the risks undertaken in these interventions.  Total profits from these interventions were more than $30 billion.11 One important condition for lending in these programs was that the loan needed to be secured to the satisfaction of the Federal Reserve Bank extending the loan.  Despite the degree of dislocation in the financial system at the time and the severity of the Great Recession, there were no losses for any of the Fed’s programs.   \n\nAt the same time, I agree with those critics who argue that there was something fundamentally unfair about the disparity in treatment between the few large financial institutions that were saved versus the millions of individuals who lost their homes or their jobs.  My response is not particularly satisfying.  Recessions inflict considerable pain on innocent bystanders in the economy.  Depressions greatly compound this pain. Given the Federal Reserve’s role and authority, what we knew at the time and the powers and tools that were available to us, I think we made good choices.  If the large systemic banking organizations had failed, the hardships inflicted on households and small business would have been far worse.12\n\nFrom my perspective, I believe that any critique of the Fed or other agencies should be focused more on the regulatory and supervisory shortcomings—some of which, I admit, were ours—that created the economic and financial market circumstances in which the Fed’s extraordinary interventions proved necessary.  This leads me back to some of those lessons learned and the changes that have resulted.\n\nThe crisis showed that the regulatory community did not fully grasp the vulnerability of the financial system.  In particular, critical financial institutions were not resilient enough to cope with large scale disruptions without assistance, and problems in one institution quickly spread to others.  In response, the Federal Reserve has made significant changes in how we regulate and supervise financial institutions.  We have raised capital and liquidity requirements, put banks through annual stress tests, established the Large Institution Supervision Coordination Committee (LISCC) to enable us to evaluate the largest firms collectively and relative to one another, and set up the Office of Financial Stability to enable us to look at the financial system more holistically.  Financial stability now receives the attention it deserves.  For example, there are now regular briefings and discussions on financial stability at FOMC meetings. \n\nAs discussed earlier, the Federal Reserve has the responsibility to be the lender of last resort.  In normal times, this occurs through discount window lending to depository institutions.  During the financial crisis, Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act enabled extensions of credit in “unusual and exigent” circumstances to individuals, partnerships and corporations.13  The extraordinary interventions that were undertaken using our emergency powers under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act were warranted and within our authority.  However, I suspect that the scale and scope of these interventions went considerably further than envisioned by the public and Congress prior to the crisis.\n\nIn response, Congress narrowed the scope of Section 13(3) with the Dodd-Frank Act.  In particular, Dodd-Frank limits the Federal Reserve’s authority to extend credit through facilities with broad-based eligibility, and constrains the Federal Reserve’s authority to extend credit to a single company.  The Dodd-Frank Act also modified the governance that would apply to any future intervention in an effort to increase public accountability. \n\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act addressed the broader issue exposed by the crisis―that some large financial institutions had become “too-big-to-fail” (TBTF).  To end TBTF, Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act established a process to ensure that any financial firm could be resolved without threatening the viability of the financial system and without putting taxpayer funds at risk.14  In addition, financial intermediaries designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council are subject to tougher prudential standards and enhanced supervision by the Federal Reserve.  The intent behind these measures is to reduce the likelihood of a failure of a large financial firm, and the consequence of such a failure for the financial system, should one occur.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act left intact the decentralized structure of the original federated Federal Reserve System—the twelve Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors in Washington.  Each Reserve Bank continues to operate as a separately capitalized corporation with its own Board of Directors.15   But, to limit the role of bankers on the Federal Reserve Bank boards, the Dodd-Frank Act prohibited the bankers on each board from participating in the selection of its Reserve Bank president.16    \n\nEven prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, it is important to emphasize that the directors played no significant role in setting policy.17 Instead, their role has been to advise the Reserve Bank president about economic, community and business developments in the District, and to ensure that the Bank is a well-governed and well-managed institution.18   And, although member banks hold capital in the Federal Reserve and receive a dividend set by law against this capital, member banks do not influence the Fed’s monetary and regulatory policy decisions, how policy is implemented or the supervisory oversight of banks. \n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also addressed the need for enhanced transparency by establishing disclosure requirements for participation in Federal Reserve facilities.  In terms of transparency, I do think it is a fair critique that, in the past, the Federal Reserve has not always been sufficiently transparent.  For example, prior to 1994, we typically didn’t even announce changes that were being implemented in monetary policy.  Market participants had to infer what we were doing from our daily open market operations and where the federal funds rate was trading.  During the crisis, I also believe we could have done more to explain the motivations for our extraordinary interventions.  At times, while the motivations and objectives might have been obvious to us, they weren’t always as readily apparent to Congress or to the public.  I think this created uncertainty about what we were trying to accomplish, and made it more difficult for outside observers to assess the appropriateness of our actions and our motives.  \n\nToday the situation is quite different.  We have made significant enhancements with respect to transparency.  After each meeting, the FOMC issues a statement that sets the current target range for the federal funds rate and explains its monetary policy decision.  Four times a year, the chair holds a press conference explaining the decision and the FOMC releases its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).  The SEP provides the FOMC participants’ forecasts for key economic variables and the federal funds rate over the next few years.  In addition, the FOMC participants give numerous speeches explaining their views on monetary policy and other issues, and the chair regularly testifies about monetary policy and the Federal Reserve’s other activities before Congress.  Overall, I have found that this move towards greater transparency has held us in good stead.   \n\nNearly six years since the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, there still remains considerable debate about whether further changes to the role and structure of the Federal Reserve System are warranted.  Some of the issues being debated include how much discretion the Federal Reserve should have in the conduct of monetary policy, whether the Federal Reserve is sufficiently transparent in how it operates, and the role of the New York Fed.  I would caution that any further changes to the Federal Reserve System should be grounded on what we learned from the crisis and based on the needs of our evolving economy.  Changes should be undertaken if they would make the Federal Reserve more effective in its mission.  In contrast, changes based on an emotional, unreasoned response in reaction to the pain associated with the financial crisis and the Great Recession would likely be counter-productive. \n\nSome argue that the Federal Reserve has too much discretion in its implementation of monetary policy and, consequently, would have the Fed stick to a formal rule in its conduct of monetary policy.  This is a poor idea because adherence to a simple rule would undoubtedly lead to significant policy errors.  The world is simply too complex to put monetary policy on autopilot.19  \n\nConcerns over the FOMC’s degree of discretion in monetary policy likely reflect, in part, innovations in monetary policy enacted in recent years that added accommodation at a time when short-term interest rates were stuck very close to the zero lower bound.  In particular, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet grew substantially as the Federal Reserve enacted a series of large-scale asset purchase programs designed to support economic activity.  With respect to the argument that these programs have distorted financial markets, I would simply respond that monetary policy always affects financial markets and financial asset valuations.   The expected path of the federal funds rate is an important factor influencing the level of bond yields, and the level of bond yields and bond term premia have implications for the valuations of other financial assets, such as equities, and influence the foreign exchange value of the dollar. \n\nOf course, the impact of monetary policy may have been greater this time.  But this is mainly because more monetary policy stimulus has been required during the current economic cycle in order to push the U.S. economy towards the Fed’s dual mandate objectives.  I believe that if we had not responded as forcefully, the recovery would have been slower, the unemployment rate would have been higher and there would have been a greater risk of deflation. \n\nWhile it is much too soon to claim success, the U.S. economy today is in a relatively good place compared to most other countries.  The economic expansion is in its seventh year and we have made considerable progress relative to our employment and inflation objectives.  Also, the tools that we designed to control monetary policy even with a very large balance sheet have been shown to be effective.  In December, when we raised our target range for the federal funds rate to 25 to 50 basis points, we also raised the interest rate we pay on bank reserves to 50 basis points and the rate we pay on our overnight reverse repo facility to 25 basis points.  Not only have these new tools been effective in moving the federal funds rate up into the middle of its new target range, but the entire complex of money market rates has moved up as well. \n\nAlso, the fears expressed by some that the Federal Reserve’s very large balance sheet would lead to runaway inflation have proven to be unwarranted.  Now that we have demonstrated that we have monetary control even with a very large balance sheet, I would hope that this issue has been put to rest.   \n\nAs I noted earlier, I am a committed advocate for enhanced transparency and we are always looking for ways to improve.  But, of course, there are limits.  One could argue, for example, that a live broadcast of a Federal Open Market Committee meeting would be more transparent.  But, such a broadcast would do considerable harm by constraining candor and debate over the appropriate monetary policy decision.  I believe it would likely lead to less informed decisions and, consequently, poorer execution of our monetary policy responsibilities.  Similarly, disclosing in real time who was borrowing from the Federal Reserve’s Discount Window would likely undercut the efficacy of the window.  Banks might be reluctant to borrow if it were immediately made public because such borrowing might be construed in the market as a sign of weakness.20   Stigmatizing Discount Window use by banks would make this tool less effective as a lender of last resort backstop for bank liquidity needs.  While there obviously is a point of diminishing returns in terms of increased transparency, I think it’s reasonable to evaluate what further steps the Federal Reserve could make in this direction, judging whether additional steps would enhance versus diminish the effectiveness of our tools and policies, and our ability to achieve our objectives.  \n\nWith regard to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which I have the responsibility of leading, I’d observe that the New York Fed, like the other eleven reserve banks, serves to support the overall mission of the Federal Reserve System.  But, by virtue of its location, the New York Fed has a unique responsibility on behalf of the System—namely to serve as the operational arm of the Federal Open Market Committee with respect to the implementation of monetary policy.  This separation of the policy arm and the operational arm of monetary policy in two distinct institutions is a very unusual setup among central banks.21\n\nThere are good reasons why these important functions are assigned to the New York Fed.  Monetary policy works by affecting financial market conditions in order to promote the economic outcomes consistent with the Fed’s dual mandate.  As such, effective and efficient monetary policy execution requires a practical and thorough understanding of the broad range of the financial markets through which monetary policy operates.\n\nNew York City is the nation’s principal financial center.  By locating the duties related to the execution of monetary policy at the New York Fed, the System gains a number of benefits. These include the New York Fed’s ability to develop expertise in and understanding of the broad spectrum of financial markets and institutions, and its access to a deep pool of specialized financial talent in the place where it is most concentrated.\n\nThe New York Fed’s institutional knowledge and experience in financial markets and its related disciplines are a critical input at all times, but never more so than during periods of duress.  This was evidenced during the financial crisis, when the New York Fed’s unique insights and expertise helped the Federal Reserve respond quickly and effectively to unfolding events.\n\nThe authors who crafted the Federal Reserve Act such as Carter Glass—assisted by H. Parker Willis—deliberately created a central bank structure that fits the U.S. political system, with a series of important checks and balances—between Washington and the rest of the country, between Washington and New York, and with respect to the role of the federal government versus the private sector.  These checks and balances exist to ensure that the central bank acts in the broadest interests of the nation, and is appropriately insulated from short-term political pressures and considerations.  In this construction, New York does have a special role, but one that stems from where it sits, in New York City, the nation’s most important financial center. \n\nThe Federal Reserve exists to serve Main Street, not Wall Street.  The dual mandate objectives established by Congress—full employment and price stability—are clear on this point.  There is no mention of Wall Street.  At the same time, it is broadly recognized that without a well-functioning financial system it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the Federal Reserve to achieve those objectives.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has evolved considerably since its inception in 1913. This evolution has been informed by lessons from past financial crises. The goal has been to make the Federal Reserve even more effective in carrying out its mission.  This process of learning from experience is as critical for institutions as it as individuals.  To paraphrase Winston Churchill: People always make mistakes, but only wise ones learn from their mistakes.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n1 Kenneth Garbade, Jack Gutt, Joyce Hansen, Michael Held and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\n2 See America’s Bank: The Epic Struggle to Create the Federal Reserve, Roger Lowenstein, 2015.\n\n3 President Wilson, who signed the Federal Reserve Act, described this new feature for the currency. “Suffice it here to say that it provides a currency which expands as it is needed and contracts when it is not needed: a currency which comes into existence in response to the call of every man who can show a going business and a concrete basis for extending credit to him, however obscure or prominent he may be, however big or little his business transactions.” Letter to Congressman Oscar Underwood, October 17, 1914, Wilson Papers, vol. 31.\n\n4 In addition, the Federal Reserve was given the authority to clear checks on a nationwide basis.  This helped knit the country’s commerce together better and ensured that checks would be payable at par rather than discounted by differing amounts depending on how far one was from the bank of issue and how little one knew about a particular bank’s financial condition and viability. \n\n5 Paul Warburg, The Federal Reserve System: Its Origins and Growth, vol. 1, 1930.\n\n6 The Federal Reserve Banks are funded through their respective operations. The Federal Reserve Board―and later, the Board of Governors―is funded through semiannual assessments on the Banks [Section 10(3) of the Federal Reserve Act]. The Board’s financial independence was strengthened in the 1933 Banking Act [Section 6(b)] which stipulated that these semiannual assessments “[…] shall not be construed to be Government funds or appropriated moneys.”\n\n7 For example, see Alesina and Summers, “Central Bank Independence and Macroeconomic Performance.” Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, vol. 25, no. 2 pg. 157-62, 1993.\n\n8 H. Parker Willis described this independence given to the Reserve Banks in the conduct of policy. “There is nothing, either in the Federal Reserve Act or in the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, to indicate that the reserve banks are to be operated in groups or through communications with one another, resulting in the establishment of a single policy as to detail.” H. Parker Willis, The Federal Reserve, pg. 128, 1915.\n\n9 This assumes no vacancies on the seven-member Board of Governors.  Currently, with five members of the Board of Governors and five votes among the Reserve Banks, the balance is split equally.  \n\n10 The Federal Reserve was unable to prevent the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers.\n\n11 For example, see “Federal Reserve: Emergency Lending,” Marc Labonte, Congressional Research Service, January 6, 2016.\n\n12 In retrospect, I believe more government support could have been provided to homeowners.  Although the Federal Reserve did not have the authority to implement a mortgage modification loan program, we did implement a mortgage-backed securities purchase program to lower mortgage interest rates.   \n\n13 Several other conditions had to be satisfied as well.\n\n14 Although considerable progress has been made in ending TBTF, I think it is premature to declare victory.  Some banks still have work to do to make their resolution plans credible, and there needs to be more work on cross-border issues to ensure that such a resolution would proceed smoothly.\n\n15 Each Board is made up of nine members divided evenly into Class A, B, and C directors.  The Class A directors represent the banks of the District that are Federal Reserve member banks, the Class B and C directors represent the broader public interest.  Only eligible Class B and Class C directors can participate in the process for selecting Reserve Bank presidents.\n\n16 The selection of the President consists of two steps: Appointment of the Reserve Bank president by the Board of Directors, and approval of the appointment by the Board of Governors. For details see: http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/how-is-a-federal-reserve-bank-president-selected.htm\n\n17 There is one exception, but it has little actual significance.  Boards of Directors do make recommendations concerning changes in the primary credit (discount) rate.  However, these recommendations only go into effect by an affirmative vote by the Board of Governors.  Also, if the Board of Governors wanted to change the primary credit rate and no recommendations were available to act upon, the Board legally could move unilaterally.  In fact, what would likely happen in this unlikely circumstance would be a phone call to one or more Reserve Banks to ask for the desired recommendation and rapid compliance with the Board of Governors’ request.  \n\n18 The Board of Governors plays an important role in the oversight of the Reserve Banks.  The Board of Governors regularly evaluates Reserve Bank operations and each Bank’s budget The Reserve Banks conduct supervision under delegated authority from the Board of Governors.  Reserve Bank directors continue to have no role in bank supervision.   \n\n19 See The Fed at a crossroads, Where to go next? Brookings Institution panel remarks, October 15, 2015.\n\n20 A historical example was the disclosure of Reconstruction Finance Corporation loans to banks in the Great Depression. This disclosure often created runs at the respective banks.

        "title": "Opening Remarks at the Conference on Supervising Large, Complex Financial Institutions: Defining Objectives and Measuring Effectiveness",
        "content": "Welcome.  It is great to see all of you here today to discuss the objectives and measurement of supervision for large, complex financial institutions.\n\nNearly eight years have passed since the financial crisis hit, pushing the financial system and the U.S. economy to the brink, and leaving scars that are still evident today. The hardships of the financial crisis are unfortunately still open wounds for too many people, especially those who lost their jobs, homes or businesses, or those who struggled with the sharp fall in value of their homes and with staying current on their debts and bills.  Understanding what went wrong and how to avoid severe financial crises in the future is, I am sure, an issue foremost in the minds of all the distinguished speakers here today, and I am no exception.  Before continuing, let me indicate that what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nA central part of the financial crisis was the failure or near-failure of many large financial institutions—both institutions that were supervised by the Federal Reserve and many that were not—which constrained their ability to play their crucial role in supplying credit and financial services to businesses and consumers.  In the wake of the crisis, considerable attention has been devoted to the role that supervisors—including those here at the New York Fed—played in this meltdown.  But much of this discussion has taken place without a broad understanding of what supervisors actually do—the scope, breadth, and limits of their activities and authorities.  Within the official sector, we make a distinction between regulation—the rules governing what financial institutions must and must not do, and supervision—which involves monitoring, oversight and enforcing compliance with law, regulation and supervisory expectations for firms’ governance, internal processes and controls, and financial condition.  This distinction between regulation and supervision is often not well-understood, and thus their complementary roles are not always fully appreciated. \n\nAddressing this distinction, as we see it, is one important motivation for this conference.  Through the papers presented today and the discussions by noted academic researchers, policymakers and senior supervisors from the U.S. and overseas, we hope to broaden the understanding of the role and objectives of supervision.  The goal is to spur conversation and new research on what supervision should be trying to achieve and the best means for achieving those ends.  Just as important, we want to generate ideas for how to better assess the effectiveness of supervisory activities.  In a world of limited resources, how do we deploy our people and technology in the most effective way to limit disruption and distress at individual firms and to the financial system, while still fostering an efficient and innovative financial system?\n\nIn considering these questions, a good starting point is to understand more fully what supervisors do and how they do it in the current environment.  The papers that are being presented here today are largely aimed at achieving this goal.  As described in the first paper—“Supervising Large, Complex Financial Institutions: What do Supervisors Do?”—bank supervision has long been an integral component of the Federal Reserve’s responsibilities.  At a broad level, Federal Reserve supervision of large financial institutions is guided by two key objectives: “enhancing the resiliency of a firm to lower the probability of its failure or inability to serve as a financial intermediary [and] reducing the impact on the financial system and the broader economy in the event of a firm’s failure or material weakness.”2 In addressing these objectives, bank supervisors enforce laws and regulations, but there is much more to supervision than just enforcement.  The activities and practices at large, complex financial organizations are simply too intricate and evolve too quickly to be fully described ex ante in regulation.  Banking supervision works in concert with regulation as the more flexible element of banking policy.  Supervisory policy and standards can, and do, evolve over time to reflect the evolution in practice in the banking industry and in financial markets.\n\nOverall, supervisors are guided by the mandate to identify any practices or conditions at supervised firms that are a threat to the safety and soundness of those firms—and, of course, to ensure that the firms take all necessary steps to promptly remediate any such conditions.  Critically, the definition of what constitutes “safe and sound” is not hard-coded into regulation, but is guided by the information and analysis done by supervisors and other Federal Reserve staff, such as economists, attorneys and market analysts.  Supervisory expectations and standards are expressed through public guidance such as Supervision and Regulation Letters (SR Letters), publicly-posted examination manuals and other guidance. \n\nOn a day-to-day basis, banking supervisors collect information on financial institutions through examinations and analysis.  Examiners look at key aspects of a supervised firm’s businesses and risk management functions.  They use this information to assess the adequacy of the firm’s systems and processes for identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling risks at the firm and in the financial sector more generally.  That said, the ultimate responsibility for risk identification and risk management remains with the supervised institution.  The Federal Reserve’s role is to ensure that the institution has the necessary strong processes in place to achieve this objective.  As risks emerge, supervisors intervene, within the realms of their safety and soundness mandates, to require that banks take corrective actions as necessary.  Supervision can reduce the chance that a financial firm fails, but it can never provide a guarantee against failure.\n\nSupervisory policies have undergone important changes over the past few years, especially in the context of the largest financial institutions.  Banking supervision no longer focuses solely on the safety and soundness of individual institutions—so-called micro-prudential supervision—but now also focuses on the implications for financial stability more generally.  The evolving supervisory framework has resulted in a number of organizational changes in the way supervision is conducted at the New York Fed and in the Federal Reserve System more broadly. A very important change in the Federal Reserve System is that supervision of the largest, most systemically important financial institutions are now coordinated across districts through the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee (LISCC).  The LISCC is a System-wide committee, chaired by the director of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve’s Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation, and composed of senior officers at the Board and Reserve Banks. \n\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve has instituted three major horizontal evaluations, which are a key element of the new enhanced supervisory framework for large banking companies.  These horizontal evaluations, which focus on capital adequacy, liquidity resiliency and preparedness for recovery and resolution, examine practices and conditions across a group of firms simultaneously, enabling supervisors to develop peer perspectives about best practices and approaches.  These programs involve a consistent and systematic assessment of the financial strength and operational resiliency of the largest and most complex financial institutions, addressing both micro-prudential safety-and-soundness supervisory goals and broader macro-prudential financial stability objectives. \n\nSpecifically, in the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), which applies to firms with at least $50 billion in total assets, Federal Reserve supervisors assess whether bank holding companies have sufficient capital to continue operations through times of economic and financial stress, and whether they have robust, forward-looking capital-planning processes that take into account whatever unique risks they might face.  By including forward-looking elements, the CCAR complements the enhanced Basel capital requirements now being implemented in the United States.  In addition, the Comprehensive Liquidity Analysis and Review (CLAR), which applies to LISCC firms, reviews the liquidity positions and liquidity risk management of large, complex banking organizations, including internal stress-testing practices.  Finally, the Federal Reserve does an annual evaluation of the LISCC firms' options to support recovery and progress in removing impediments to orderly resolution in the Supervisory Assessment of Recovery and Resolution Preparedness (SRP).\n\nWhile these evaluations form the core of the supervisory program for large, complex banking companies, they are far from the only important activities pursued by supervisors.  Day-to-day oversight of individual firms is a critical complement to these cross-firm, horizontal evaluations.  There are three key channels that generate insight on firms: 1) continuous monitoring through meetings with bank senior management, business line management, risk managers, auditors and others; 2) review and analysis of internal reports; and 3) independent analysis by supervisory teams.  These insights guide supervisory assessments and supervisory actions for individual institutions, as well as contributing to the assessments made as part of CCAR, CLAR and other horizontal exercises.\n\nWe have come a long way since the financial crisis, and the financial sector today is much more resilient as a result of the evolving supervisory framework.  However, more work still lies ahead.  A key challenge in assessing the effectiveness of supervision is that much of what supervisors do, by necessity, is confidential.  This reliance on confidential information and confidential actions can make supervision seem mysterious to outsiders, which complicates the evaluation of what policies may be effective or ineffective.  For example, if a bank fails, is this evidence of poor supervision, or instead evidence that even good supervision can’t prevent all bank failures? Improving our ability to do this diagnosis is critical.  I am confident that today's panels and paper discussions will help us move forward in this direction.  \n\nThank you for participating in this conference.  \n\n1 Beverly Hirtle, David Lucca and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\n2 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. “Consolidated Supervision Framework for Large Financial Institutions.”  Supervision and Regulation Letter 12-17.

        "content": "Thank you, Deputy Governor Chen, for the opportunity to speak at this inaugural People’s Bank of China and Federal Reserve Bank of New York 2016 Joint Symposium. It is a wonderful occasion for our two central banks to meet and share ideas on important global macroeconomic and monetary policy issues.\n\nIt is especially satisfying to me to be here in Hangzhou to see the result of my discussion last February with Governor Zhou about this kind of policy and research exchange. I thank you and the staff of The People’s Bank of China for developing this idea into such an ambitious work agenda, and for assembling such a distinguished group of contributors and participants for this symposium. We at the New York Fed look forward to future collaborative efforts to strengthen the relationship between our two institutions, especially given the key roles that China and the United States play in the global economy. By working together I believe we can achieve better outcomes for our countries and for the global economy. Today, although I will focus mainly on the U.S. economic outlook, I also will discuss how global economic and financial market developments factor into my thinking about U.S. monetary policy. As always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nU.S. Economic Outlook\nRecent economic and financial developments have not yet led me to make a fundamental change in my outlook for U.S. growth in 2016. At this point, I have marked down my growth outlook very modestly. However, financial market conditions have tightened since the start of the year, mostly in response to international developments. If this tightening of financial conditions were to persist, it could potentially lead to a more significant downgrade to my outlook.\n\nI continue to expect that the economy will expand over the course of this year at a pace slightly above its long-term trend—sufficient to push the unemployment rate down a bit further and to more fully utilize the nation’s labor resources. On inflation, we continue to fall short of our 2 percent objective for the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) deflator. This shortfall looks likely to continue longer than I had earlier anticipated due to the persistent strength of the dollar and weakness in energy prices. However, I continue to expect a gradual return to our 2 percent objective as the transitory factors that have held down inflation dissipate.\n\nIn assessing the current state of the U.S. economy, there are divergent signals, with weakness in some spending and production indicators, but robustness in a number of labor market indicators. In the fourth quarter, investment spending for both equipment and structures fell, and net exports and inventory investment were drags on growth. These developments partly reflect the slowing of global growth and the impact of the dollar’s appreciation since mid-2014. This weakness has been particularly evident in U.S. manufacturing. However, the latest ISM non-manufacturing index suggests the possibility of a slower pace of growth also in the services sector, which has been relatively robust. Consumer spending growth—which had been a brighter spot for most of 2015—also slowed notably in the fourth quarter.\n\nIn contrast, the U.S. labor market has remained healthy and supportive of growth. Over the course of 2015, payroll employment increased an average of about 228,000 per month. Although the January increase of 151,000 was below last year’s pace, other aspects of the report were strong. The January data indicated substantial gains in wages and hours worked, which implies healthy real income growth for the household sector. Moreover, the amount of slack in the labor market continues to diminish based on a number of measures. The unemployment rate declined to 4.9 percent. This was accompanied by further declines in both the share of people working part-time that would like full-time work, as well as the share of people not part of the labor force. Consistent with a tighter labor market, the share of the working-age population that is employed has risen gradually, and the labor force participation rate has stabilized.\n\nWhile the weakness in some indicators has led me to make small reductions in my forecast, my overall outlook has not changed substantially. In making this determination, a central question is how to reconcile these cross-currents. One has to also factor in that the real GDP growth rate in the fourth quarter was only 1.0 percent and the four-quarter change was 1.9 percent—low even by the subdued standards of this expansion. It is important, though, to recognize that a number of transitory factors held down growth in the fourth quarter—most notably lower utility spending due to warm weather and a decline in the rate of inventory investment.\n\nAs these transitory factors depressing the pace of economic growth dissipate, the core strengths for the economy should reassert themselves. I anticipate that consumption and housing activity will expand at a moderate pace. Continued job and wage gains, as well as low energy prices, should support real disposable income growth and consumer spending. Retail sales in January provide evidence of this support. The housing market should remain on a solid trajectory, supported by rising employment and low mortgage rates. In addition, the fiscal 2016 budget package passed at the end of last year, which extended a number of tax breaks and eased caps on spending, means that fiscal policy should provide a moderate stimulus this year. I believe that these positive factors should be sufficient to offset weakness in manufacturing and business-fixed investment.\n\nPutting this all together, I expect real GDP growth of about 2 percent in 2016, slightly below the average pace of growth in this expansion, and a bit above my estimate of the potential growth of the U.S. economy. If this materializes, then we should see some further reduction in the unemployment rate to around my estimate of the rate—about 4¾ percent—that I view as consistent with stable inflation over the long term.\n\nTurning to the outlook for inflation, headline inflation on a year-over-year basis has begun to rise as the sharp falls in energy prices in late 2014 and early 2015 are removed from the calculations. However, inflation still remains well below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent objective. As the FOMC has noted in its statements, this continued low inflation is partly due to recent further declines in energy prices and ongoing impacts of a stronger dollar on non-energy import prices. Although energy prices will eventually stop falling and the dollar will stop appreciating, these factors appear to have had a more persistent depressing influence on inflation than previously anticipated.\n\nThis continued period of low headline inflation is a concern, in part, because it could lead to significantly lower inflation expectations. If this drop in inflation expectations were to occur, it would, in turn, tend to depress future inflation. Evidence on the inflation expectations front suggests some cause for concern. In particular, market-based measures of longer-term inflation compensation derived from nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury securities have fallen to very low levels. In addition, some survey measures of household inflation expectations have recently moved lower.\n\nWith respect to the market-based measures, there are some reasons to discount the decline. Several term structure models, including those estimated at the New York Fed, attribute most of this decline to a decrease in term premiums—what investors demand for insurance against inflation risks—and not to a decrease in long-term inflation expectations. These models suggest that, over the indicated horizon, investors anticipate that low growth will occur along with low inflation. Still, given the extent to which inflation compensation has fallen since mid-2014, I believe that it is prudent to consider the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations of market participants may have declined somewhat.\n\nWhat I find more concerning is the decline in some household survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations. For example, the median of three-year expectations from the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations has declined over the past year to its lowest reading in the survey’s short history, and the longer-running University of Michigan measure is at the bottom of its historical range. Further declines in either measure would be worrisome. To date, these declines have not been sufficiently large for me to conclude that inflation expectations have become unanchored. However, these developments merit close scrutiny, as past experience shows that it is difficult to push inflation back up to the central bank’s objective if inflation expectations fall meaningfully below that objective. Japan’s experience is cautionary in this regard.\n\nIn sum, I still anticipate that the combination of decreasing resource slack and anchored longer-term inflation expectations will contribute to inflation rising to our 2 percent objective over the medium term. Even so, because of the more persistent effects of energy and commodity price declines and U.S. dollar appreciation, the return of inflation to that goal may be slower than I earlier anticipated. This does not deny the possibility of some upside surprise―such as a sharp upswing in wage growth triggered by low unemployment. But, on balance, I am somewhat less confident than I was before. Partly, this reflects my assessment that uncertainty to the outlook has increased and that downside risks have crept up, a topic to which I now turn.\n\nAssessment of Risks to the Outlook\nThe forecast that I have just described is my best assessment of how the U.S. economy will evolve over 2016. But there is uncertainty and risk relative to this baseline forecast, which also needs to be taken into consideration in assessing the implications of the outlook for monetary policy.\n\nThere are two key considerations to this risk assessment. First, are the perceived uncertainties about the forecast higher, lower or about average as compared to the past? Second, are the risks symmetric around the baseline forecast or skewed upward or downward? The level of uncertainty is important in that it relates to the expected magnitude of forecast errors. The balance of risks is important in that it relates to the expected sign of those forecast errors.\n\nAt the New York Fed, we use surveys, internal models and judgment in forming our risk assessment. Some surveys, such as the U.S. Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF), ask respondents for both point and density forecasts. The density forecasts take the form of respondents filling out a histogram of their probability assessments that the forecasted outcome will fall into given intervals. These histograms can be aggregated and the resulting aggregate distribution can be used to assess both the level of uncertainty as well as the balance of risks. Recent U.S. SPF surveys have not indicated any significant changes in the overall degree of uncertainty around growth or inflation. The balance of risks have been roughly symmetric for inflation and tilted to the downside for growth.\n\nWe supplement this survey evidence with assessments from internal models. These models are data-driven and estimate percentiles of the distribution of possible forecast outcomes for growth and inflation. Our estimated models have indicated a greater degree of uncertainty than reflected in the U.S. SPF, and suggest downside risk to both the growth and inflation forecast. But, I would caution that these models are still relatively new in terms of their development and their results need to be supplemented by judgment.\n\nNow, putting these inputs and my judgment together, I see the uncertainties around my forecast to be greater than the typical levels of the past. This assessment reflects the divergent economic signals I highlighted earlier, and is consistent with the turbulence we have seen in global financial markets. At this moment, I judge that the balance of risks to my growth and inflation outlooks may be starting to tilt slightly to the downside. The recent tightening of financial market conditions could have a greater negative impact on the U.S. economy should this tightening prove persistent and the continuing decline in energy and commodity prices may signal greater and more persistent disinflationary pressures in the global economy than I currently anticipate. I am closely monitoring global economic and financial market developments to assess their implications for my outlook and the balance of risks.\n\nU.S. Monetary Policy in a Global Environment\nThus far, my remarks have focused on the U.S. outlook and the risks relative to this outlook. This focus is appropriate. Like other central banks, our monetary policy mandate concerns domestic objectives: maximum sustainable employment and price stability. Our monetary policy actions, however, often have global consequences that, in turn, influence the U.S. economy and financial markets. At the same time, external factors can impact the monetary policy transmission mechanism in the U.S. and influence the effectiveness of our monetary policy in achieving our objectives. We cannot appropriately calibrate policy without keeping these spillover and feedback effects in mind.\n\nIn some cases, these effects can be significant. An example is the market volatility we saw in the spring and summer of 2013 during the so-called “taper tantrum.” In the U.S., we saw a spike in Treasury yields, with the 10-year rate rising by more than 100 basis points from early May of that year before peaking in September. Financial markets in emerging market economies (EME) were hit hard as well, with declines in equity prices, a widening in sovereign debt spreads and a sharp increase in foreign exchange volatility.\n\nVolatility in EME financial markets reemerged last summer and has continued into this year. For EMEs as a group, declines in equity prices and currency values have been larger than what we experienced during the taper tantrum. The recent episode, however, appears to largely reflect concerns about risks emanating from EMEs themselves, rather than concerns about the direction of Fed policy.\n\nThree related concerns appear to be at the forefront. First, there has been a broad-based slowdown in EME growth. This slowdown is not new. Each year since 2012, EME growth has come in well short of expectations that existed at the start of the year. It is difficult, however, for market participants to recognize and adjust to large structural shifts in real time. There is still considerable uncertainty about the trajectory of long-term EME growth, and therefore the appropriate pricing of EME financial assets. In that context, heightened market volatility is not surprising.\n\nSecond, this slowdown in EME growth is happening after a long upswing in credit expansion in these countries. Based on BIS data for 23 of the largest EMEs, since the end of 2007 credit to their private nonfinancial sectors has risen from roughly 80 to 135 percent of GDP. In several countries, the increase in private credit penetration exceeds 40 percent of GDP—roughly the same order of magnitude that we witnessed in other periods that preceded financial crises. Although the magnitude of the EME credit boom has been apparent for some time, with EME growth now on a more subdued trajectory and the global financial environment less forgiving, market participants have begun to sharpen their focus on the risk of larger than expected credit losses as the credit cycle reverses.\n\nThird, China has entered a period of economic transition, from a growth model based on investment, manufacturing and rapid state-directed credit growth to one emphasizing consumption, services and more sustainable market-directed credit intermediation. This transition also involves a downshift in China’s trend growth rate, which is inevitable given the level of economic development in China and the shrinking margin of underutilized labor market resources. Economic transitions are always difficult to manage, and invariably present policymakers with unexpected challenges. It is not surprising, then, that market participants are focused on the risk that the downshift in Chinese growth could prove to be more pronounced than anticipated. I want to be clear. The rebalancing process now underway in China is both necessary and appropriate, and will unfold over a period of years. How to pragmatically strike the best balance between progress on long-term reform and support for short-term growth is, of course, a matter for policymakers in China. You can be sure that you will have the backing of the official international community as you oversee this important transformation.\n\nFinally, the slowdown in Chinese and broader EME growth has been a key factor behind the sharp drop in global commodity prices since mid-2014. The income streams accruing to commodity export countries have been adversely impacted, requiring sometimes painful downward adjustments in investment and economic activity in these countries. Here, too, it may take time for markets to find a new equilibrium, as investment projects that were based on the price structure prevailing a few years ago are still coming online.\n\nIn most cases, EMEs appear to have the tools and the resources to help manage their way through the current period of difficulties. There are fewer of the pegged exchange rate regimes that often came violently undone during past periods of acute market stress. Monetary policy regimes are generally better structured and more coherent. Banking systems are better capitalized and supported by stronger regulatory and supervisory frameworks. Foreign exchange reserve cushions are larger and generally still ample. I think we can remain cautiously optimistic about EMEs’ prospects overall in the years ahead, although particular countries will face considerable challenges over the near term.\n\nHow will we at the Fed take in and respond to these developments? As I’ve already noted, foreign developments factor into our assessment of the U.S. outlook. Recent FOMC statements have sometimes made this connection explicit, noting that the Committee will be monitoring foreign economic and financial conditions closely. The weakness we have been seeing in EME economies and markets is one of the considerations behind the Committee’s assessment that the appropriate pace of policy normalization is likely to be gradual.\n\nThe federal funds rate is only one element of the broader set of financial conditions affecting the U.S. growth and inflation outlook. Tighter financial conditions abroad do spill back into the U.S. economy, and policymakers must take this into account in their assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Of course, this does not mean that we will let market volatility dictate our policy stance. There is no such a thing as a “Fed put.” What we care about is the country’s growth and inflation prospects, and we take financial market developments into consideration only to the extent that they affect the economic outlook.\n\nOur focus on the global implications of our policies also has a broader dimension. Given the central place of U.S. markets in the global financial system and the dollar’s status as the leading global reserve currency, we in the United States have a special responsibility to be good stewards of the global economic commons. This makes it all the more important that we conduct policy transparently and according to clear principles.\n\nThis highlights the importance of effective Fed communication. I noted earlier our attempts in the spring of 2013 to provide guidance about the potential timing and pace of tapering may have served to confuse market participants. Market participants seemed to conflate the prospective tapering of asset purchases with monetary policy tightening, and pulled forward their expectations about the likely timing of liftoff, thus raising their expected path for the federal funds rate. Since then, we have adjusted our approach with improved results. The actual tapering of the Fed’s asset purchase program went smoothly and liftoff of our policy rate from the zero lower bound was in line with widely held market expectations. While the future path of policy is not on a pre-set course and must remain data dependent, we will strive to be similarly effective in our communications going forward.\n\nAs you know, we’ve taken a number of steps in recent years to increase transparency and improve our communications. This includes regular press conferences by the Fed chair following FOMC meetings; the publishing of growth, inflation, unemployment and federal funds rate projections by FOMC participants; a concerted attempt to lay out the guideposts that the FOMC will look at to assess progress toward our mandate; and an equally concerted attempt to lay out how our various policy tools―such as interest on reserves, overnight reverse repurchase (ON RRP) operations and reinvestment of principal payments from our asset holdings—will be used to pursue our objectives.\n\nWe are also working to be better stewards in safeguarding financial stability. Simply put, we failed to act early enough and decisively enough to stem the credit excesses that spawned the financial crisis and Great Recession. The U.S. was not alone in this shortcoming, but, given our position in the global financial system, we should have done better. We’ve taken important steps through new legislative mandates and a broader effort to rethink our regulatory and supervisory framework. In particular, systemically important banking organizations must now hold capital and liquidity buffers that are better aligned with their risk profiles. Many other changes have also been implemented, such as the central clearing of standardized over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives contracts, which should help make the global financial system more resilient and robust.\n\nWhile these efforts remain a work in progress, I think they will reduce the risk of repeating the mistakes of the past decade, and enable us to take a more proactive stance toward addressing potential future vulnerabilities. Of course, we at the Fed are not alone here. Since the financial crisis, central banks worldwide have been engaged in a broad rethinking of how better to fulfill their mandates.\n\nLet me close with a final thought. Adam Smith in the Wealth of Nations introduced the concept of the “invisible hand.” Smith argued that individuals acting in their self-interest can collectively promote the public interest. This concept, I believe, also often applies to international monetary policy.2 The biggest problems that countries create for others often stem from getting policy wrong domestically. Recession or instability at home is often quickly exported abroad. Equally important, growth and stability abroad makes it easier to set policy at home. Central banks, therefore, by individually acting on their domestic economy mandates, can collectively promote the global economy.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.\n\n1 Matthew Higgins, Jonathan McCarthy, Paolo Pesenti and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\n2 There are important exceptions of course. Two noteworthy exceptions include “beggar-thy-neighbor” policies in which countries engage in unilateral competitive currency devaluation and trade protectionism."

        "title": "Remarks at the New York Fed’s Economic Press Briefing on the Household Debt and Credit Report",
        "content": "Good morning and welcome to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Economic Press Briefing.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak with you today about the economic outlook, with a focus on the household sector.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the current expansion began in July 2009, making it nearly seven years old.  If we gathered this expansion and the 11 prior post-WWII expansions together for a family photograph, arranging them by age from youngest in front to oldest in back, this expansion would be standing third from the rear.  The only two that lasted longer were the expansion that began in February of 1961, which lasted for nearly nine years, and the one that began in March of 1991, which lasted for ten years.  Thus, the current expansion is already an elder statesman in the family of post-war U.S. expansions.  This raises the question of whether this expansion has already entered its twilight years, with the risk of recession edging higher with each passing month.\n\nAs I have said before, expansions do not simply die of old age.2 Rather, expansions end either because a significant inflation risk emerges that requires a sharp tightening of monetary policy, or the economy is adversely impacted by a large shock that cannot be offset by monetary policy in a timely manner.  While the sample of post-war U.S. expansions is still too small for reliable statistical analysis, the evidence suggests that after an expansion’s first few years its likelihood of ending is mostly independent of age, and depends mainly instead on the level of inflation.  Since the possibility is low that a significant inflation risk would emerge over the near term, this means that the main danger facing the current expansion is the risk of large, adverse shocks.\n\nGiven that the labor market still appears to have some excess slack and inflation is below the Federal Reserve’s objective, monetary policy is appropriately still quite accommodative despite the advancing age of the expansion.  While this limits to an extent the degree to which monetary policy can aggressively respond to any adverse events, the good news is that the economy is more resilient to any shocks.  Key sectors of the U.S. economy, such as the household sector, seem to be in good shape.  The financial system is also clearly much stronger, with the banking system much better capitalized and with much larger liquidity buffers than in the years preceding the financial crisis. \n\nIn today’s briefing, we will be focusing on the household sector.  Given the importance of consumption to U.S. economic growth, the health of the household sector is critical for an assessment of risks to the outlook.  Over the last several years we have devoted significant resources to better understanding the state of the household sector, and one outcome of this attention is our now well-known Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit.  This report, and the data that underlie it, give us direct insight into the health of the household balance sheet.  The assets and liabilities that families hold is a crucial determinant of the household sector’s ability to help immunize the economy from shocks.  We learned during the Great Recession the importance of household liabilities—in particular, mortgages, which make up more than two-thirds of the sector’s total liabilities.\n\nAs you know, the early part of the 2000s witnessed a very substantial expansion in borrowing by households.  This borrowing took many forms, but was particularly notable in mortgages and home equity lines of credit, and reflected the very high and unsustainable expectations of house price appreciation.  Household debts peaked in 2008, at which point the sector’s balance sheet was weak.  Households were highly-leveraged, with many underwater on their mortgages.  This was particularly the case for younger and lower- and middle-income households who, besides being more leveraged, were disproportionally affected by job loss and other income shocks, and had little experience managing debts―especially in times of stress.  Consequently, delinquency, foreclosure and bankruptcy rates reached very high levels.\n\nBeginning in 2008, households began a new phase to repair their balance sheets by paying down outstanding debt.  During this “Great Deleveraging,” which lasted five years, households reduced their overall liabilities by 12 percent or $1.5 trillion.  House prices began to rise again in earnest in 2012, and by mid-2013 household deleveraging appeared to have come to an end.  Net household borrowing resumed, and household debt has risen over 8 percent during the last couple of years.  But, this recent period of credit expansion looks very different from the early 2000s, and I believe that the household sector today is in much better health.  There are several reasons for my confidence.\n\nLet me begin with the situation in the residential mortgage market, which plays such a dominant role in household finance and was such a problem the last time around.  Currently, house price growth is running nationally at around 5 percent per year.  But this time, households appear to be much more cautious in how they are responding to the rise in home values.  Rather than borrowing against the rising equity in their homes, mortgage balances have instead essentially stabilized and remain well below their previous levels.  As my colleagues will describe in more detail shortly, this stabilization reflects an increase in debt paydown due to a combination of lower interest rates, shorter loan terms and aging of mortgages.  This trend is reflected in increased household saving and growing home equity, and we expect these trends to continue to help households rebuild their balance sheets over the near term, thereby further increasing the household sector’s resiliency to shocks.\n\nLow interest rates have also been important in driving the household debt service ratio to the lowest levels observed in our data.  This means that households have more capacity with which to absorb any temporary adverse income shocks.  One clear reflection of these improvements is the very significant decline in delinquency rates.  At this point, the great majority of the bad debt from the boom years has been charged off and new foreclosures are at the lowest level we’ve seen in our data.  The combination of charge-offs and tight mortgage underwriting standards over the last several years has shifted the stock of outstanding mortgage balances toward lower-risk borrowers, who are typically older with more stable incomes.\n\nFor all these reasons, the household sector looks much better positioned today than in 2008 to absorb shocks and continue to contribute to the economic expansion.\n\nNow, before asking my colleagues to discuss some of these trends in more detail, let me note that my positive overview of the household sector comes with some caveats.  First, these aggregate statistics can mask some important variations, and there are some local markets where, as in the prior boom, both house prices and mortgage growth are quite strong.  Similarly, there exist substantial differences across households in their financial situation and their ability to improve their balance sheets.  Borrowers with little equity, low credit scores and slow income growth face difficulties refinancing into low rate mortgages.  As a result, this subset of the population has been less able to deleverage and still faces relatively high debt service costs, which constrains their consumption, investment and saving behavior.  So, even within what looks to be a stable overall mortgage market, there are some things that we must continue to monitor.  Second, there are other difficult challenges that many households face, particularly with respect to a subject we’ve discussed on previous occasions―student loans.  On balance, though, households are in a much better position today than they were in 2008.  Now, I'd like to turn things over to our economists, beginning with Andrew Haughwout, who will provide a more detailed discussion of household sector finances.\n\n1 Domenico Giannone, Andrew Haughwout, Joseph Tracy and Wilbert van der Klaauw assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\n2 See William C. Dudley, The U.S. Economic Outlook and Implications for Monetary Policy, Remarks at the Economic Leadership Forum, Somerset, New Jersey."

        "content": "It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to join you again at the Economic Leadership Forum.  I would like to thank John McWeeney of the New Jersey Bankers Association and Rutgers University for the invitation to be here today.  Northern New Jersey is a vital part of the New York Fed’s district, and I don’t just say that because I live here.  My staff and I actively maintain ties with local community, business and banking leaders, and we always benefit from opportunities to hear about what is on your mind. \n\nI am particularly delighted to see that community banks are well represented here today.  The Federal Reserve understands the importance of a vibrant community banking sector and the crucial role community banks play in supporting the activities of local businesses and households.  While protecting the safety and soundness of the financial system is an important part of the Federal Reserve’s mandate, I believe that the regulation of community banks should be appropriately calibrated to reflect the lower degree of risk they pose to the financial system relative to larger banks.  In other words, community banks should not be subject to the same set of regulations that are applied to the most systemically important banking organizations.\n\nIn my remarks, I will discuss the U.S. economic outlook and the implications for U.S. monetary policy. I will focus primarily on last month’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) “lift-off” decision—the first increase in the federal funds rate target range in nearly 10 years. I’ll explain what motivated my vote to begin to normalize U.S. monetary policy. I’ll also offer a preliminary assessment of how things are going so far―both with respect to how the U.S. bond market reacted to lift-off and how well our new tools are working as we begin to push up short-term interest rates. Both issues are pertinent, as money market rates have spent a very long time close to zero and we have never attempted to tighten monetary policy with such a large balance sheet and high level of excess reserves. To summarize my conclusions: Generally so far, so good on both fronts.\n\nLooking ahead, I’ll talk about what comes next. No surprises here—it depends on the data. As noted in the December FOMC statement, we expect that the normalization of monetary policy will be quite gradual. But, there is no commitment here. The flow of the data—broadly defined―will drive our actions as it influences our assessment of the economic outlook and our view of the stance of monetary policy best suited to achieve our dual mandate objectives of maximum sustainable employment and price stability. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the FOMC or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nIn terms of the economic outlook, the situation does not appear to have changed much since the last FOMC meeting. Some recent activity indicators have been on the softer side, pointing to a relatively weak fourth quarter for real GDP growth. But this needs to be weighed against the strength evident in the U.S. labor market. I continue to expect that the economy will expand at a pace slightly above its long-term trend in 2016. In other words, I anticipate sufficient economic strength to push the unemployment rate down a bit further and to more fully utilize the nation’s labor resources.\n\nTurning to inflation, we continue to fall short of our 2 percent objective for the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) deflator. But I take it as a positive sign that the core PCE inflation rate—that is, excluding food and energy—has been quite stable despite the downward pressure being exerted by lower energy prices on the prices of non-energy goods and services, as well as the drop in non-energy import prices from a firmer dollar.\n\nGoing into more detail, U.S. economic activity has areas of both strength and weakness. On the stronger side of the ledger, domestic demand is doing reasonably well. In particular, consumption and housing activity continue to expand at a moderate pace. Consumer spending has been supported by solid real disposable income growth, which has been underpinned, in turn, by sturdy job gains and falling energy prices. Residential investment has been slowly increasing for several years and that trend seems likely to continue in 2016. Housing starts are still well below the rate consistent with the nation’s population growth rate, and the fundamentals of housing demand remain positive. Rising employment is likely to boost the household formation rate and low mortgage interest rates should keep housing relatively affordable, despite the ongoing recovery in home prices. Last month’s passage of a fiscal 2016 budget package should also provide support to economic activity. Not only does this budget package reduce uncertainty about the budgetary outlook, but its extension of a number of tax breaks and easing of the caps on domestic and military spending means that fiscal policy in 2016 will likely turn somewhat stimulative.\n\nOn the weaker side, the collapse in energy prices continues to pull down domestic investment in oil and gas drilling projects. Although this adjustment is now well-advanced, I suspect that there remains a further leg down given the sector’s diminished cash flows and the reduced access to credit. In addition, manufacturing remains very soft—hurt by the drop in energy-related investment, an ongoing inventory adjustment and the loss of competitiveness caused by the persistent strength of the U.S. dollar. Even the one bright spot in manufacturing over the past year—the auto sector—seems to be close to a cyclical peak. Thus, I suspect manufacturing will continue to be soft in 2016. Overseas developments, especially with respect to the emerging market economies, pose a risk to the U.S. economic outlook—potentially exerting greater restraint on the demand for U.S. exports and contributing to greater turbulence in global financial markets. Putting these positives and negatives together, the most likely outlook seems to be more of what we have experienced in this expansion—an economy that grows at slightly above a 2 percent annual rate this year.\n\nThe inflation outlook also has not changed much. Inflation remains well below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent objective. In my assessment, this is due mainly to weaker energy prices and the impact of a stronger dollar on non-energy import prices. However, the fact that core measures of inflation are considerably higher than the headline readings, and have been quite stable in recent months, suggests to me that we are likely to see inflation rise once energy prices stop falling and the dollar stops appreciating—clearly neither trend can persist indefinitely. Of course, this assumes that the U.S. economy grows sufficiently rapidly so that pressure on available labor and capital resources continues to increase.\n\nWith respect to the risks to the inflation outlook, the most concerning is the possibility that inflation expectations become unanchored to the downside. This would be problematic were it to occur because inflation expectations are an important driver of actual inflation. If inflation expectations become unanchored to the downside, it would become much more difficult to push inflation back up to the central bank’s objective. Japan’s difficult experience indicates the importance of avoiding such an outcome.\n\nFor this reason, we closely monitor inflation expectations. Inflation measured by the PCE deflator has been running below the FOMC’s objective since May 2012. A concern is whether these persistent underruns in inflation may be beginning to weigh on inflation expectations. Some surveys of inflation expectations have softened recently. For example, the University of Michigan measure of median long-term household inflation expectations—that is, expected inflation at a five-to ten-year horizon—is currently at 2.6 percent. This is near the very bottom end of its range over the past two decades.\n\nThe New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations also shows softness. The median of 3-year inflation expectations has declined over the past year, falling by 22 basis points to 2.8 percent. While the magnitude of this decline is small, I think it is noteworthy because the current reading is below where we have been during the survey history. Up until July 2014, the median largely stayed in the range from 3.2 to 3.4 percent, and from July 2014 to July 2015 it remained near 3 percent.\n\nWhile it has a short history, I put more weight on the New York Fed’s survey because its methodology should be more robust in accurately assessing consumer inflation expectations. Compared to the more widely followed University of Michigan survey, for example, the New York Fed survey has several advantages. The sample size is larger, most of the people that are interviewed are the same each month, and the inflation expectations question is posed differently to focus the respondent’s attention on inflation rather than on prices. We believe that all these factors lead to a more reliable estimate of inflation expectations.\n\nObviously, I didn’t think the degree of weakness we have seen in our survey measure of inflation expectations was of sufficient concern to defer the start of monetary policy normalization. And, as long as the economy continues to grow at an above-trend pace, I expect the increase in resource utilization will be sufficient to push both inflation and inflation expectations higher over time. That said, should the economy unexpectedly weaken, then this fall in inflation expectations would become more concerning.\n\nAssuming, as I anticipate, that inflation does move back towards our 2 percent target, I am often asked how tolerant would I be of an overshoot? In other words, is the 2 percent inflation target a ceiling or not? I don’t think of the 2 percent objective as a ceiling. I would be equally intolerant of misses relative to 2 percent in both directions, above or below, with my intolerance growing the further we deviated from our 2 percent objective. We will almost certainly never be precisely at our 2 percent objective for any length of time given all the forces—many of which are not under our control—that influence actual inflation outcomes over a business cycle. Thus, with a neutral monetary policy, my goal would be to spend about the same amount of time slightly above as slightly below our 2 percent objective.\n\nTurning now to U.S. monetary policy, why did I favor raising the federal funds rate target last month? Basically, my assessment was that our conditions for lift-off had been met. Recall, these two conditions were: 1) further improvement in the labor market that we anticipated would be sustained in 2016, and 2) greater confidence that inflation would begin to move back towards our 2 percent inflation objective over the medium term.\n\nThe timing of policy normalization involves a balancing of risks. I don’t disagree with our critics that there were risks from lifting off in December versus waiting a little longer. First, the economy might turn out to be more fragile than we anticipate, or economic shocks could push the economy off-course relative to our expectations. In other words, our economic projections might be too optimistic. Second, the first tightening move might itself provoke another taper tantrum characterized by higher bond yields and tighter financial market conditions that could be sufficiently strong to impede the economic recovery.\n\nMy judgment was that these risks were manageable. First, downside forecast errors are certainly possible, but the U.S. economy appears to be on sufficiently sound footing to withstand downside shocks better than was the case a few years ago. Second, I felt that the likelihood of a substantial tightening in financial market conditions due to lift-off was relatively low, in part, because the rate hike was widely anticipated. Market conditions had adjusted quite smoothly—except for some strains observed in the high-yield debt market—as market participants placed higher odds of tightening in the weeks preceding the December FOMC meeting. This reinforced that conclusion. A large market reaction would have been a surprise given that this was one of the most anticipated monetary policy events in history. Also, the policy action needs to be viewed in context. While this decision was the first upward adjustment to short-term rates in nearly 10 years, the actual move was small—only 25 basis points—which, by itself, should have only a very mild impact on the overall trajectory of the economy. As we noted in the FOMC statement and as Chair Yellen pointed out in her December press conference, even after this rate hike, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative.\n\nMoreover, it is important to recognize that there are also significant risks from waiting longer to lift off. Upside forecast errors are also certainly possible. For example, while the pace of growth has generally been weaker than expected in recent years, the pace of labor market improvement has generally been stronger. By waiting, we would increase the risk that we would need to raise rates more aggressively in the future. This could unduly threaten the economic expansion. In balancing these risks, relatively “early and slow” seems like a better strategy than “late and fast”—especially when one is uncertain both about the degree of accommodation being provided by monetary policy and the level of unemployment consistent with our price stability mandate. Because monetary policy works with a lag, policy normalization needs to begin before the economy reaches its employment and inflation objectives. That is, if we are to get to a neutral monetary policy setting before inflation materially overshoots our 2 percent objective, then we need to get started. Once underway, the pace of policy tightening can be calibrated to how the economy and financial market conditions are responding.\n\nA particular risk of late and fast is that the unemployment rate could significantly undershoot the level consistent with price stability. If this occurred, then inflation would likely rise above our objective. At that point, history shows it is very difficult to push the unemployment rate back up just a little bit in order to contain inflation pressures. Looking at the post-war period, whenever the unemployment rate has increased by more than 0.3 to 0.4 percentage points, the economy has always ended up in a full-blown recession with the unemployment rate rising by at least 1.9 percentage points. This is an outcome to avoid, especially given that in an economic downturn the last to be hired are often the first to be fired. The goal is the maximum sustainable level of employment—in other words, the most job opportunities for the most people over the long run.\n\nSome of you may be wondering whether the risk of a recession isn’t already quite high? And, if so, doesn’t this imply a need for special care in adjusting monetary policy? After all, the current economic expansion is more than six years old—a bit long in the tooth by post-war standards.\n\nEven so, recession risk did not play a major factor in my thinking. Economic expansions don’t simply die of old age. They primarily end either because monetary policy is kept too loose for too long, thereby necessitating a subsequent sharp tightening in monetary policy to prevent a significant inflation overshoot, or because some large adverse shock hits the economy that the central bank cannot easily offset. Mitigating the first risk of being forced to choke off the expansion argues for getting started with policy normalization now rather than holding off. With respect to the second risk of unanticipated shocks, this is obviously very difficult for the central bank to insulate the economy from. Making sure the financial system is robust and resilient is probably the most important thing the central bank can do in this respect.\n\nI would like to turn now to the issue of how the initial step in normalization is going. The U.S. bond market response to lift-off has been very mild. There has been no bond market “taper tantrum” such as what occurred in 2013 when Chairman Bernanke discussed the possibility of tapering Federal Reserve asset purchases. Normalization is also going very well in the sense that, even with an extraordinarily large balance sheet, the tools we have developed to raise the federal funds rate (and other money market rates) have so far worked well. The federal funds rate is trading close to the middle of the new target range of 25 to 50 basis points and other money market rates have moved up in tandem.\n\nWhy is this noteworthy? To explain, I’ll first have to provide some background on how monetary policy used to work before the crisis and then compare that regime with how it works now.\n\nBefore the financial crisis, banks valued reserves―even though the Federal Reserve paid no interest on them―because the Federal Reserve kept their supply scarce. When the FOMC wanted to adjust its federal funds rate target—that is, the interest rate banks earn or pay when lending or borrowing overnight reserves with another bank—it directed the System Open Market Account (the Desk) manager in New York to alter the supply of reserves within the banking system (up or down) as needed to match the estimated demand for reserves in order to keep the federal funds rate very close to the FOMC’s target.2 In this setup, the amount of banking reserves in the system—required and excess—was very small and the Desk typically conducted open market operations that added or drained no more than a few billion dollars of reserves from the banking system to ensure that the federal funds rate traded around the FOMC’s target.\n\nIn October 2008, after passage of the TARP legislation, the Federal Reserve was authorized to implement a new tool, the ability to pay interest on required and excess reserves.3 This tool was significant because it meant that the FOMC would be able to control interest rate policy even with a much larger balance sheet and a much larger amount of excess reserves in the banking system. This was important because it gave us more scope to expand the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet to help address the financial crisis and to provide support for the economic recovery, knowing that later, when the recovery took hold, we could raise interest rates even with an enlarged balance sheet. The Fed wouldn’t necessarily be forced to return to the much smaller balance sheet we had prior to 2008 before we could begin the monetary policy normalization process.\n\nWhen interest is paid on reserves, these reserves retain value even when they are no longer scarce. Banks may be able to borrow funds at lower interest rates from financial entities such as money market funds that are not permitted to hold deposits at the Federal Reserve and place these borrowed funds with the Federal Reserve to earn the higher interest rate paid on reserve balances.\n\nHow well the ability to pay interest on reserves works in practice in raising the entire constellation of short-term interest rates depends critically on the willingness of banks to engage in such arbitrage activity. Prior to lift-off, we were uncertain how much friction there might be that would limit the willingness of banks to expand their balance sheets. These frictions include limits on bank leverage that can make the use of balance sheet capacity costly, competitive frictions given the relatively narrow range of banks that are viewed as sufficiently creditworthy to warrant being recipients of large uncollateralized loans and, for those banks that accept FDIC insured deposits, insurance premiums that increase when they borrow reserves and their total liabilities increase.\n\nTo help ensure that money market rates would track the federal funds rate regardless of these frictions, the FOMC developed a second tool—the overnight, fixed-rate, reverse repurchase facility (overnight RRP). In this facility, a number of financial entities, such as money market funds, that cannot hold reserves at the Federal Reserve can lend funds overnight to the Federal Reserve against the Fed’s Treasury collateral and receive the overnight RRP rate—currently 25 basis points. The overnight RRP provides these institutions with an alternative investment if the interest rate offered by banks is unattractive. Consequently, these financial entities should be unwilling to lend funds to banks and others at lower rates than the overnight RRP rate. The overnight RRP rate should act, therefore, as a floor on money market rates.\n\nAs I noted earlier, the tools are working as anticipated. Not only is the federal funds rate trading close to the middle of the new 25 to 50 basis point target range, but the entire complex of money market rates, such as LIBOR deposits and GCF repo, has also risen as well. Moreover, apart from a temporary spike in usage around year end, which was expected, the usage of the overnight, fixed rate reverse repo facility has fallen back to levels similar to what we saw during the testing phase. In recent days, usage has averaged less than $100 billion per day. Thus, the facility has been absorbing only a small fraction of the $2.4 trillion of excess reserves in the banking system. This demonstrates that to firm interest rates, we don’t necessarily have to drain reserves or shrink the size of our balance sheet.\n\nWe are very pleased by how well our tools are working, and this has reinforced our confidence that they will support the policy normalization process going forward. This is what we expected given our extensive testing, but there are always uncertainties that only can be resolved by actually getting underway. For example, there was some residual uncertainty about how important a factor the zero lower bound of interest rates had been in supporting the federal funds rate and other money market rates. This uncertainty now has been at least partially resolved. Even as we have moved away from the zero lower bound, the relative yield relationships we saw before December’s federal funds rate hike have persisted.\n\nSo what’s on the docket for monetary policy in 2016? The answer is that it depends on how the incoming data weighs on the outlook, and how changes in the outlook influence our views on the appropriate setting for monetary policy. What I can say is that our expectation at the December FOMC meeting was for further interest rate hikes in 2016 and beyond. Participants anticipated that the federal funds rate would likely continue on a gradual upward path. Over the longer term, FOMC participants expected that the federal funds rate would eventually reach 3 to 4 percent as inflation rose back to our 2 percent objective and the headwinds from the financial crisis that had been restraining economic activity fully dissipated.\n\nEven though this path is shallow relative to previous tightening cycles, the median federal funds rate path of FOMC participants in the December Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) is well above the path implied by the federal funds futures market. Should this be a concern? Does this imply that there is a significant risk of an abrupt future spike in short- and long-term interest rates as market rates realign to levels more consistent with the median FOMC participants’ projections?\n\nI don’t think so for several reasons. First, the SEP projections are modal forecasts—that is, what the participants believe is most likely to happen—whereas those embodied in market prices are a mean—that is, an average across all possible outcomes. One might reasonably expect these modal forecasts to be above the mean when inflation is low and the economic outlook is uncertain. Second, the median federal funds rate forecasts for primary dealers and for buyside participants surveyed just prior to the December FOMC meeting differed only marginally from the December SEP median projections of FOMC participants. This reinforces my judgment that the difference between means and modes is the main factor for the gap between the federal funds futures market and the SEP paths. Third, the differences between the interest rates implied by futures markets and the SEP have been quite small at shorter-term time horizons, such as the end of 2016, and grow much larger as the time horizon lengthens. I think this is noteworthy because the confidence one has at longer horizons should be much lower than at shorter horizons.\n\nBecause I do not know what the federal funds rate target range will be at the end of 2017 or 2018 with any confidence, I am not very concerned if others have a different modal forecast. Projections will adjust as incoming information changes the economic outlook. I would expect convergence over time of the SEP and market expectations as new information informs the outlook.\n\nLet me close with some observations about my current thinking concerning our reinvestment of maturing Treasury securities and paydowns in our agency MBS holdings. As we noted in the December FOMC statement, we anticipate that we will continue reinvestment “until normalization of the federal funds rate is well underway.” I think this policy makes sense not only because the decision to end reinvestment will represent a further tightening of monetary policy, but also because it is difficult to assess ahead of time the impact of such a decision on financial market conditions given the lack of historical experience.\n\nI also believe that continuing reinvestment until the federal funds rate reaches a higher level makes sense. We want to ensure that we have the ability to respond to adverse shocks by easing monetary policy by lowering the policy rate. Having more “dry powder” in the form of higher short-term interest rates seems more desirable than less dry powder and a smaller balance sheet.\n\nNow the words “well underway” in the FOMC statement are vague—what does that mean in terms of the level of the federal funds rate? Reiterating the disclaimer that I am speaking for myself, my view is that we should not set a numerical tripwire for ending reinvestment. If the economy were growing very quickly and the risks of an early return to the zero lower bound for the federal funds rate were deemed to be low, then I could see ending reinvestment at a relatively low federal funds rate. In contrast, if the economy lacked forward momentum and the risks of a return to the zero lower bound were judged to be considerably higher, I would want to continue reinvestment until the federal funds rate was higher. Consistent with the general principles I mentioned before, the evolution of the overall monetary policy stance—both interest rate decisions and balance sheet developments—should be data dependent.\n\nIn my view, good monetary policy-making requires ongoing assessment and judgment, not the adherence to mechanical rules. I know market participants desire certainty, but in the uncertain world in which we live, that desire is not consistent with the policy that would best achieve our objectives. We will strive to communicate as clearly as we can so you can think along with us and alter your expectations just as we do in response to incoming information.\n\nThank you for kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n1 Antoine Martin, Jamie McAndrews, Jonathan McCarthy, Paolo Pesenti and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\n2 In this arrangement, the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet was mainly driven by the amount of currency in circulation. As the amount of currency in circulation increased, this drained reserves from the banking system. The Federal Reserve offset this by increasing its holdings of Treasury securities.\n\n3 The Federal Reserve gained the authority to pay interest on reserves earlier as part of the Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006; that legislation authorized the Federal Reserve Banks to begin payment of interest on reserves in 2011. As part of the TARP legislation, Congress moved up the date at which the Federal Reserve could exercise that authority to October 2008."
