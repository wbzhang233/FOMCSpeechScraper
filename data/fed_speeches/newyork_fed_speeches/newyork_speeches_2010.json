        "content": "Good morning. I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak to you as I travel through Upstate New York to meet with various communities in the region. This afternoon I will focus on national and regional economic conditions and what the Fed is doing about them—with particular attention to the housing sector and to conditions in Upstate New York. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIntroduction to the New York Fed\nAs many of you know, this is my first chance to speak at the University at Buffalo since I became president of the New York Fed. So, by way of introduction, let me start with a synopsis of what the New York Fed is, what we do and what makes my job so interesting.\n\nThe New York Fed is part of the Federal Reserve System, America's central bank, and was created by Congress in 1913. With this act, Congress delegated to the Fed System its constitutional authority to manage the money supply—and designed it be decentralized, representative of all of America and independent of the political process. The Fed System is comprised of the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C.—a federal agency led by Chairman Ben Bernanke—plus 12 autonomous Reserve Banks that span the country. For example, the district overseen by the New York Fed includes all of New York, the 12 northern counties of New Jersey; Fairfield County, Connecticut; Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Each Reserve Bank is autonomous, with its own charter and a board of directors drawn from its district, but overseen by the Board of Governors. The law that created the Federal Reserve made us independent so we can make decisions in the national interest free from political pressure. However, the Fed is accountable to Congress.\n\nCongress has set an explicit objective for monetary policy: To pursue the highest level of employment consistent with price stability. This objective is often referred to as our \"dual mandate,\" because it combines two goals: high employment, and low and stable inflation. In order to promote these objectives, we also pay close attention to financial stability, because without financial stability, it is very hard to achieve our goals for jobs and inflation.\n\nThe FOMC meets in Washington, D.C., eight times per year to deliberate and vote on monetary policy. As New York Fed president, I am vice chairman at these meetings and have a permanent vote. At these meetings, the 16 other members (the Board of Governors and the other Reserve Bank Presidents) and I each present our current outlook for the economy. For these assessments, we augment input from our research departments with critical information about local economic conditions supplied by our boards of directors, regional advisory councils and conversations with local stakeholders. You may know that one of my councils, the Upstate New York Regional Advisory Board, is designed specifically to provide me with timely information from this area. In this way, decisions by the FOMC are continually informed by views gathered from all parts of the country, including Upstate New York.\n\nOne thing that makes my job even more interesting is that New York has some roles unique within the Fed. Let me tell you about some of them. We, alone, implement monetary policy. At the direction of the FOMC, we buy and sell Treasury securities. We are also the eyes and ears of the Fed on Wall Street, and we supervise many of the largest financial institutions in the country. We operate Fedwire®—the conduit for large money transfers between banks. And, we provide banking services to the U.S. Treasury, and central banks and governments from around the world. Finally, I must mention that the New York Fed's district could be the most diverse in the System: ranging from the urban density of Manhattan to the forested sparseness of the northern Adirondacks, to the Caribbean islands of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. All in all, there is a lot to keep my colleagues and me quite busy—even in normal times.\n\nThe Crisis and Response\nOf course these are anything but normal times. The financial crisis that broke in mid-2007 and intensified dramatically following the failure of Lehman Brothers has been among the most virulent ever. And it was followed by the longest and one of the deepest recessions since World War II, called by many the \"Great Recession.\"\n\nThe Fed responded aggressively and creatively in an effort to pursue our dual mandate. Our actions fell into two broad buckets.\n\nFirst, we took steps to supply liquidity to the financial system, so that financial markets could continue to function properly and to enable households and businesses to maintain access to credit. Carrying out an age-old central banking role, we loaned funds to financial firms, secured against their high-quality collateral.\n\nTraditionally, such loans were only made to depository institutions, such as banks. Of course, the modern U.S. financial system includes many lenders that are not banks. These companies and markets provide vital financing for credit card loans, short-term business needs and many other activities. Many years ago, Congress gave the Fed the emergency authority to lend to nonbanks in \"unusual and exigent circumstances.\" During the crisis—in order to limit damage to the wider economy—we exercised this authority to lend to a wide variety of financial firms and markets.\n\nA handful of times, we made the difficult decision to make emergency loans to prevent the disorderly failure of particular firms. We did so not because we wanted to help the firms, but because allowing them to collapse in a disorderly fashion in the midst of a global crisis would have harmed households and business throughout the United States. All the Fed's loans were collateralized and we are confident they will be repaid in full.\n\nSecond, we took aggressive steps to ease monetary policy in order to support economic activity and employment. By the end of 2008 we reduced short-term interest rates to virtually zero—the lowest level in the history of the Fed. In order to provide still further support for the economy, we bought more than $1.5 trillion of long-term assets—principally mortgage bonds guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with the support of U.S. Treasury—between December 2008 and March 2010.\n\nWhen the Fed buys long-term assets, it pushes down long-term interest rates. This supports economic activity in a number of ways, including by making housing more affordable and boosting consumption in households that can refinance their mortgages at lower rates. In addition, low long-term rates reduce the cost of capital for businesses, thereby fostering more hiring and investment spending (on equipment, construction and machinery, for example) for any given economic outlook.\n\nNational Economic Conditions\nSo where are we today? Let me start my discussion of economic conditions with a few comments about national economic conditions.\n\nAs I discussed in a recent speech, the Great Recession has been followed by a tepid recovery. Since June 2009, economic activity has grown—but not robustly.\n\nIn recent months, the momentum has slowed. After rising at a 3.25 percent annual rate during the second half of 2009, real gross domestic product growth has slowed. With demand growth barely keeping pace with firms' ability to increase productivity, job creation has been too weak to significantly reduce unemployment, which stands today at 9.6 percent. And, as is typical in such circumstances of considerable slack, the rate of inflation has declined.\n\nWhy are we experiencing this soft patch now? There are several reasons:\n\nThe slow recovery of consumer spending and housing in the face of very substantial monetary and fiscal stimulus reflects the painful unwinding of the dynamics at work during the expansion that preceded it. Beginning around 2003, underwriting standards for residential mortgages were significantly relaxed, leading to a sharp rise in household borrowing and in home prices. The rise in home prices helped support more borrowing as households used lines of credit and second mortgages to tap into their rising home equity. This also fueled a strong boom in home construction. But house price increases could not be sustained without limit. When home prices peaked and started to turn down, the dynamic linking house prices, credit and consumption went into reverse.\n\nLet's consider first what this means for consumption. Consumption of goods and services rose at a slow 2 percent annual rate over the first half of 2010 and with no sign of a rebound. Several factors are inhibiting families from spending, including: job or income losses, low confidence and declines in wealth as real estate and stock prices dipped. Households have been saving more and paying down their debts. Of course, lenders have also reinforced this tendency with tightened underwriting for credit relative to prerecession standards. Have households completed their deleveraging, so they will soon spend more? Although we believe that substantial progress has been made, it is hard to tell how much further this process has to run.\n\nNow, let's consider why housing market activity—both new construction and sales—remains depressed. One reason for this is that many existing homes stand vacant. We estimate that there are roughly 3 million vacant housing units more than usual. This stock of vacant homes will shrink when foreclosures fall and more empty homes are sold or rented out.\n\nOn the sales side, even though low mortgage interest rates and falling home prices have together boosted housing affordability to its highest level in 40 years, the current pace of sales is quite sluggish. Impediments to home sales include tight lending standards, a weak job market and continued uncertainty about home prices. Importantly, the large drop in home prices between 2006 and 2008 also reduced homeowner equity broadly, making it more difficult to \"trade-up\" and move into better homes.\n\nWith lower home prices, many families now owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. This means that they cannot refinance or sell their homes easily if they experience a crisis such as a job loss or a serious illness. Foreclosure completions are at an all-time high, although the initiation of new foreclosures may be finally slowing. Recently, attention has focused on cases where some of the documentation used in the foreclosure process may have been flawed. The Fed actively encourages efforts to find viable alternatives to foreclosure. Not many people know this, but a team of New York Fed officials work with mortgage counselors and community activists to support distressed homeowners, and our lawyers support legal aid programs for people facing foreclosure. At the same time, it is important that foreclosures that comply with the law can ultimately take place. This is a necessary part of returning the housing market to more normal conditions.\n\nAlong with two other agencies, the Fed is reviewing the foreclosure practices at the major bank mortgage servicers. We are also keeping an eye on banks' potential liabilities where they made representations about mortgages bought by investors that may not have been correct in all cases. We want to ensure that the housing finance business is supported by robust back-office operations—for processing of new mortgages as well as foreclosures—so that homebuyers and investors have full confidence in the process. We are monitoring developments closely in order to evaluate any potential impact on housing or financial markets and the overall economy.\n\nEconomic Conditions in Upstate New York\nNow let me turn to economic conditions in Upstate New York. It is no secret that this region has struggled with weak economic growth and population loss in recent decades. The region has experienced some very painful economic restructuring, particularly as it lost so many of its high- paying manufacturing jobs. Yet the process has yielded a productive and more diversified economy, with a larger service sector. For this and other reasons I will discuss, the Upstate New York economy has weathered the Great Recession relatively well.\n\nWhile the Upstate economy generally underperformed the nation during the 1980s and 1990s, its recent experience has been quite different. During the Great Recession, Upstate New York's job losses began later than they did for the United States as a whole, and those losses were generally less severe.\n\nThe relatively strong economic performance of the region of late is also clearly tied to its stable housing markets. Upstate New York's relatively slow economic performance and lack of population growth during the expansion in the 2000s supported only modest increases in home prices and sales during the housing boom. When home prices and sales began to decline quite rapidly in many parts of the nation, they held steady across the region. As a result, Upstate New York has largely been spared the boom-and-bust cycle in housing that occurred in other parts of the country. In fact, many of Upstate New York's metropolitan areas even experienced home price appreciation during the housing bust, making these places among the best performing in the country during this period. Many parts of the country experienced severe housing busts, with sharp drops in housing-related activity (such as construction and purchases of major appliances). For example, in fast-growing places such as California and Florida, construction jobs grew to be a large share of employment, but the number of these jobs then plummeted during the recession. This dynamic did not occur in places like Buffalo, where the housing sector was small and thus, had few jobs to lose.\n\nAnother part of the story is that homeowners in Upstate New York did not take on as much debt, and households have been less strained here than elsewhere. One reason is that home prices did not appreciate rapidly here, so homes remained affordable. Moreover, there was generally lower penetration of risky nonprime loans into the region's housing markets. So, Upstate New York's home loans have generally performed better than elsewhere in the country, with fewer delinquencies and foreclosures. Indeed, much of the region was spared the worst effects of the nonprime mortgage boom and bust.\n\nThus, compared with other parts of the nation, the Upstate economy has performed well over the past few years. As a large and growing sector, local colleges and universities have surely contributed to the region's economic stability over the past few years. Indeed, the University at Buffalo provides a clear example of how a university can play a key role in its local economy. The benefits of the higher education industry go beyond their direct economic contributions, such as employment and spending, for a very important reason: they can increase a region's stock of human capital—that is, the total supply of knowledge and skills in its workforce.\n\nA region's human capital contributes to its economic success and resiliency. The educational activities of a region's colleges and universities help build the skills of the local workforce. In addition, the knowledge created by colleges and universities through research activities can play a key role in starting and supporting local businesses. Businesses can use university expertise, infrastructure and research findings to help them develop cutting edge products and services. Furthermore, universities often employ local businesses to develop and commercialize products that arise from their research activities. This dynamic can expand local economic activity and consequently create new jobs for high-skilled workers in a region. Institutions such as the University at Buffalo play a vital role of this sort in the Upstate economy.\n\nThe diversification of Buffalo's economy has helped the region to weather the Great Recession. In particular, major investments in the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus have allowed the health care and education sectors to expand and become an increasingly important part of the local economy. These sectors provide stability because they are less susceptible to contraction during economic downturns than other sectors of the economy. Moreover, Buffalo's robust banking industry provides an additional source of strength. And the strong Canadian dollar has attracted Canadian shoppers to the region, bolstering retail sales, contributing to local economic stability over the past few years.\n\nWhat Is the Fed Doing Now?\nSince the beginning of the downturn, the Fed has actively used monetary and regulatory policy to help support economic activity and improve economic outcomes—here in Buffalo and across the nation—relative to what would have happened in the absence of this support.\n\nWith regard to monetary policy, the Fed has in place a highly accommodative stance. The FOMC has said that it will keep short term interest rates at exceptionally low levels for an extended period of time. The Fed also retains large amounts of mortgage-backed bonds acquired in order to support the housing market and help bring down mortgage and other long-term interest rates to the historically low rates in place today.\n\nThe FOMC and the Chairman have stated their commitment to take further actions to bring interest rates down further should economic conditions warrant. In a recent speech, I said that both the current levels of unemployment and inflation and the timeframe over which they are likely to return to levels consistent with our mandate are unacceptable. I said that I thought further Fed action was likely to be warranted unless the economic outlook were to evolve in a way that made me more confident we would see better outcomes for both employment and inflation before too long.\n\nTurning to regulatory policy, the biggest lesson of the financial crisis is that severe financial disruptions can inflict very large and persistent costs on people's lives and jobs. Over the past year, with Fed leadership and support, important new regulatory initiatives have been advanced to create a global financial system where the players cannot slide back into the risky \"business as usual\" that created this crisis. These include the recent agreement with international bank regulators (sometimes called \"Basel III\") to impose stricter standards for globally active banks and the considerable regulatory changes embodied in the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nThese measures recognize that to avert or contain future financial crises, we need a financial system that can withstand large negative shocks. First, market participants must not have incentives to take excessive risks. Instead, incentives should reward actions that support economic growth and financial stability. And financial firms must set aside enough capital and liquidity so that when things go wrong they can absorb losses with their own resources. Finally, if these buffers prove inadequate and a financial firm veers toward failure, the official sector needs the tools to wind them down in an orderly manner without having to make the terrible choice between a chaotic failure that harms the whole economy and a taxpayer-funded rescue.\n\nConclusion\nI appreciate the opportunity to talk to you about how my job at the New York Fed ties in with your lives and work here in Upstate New York. The links are many, including\n\nTo summarize conditions at the moment: after a recession that was milder in Upstate New York than in many parts of the country, the region is showing signs of a modest recovery. A more diversified, more knowledge-based economy and a relatively small housing sector helped to limit the recession's impact on many communities. Nevertheless, the Great Recession spread much pain throughout this region and unemployment remains much higher than we would like.\n\nThe Fed cannot wave a magic wand and make the problems remaining from the preceding period of excess vanish immediately. But we can provide essential support for the needed adjustments. Even with our best efforts, the road to full recovery here in Upstate New York and across the nation is likely to be long and bumpy. But I am confident that we will make it. And, the dynamism that is represented in this room—the private sector combined with academic learning and research—will provide a strong underpinning for future prosperity.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I will now be happy to take some questions."

These sectors tend to provide stability to their local economies because they are less susceptible to contraction during economic downturns than other sectors of the economy. Moreover, despite the decline in manufacturing, Rochester is well known for its world-class optics and imaging business cluster. Local businesses work closely with the University of Rochester and the Rochester Institute of Technology to leverage their joint expertise in fields such as imaging technologies and lenses to develop cutting edge products. As a result, Rochester has remained a highly productive and relatively stable region.\n\nWhat Is the Fed Doing Now?\nSince the beginning of the downturn, the Fed has actively used monetary and regulatory policy to help support economic activity and improve economic outcomes—here in Rochester and across the nation—relative to what would have happened in the absence of this support.\n\nWith regard to monetary policy, the Fed has in place a highly accommodative stance.

        "content": "Introduction to the New York Fed\nAs many of you know, this is my first chance to speak at Cornell University since I became president of the New York Fed. So, by way of introduction, let me start with a synopsis of what the New York Fed is, what we do and what makes my job so interesting.\n\nThe New York Fed is part of the Federal Reserve System, America's central bank, and was created by Congress in 1913. With this act, Congress delegated to the Fed System its constitutional authority to manage the money supply—and designed it be decentralized, representative of all of America and independent of the political process. The Fed System is comprised of the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C.—a federal agency led by Chairman Ben Bernanke—plus 12 autonomous Reserve Banks that span the country. For example, the district overseen by the New York Fed includes all of New York, the 12 northern counties of New Jersey; Fairfield County, Connecticut; Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Each Reserve Bank is autonomous, with its own charter and a board of directors drawn from its district, but overseen by the Board of Governors. The law that created the Federal Reserve made us independent so we can make decisions in the national interest free from political pressure. However, the Fed is accountable to Congress.\n\nCongress has set an explicit objective for monetary policy: To pursue the highest level of employment consistent with price stability. This objective is often referred to as our \"dual mandate,\" because it combines two goals: high employment, and low and stable inflation. In order to promote these objectives, we also pay close attention to financial stability, because without financial stability, it is very hard to achieve our goals for jobs and inflation.\n\nThe FOMC meets in Washington, D.C., eight times per year to deliberate and vote on monetary policy. As New York Fed president, I am vice chairman at these meetings and have a permanent vote. At these meetings, the 16 other members (the Board of Governors and the other Reserve Bank Presidents) and I each present our current outlook for the economy. For these assessments, we augment input from our research departments with critical information about local economic conditions supplied by our boards of directors, regional advisory councils and conversations with local stakeholders. You may know that one of my councils, the Upstate New York Regional Advisory Board, is designed specifically to provide me with timely information from this area. In this way, decisions by the FOMC are continually informed by views gathered from all parts of the country, including Upstate New York.\n\nOne thing that makes my job even more interesting is that New York has some roles unique within the Fed. Let me tell you about some of them. We, alone, implement monetary policy. At the direction of the FOMC, we buy and sell Treasury securities. We are also the eyes and ears of the Fed on Wall Street, and we supervise many of the largest financial institutions in the country. We operate Fedwire®—the conduit for large money transfers between banks. And, we provide banking services to the U.S. Treasury, and central banks and governments from around the world. Finally, I must mention that the New York Fed's district could be the most diverse in the System: ranging from the urban density of Manhattan to the forested sparseness of the northern Adirondacks, to the Caribbean islands of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. All in all, there is a lot to keep my colleagues and me quite busy—even in normal times.\n\nThe Crisis and Response\nOf course these are anything but normal times. The financial crisis that broke in mid-2007 and intensified dramatically following the failure of Lehman Brothers has been among the most virulent ever. And it was followed by the longest and one of the deepest recessions since World War II, called by many the \"Great Recession.\"\n\nThe Fed responded aggressively and creatively in an effort to pursue our dual mandate. Our actions fell into two broad buckets.\n\nFirst, we took steps to supply liquidity to the financial system, so that financial markets could continue to function properly and to enable households and businesses to maintain access to credit. Carrying out an age-old central banking role, we loaned funds to financial firms, secured against their high-quality collateral.\n\nTraditionally, such loans were only made to depository institutions, such as banks. Of course, the modern U.S. financial system includes many lenders that are not banks. These companies and markets provide vital financing for credit card loans, short-term business needs and many other activities. Many years ago, Congress gave the Fed the emergency authority to lend to nonbanks in \"unusual and exigent circumstances.\" During the crisis—in order to limit damage to the wider economy—we exercised this authority to lend to a wide variety of financial firms and markets.\n\nA handful of times, we made the difficult decision to make emergency loans to prevent the disorderly failure of particular firms. We did so not because we wanted to help the firms, but because allowing them to collapse in a disorderly fashion in the midst of a global crisis would have harmed households and business throughout the United States. All the Fed's loans were collateralized and we are confident they will be repaid in full.\n\nSecond, we took aggressive steps to ease monetary policy in order to support economic activity and employment. By the end of 2008 we reduced short-term interest rates to virtually zero—the lowest level in the history of the Fed. In order to provide still further support for the economy, we bought more than $1.5 trillion of long-term assets—principally mortgage bonds guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with the support of U.S. Treasury—between December 2008 and March 2010.\n\nWhen the Fed buys long-term assets, it pushes down long-term interest rates. This supports economic activity in a number of ways, including by making housing more affordable and boosting consumption in households that can refinance their mortgages at lower rates. In addition, low long-term rates reduce the cost of capital for businesses, thereby fostering more hiring and investment spending (on equipment, construction and machinery, for example) for any given economic outlook.\n\nNational Economic Conditions\nSo where are we today? Let me start my discussion of economic conditions with a few comments about national economic conditions.\nAs I discussed in a recent speech, the Great Recession has been followed by a tepid recovery. Since June 2009, economic activity has grown—but not robustly.\n\nIn recent months, the momentum has slowed. After rising at a 3.25 percent annual rate during the second half of 2009, real gross domestic product growth has slowed. With demand growth barely keeping pace with firms' ability to increase productivity, job creation has been too weak to significantly reduce unemployment, which stands today at 9.6 percent. And, as is typical in such circumstances of considerable slack, the rate of inflation has declined.\n\nWhy are we experiencing this soft patch now? There are several reasons:\n\nThe slow recovery of consumer spending and housing in the face of very substantial monetary and fiscal stimulus reflects the painful unwinding of the dynamics at work during the expansion that preceded it. Beginning around 2003, underwriting standards for residential mortgages were significantly relaxed, leading to a sharp rise in household borrowing and in home prices. The rise in home prices helped support more borrowing as households used lines of credit and second mortgages to tap into their rising home equity. This also fueled a strong boom in home construction. But house price increases could not be sustained without limit. When home prices peaked and started to turn down, the dynamic linking house prices, credit and consumption went into reverse.\n\nLet's consider first what this means for consumption. Consumption of goods and services rose at a slow 2 percent annual rate over the first half of 2010 and with no sign of a rebound. Several factors are inhibiting families from spending, including: job or income losses, low confidence and declines in wealth as real estate and stock prices dipped. Households have been saving more and paying down their debts. Of course, lenders have also reinforced this tendency with tightened underwriting for credit relative to prerecession standards. Have households completed their deleveraging, so they will soon spend more? Although we believe that substantial progress has been made, it is hard to tell how much further this process has to run.\n\nNow, let's consider why housing market activity—both new construction and sales—remains depressed. One reason for this is that many existing homes stand vacant. We estimate that there are roughly 3 million vacant housing units more than usual. This stock of vacant homes will shrink when foreclosures fall and more empty homes are sold or rented out.\n\nOn the sales side, even though low mortgage interest rates and falling home prices have together boosted housing affordability to its highest level in 40 years, the current pace of sales is quite sluggish. Impediments to home sales include tight lending standards, a weak job market and continued uncertainty about home prices. Importantly, the large drop in home prices between 2006 and 2008 also reduced homeowner equity broadly, making it more difficult to \"trade-up\" and move into better homes.\n\nWith lower home prices, many families now owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. This means that they cannot refinance or sell their homes easily if they experience a crisis such as a job loss or a serious illness. Foreclosure completions are at an all-time high, although the initiation of new foreclosures may be finally slowing. Recently, attention has focused on cases where some of the documentation used in the foreclosure process may have been flawed. The Fed actively encourages efforts to find viable alternatives to foreclosure. Not many people know this, but a team of New York Fed officials work with mortgage counselors and community activists to support distressed homeowners, and our lawyers support legal aid programs for people facing foreclosure. At the same time, it is important that foreclosures that comply with the law can ultimately take place. This is a necessary part of returning the housing market to more normal conditions.\n\nAlong with two other agencies, the Fed is reviewing the foreclosure practices at the major bank mortgage servicers. We are also keeping an eye on banks' potential liabilities where they made representations about mortgages bought by investors that may not have been correct in all cases. We want to ensure that the housing finance business is supported by robust back-office operations—for processing of new mortgages as well as foreclosures—so that homebuyers and investors have full confidence in the process. We are monitoring developments closely in order to evaluate any potential impact on housing or financial markets and the overall economy.\n\nEconomic Conditions in Upstate New York\nNow let me turn to economic conditions in Upstate New York. It is no secret that this region has struggled with weak economic growth and population loss in recent decades. The region has experienced some very painful economic restructuring, particularly as it lost so many of its high- paying manufacturing jobs. Yet the process has yielded a productive and more diversified economy, with a larger service sector. For this and other reasons I will discuss, the Upstate New York economy has weathered the Great Recession relatively well.\n\nWhile the Upstate economy generally underperformed the nation during the 1980s and 1990s, its recent experience has been quite different. During the Great Recession, Upstate New York's job losses began later than they did for the United States as a whole, and those losses were generally less severe.\n\nThe relatively strong economic performance of the region of late is clearly tied to its stable housing markets. Upstate New York's relatively slow economic performance and lack of population growth during the expansion in the 2000s supported only modest increases in home prices and sales during the housing boom. When home prices and sales began to decline quite rapidly in many parts of the nation, they held steady across the region. As a result, Upstate New York has largely been spared the boom-and-bust cycle in housing that occurred in other parts of the country. In fact, many of Upstate New York's metropolitan areas even experienced home price appreciation during the housing bust, making these places among the best performing in the country during this period. Many parts of the country experienced severe housing busts, with sharp drops in housing-related activity (such as construction and purchases of major appliances). For example, in fast-growing places such as California and Florida, construction jobs grew to be a large share of employment, but the number of these jobs then plummeted during the recession. This dynamic did not occur in places like Ithaca, where the housing sector was small and thus, had few jobs to lose.\n\nAnother part of the story is that homeowners in Upstate New York did not take on as much debt, and households have been less strained here than elsewhere. One reason is that home prices did not appreciate rapidly here, so homes remained affordable. Moreover, there was generally lower penetration of risky nonprime loans into the region's housing markets. So, Upstate New York's home loans have generally performed better than elsewhere in the country, with fewer delinquencies and foreclosures. Indeed, much of the region was spared the worst effects of the nonprime mortgage boom and bust.\n\nThus, compared with other parts of the nation, the Upstate economy has performed well over the past few years. As a large and growing sector, local colleges and universities have surely contributed to the region's economic stability over the past few years. Indeed, Cornell provides a clear example of how a university can play a key role in its local economy. The benefits of the higher education industry go beyond their direct economic contributions, such as employment and spending, for a very important reason: they can increase a region's stock of human capital—that is, the total supply of knowledge and skills in its workforce.\n\nA region's human capital contributes to its economic success and resiliency. The educational activities of a region's colleges and universities help build the skills of the local workforce. In addition, the knowledge created by colleges and universities through research activities can play a key role in starting and supporting local businesses. Businesses can use university expertise, infrastructure and research findings to help them develop cutting edge products and services. Furthermore, universities often employ local businesses to develop and commercialize products that arise from their research activities. This dynamic can expand local economic activity and consequently create new jobs for high-skilled workers in a region.\n\nThese dynamics are clearly visible in Ithaca, where a large number of local companies—in industries ranging from information technology to medical equipment to agriculture—are closely tied to Cornell. Many of these companies were started by Cornell's faculty and students and have remained in the local economy to stay connected to the university. Other companies have been attracted to the region because of the access afforded to specific knowledge or new products and processes invented at Cornell. Higher education institutions such as Cornell play a vital role in upstate New York's economy.\n\nThe relative stability of the higher education industry has, not surprisingly, contributed to a strong economic performance in recent years. Ithaca's housing market is among the healthiest in the state, and it has experienced relatively strong employment growth during and since Great Recession. Indeed, unlike most of its Upstate peers, Ithaca has gained population throughout the past decade.\n\nWhat Is the Fed Doing Now?\nSince the beginning of the downturn, the Fed has actively used monetary and regulatory policy to help support economic activity and improve economic outcomes—here in Ithaca and across the nation—relative to what would have happened in the absence of this support.\n\nWith regard to monetary policy, the Fed has in place a highly accommodative stance. The FOMC has said that it will keep short term interest rates at exceptionally low levels for an extended period of time. The Fed also retains large amounts of mortgage-backed bonds acquired in order to support the housing market and help bring down mortgage and other long-term interest rates to the historically low rates in place today.\n\nThe FOMC and the Chairman have stated their commitment to take further actions to bring interest rates down further should economic conditions warrant. In a recent speech, I said that both the current levels of unemployment and inflation and the timeframe over which they are likely to return to levels consistent with our mandate are unacceptable. I said that I thought further Fed action was likely to be warranted unless the economic outlook were to evolve in a way that made me more confident we would see better outcomes for both employment and inflation before too long.\n\nTurning to regulatory policy, the biggest lesson of the financial crisis is that severe financial disruptions can inflict very large and persistent costs on people's lives and jobs. Over the past year, with Fed leadership and support, important new regulatory initiatives have been advanced to create a global financial system where the players cannot slide back into the risky \"business as usual\" that created this crisis. These include the recent agreement with international bank regulators (sometimes called \"Basel III\") to impose stricter standards for globally active banks and the considerable regulatory changes embodied in the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nThese measures recognize that to avert or contain future financial crises, we need a financial system that can withstand large negative shocks. First, market participants must not have incentives to take excessive risks. Instead, incentives should reward actions that support economic growth and financial stability. And financial firms must set aside enough capital and liquidity so that when things go wrong they can absorb losses with their own resources. Finally, if these buffers prove inadequate and a financial firm veers toward failure, the official sector needs the tools to wind them down in an orderly manner without having to make the terrible choice between a chaotic failure that harms the whole economy and a taxpayer-funded rescue.\n\nConclusion\nI appreciate the opportunity to talk to you about how my job at the New York Fed ties in with your lives and work here in Upstate New York.

        "content": "National Economic Conditions\nTo provide context, let me start with a few comments about national economic conditions. As I discussed in a recent speech, the long and deep recession that ended in June 2009 has been followed by a very tepid recovery. Since June 2009, economic activity has grown—but only slowly from levels far below the productive capacity of the economy.\n\nIn recent months, the momentum of the recovery has slowed. For example, after rising at a 3.25 percent annual rate during the second half of 2009, there has been a progressive slowing—to a 2.75 percent annual rate during the first half of 2010 and, most likely, to an even slower rate when the third-quarter real gross domestic product (GDP) figures are released at the end of this month.\n\nWith demand growth barely keeping pace with firms' ability to increase productivity, job creation has been too weak to significantly reduce unemployment, which stands today at 9.6 percent. And, as is typical in such circumstances of considerable slack, the rate of inflation has declined.\n\nViewed through the lens of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate—the pursuit of the highest level of employment consistent with price stability, the current situation is wholly unsatisfactory. Given the outlook that the upturn appears likely to strengthen only gradually, it will likely be several years before employment and inflation return to levels consistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate.\n\nWhy are we experiencing this soft patch now? There are several reasons:\n\nInstead, we have ongoing sluggishness in two key sectors that have led past recoveries: consumer spending and housing.\n\nThe slow recovery of consumer spending and housing in the face of very substantial monetary and fiscal stimulus reflects the painful unwinding of the dynamics at work during the expansion that preceded it. Beginning around 2003, underwriting standards for residential mortgages were significantly relaxed, leading to a sharp rise in household borrowing and in home prices. The rise in home prices helped to support additional demand for credit as households used the collateral represented by their homes to borrow large sums of money via home equity lines of credit and second mortgages. This also fueled a strong boom in home construction. But house price increases could not be sustained without limit. When home prices peaked and started to turn down, the dynamic linking house prices, credit and consumption went into reverse, forcing substantial adjustments on the part of the household sector and in the housing market itself.\n\nI've discussed in recent speeches the role monetary and regulatory policy can play in helping to support economic activity and in improving economic outcomes relative to what would otherwise be experienced in the absence of this support. These steps include critical reforms that make the financial system safer and accommodative monetary policy that make mortgages more affordable and make the investments that create jobs are more attractive. Today I will focus on the economic trends themselves.\n\nLet's consider first the consequences of this dynamic for consumer spending—that is, households' purchases of goods and services. Families' expenditures rose at a slow 2 percent annual rate over the first half of 2010 and (so far) this sluggishness appears to have continued in the third quarter of 2010. Families have not yet boosted their spending above the levels preceding the severe cuts they made during the recession. This frugality stands in stark contrast to the first year of recovery from previous deep recessions. Several factors are inhibiting families from spending. Many people have lost their jobs and are still unemployed, or have had their hours or pay reduced. Confidence in the economy remains quite low. And households' net worth, which fell substantially as real estate and stock prices dipped, remains well below its previous peak compared with disposable income. So, households have been saving more. The personal saving rate, which rose to 5.5 percent by the end of 2009 from a recent low of 1.2 percent in the third quarter of 2005, seems headed even higher in the third quarter. Households are \"deleveraging\"; they are paying down their debts. Of course, lenders have also reinforced this tendency as they have tightened underwriting standards for consumer credit, relative to their pre-recession standards.\n\nHave households completed their deleveraging, so they will soon spend more? Although we believe that substantial progress has been made, it is hard to tell how much further this process has to run. For example, the share of household after-tax income that families owe for servicing debts and paying for housing (including property taxes, homeowners insurance and rents) has declined sharply over the past two years and is now back to levels last seen in the late 1990s. Households have cut the total amount of debt they owe. They are also refinancing outstanding debt to take advantage of the lowest mortgage interest rates since the mid 1950s. We expect the increased rate of mortgage refinancing now in place to continue over the near term. This represents another means by which households can free up income for other uses.\n\nNow, let's consider the slow housing recovery. Housing market activity—both new construction and sales—remains depressed. On the construction side, total housing starts are running at just 600,000 units per year (seasonally-adjusted) in recent months. This is up from 530,000 units at the trough in the first quarter of 2009 but it is still extremely low by the standards of the last 50 years. In fact, the rate of new construction is so low that there is barely any net growth in the U.S. housing stock these days.\n\nOne reason why so little housing is being built is that many existing homes stand vacant. We estimate that there are roughly 3 million vacant housing units more than usual. And more vacancies are added daily as the foreclosure process moves homes from families to mortgage lenders. This stock of vacant homes will shrink when fewer are foreclosed upon and more of these homes are sold or rented out.\n\nOn the sales side, even though low mortgage interest rates and falling home prices have together boosted housing affordability to its highest level in 40 years, the current pace of sales is quite sluggish. Impediments to home sales include tight lending standards, a weak job market and continued uncertainty regarding the future path of home prices. The large decline in home prices that occurred between 2006 and 2008 is also important. This decline reduced the amount of equity that owners have in their homes, making it difficult for people to come up with the funds needed to \"trade-up\" and move into better homes.\n\nIn addition, the steep decline in home prices put many families at risk of mortgage delinquency and, ultimately, losing their homes to foreclosure. With lower home prices, many families now owe more on their mortgage than their home is worth. This means that they cannot refinance or sell their homes easily if they experience a financial crisis, such as a job loss or a serious illness. Recent developments on foreclosures have been mixed. While RealtyTrac reports that foreclosure completions in the United States exceeded 100,000 for the first time in September, it is important to remember that foreclosure is a lengthy process in most states. Our data indicate that, in recent quarters, borrowers are becoming less likely to fall behind on their mortgages, so fewer households are now entering the foreclosure process. At the same time, though, major lenders have acknowledged serious problems in the processes they have used to repossess homes and announced moratoria on new foreclosures. Taken together, these developments suggest that the situation in housing remains uncertain for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Federal Reserve actively encourages efforts to find viable alternatives to foreclosure, like loan modifications, or deeds in lieu. We also support due process and access to legal counsel for homeowners facing foreclosure, for instance through legal aid programs. At the same time, it is important that foreclosures that properly comply with state and federal law can ultimately take place, as this is a necessary part of the adjustment that will eventually return us to more normal conditions in the housing market.\n\nAt present, the extent of the documentation problem and its wider ramifications are still uncertain. In conjunction with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve is therefore seeking to establish the facts through a review of the foreclosure practices, governance and documentation at the major bank mortgage servicers. We want to ensure that the housing finance business is supported by robust back-office operations—for processing of new mortgages as well as foreclosures— so that buyers of homes and investors in mortgage securities have full confidence in the process. We are monitoring developments closely in order to evaluate any potential impact on the housing market, financial institutions and the overall economy.\n\nThe key role that housing has played during this recession and recovery makes it a timely topic for our regional economic briefing.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions (update since the July regional press briefing)\nNow, let me turn to regional economic conditions. Overall, the recession seems to have been less severe in much of our region than in many other parts of the country, though unemployment remains unacceptably high.\n\nAs attendees at previous Regional Press Briefings may recall, the New York Fed produces Coincident Economic Indicators to help track the performance of the regional economy. Since July, these indicators point to recovery in New York State, and particularly in New York City.\n\nAlthough New York City and New York State are recovering, elsewhere in the region, the story is different. In New Jersey, although activity is no longer declining, there has yet to be a sustained recovery. New Jersey's economy remains essentially flat. An index produced in Puerto Rico by the Government Development Bank shows that the pickup in economic activity there in late spring and early summer has retreated and activity in the past few months has again turned down.\n\nNow, let's look at jobs, which are the key for people to truly feel the recovery in their lives. I am pleased to note that private-sector jobs have continued to grow moderately across much of the region in the past few months, just as they have in the nation. Growth in private-sector jobs—which is not affected directly by hires and layoffs from the decennial census—signals that, on balance, firms are expanding their workforces to meet their business needs. While state and local government job cuts have also reduced total employment, the fact that the private sector is creating jobs is a good sign and necessary for a sustainable recovery.\n\nThe number of private-sector jobs has increased in and around New York City, in northern New Jersey and in some parts of Upstate New York. The latest job market report for New York shows a continuation of the generally rising trend of employment in the state at a pace that roughly matches the nationwide growth rate. In New York City, employment has expanded at rates substantially above the nation. Since we last met, employment in New Jersey has expanded, and while that growth has been quite modest, it is an encouraging sign. In Puerto Rico, employment reports continue to give mixed signals, showing a see-saw pattern that has yet to add up to a strong rebound.\n\nDespite these employment gains, unemployment in the region remains painfully high. In August, New York City's and New Jersey's rates were very close to the national jobless rate of 9.6 percent. The rate for New York State, which has been improving since the first quarter, is noticeably lower at 8.3 percent. Puerto Rico, which has had much higher unemployment than the mainland for the past several decades, saw a modest decline in its jobless rate, but at 15.6 percent is still showing little evidence of a recovery.\n\nRegional Housing Trends in New York and New Jersey\nWe focus on housing at today's briefing because it represents the most important asset that many households own, provides a substantial number of high-wage jobs and is often a key driver of regional as well as national business cycles.\n\nI'll start with a key observation: During this recession, the housing sector contributed less volatility to the regional economy than it did in much of the nation. We have, of course, seen painful losses of homes, construction jobs and housing equity in New York and northern New Jersey. This pattern can be seen quite directly in the construction sector, where many jobs were created during the housing boom, but then were lost as the housing market deteriorated. However, our housing markets tend to be less influential in our economy because we are a relatively mature region. That is, we are not adding population as rapidly as some other parts of the country, so housing construction—which tends to be very cyclical—and associated purchases account for a smaller share of aggregate activity here than it does in faster growing regions.\n\nIn addition, much of our region was spared the worst effects of the non-prime mortgage boom and bust. There was generally lower penetration of nonprime loans into our housing markets, and in general, our region shows better performance, with fewer delinquencies and foreclosures. This pattern was particularly true across Upstate New York. However, as can be seen on the New York Fed's U.S. Credit Conditions maps, there are significant pockets of housing distress around the greater New York City metro area, especially in communities in the Bronx, Dutchess County and Long Island. Indeed, we recently documented the severity of problems on Long Island in our Facts and Trends publication. Moreover, New Jersey had non-prime mortgage activity closer to the national average and now has more delinquencies and foreclosures than is the case for much of the region.\n\nAs the uneven pattern of nonprime lending suggests, the region is hardly uniform. The housing section fared better in Upstate New York than it did in much of the region during the recession. In fact, the housing boom and bust largely bypassed Upstate New York, where construction activity is a relatively small part of the overall economy.\n\nRelative to Upstate New York, most areas in downstate New York and northern New Jersey more closely tracked the national cycle. Sales activity and home prices ramped up during the housing boom, but then dropped sharply.\n\nMore recently—over the past year—home sales and prices in the region have followed different paths. Home prices have generally stabilized across upstate New York, with some parts, such as Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse, even experiencing price increases over this period. However, home prices have continued to decline in the greater New York and New Jersey area. By contrast, the number of home sales have generally increased throughout the region over the past year. But the pattern has been erratic because of various policy changes. In particular, the introduction, initial expiration and subsequent extension of the home buyer tax credit introduced volatility as it boosted, slowed and then boosted sales again. With the final expiration of this tax credit, the recent rise in home sales across New York and northern New Jersey may well be short-lived.\n\nRegional Housing Trends: Focus on New York City\n\nI'll end with a few remarks about New York City's housing market—a very large market that stands out as unique in many respects.\n\nLet me remind you of some of these key differences:\n\nSo, how did the economic expansion and contraction affect New York City's housing market? For a mature city, the city saw an unusually strong boom in housing sales, construction and prices. This expansion actually began in 1996 and continued even in the aftermath of the 9/11 attack. Since 2007, however, New York City's market has turned down. This decline started later than the nation's and prices have fallen less sharply. Now, prices appear to have stabilized.\n\nThis pattern can also be seen in Manhattan's rental market. After a long period of rising rents, the market weakened substantially from 2007 to 2009, and rents have rebounded moderately in 2010.\n\nNew York City has not been spared from the high rates of mortgage delinquencies characteristic of this recession. Manhattan's delinquency rates are elevated although they remain markedly below the national average. By contrast, pockets of distress are much more prevalent in the outer boroughs, all of which have delinquency rates, per owner-occupied unit, above the national average.\n\nThe relatively mild recession and the recovery in the City are lending support to both home prices and sales. Also positive, compared with the rest of the country, are the City's low mortgage leverage rates and a low share of homes with underwater mortgages.\n\nNevertheless, several risks to home prices in the City remain. These risks include the ongoing completion of a considerable number of new apartment buildings—ones that were started at the end of the boom. Another risk comes from the slow pace of job growth in high-pay sectors (including the securities industry) in New York City. Finally, during the boom, prices rose substantially faster than rents. Going forward, this disparity could exert downward pressure on home prices as renting has become a more affordable alternative.\n\nConclusion\nIn sum, after a recession that was milder than in many parts of the country, the region is showing signs of a modest recovery in New York, but little growth elsewhere. The housing sector played a pivotal role in the recent national downturn. In the region, the fact that housing activity has a smaller weight in the regional economy helped to limit the recession's impact on many communities. Going forward, given housing's significance to the well-being of people in our region and beyond, the New York Fed will continue to focus on the sector as we monitor regional and national economic conditions.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I will now ask James Orr to provide more details on current regional economic conditions."

        "content": "Today I want to discuss some of these initiatives, with a special focus on the recent agreement in Basel on capital and liquidity for large, internationally active banks. I will give my perspective on how these efforts have been informed by the lessons of the financial crisis and discuss what some of the likely consequences may be as these measures are put in place. Given the breadth of the changes, my remarks will be by no means complete. As always, my remarks reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe biggest lesson of the financial crisis is that severe financial disruptions can inflict very large and persistent costs on real economic activity and employment. Thus, lawmakers and regulators must make widespread changes to create a more resilient and robust global financial system. But, at the same time, this must be done in way that ensures the financial system retains sufficient dynamism so that it can allocate capital efficiently to support innovation and economic growth.\n\nThe crisis revealed a number of significant weaknesses in the global financial system. First, many leading financial institutions at the core of the system did not have enough high-quality capital to be able to retain access to private funding markets in the face of the large credit and mark-to-market losses. In particular, they often held grossly inadequate capital against their trading book exposures and the counterparty credit risk generated by activities such as their over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives business.\n\nSecond, individual firms and the system as a whole had inadequate liquidity buffers to withstand marketwide disruptions. Indeed, there was widespread overreliance on short-term funding to finance long-term illiquid assets. This was especially evident among the major securities dealers, which depended on tri-party repo funding to finance much of their securities inventories, and in the so-called shadow banking system, in which entities such as structured investment vehicles and conduits were dependent on short-term funding to finance their long-term assets. Banks that had provided liquidity guarantees to these shadow banks were in turn exposed to runs on those entities.\n\nThird, a lack of transparency exacerbated uncertainty about the creditworthiness of many institutions. Some of this was due to the complexity of the assets—collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), in particular, were very hard to value even in normal times. But, some of this was also due to the lack of transparency about certain markets—the OTC derivatives market for credit default swaps is one notable example.\n\nFourth, an inappropriate structure of incentives encouraged excessive risk-taking. This was evident within firms in the form of “the trader’s option,” in which compensation was based mainly on fiscal year results with no clawback when mark-to-market profits on illiquid securities and other assets turned into losses. It was also evident in the ability of the largest firms to benefit in terms of their funding costs via a perception that they would be “too big to fail.”\n\nFifth, regulators and market participants did not appreciate how the financial system was interconnected so that shocks were transmitted broadly through the financial system, often intensifying rather than dampening as they spread.\n\nThe severe economic costs generated by the crisis indicate that the primary goal must be to reduce the likelihood and the severity of future financial crises. To accomplish this, we need a financial system that is better suited to withstand shocks of all kinds, regardless of their source. We need a financial system in which market participants face the appropriate set of economic incentives so that they do not take excessive risks, but instead behave in ways that generate outcomes that are supportive to economic growth and ongoing financial stability. This requires financial institutions to internalize the costs of their risk-taking activities up front and to hold capital and liquidity buffers sufficient to handle a plausible range of adverse outcomes. Finally, on occasions when these buffers prove inadequate and a financial firm does reach the brink of failure, the official sector needs the capacity to smoothly wind down such firms so that future taxpayer-funded rescues prove unnecessary.\n\nRegulatory and supervisory efforts to accomplish these goals are proceeding down several distinct but related paths:\n\nTurning first to the Basel III capital and liquidity standards agreed upon by the Governors and Heads of Supervision Committee (GHOS) in Basel last month, I believe these standards address some of the major shortcomings revealed by the crisis. In particular, the new standards will require banking organizations to significantly increase the amount of high-quality, loss-absorbing capital that they hold; significantly improve risk capture in trading, counterparty credit, securitization and other activities that the prior regulatory capital requirements did not adequately capture; make it more expensive for banks to provide liquidity guarantees to shadow banks; constrain the leverage that banking companies can take by introducing a credible, non-risk-based backstop; and increase the capacity of banks to absorb shocks that might temporarily impede their ability to access short-term funding markets. While these changes apply directly only to large internationally active banks, they will have wider ramifications for the financial system as a whole, including nonbanks and the capital markets.\n\nFurthermore, I believe that the agreement achieves an appropriate balance between significantly increasing the minimum capital and liquidity requirements for the major banks, while doing so in a way that recognizes the current state of the global economy and that seeks to minimize adjustment costs. The international regulatory community consciously has been willing to trade off a relatively slow phase-in period for the new standards in order to reach a much higher level of standards.\n\nThe new capital rules are intended to provide strong incentives for banks to change their business models in ways that make the system more stable and reduce the negative impact their actions have on others—for instance, by providing incentives to standardize OTC derivatives contracts and clear such standardized trades through central counterparties. To understand what these new requirements mean for the amount of capital banks will ultimately have to hold, it is important to note that one of the intended consequences of these changes is for banks to adjust their business models in ways that reduce the risks their activities generate. This adjustment will likely reduce the amount of extra capital that banks would need relative to a world in which they kept their business models unchanged even as the new rules were phased in. In other words, the impact on banks must be evaluated dynamically, not by taking a snapshot of the banks’ activities and balance sheets today.\n\nThat said, the new capital standards are much tougher than the existing regime. The requirements have been strengthened in several different dimensions. First, the standards emphasize common equity by creating an explicit quantitative capital standard for this highest form of capital, as compared with an implicit qualitative standard under the previous rules. This is important because the crisis demonstrated that bank investors and debt holders have a strong presumption that only common equity is truly loss absorbing outside bankruptcy. In the crisis, as losses climbed, Tier 1 capital ratios were eroded from the bottom, with tangible common equity ratios sometimes shrinking to levels that raised questions about a bank’s viability and its ability to access the equity and debt markets. Although common equity is typically a higher-cost form of capital for banks, it absorbs losses on a going-concern basis and so preserves an institution's viability in the eyes of the market much better than other forms of Tier I capital, such as perpetual preferred stock or trust preferred securities (TRUPS).\n\nSecond, the standards create a new definition of what constitutes common equity. The emphasis is on the ability of common equity to be loss absorbing. For that reason, there are limits on the amount of the assets that are not readily saleable or loss absorbing that can be counted toward a bank’s tangible common equity. These include assets such as mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets. Also, there is strict treatment of equity tied up in the form of minority interests. That is because this invested equity is not immediately available to the parent company to absorb losses in that company’s operations.\n\nThird, the minimum required ratio of total tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets will be increased significantly. Once the new standards are fully phased in, it will have to equal 4.5 percent of risk-weighted assets.\n\nFourth, the measure of risk-weighted assets—the denominator of the capital adequacy ratio—is constructed to better capture the risks that banks are taking in their activities. For example, the risks weights on trading account assets and for counterparty exposures have been increased substantially to reflect the lessons of the crisis. Note that due to better capture of the underlying risks, at least initially, aggregate risk-weighted assets in the system are likely to increase. This is not because the inherent riskiness of bank balance sheets has increased, but rather because that riskiness will be better captured.\n\nIn addition to the 4.5 percent minimum common equity standard, there is also a new capital conservation buffer requirement equal to 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets. If a bank were to incur losses and fall deeper and deeper into this buffer, increasingly tough limitations would come into play in terms of the bank’s ability to make capital distributions by paying dividends or buying back shares. This capital conservation buffer is designed to forestall the type of behavior that we saw during the crisis—banks continuing to dissipate capital by paying out dividends in order to demonstrate that they were strong. Instead, banks will have an incentive to raise additional equity to exit the buffer and its restrictions on distributions.\n\nIn order to maintain operational flexibility in terms of their business operations and an ongoing ability to distribute capital to their shareholders, we expect that banks will want to maintain their level of tangible common equity at or above 7 percent, the sum of the minimum requirement and the conservation buffer. However, we do anticipate that the buffer may be penetrated from time to time during adverse economic environments.\n\nFinally, the risk-based ratios will be back-stopped by a new leverage ratio standard, which will constrain the amount of overall leverage that a banking organization can take relative to the sum of its non-risk-weighted assets and off-balance-sheet exposures.\n\nTogether, these changes represent a very significant upgrade of the standards: A much higher proportion of this ratio is now met by common equity; that common equity is much better quality than before; the amount of risk-weighted assets against which capital must be held has increased and better reflects underlying risk; a new capital conservation buffer is added, and there is a new backstop against excessive leverage.\n\nSo what were the considerations that went into constructing this new standard? The basic goal was to enable the big, internationally active banks covered by the Basel Accord to absorb the type of losses associated with a major marketwide financial shock and still retain sufficient market confidence so that they could continue to be able to fund themselves and, if necessary, to raise additional equity without the need for unusual government support.\n\nI believe that the requirements were the outgrowth of at least four major considerations:\n\n1. What type of losses could banks expect to occur in a crisis? In other words, how thick a buffer was needed to absorb shocks? This is represented by the 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer. Although this is not thick enough to protect every bank in every crisis, it does create a loss-absorbing cushion so that banks will retain their ability to access the capital markets even after incurring significant losses.\n\n2. How much common equity must a bank hold to be viewed as viable by financial market participants? This is important because beyond a certain point banks lose their access to the capital markets, and this makes failure much more likely. The 4.5 percent minimum common equity requirement is set at a high enough level so that a bank operating above this level would very likely still be able to access the capital markets to replenish its capital base after large losses.\n\n3. What was achievable internationally? It is important to have international convergence in terms of standards. This is necessary to minimize competitive inequity and to avoid creating incentives for a race to the bottom. If standards differed markedly around the world, then the conversation would inevitably shift to “what will help my banks competitively” from “what levels of capital do we need to have a sound financial system.”\n\n4. What is the appropriate tradeoff between benefits and costs? There are diminishing returns in terms of the benefits of ever higher capital requirements. Setting the bar at too high a level would increase intermediation costs too much and drive activities offshore or into areas that are not as closely regulated. At some point, higher requirements would not make the financial system safer, just the regulated sector much smaller.\n\nOn this last point, some argue that the new standards are too severe. They argue that, in the short run, the higher standards could lead to a significant constraint in credit that could hurt the nascent economic expansion. And, they argue, in the long run, that the higher capital standards will inevitably drive up lending costs and that this will hurt economic performance. Although I believe the new standards do impose some real costs on the financial system in order to achieve real benefits, I believe that concerns over the costs are exaggerated.\n\nTurning first to the issue of the transition to the new regime, we cannot precisely predict the size of the adjustment costs as they will depend importantly on the strategies bank managers employ to meet the new requirements, and how bank investors respond to these actions. Nonetheless, I believe the transition is likely to be quite manageable for three reasons.\n\nFirst, many of the large U.S. banks already have large amounts of tangible common equity. In part, this represents the regulatory response during the crisis. The Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) in 2009 required the large banks to have a capital buffer consistent with achieving a Tier I common ratio of 4 percent under a stress environment considerably worse than what was anticipated (or did, in fact, occur). Banks that fell short of this were forced to raise additional capital. On top of this, Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) repayment terms provided strong incentives for banks to issue common equity to repay the TARP preferred stock. In addition, several banks converted preferred stock into common equity. Roughly speaking, the 19 banks subject to the SCAP generated more than $100 billion of common equity via share issuance and $80 billion via conversion of preferred stock into common equity in 2009.\n\nSecond, as noted above, the standards are being phased in slowly. For example, in 2013, the tangible common equity standard will be only 3.5 percent. In 2013, there will be no conservation buffer requirement and banks will still get credit for items that will ultimately be deducted from common equity, such as deferred tax assets. The Federal Reserve, as the consolidated supervisor of the largest and most complex banking companies, does not expect these banks to meet the fully phased in standards today. Instead, the Federal Reserve will require firms to develop an adequate capital plan to meet the Basel III requirements as they become effective and will track progress toward meeting those plans over time.\n\nThird, banks have many ways they can adjust their business models to meet the new standards as they are phased in. Many of these changes can occur without any risk of disruption to the flow of credit to households and business. For instance, banks can sell non-strategic assets to investors and can modify their minority investments in non-consolidated interests.\nLow-quality legacy assets, such as subprime mortgage loans and second mortgages, will mature and run off. Risk-weighted assets will tend to fall as the economy recovers. Moreover, as banks book profits, deferred tax assets will shrink, reducing the magnitude of these future deductions from common equity.\n\nFinally, it is important to note the significant potential earnings power of large U.S. banks, which have historically tended to have higher rates of return on their average assets relative to many of their foreign counterparts. Banks that currently are short of the 2019 standard could retain these future earnings to build up their capital ratios. Equity analysts project that the 20 largest U.S. banks will earn more than $80 billion in 2010, and consensus estimates expect that figure will increase to around $110 billion in 2011. Of course, because these estimates are dependent on an economy that continues to recover, we need to be cautious about relying entirely on as-yet-unrealized earnings as the primary means to meet the higher capital standards.\n\nSo what about the long-run consequences? It would be prudent to assume that requiring banks to hold more capital and higher cost capital is likely to result in somewhat higher lending spreads. Bank managements will need to generate sufficient income to support the rate of return on equity at a sufficient high level so banks can continue to attract capital from investors.\n\nOf critical importance is whether the increase in lending spreads is likely to be large or not. Those who argue that the new capital standards will necessitate a large increase in lending spreads generally start with a rigid set of assumptions. These include: 1) Return on bank equity is unchanged; 2) the increase in bank equity does not affect funding costs; and 3) there is no change in the banks’ book of business or on banks’ ability and willingness to adjust other expenses, such as compensation.\n\nSuch rigid assumptions are unrealistic. This is particularly important because each assumption is likely to be wrong in the direction that reduces the impact on lending margins. First, the necessary return on equity that banks will have to generate to be able to attract capital will likely fall. Because banks with more capital should be safer and have less volatile earnings, investors should demand a lower return on equity than before.\n\nSecond, by increasing the soundness of banks, an increase in bank equity, everything else equal, should also reduce funding costs. Third, higher bank lending spreads almost certainly will push some activity into the capital markets, constraining the magnitude of the rise in total lending costs. Finally, banks may be forced via competitive pressures to lower their compensation levels. By cutting compensation costs, banks could have smaller lending margins and still earn sufficient profits to generate a level of returns necessary to attract capital. Given all the potential margins for adjustment, there are good reasons to expect that the increase in lending margins will actually turn out to be quite modest.\n\nAlthough any increase will be a real cost, this appears to be a necessary and appropriate price to pay for a much more resilient financial system. The cost represented by higher lending spreads has to be weighed against the benefits of a more robust and resilient banking system. Recent years have surely taught us that easy access to credit that is underpriced because it is not backed by sufficient capital is not a sustainable route to prosperity. Indeed, to the extent that tougher standards reduce the misallocation of resources in the real economy that often accompanies periods of financial excess, ensure more consistent access to finance over time and encourage investment by holding out the prospect of greater economic stability, the new standards could be consistent with a more rapid sustainable growth rate over the long run.\n\nTurning next to the new Basel liquidity requirement, the new standard will likely necessitate a significant adjustment in behavior for those banks that historically relied on short-term wholesale funding and those that had negligible buffers but instead had relied on the Federal Reserve and the Federal Home Loan Bank System to be their liquidity backstops. However, the transition costs are likely to be quite manageable because, as was the case for the capital standards, there are many margins available for adjustment.\n\nBefore I assess the transition costs of the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) standard, a few words about what the LCR is intended to do and how it operates. The notion behind the LCR standard is that large, internationally active financial institutions should have a liquidity buffer that enables them to operate for 30 days in a stress environment without having to rely on government support, including central bank liquidity backstops. Banks would have to have sufficient liquid assets that they could sell to be able to meet outflows stemming from deposit withdrawals; bank debt that matures and is unable to be rolled over; and drawdowns from committed credit and liquidity facilities provided to financial firms and other entities. The size of the required liquidity buffer depends, in part, on the maturity of the bank’s assets and liabilities, the stickiness of its deposit liabilities, the amount of irrevocable liquidity backstops and composition of its assets.\n\nThe adjustment costs associated with the LCR standard should be low because, like capital, there are different, relatively low-cost ways to adjust to the standards. For example, because the liquidity buffer only needs to last for 30 days, a bank that extends the maturity of its short-term wholesale borrowing or its deposit liabilities by a month or two will find that this goes a long way in helping to meet this standard. Banks could also cut the level of their backstop liquidity lines and other commitments to financial firms. The standard assumes that such lines of credit can be fully drawn upon and thus, count as potential draws against the buffer.\n\nBecause the common international liquidity standards are relatively untested, regulators are implementing LCR with an “observation period.” What this means is that unanticipated and unintended consequences generated by the new liquidity standard will be closely scrutinized and, if necessary, adjustments will be made to the rules if undesirable effects become evident over time. For example, the tough requirements on backstop liquidity lines could potentially be modified if such rules generated unintended negative consequences for short-term corporate funding markets, such as the nonfinancial corporate commercial paper market.\n\nMoving on from the changes to capital and liquidity standards, I now want to discuss how firms, markets and the official sector deal with distress in the event that it does occur. Of paramount importance in making the financial system more robust is the need for a viable resolution mechanism for large, complex financial firms. The Dodd-Frank Act does this for the nonbank operations of systemically important U.S. financial firms by authorizing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), under certain conditions, to establish a “bridge” bank to liquidate the troubled firm’s operations in an orderly manner. Any net outlays incurred by the FDIC in this process must be recovered by assessing levies on the financial industry.\n\nThis resolution process is beneficial because an orderly resolution prevents the type of catastrophic collapse that leads to widespread market disruption. And it does so in a way that taxpayer funds are not at risk. However, much work needs to be done so that market participants can understand how such resolutions would work in practice. In particular, there will be some uncertainty about the precise conditions that will trigger a resolution under Title II of DFA. Even after DFA, the alternative of a normal Bankruptcy Code filing remains. In fact, DFA requires an evaluation as to why a filing under the Bankruptcy Code is not appropriate. In addition, the Dodd-Frank resolution process is complex, requiring multiple steps.\n\nMoreover, the resolution regime in Title II of Dodd Frank could be very difficult to implement for complex, globally active firms. These banks operate in diverse legal regimes worldwide and it is very doubtful that DFA will apply to these banks’ operations outside the United States.\n\nOne approach to this problem would be to harmonize the diverse insolvency laws in the various jurisdictions in which globally active firms have significant operations. But achieving this objective will be hard and take many years at a minimum.\n\nThis is one reason to require additional loss-absorbing capacity for systemically important firms, most (if not all) of which tend to be complex global organizations. Such a surcharge would be a mechanism to reduce the probability of failure for such firms below that of smaller firms.\n\nA surcharge for systemically important financial institutions has two motivations. First, it compensates for the distortion created by the fact that a large financial firm may still be resolved differently than smaller firms and that this could conceivably, by being an orderly resolution process, reduce the costs imposed upon creditors. To the extent creditors see this as a benefit, this might enable large banks to retain some funding advantage over smaller firms not likely to be resolved in the same fashion. Second, it recognizes the large costs imposed on the broader financial system by the failure of systemically important banks.\n\nSuch an approach is being pursued both internationally and in the United States. The recent Governors and Heads of Supervision meeting in Basel, for example, endorsed additional loss-absorbing capacity for systemically important firms. Similarly, the Dodd-Frank Act provides that the Federal Reserve shall establish prudential standards for systemically important financial companies, including capital and liquidity standards that are “more stringent” than for other institutions that do not present systemic risk.\n\nStrengthening financial market infrastructures is another important initiative underway to make the financial system more resilient and robust. In this regard, there are two important strands of work underway. First, there is strong momentum both in the United States and abroad to require that standardized OTC derivative products be cleared through central counterparties (CCPs) and that the information associated with all OTC derivatives trades be reported to trade repositories, with this information then being available to regulators around the world.\n\nSecond, the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the International Organization of Securities Commission (IOSCO) are undertaking a review of international standards for financial market infrastructures. This review will lead to a comprehensive set of recommendations as to what constitutes best practice with respect to the operations of financial market infrastructures. These recommendations will apply to a broad array of financial market infrastructures, including CCPs and trade repositories. The final report will be completed during the first half of 2011. The goal will be to have these standards endorsed by the Financial Stability Board and the G-20 leaders. With those endorsements, it should be possible to harden the recommendations into more substantial standards.\n\nIn all of the reforms that we are implementing it is important that we pay close attention to the shadow banking system. By shadow banks, I mean the largely unregulated financial entities that take credit risk and/or engage in maturity transformation without access to explicit governmental backstops such as the Federal Reserve’s discount window and or deposit insurance. As we saw in the crisis, without such support, these institutions are vulnerable to runs. When this occurred, the shadow banking sector imploded in a way that imposed significant costs on the regulated sector.\n\nThe risk is that tighter capital and liquidity requirements for the large financial institutions could push much of the business of credit intermediation and maturity transformation from the regulated sector to the unregulated sector. However, this risk is mitigated by the fact that shadow banks heavily rely on credit support and liquidity lines from the regulated sector. The costs of such facilities will be affected by the new capital and liquidity standards for banks. Thus, the economics of the shadow-banking sector are likely to change in a way that makes such activities less attractive. In addition, by increasing transparency and requiring some risk retention by issuers, Dodd-Frank should make the securitization markets in which shadow banks operate less likely to support poorly underwritten credit. Taken together, these changes mean it is less likely that there will be widespread movement of credit and maturity transformation from the regulated sector to the unregulated sector. Nonetheless, as my colleague Governor Tarullo noted in a recent speech,1 more will need to be done to increase the stability of the unregulated sector, and developments in this area will need to be scrutinized carefully in the years ahead.\n\nBefore closing, let me reiterate the importance to achieve harmonized global standards. As noted earlier, this is important for competitive equity reasons. But more importantly, it is necessary to ensure that banks and other financial firms cannot move their activities to evade regulation. If that were to occur, we would just have a race to the bottom and a less transparent and even more complex financial system.\n\nIn this respect, it is important that we regulate the U.S. operations of foreign banks in a way that is consistent with how U.S. banks are treated. It is also important that we work for the same type of national treatment abroad, and when there are differences in regulatory regimes, that we find ways of reducing or eliminating the substantive differences over time.\n\nFinally, it is important that we clarify the responsibilities of the home and host countries and work to better share information across the regulatory community. This can help ensure that regulatory decisions are made and applied in a consistent and fair manner. It is also my hope that by establishing a robust global regime, we can mitigate the incentives for national regulators and supervisors to impose local rules that make it hard for globally active institutions to manage their operations on a global basis, thereby undermining the global integration of markets that has supported economic globalization.\n\nOver the next 12 to 18 months, regulators will be particularly busy in implementing these reform efforts. Broad legal statutes now have to be turned into specific rules and regulations governing business practices, conduct and operations. Doing this well—in particular, in a way that is sufficiently informed, deep and broad—will be very important. Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Act are important markers on this road, but it will always be a journey to a never-reached destination of perfection.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n__________________________________________\n\n1 Governor Daniel K.

        "content": "Viewed through the lens of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate—the pursuit of the highest level of employment consistent with price stability, the current situation is wholly unsatisfactory. Given the outlook that the upturn appears likely to strengthen only gradually, it will likely be several years before employment and inflation return to levels consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.\n\nToday, I will discuss why the recovery has been disappointing and highlight some of the issues facing the Federal Reserve and monetary policy, echoing some of the themes laid out by Chairman Bernanke in his Jackson Hole speech in late August. As always, what I am going to say reflects my own views and does not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Open Market Committee and the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIn recent quarters the pace of growth has been disappointing even relative to our modest expectations at the start of the year. After rising at about a 3.25 percent annual rate during the second half of 2009, there has been a progressive slowing—to a 2.75 percent annual rate during the first half of the year and, very likely, to an even slower rate in the third quarter.\n\nThe factors responsible for the failure of the recovery to pick up speed include: (1) the gradual petering out of the contribution from the swing in inventories from rapid liquidation during the first half of 2009 to a modest increase in the second quarter of 2010; 2) the sluggish recovery in consumer spending; and 3) the continued weakness in housing. Normally, at this stage of recovery, the handoff from growth led by inventory accumulation to growth led by private final demand would have been more fully accomplished. This handoff has been delayed because households have been paying down their debts—a process known as deleveraging. In addition, many businesses have been reluctant to hire. This has limited income growth.  Slow income growth, and along with caution in the face of economic uncertainty, has also restrained spending.\n\nAlthough so-called “soft-patches” are quite common during the early stages of an economic expansion, this soft patch is a bit different. First, it looks like it will last somewhat longer because the deleveraging process is not yet complete. Second, the current weakness is somewhat more concerning because it is occurring at a time that the central bank has already cut interest rates to near zero.\n\nIn fact, this failure of the recovery to “catch fire” has occurred despite aggressive monetary and fiscal policy steps to stimulate the economy. On the monetary policy side, short-term interest rates have been nearly zero for a year and a half; the Fed purchased $1.7 trillion of long-term assets, and the proceeds from maturing securities are being reinvested to keep the balance sheet from shrinking unduly. On the fiscal side, a series of measures has provided support to a broad range of activities.\n\nThe sluggish nature of the recovery in the face of very substantial stimulus reflects the dynamics at work during the expansion that preceded it. Beginning around 2003, underwriting standards for residential mortgages were significantly relaxed, leading to a sharp rise in household borrowing and in home prices. The two trends were inextricably linked. The rise in home prices helped to support additional demand for credit as households used the collateral represented by their homes to borrow large sums of money via home equity lines of credit and second mortgages. Chart 1 illustrates how the growing proportion of nonprime first mortgage loans helped fuel the sharp rise in home prices.\n\nAs home prices rose and the stock market performed strongly, household net worth rose sharply. Households responded by borrowing more and saving less. After all, why save when the rise in home prices was adding to your wealth and the housing equity created by the rise in home prices could be easily tapped for funds as needed? The use of home equity as a source for funds to support consumption is evident in the fact that the homeowners’ equity as a share of home values was essentially flat over this period (Chart 2). This indicates that homeowners were borrowing against their accumulated gains. The surge in home prices pushed up the ratio of household net worth to disposable income to nearly 640 percent and the personal saving fell below 2 percent (Chart 3).\n\nThe surge in home prices was fueled by products and practices in the financial sector that led to a rapid and unsustainable buildup of leverage and an underpricing of risk during this period. These dynamics in turn provided the fuel that caused house prices and consumer spending to rise much faster than income. As shown in Chart 4, the share of GDP accounted for by consumption and residential investment climbed to a peak of 76 percent in 2005 from 71 percent in the mid-1990s.\n\nThe boom, of course, was unsustainable. The progressive easing of underwriting standards that was needed to support housing demand could only persist as long as housing prices were rising rapidly. But for home prices to rise rapidly, underwriting standards had to be progressively relaxed in order to generate more buyers. When home prices began to slip beginning in 2006, the dynamic swung into reverse. The collateral values supporting borrowing and spending began to fall.\n\nAs banks’ and other financial intermediaries’ credit losses began to mount, credit availability became impaired and this exacerbated the downward pressure on home prices and on borrowing and spending. Not only did households that had overextended themselves have to cut back; others also retrenched because they were also affected by declines in wealth and heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook and their job prospects.\n\nIt is not surprising that the workout from the excesses of this type of boom would take a long time. Just as it took several years for the boom to begin and run its course, so it would take years, not months, for households and financial intermediaries to adjust their balance sheets and behavior to the new environment. Households had to raise their saving rates in order to rebuild their balance sheets. Financial intermediaries had to replenish their capital to replace losses via loan charge-offs and other credit impairments. Both adjustments would need to occur before the economy could grow rapidly.\n\nWith this in mind, the key questions are: 1) Where are we in the adjustment process, and 2) what, if anything, can monetary policy do to facilitate a smoother adjustment and more rapid progress toward our dual mandate objectives?\n\nIn terms of the adjustment process, starting on the household side, most signs point to significant progress. For example, the revisions to the national income and product accounts announced in July revealed substantial upward revisions to the personal saving rate (Chart 5). The current saving rate is broadly consistent with the historical relationship between personal saving and the household net worth-to-income ratio. Of course, part of this story depends on the stabilization of household net worth, which had earlier fallen sharply due to declines in both home and equity prices. Although household net worth dropped significantly again in the second quarter according to the Flow of Funds accounts, the subsequent rise in the U.S. equity market is likely to have reversed that decline. Meanwhile, housing price declines have moderated substantially, helped, in part, by the fact that the low level of mortgage rates combined with the sharp drop in house prices has resulted in a substantial improvement in affordability (Chart 6).\n\nHouseholds have retrenched in terms of their borrowing and this has helped push down the household debt-to-income ratio sharply from its peak in 2007. Another factor behind the fall in the debt-to-income ratio has been credit losses and debt forgiveness. Since 2007, charge-offs have reduced household debt outstanding by over $880 billion.\n\nSome argue that the decline in the household debt-to-income ratio must go much further before the deleveraging process can be complete. After all, the household debt-to-income ratio is still far above the level reached as late as 2002, before the surge in household borrowing began. Some even argue that household debt-to-income ratios must fall back to the level of the 1980s. I think that this is an overly pessimistic view for a simple reason—both household debt and household financial assets have been rising faster than income growth on a secular basis since the 1950s. Focusing just on debt misses what is happening on the other side of the balance sheet (Chart 7). One reason why both household assets and debt have been rising faster than income is due to greater financial intermediation. For instance, tax incentives encourage people to fund their 401(K) pension plans rather than pay down mortgage debt as they get older.\n\nThe notion that the household adjustment process is well advanced is also supported by other data, as well. For example, the share of after-tax income devoted to servicing debts, as well as paying property taxes and homeowners insurance or rent, has declined sharply over the past two years and is now back to levels that prevailed in the late 1990s (Chart 8). In addition to the declining stock of debt, households have been able to refinance outstanding debt at lower interest rates.\n\nMoreover, mortgage delinquency rates, even in the most serious category, have started to fall, and data that tracks changes in the proportion of borrowers who are delinquent and then become current versus becoming even more delinquent is encouraging (Charts 9 and 10). Finally, the less serious delinquencies for credit card, auto and student loans have been trending lower, though not the more serious delinquencies (Chart 11). Of course, these recent improvements have come in the context of the stabilization in unemployment and house prices. To ensure that the more favorable trends in household balance sheets continue, the economic environment needs to become more supportive.\n\nWe should recognize that there is still considerable uncertainty about the level of the saving rate and configuration of household balance sheets that will prevail in the coming years. It is possible that households now perceive the world to be a riskier place than they did before and will want to have more “rainy day” funds. More saving may also be needed to meet higher downpayment requirements for home purchases. Thus, while we may be far along in the adjustment process, it is difficult to judge just how much further we have to go.\n\nTurning now to the issue of credit availability, there is no question that credit conditions are still tight. There are a number of impediments: 1) Financial institutions—many of which still face balance sheet problems of their own—have tightened underwriting standards and, 2) a decline in property prices has cut collateral values and made the refinancing of many residential and commercial mortgages difficult.\n\nOn the banking side, there is considerable differentiation across the industry in terms of health. The largest banks in the United States are generally in much improved health following the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) in 2009, which led to substantial additional equity raising. For smaller banks, the situation is more mixed. According to the FDIC, as of June 30, 2010, 829 of the nation’s 7,830 commercial banks and savings institutions remain on the FDIC’s problem institution list.\n\nBut overall, the situation is one in which credit availability is slowly improving. According to the Federal Reserve’s Senior Loan Officers Survey, the percentage of banks reporting that they were tightening credit standards across a wide range of lending categories peaked in late 2008. The most recent data indicate that virtually no banks are tightening standards, and a number of banks have begun to relax credit terms (Chart 12).\n\nIn addition to households, the small-business sector is another area that has seen a contraction in credit. Focus groups and surveys conducted by the Federal Reserve System suggest this contraction is the result of three distinct factors—a decline in demand for credit, a tightening of lending standards, and a weakening of credit quality due to lower collateral values and cash flows.1 Which is the most important is difficult to discern.\n\nHowever, surveys of small-business owners indicate that much of the weakness in lending to this sector reflects lack of demand. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) Small Business Optimism Index, for instance, asks respondents to indicate their single most important problem from a standard list. For some time now, the response “poor sales” has been the most frequently cited problem. In contrast, relatively few respondents cite “financial and interest rates” as the most important problem (Chart 13). A caveat to this is that credit constraints could be inhibiting the formation of new small businesses—something that surveys of existing firms would not capture.\n\nAlthough credit availability has begun to improve, the decline in collateral values remains a significant impediment. For example, housing prices have declined so far that nearly one quarter of homes are now worth less than the value of the mortgages that finance them. Lacking sufficient collateral value, such homeowners cannot take advantage of the fact that conforming mortgage rates are at their lowest level in history and refinance their mortgages. Overall, the desire to rebuild wealth through savings and the limits on credit availability to households has acted to restrain consumer spending, keeping the recovery tepid.\n\nTo some degree, this adjustment is unavoidable, as the economy had reached unsustainable levels of consumption and housing demand. However, the fact that many of these adjustments are inevitable does not rule out a role for monetary policy to support economic activity. Very low interest rates can help smooth the adjustment process by supporting asset valuations, including making housing more affordable and by allowing some borrowers to reduce debt interest payments.\n\nBeyond this direct role in smoothing the deleveraging process—to the extent that monetary policy can “cut off the tail” of the distribution of potential adverse economic outcomes, making a truly disastrous outcome less likely—it can help encourage those households and businesses with money to spend to do so.\n\nToday’s low and falling rate of inflation—at a time when interest rates are near zero—is a problem that is slowing the adjustment process. Currently, by most measures, inflation is below the level that members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) view as consistent with price stability. Although the Federal Reserve has no formal numerical inflation target, it is noteworthy that the long-run inflation forecasts of the FOMC members cluster around 1.75 percent to 2 percent for the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator. This compares with a 1.5 percent year-over-year rate for the PCE deflator and 1.4 percent rate for the core PCE deflator, which excludes food and energy prices.\n\nLow and falling inflation is a problem for several reasons. First, low and declining inflation makes it harder to accomplish needed balance sheet adjustments. That is because, all other things being equal, lower inflation means slower nominal income growth. Slower nominal income growth, in turn, means that less of the needed adjustment in household debt-to-income ratios will come from rising incomes. This puts more of the adjustment burden on paying down debt.\n\nSecond, and even more importantly, low and falling inflation can cause inflation expectations to decline. This is important because inflation expectations are an important factor that influences actual future inflation. Moreover, when inflation expectations decline, the expected real cost of credit increases—a subject I will return to in a moment.\n\nSo what could the Federal Reserve do? As I see it, there are two potentially complementary avenues. First, we could take steps to make our current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy more effective in stimulating economic activity by providing additional guidance about what we are trying to achieve today and in the future. Second, we could find ways to increase the amount of stimulus we currently provide via our balance sheet.\n\nTurning to the first issue, clear communication about objectives and intent is an important element of effective monetary policy. For example, communicating clearly our intention to return inflation to more normal levels can help keep inflation expectations well anchored around levels consistent with our inflation goals. As the central bank, we and we alone can control inflation—if not precisely in the short run, then over the medium term. By clarifying our intentions, we can reduce the risk of further disinflation—or even an outright debt-deflation spiral that would make it still more difficult to accomplish the necessary balance-sheet adjustments.\n\nClear communication on the part of a central bank is important at all times, but it is even more critical when the federal funds rate is at or near its effective lower bound. In this environment, a decline in inflation expectations that drives up the real interest rate and thereby increases the real cost of credit cannot be offset by simply lowering the federal funds rate. Thus, in a very direct sense, a fall in inflation expectations when the target interest rate is at the zero bound represents a de facto tightening of monetary policy and of financial conditions. Such a tightening would clearly be highly undesirable at a moment when unemployment is too high, inflation is too low and the economy has only moderate forward momentum.\n\nIn this situation, the FOMC must be clear and resolute in its commitment to its price stability objective. This is why the most recent FOMC statement clearly stated that underlying inflation was running somewhat below levels consistent with the dual mandate.\n\nThere are a range of options we could pursue if we judged it worthwhile to go even further in communicating our objectives and intent. We could be even more explicit with regard to the inflation rate that the Committee views as compatible with price stability, for instance, by stating an explicit inflation objective as is common practice in other advanced economies. This could help anchor inflation expectations at the desired rate. It would also clarify the extent to which the current level of inflation falls short of that rate.\n\nIf we were to go down this path, it would be important to note that any provision of more information on our inflation objective would not be a signal that the inflation element of the dual mandate had become more important than the full employment objective. Instead, it would principally reflect the fact that inflation being “too low” (just like inflation being “too high”) is an impediment to achieving the full employment objective of the dual mandate.\n\nIf we judged it desirable, we could go still further and provide more guidance on how monetary policy would react to deviations from any stated inflation objective. One possibility would be to keep track of inflation shortfalls when the federal funds rate is constrained by the zero bound, as is the case today. For example, if inflation in 2011 were a 0.5 percentage point below the Fed’s inflation objective, the Fed might aim to offset this miss by an additional 0.5 percentage point rise in the price level in future years.\n\nIn the current environment, such an approach would have some advantages as well as some disadvantages. When there is a large amount of slack in the economy, the Federal Reserve might not easily be able to hit an inflation objective soon. But, the central bank could plausibly promise to make up the difference later on. Indeed, the further the Fed fell behind its inflation objective in the near term, the more inflation would need to increase in order to push the actual path of prices up to the path consistent with price stability over the long run. To the extent this policy was more credible, it might do a better job keeping inflation expectations from falling. This might make monetary policy more stimulative and, thus, might help the FOMC achieve its objectives more quickly.\n\nHowever, such an approach would only work well if people understood how it would operate and formed their expectations of future inflation accordingly. And there could also be significant costs. For example, if people mistakenly concluded that the Fed was tinkering with its long-run inflation objective, this could lead to greater uncertainty about future inflation. This might lead to higher risk premia and higher nominal interest rates that would undermine the effectiveness of such a policy to stimulate the economy.\n\nIn addition to communication strategies, the Federal Reserve has a second set of tools, namely the ability to expand its balance sheet to stimulate activity and move inflation toward desired levels—either by purchasing medium and long-term Treasuries or agency mortgage-backed securities. Such purchases of long-duration assets pull down the level of long-term interest rates by removing duration from private-sector hands, who respond by purchasing other long-dated assets.\n\nTwo interesting questions pertain to balance sheet expansion: (1) How much would the Fed have to purchase to have a given impact on the level of long-term interest rates and economic activity, and, (2) what constraints exist in terms of limits to balance- sheet expansion, and what are the costs involved that could impede efforts to meet the dual mandate now or in the future? The questions demand serious consideration prior to any decision to expand the balance sheet further.\n\nWith respect to the first question, some simple calculations based on recent experience suggest that $500 billion of purchases would provide about as much stimulus as a reduction in the federal funds rate of between half a point and three quarters of a point. But this estimate is sensitive to how long market participants expected the Fed to hold on to these assets.\n\nMore broadly, the clearer and more credible the framework governing purchases, the greater the likelihood that market participants would act in a manner that helped the Fed achieve its objectives. In particular, the more confident market participants are in the Fed’s ability to exit when the time is right, the more effective its purchases will be in stimulating the economy.\n\nSuppose the Fed was indeed successful in reducing long-term interest rates further—what then? Some claim that lower rates would have no effect on economic activity—that the Fed would be “pushing on a string.” This is too dark a view. Although the responsiveness of demand to reductions in interest rates is probably lower in a world in which balance sheet constraints are important, the responsiveness is not zero. I believe that it remains significant.\n\nEven in today’s challenging circumstances, lower long-term rates would support the economy through a number of channels. Lower long-term rates would support the value of assets, including houses and equities and household net worth. Lower long-term rates would make housing more affordable and support consumption by enabling households to refinance their mortgages at lower rates. This would increase the amount of income left over for other spending. Of course, this channel can be made more powerful to the extent that further progress can be made in efficient mortgage debt restructurings that allow households with negative equity in their homes to take advantage of the drop in mortgage rates. In addition, lower long-term rates would reduce the cost of capital for businesses, thereby fostering higher levels of capital spending for any given economic outlook.\n\nIn considering the limits to balance sheet expansion, there are two constraints—one major and one more minor. The first constraint is the risk that the balance sheet expansion might cause inflation expectations to become unanchored, leading to higher risk premia. This risk is presumably greater in a period in which budget deficits are high, as they are today.\n\nIf exit concerns were to rise as purchases increased, then a rise in inflation risk premia would offset at least some of the expected fall in interest rates. In contrast, the more credible the ultimate exit strategy, the less likely it is that inflation risk premia would go up and the more effective purchases would be in lowering long-term rates. Also, the more credible the ultimate exit plan, the more confident investors would be about the Fed’s willingness to do what is needed to accomplish its objectives. This is important because it would help stabilize longer-run inflation expectations at levels consistent with the dual mandate.\n\nThe FOMC should be able to assure investors that it has both the means and the will to exit when—but not before—the time is right. That is because the Federal Reserve has the tools to control financial conditions and credit creation even with an expanded balance sheet. Payment of interest on reserves allows us to control short-term rates with even a large amount of excess reserves outstanding. In addition, we can drain excess reserves in several ways. We have developed term deposit accounts and the ability to conduct reverse repurchase operations with a large number of counterparties that would allow us to drain a large volume of reserves. Also, when the time is right, the Fed can always sell assets. Such asset sales would lead to a rise in longer-term rates and this would have a contractionary effect on the demand for credit.\n\nI am very mindful of concerns here and abroad that balance sheet expansion could be interpreted as a policy of monetizing the federal debt. However, I regard this view to be fundamentally mistaken. It misses the point of what would be motivating the Federal Reserve. The FOMC would only engage in large-scale asset purchases in order to push the economy more rapidly toward the dual mandate goals of full employment and price stability. Once these goals were accomplished, there would be no basis for further purchases regardless of the government’s fiscal position because additional purchases would not be consistent with this mandate.\n\nThe second constraint is that further balance sheet expansion would increase the Federal Reserve’s interest rate risk by raising the maturity mismatch between its assets and liabilities. Recall that the bulk of the Fed’s liabilities are overnight reserves and the bulk of its assets are longer-term Treasuries, agency and agency MBS securities. The bigger the balance sheet becomes, the more a future rise in interest rates will squeeze the Federal Reserve’s net interest margin.\n\nSome worry that this exposure to higher short-term rates could conceivably affect the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy credibility in the future. Some market participants might worry that the Federal Reserve could become reluctant to raise short-term rates in a timely way because this would constrain the amount of revenue that it would earn and remit to the Treasury. I am confident there is nothing to worry about on this score.\n\nEven if the Federal Reserve was not obliged to act in keeping with its dual mandate—which it is—with its assets skewed toward longer-duration securities, the Federal Reserve would have every incentive to ensure price stability over the long term.\n\nIt is true that the larger the size of the balance sheet, the more likely it is that the Fed would ultimately sell assets back into the market, potentially at prices that could result in losses. Although some fear that such losses could compromise the Federal Reserve’s independence, there is no reason why this should be the case, providing we stick closely to our mandate at all times.\n\nTo date, the Fed’s actions in responding to the crisis have resulted in abnormally large profits that might reasonably be set against any subsequent losses. But much more importantly, our dual mandate does not state that we should do what is necessary to promote full employment and price stability only at times when we are virtually certain that in doing so we will make a profit. It directs us to promote full employment and price stability at all times. Profits and losses in any given year are much less important than getting the U.S. economy back to the highest level of employment consistent with price stability.\n\nIn making our assessments about next steps, we need to be a bit humble about our capacity to forecast how market participants would respond to our actions. We do not control their behavior nor have much historical experience that we can draw on to easily assess how they are likely to behave. Even viewpoints that turned out to be incorrect could persist for a long time and generate adverse consequences. It is not enough for us to be right in theory. We also have to be convincing in practice and in explaining why concerns we think are misplaced are indeed unwarranted.\n\nAs Chairman Bernanke indicated at Jackson Hole, the FOMC’s decision with respect to providing additional accommodation will be made by weighing the costs against the benefits. This is a dynamic process, which depends on the evolution of the economic outlook and our own ability to learn how to become more effective in improving the cost/benefit trade-offs.\n\nAnd, at its last meeting in September, the FOMC said it is “prepared to provide additional accommodation if needed to support the economic recovery and to return inflation, over time, to levels consistent with its mandate.”\n\nCurrently, my assessment is that both the current levels of unemployment and inflation and the timeframe over which they are likely to return to levels consistent with our mandate are unacceptable. In addition, the longer this situation prevails and the U.S. economy is stuck with the current level of slack and disinflationary pressure, the greater the likelihood that a further shock could push us still further from our dual mandate objectives and closer to outright deflation.\n\nWe have tools that can provide additional stimulus at costs that do not appear to be prohibitive. Thus, I conclude that further action is likely to be warranted unless the economic outlook evolves in a way that makes me more confident that we will see better outcomes for both employment and inflation before too long.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n__________________________________________\n\n1Chairman Ben S.

        "content": "I. National economic conditions\nTo provide some context, I'll begin with a few words about national economic conditions. U.S. economic activity has expanded for four consecutive quarters, but at rates that can only be described as modest when compared with early stages of past recoveries. The June payroll numbers tell the story of this sluggish recovery in employment. The economy gained only 83,000 private-sector jobs, following a downwardly revised gain of only 33,000 in May. Growth in the third quarter may turn out to be a bit less than we saw in the first half of the year, though we think there is only a slight risk of a double dip. The road to recovery is turning out to be a bit bumpy as relatively weak consumer spending and the ongoing problems in financial markets are keeping growth far less robust than we would like.\n\nTo date, the manufacturing sector has been a key source of growth during the recovery. After an unusually steep decline from late 2007 to mid-2009, manufacturing output has grown rapidly over the past year, although the level of manufacturing output remains well below the previous peak. A major force behind the growth of manufacturing output has been an unusually pronounced inventory cycle. Production has expanded as firms across a variety of industries have been rebuilding their stocks to bring them into a better balance with sales. Another driver of manufacturing output over the past several quarters has been a pronounced rebound of our exports of manufactured goods. Economic activity abroad has been recovering from its weak levels in 2009, and that global recovery has helped fuel demand for our products, particularly capital goods.\n\nThe importance of manufacturing in the recovery makes it a timely topic for our regional economic briefing, namely, trends in the manufacturing sector here in the Second District.\n\nII. Regional Economic Conditions (update since the April regional press briefing)\nTurning to our region, we can see a nascent recovery in most areas, with a holding pattern in other parts. This mixed pattern of growth is not surprising in the aftermath of a recession, and particularly a deep one with a financial crisis, as well. On the positive side, I can report that economic activity has picked up in many parts of the region.\n\nTo measure activity we use a set of indexes of economic activity—called Coincident Economic Indicators—that we produce here at the New York Fed for New York State, New York City and New Jersey, plus a similar index produced in Puerto Rico. These indexes provide a timely, monthly gauge of economic activity. They show that in New York State and New York City, activity has expanded at a relatively brisk pace since the beginning of the year. In Puerto Rico, where the recession began three years before the mainland downturn, the economy also appears to be picking up in recent months. In contrast, economic conditions in New Jersey remain essentially flat. Although activity there is no longer declining, New Jersey has yet to establish a sustained recovery.\n\nBut, what about jobs—which are the key for people to truly feel the recovery in their lives? I am pleased to note that private-sector job growth has turned up moderately across much of the region in the past few months, just as it has in the nation. Growth in private-sector jobs signals that some firms need to hire workers to meet their production needs. This is a good sign and necessary for a sustainable recovery. The number of private-sector jobs has increased in and around New York City, in Northern New Jersey and in some parts of upstate New York. The June job market report for New York and New Jersey showed the recovery is likely to be a bit bumpy. Private-sector employment fell in both in New York State and New York City, though despite June's dip, employment in New York City remains above its low point in December 2009. In contrast, New Jersey's private-sector jobs picture improved in June, though a weak public sector there continues to weigh down overall job growth.\n\nDespite the improvements we have seen, unemployment in the region remains painfully high. In June, New York City's and New Jersey's rates were very close to the national jobless rate of 9.5 percent. The rate for New York State, which has been improving since the first quarter, is noticeably lower at 8.2 percent. Puerto Rico, which has had much higher unemployment than the mainland for the past several decades, had a jobless rate of 16.3 percent in June, with little evidence of recovery so far.\n\nIII. Regional Manufacturing Sector\nBackground\nThe manufacturing sector is important to our region because it provides a substantial number of high-wage jobs and, in some parts of the region, is a key driver of business cycles and longer-term trends. To understand manufacturing in our region, it is important to note that different parts of the region specialize in different products. For example, New York City's largest manufacturing industry is apparel; motor-vehicle parts is a large industry in western New York, as are computers and electronics in Syracuse, Binghamton and the Hudson Valley. The pharmaceuticals industry is dominant in Northern New Jersey and Puerto Rico.\n\nOver the past several decades, manufacturing wages have risen, while the number of workers it employs has fallen, These long-term trends stem from fundamental structural changes in trade, technology and consumption patterns. Some manufacturing has moved to other parts of the United States or overseas. The advent of information technology and computerization has also profoundly altered many manufacturing processes. And, the mix of products demanded by consumers has evolved over time. All of these factors have combined to reduce the number of factory jobs across the nation, with the New York/New Jersey region hit particularly hard. What is less well known is that despite this employment decline, manufacturing output has actually continued to grow moderately in much of the New York/New Jersey region. This means that the sector has experienced substantial gains in productivity. These productivity gains—the result of innovation and adaptation—have been accompanied by rising average wages in manufacturing. Like the rest of the country, our job losses have been heavily concentrated in lower-skill positions, resulting in a leaner and more skilled manufacturing industry.\n\nThe manufacturing sector and its structural job-wage dynamics are particularly important in upstate New York. Upstate (especially in its rural areas) manufacturing workers tend to earn higher wages than the average in their region, and the sector employs a larger share of the workforce there than it does nationally.\n\nOutlook\nHow will the current recovery in manufacturing employment play out? Nationally, the growth in manufacturing output over the past year has occurred in a variety of industries, including autos, machinery, and computers and other electronic equipment. This growth reflects a combination of the restocking of inventories, domestic demand growth (particularly in investment goods), and higher exports. The concentration of these industries in parts of our region meant that those areas were poised to take advantage of this growth. The region has seen some increase in factory jobs in recent months, which undoubtedly reflects the expansion of production that has occurred nationally in these industries.\n\nA number of indicators suggest that the inventory cycle may be largely complete—that is, the recent restocking has brought inventories into a better balance with sales. If so, we will lose restocking as an impetus for growth. Despite this, we expect manufacturing output to continue to expand because of improving domestic demand and foreign demand for U.S. manufactured exports. Yet, if this recovery follows the typical pattern for past recoveries, the prospect for growth in factory jobs will likely be weaker here than the rest of the nation.\n\nLonger term, the sector's prospects are likely to be governed by a continuation of the trends I mentioned before in international trade, technology and consumption patterns. This means that output and wages will likely continue to rise, both nationally and regionally. However, the sector is unlikely to be a major source of job growth. Beyond the national trends that work against an expansion of factory jobs, the New York–New Jersey region faces ongoing competitive pressures as a location for manufacturing production. That competition comes from other regions of the country, as well as from abroad. One key to meeting these competitive challenges will be for the region to ensure that it develops and attracts a highly skilled workforce that can meet the needs of innovative and rapidly changing firms.\n\nIV. The Empire State Manufacturing Survey\nIn order to monitor conditions in the region, the New York Fed conducts a monthly survey of manufacturing firms in New York State, our Empire State Manufacturing Survey. Let me tell you a little about the survey and then review recent patterns.\n\nThe survey is sent to a pool of about 200 manufacturing executives in a wide variety of industries across the state. About 100 responses are usually received. For the survey's main index—which is called the General Business Conditions Index—respondents report the change from the previous month in of overall conditions in their firm. To explain their answers, we also ask them to assess components of activity such as orders, shipments, inventories and employment. Respondents are also asked for their views on the likely direction of these indicators over the next six months. In addition, each month we ask supplementary questions on a topic of current interest. To share the information as quickly and broadly as possible, we post results on our public website on the 15th of each month or the next business day. In doing this survey, we join the four other Federal Reserve Banks that use a survey to monitor conditions in their manufacturing sectors.\n\nThis morning I want to highlight the results of our July survey, which we released last Thursday. Our main index began to signal an upturn in the manufacturing sector in New York State last summer and, despite a brief dip last December, has given a consistently positive signal for a year now. Our July survey showed that conditions continue to improve, but at a slower pace than in previous months. In this month's supplementary questions, we asked respondents about the importance of trade with various parts of the world to manufacturing activity in New York State. In general, respondents indicated that exports account for a growing share of their revenues. Their firms are devoting more resources to marketing abroad—particularly in Asia—and expect their export sales to be higher in the next 12 months than in the past 12 months.\n\nIn sum, the region is showing signs of a moderate recovery, and the manufacturing sector is playing a key role in that recovery in parts of the region.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I will now ask Jaison Abel to provide more details on current regional economic conditions."

        "content": "Thank you to the graduates and members of the faculty and administration for selecting me as New College of Florida's 44th commencement speaker. I am very grateful for the opportunity to speak here today in such a beautiful setting. It's nice to be back.\n\nEarlier today, I had the pleasure of meeting a few of you—in a smaller setting—to hear about your plans for after graduation; or should I say, tomorrow. I am very impressed with the high caliber of graduates in your class. I also had a tour of the campus today, which I must say has changed a lot in the past 30 years. One thing that hasn't changed, however, is the Palm Court—or as you all so affectionately call it, the \"center of the universe.\"\n\nI have very fond memories of my time at New College, aside from those great Palm Court parties. I received a terrific education and made some life-long friends. I hope the same has been true about your New College experience.\n\nI am especially grateful for the support from the faculty over the years—both while I was a student and afterwards. There are two people I would particularly like to highlight:\n\nJan Van der Veen—Jan was the professor who really got me started in economics.\n\nBob Bennedetti—Bob agreed to a contract in which I would get a semester of college credit mainly through working on the 1972 presidential campaign in the California primary election and in Ohio for the general election. Probably learned more from that experience than anything else I have ever done in higher education. I would encourage all of you—Republicans, Democrats and Independents—to get involved in public service at some point in your careers.\n\nI have many memories of New College—some about people such as Jan and Bob, and others about events and experiences. For example, one of the most remarkable events I have ever witnessed occurred here one night in December 1972—the first Apollo spacecraft night launch. I remember staring out from the top of a dormitory roof not far from here across the horizon looking at the star specks —wondering, is that the rocket? When it actually came up over the horizon it truly was amazing. I remember it as no bigger than a half-inch gap between your thumb and index finger at arm's length. And as the liftoff proceeded and the vapor trail started to decline over the horizon following the curvature of the Earth—I really could see clearly that the world was truly round. Maybe that's a good metaphor for my New College experience!\n\nMy only truly unpleasant memory here was one literature course (student taught, I might add) in which I received an evaluation that essentially noted that I could not read, write or think. I like to think that was a bit harsh, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion!\n\nNew College truly is a special place. I like to call it \"graduate school for undergraduates\" because it really is a place that encourages students to intellectually engage, learn, think and communicate.\n\nThe unstructured format of evaluations and contracts rather than grades is not for everyone—some folks need more structure. But I see that you have made it through and I congratulate you for that—it is an important milestone in your life.\n\nToday, I want to talk about two issues: the economy you face as you graduate, and some advice—call it \"lessons learned\"—that might have some value to you as you contemplate what you are going to do with the rest of your life.\n\nThe Economy You Face as New Graduates\nThe U.S. economy is recovering and we are now seeing the first signs of significant employment growth. Thus, this is a better year to graduate than last. However, finding a job will not be easy—the unemployment rate is much too high—nearly 10 percent. And the recovery seems likely to be more sluggish than we would like.\n\nThe economy is suffering from the hangover of the real estate and consumption boom that ended a few years ago. That boom collapsed beginning in mid-2007. The result was a very deep downturn from which we are now only emerging.\n\nAlthough the Federal Reserve has been aggressive about easing monetary policy to support economic activity, the recovery is not likely to be as robust as we would like for several reasons.\n\nFirst, households are still in the process of deleveraging. The housing boom created paper wealth that households borrowed against. This pushed the consumption share of nominal gross domestic product to a record high of about 70 percent. When the boom turned into a bust, those paper gains evaporated. In fact, many households now find that the value of their homes is less than the amount of their mortgage debt. This has created a difficult time for many families and has caused the hangover to last longer.\n\nSecond, the banking system is still under significant stress. This is particularly the case for small- and medium-sized banks that have significant exposure to commercial real estate loans. This stress means that banks have been slow to ease credit standards as the economy has moved from recession to recovery.\n\nThird, some of the sources that have supported the nascent recovery are temporary. The big swing from inventory liquidation during the recession back to accumulation will soon end as inventory levels come back into better balance with sales. And fiscal stimulus from the federal government is subsiding and will soon reverse.\n\nCoupled with the benign outlook for inflation, these headwinds to growth and employment explain why the Federal Reserve is keeping short-term interest rates unusually low. We want to do all we can to support more rapid economic and employment growth, subject to keeping inflation low and stable, and inflation expectations well anchored. The situation has improved and total employment is now growing—for example, U.S. payrolls rose by 290,000 last month. But we are still far from where we want to be.\n\nIn this environment, finding a job will be tough, but when you hit the pavement remember that the job market is improving. Don't get discouraged. Get your foot in the door by doing something productive, even if it may not be exactly what you want to do for the rest of your life. Gaining knowledge and experience is what is important at this point. The first job out of college is a foot on the ladder—the job doesn't have to be perfect to be valuable to you.\n\nA Bit of Advice\nIn terms of your career, my first bit of advice is: don't rush. There is plenty of time for your careers to unfold. It's not a sprint, it's a marathon. I didn't really start my career until I went to work for the Federal Reserve Board at 28 after graduate school and didn't begin working on macroeconomics until I joined Goldman Sachs when I was 33.\n\nWhen I entered the job market from New College in the fall of 1974—the economy was in recession. I interviewed for many jobs, and I was told that I was overqualified for a few and under qualified for many. I eventually got a job as a methods analyst, which is essentially an internal efficiency consultant. It wasn't much, but it was a start and I went from there. My second bit of advice is to take the time to find out what really interests you. This means you may want to try a few different things before settling on a particular career path. When I left New College I certainly didn't know where I was headed. I only made the decision to become a professional economist two years later when I was deciding between law school and economics. And I didn't decide to opt for more policy-related work rather than become an academic until I entered the job market from Berkeley five years later.\n\nThe important point is that if you like what you are doing, you almost certainly will be successful at it.\n\nMy third bit of advice is to be true to yourself. It is a lot easier to keep things straight and be happy if your public persona and private persona are not in conflict—you are one integrated person.\n\nBeing true to yourself also means facing up to problems and mistakes early. Early on in my career as a professional economist, I got involved in writing a paper about tax reform with the head of the firm's research department. The night the paper went to the printers, I woke up with complete clarity that there was a mistake in the paper. The mistake did not affect the conclusions of the paper. It just slightly changed all the numbers and was obscure enough that no one would probably catch it.\n\nWhat to do? I decided to take my medicine. I walked into the office of my co-author the next morning and said that we needed to throw out the 10,000 copies of the paper that had been printed. The head of research—Leon Cooperman—was known for his—let me say this delicately—strong personality. But rather than blowing up at me, he said fine, let's fix it.\n\nFacing up to the error must have actually worked in my favor since I won his respect. A few months later, he introduced me to Robert Rubin—who, as you know, went on to become the U.S. Secretary of Treasury. And through Robert Rubin I met all sorts of interesting people in the Clinton administration.\n\nMy fourth bit of advice is to continue to build your human capital. That means seeking out jobs and opportunities that give you new experiences and skills. Keep up with your mentors and continue to cultivate relationships and build your network. Education isn't just about college course work, it should be a lifelong experience. If your employer asks you do something new—don't shy away from it. Instead, think of it as a wonderful deal: Your employer is going to pay you to deepen your skills and knowledge base. You will be paid to become more valuable.\n\nFor me, the ability to build my human capital has happened—in spades—several times. The first occurred here at New College and at Berkeley for graduate school. Here I learned to really read critically and how to write—the one literature course that I mentioned earlier notwithstanding.\n\nThe second was the opportunity early on in my career to become involved in macroeconomic forecasting and policy analysis. Up to that point, I had been a regulatory economist. I had only taken one course in macroeconomics in graduate school and it was the only course on which I received a \"B\" grade—I had not revealed any great affinity for that subject. At first, the work was stressful. When people asked me questions, I wasn't sure whether I was supposed to know the answers or not. At first, I felt quite ignorant, but eventually that passed.\n\nThe third was when I was asked to head the Markets Group at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at the beginning of 2007. It was an unexpected opportunity for public service after spending the bulk of my career in the private sector. The Markets Group is the operational arm of the Federal Reserve System. It helps to have an economics background, but it was a very different task managing 300 people who worked in many complex businesses ranging from Treasury auctions to providing services to foreign central banks. And, when the financial crisis began in earnest in August 2007, the learning curve accelerated sharply.\n\nAnd the fourth was when I had the opportunity to succeed Timothy Geithner as president of the Bank in January 2008. Now it is 3,000 people, not 300 to manage and a much wider set of responsibilities.\n\nSome of the most interesting parts of the job have been getting troubled financial institutions onto a stronger footing so that these firms could provide greater credit and support to the U.S. economy. Obviously, working closely with Chairman Ben Bernanke and my Fed colleagues at the Board of Governors and around the other 11 Reserve Banks has also been particularly rewarding.\n\nEach time, the opportunities helped me broaden my knowledge and skills. My career benefited as a consequence.\n\nIn implementing this advice, it also helps to have lots of good luck. In that regard, I have been blessed. Think of the chain of events for me to get my \"dream job\"—head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. I had to decide to leave Goldman Sachs at the end of 2005; be asked by Timothy Geithner to be head of the Markets Group in 2006 and be smart enough to take him up on his offer; Barack Obama had to win the presidential election; Tim had to be selected to be Treasury Secretary; and the Board of Directors of the Bank in collaboration with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., had to agree on me as Tim's successor. If you ever thought that train of events was even remotely likely, I think you would have been considered delusional!\n\nMy final piece of advice is the most important one: Don't forget all that they have taught you here about thinking critically and speaking up.\n\nSo, let me sum up. Go into the job market with enthusiasm and don't be daunted by the inevitable rejections. That's part of the process of getting started. Don't feel in a rush to figure out all the details of your career. If you are true to yourself, continue to build your human capital and don't forget everything that they have taught you here, I know that you will meet with every success."

        "content": "The past few years have been an extraordinary time for policymakers. We have been very aggressive in providing support to the economy and it now appears that we are emerging from a deep and protracted recession. Economic activity expanded over the second half of 2009, suggesting that a recovery has begun. While we continue to receive encouraging news, growth is likely to be muted compared with the early stages of past recoveries. As a result, the unemployment rate is likely to decline over the near term at a very gradual pace, if at all.\n\nIn the labor market, employment has begun to expand. We hope this is the beginning of a sustained period of job growth. Total employment shrank by roughly 8 million jobs since the peak of the cycle, and the current unemployment rate of 9.7 percent remains unacceptably high.\n\nAt the regional level, here in the New York—New Jersey region, the labor market was not hit as hard as in many areas in the country, and the pace of job losses in our region has eased. Nevertheless, the unemployment rate in New York and New Jersey has risen to levels not seen in almost two decades.\n\nIn New York City, employment has typically recovered more than a year later than the recovery of national employment and has, in the past, been led by a recovery of Wall Street employment. Although Upstate New York has seen little overall job growth for the past several decades, job losses in this downturn were not as severe as losses for the nation, in part, because the upstate metro areas did not experience a boom-and-bust housing cycle. In addition, Puerto Rico, which is also part of our District, has experienced a considerably longer and deeper downturn than the mainland or this region.\n\nBefore I continue, it is important to explain the integral role of the Federal Reserve System in regional economies across the country. One of our key responsibilities here at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is to connect the Federal Reserve System to Main Street across our District. Real activity takes place on Main Street in the form of the millions of decisions made every day by households and businesses around the country. When we talk to them, we learn how firms and consumers are experiencing the economy.\n\nThat essential insight from Main Street informs the policy decisions that we make in pursuit of our goals of stable prices, full employment and financial stability. Staying connected with Main Street is also important because the effectiveness of our policy actions is enhanced when private actors have a clear understanding of what our actions are intended to accomplish. For these complex policy decisions, the Federal Reserve System needs accurate and timely information on business and financial conditions, and the perspectives of participants in markets throughout the United States.\n\nEconomic conditions often differ in various parts of the country, and it is important that the Fed takes all of this into account when it formulates policy. This input is particularly important for the Second District of the Federal Reserve, where we sit today, because the forces that drive economic conditions here often do not mirror the forces driving other regional economies.\n\nIn order to monitor and understand the various aspects of local economic conditions, we utilize a number of different measures. Two of these measures we have developed here at the New York Fed—a survey of manufacturers and indexes of economic activity. We regularly produce the Beige Book and report information on local credit conditions. These measures supplement and extend the understanding gleaned from public data sources. We also seek input from regular meetings with several advisory groups representing different facets of the District’s economy—such as our Small Business, Upstate New York and Thrift Institutions panels—and from interactions with key academic researchers at local universities and public policy organizations.\n\nWe recognize that timely and accurate information about our region, which is highly valuable to us, can also help to reduce uncertainty and inform the economic and financial decisions of regional residents, businesses, communities and governments. To that end, we make our various regional measures and analysis available to the public through our website and a variety of outreach activities. These activities include making presentations on topics of current concern to business and community organizations throughout the District.\n\nWe welcome you here today to brief you on our views of the current state of activity and employment in the regional economy and to review the rich portfolio of resources that we make available to help monitor economic conditions across the region."

        "title": "Asset Bubbles and the Implications for Central Bank Policy",
        "url": "https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2010/dud100407",
        "content": "As I see it, we need to reexamine how central banks should respond to potential asset bubbles. After all, recent experience has underscored the fact that poorly regulated financial systems are prone to such bubbles and that the costs of waiting to respond to an asset bubble until after it has burst can be very high.\n\nToday, I will try to define some of the important characteristics of asset price bubbles. I will argue that bubbles do exist and that bubbles typically occur after an innovation that has created uncertainty about fundamental valuations. This has two important implications. First, a bubble is difficult to discern and, second, each bubble has unique characteristics. This implies that a rules-based approach to bubbles is likely to be ineffective and that tackling bubbles to diminish their potential to destabilize the financial system requires judgment.\n\nDespite the fact that it is hard to discern bubbles, especially in their early stages, I conclude that uncertainty is not grounds for inaction. Instead, the decision whether to act depends on whether appropriate tools can be deployed to limit the size of a bubble and whether the benefits of acting and deploying such tools are likely to exceed the costs.\n\nThat cost-benefit calculus, in turn, depends crucially on the tools we can deploy to limit the growth of bubbles and the consequences when they burst. In this respect, I will argue that, in most cases, use of the bully pulpit and macroprudential tools, such as rules limiting loan-to-value ratios or leverage, are likely to prove superior to monetary policy.\n\nTurning to the first issue of whether there are asset bubbles, I am going to be a bit of a heretic and argue that there is little doubt that asset bubbles exist and that they occur fairly frequently. By an asset bubble, I mean price increases (or declines) that become unmoored from fundamental valuations. I want to be clear that I am distinguishing this from price movements that are tied to changes in fundamentals. I know this runs afoul of the efficient markets hypothesis—which in this context would argue that if a bubble were obvious, then people would take the other side and the bubble would not occur in the first place.\n\nThere are several reasons why this argument does not hold in practice. First, it is not always easy to take the other side. There may be constraints on the ability to short the asset in question. Such limits on the ability to short sell can arise for many reasons. For some assets, short selling in size might simply not be possible because the markets are not sufficiently developed. Also, even if there were instruments that can be used to go short, it may not be an easy trade to undertake. For example, if a bubble builds up over many years and market participants’ compensation is based on year-to-year performance, there may be disincentives to take the short side. Compensation schemes and other practices that skew incentives may create a bias to simply “trade with the market.”\n\nSecond, bubbles may simply emerge from the way market participants process information and trade. Experimental work done by behavioral economists has shown that people often trade in ways that generate price bubbles. In many carefully controlled experiments in which the intrinsic value of the asset could be determined with certainty, participants still bid prices up far above fundamental valuations, with the bubbles being followed by sharp declines in prices.\n\nLet me give you an example of one of the seminal studies of this type. In this experiment, all investors start with an identical asset that pays the same dividend generated from a known probability distribution at the end of each trading period.1 This means that all participants know the expected value of the dividend stream with certainty. The participants are allowed to buy and sell these assets from one another. In this framework, if all participants were fully rational, then trading should occur only at intrinsic values based on the expected dividend stream. But this is not what happens in practice. In 14 of the 22 experimental runs, prices rose significantly above fundamental valuations and these price bubbles were followed by crashes. When traders in these experimental runs were “experienced,” meaning that they had participated in the experiment before, the probability of a bubble was reduced, but not eliminated. The authors conclude: “What we learn from the particular experiments … is that a common dividend and common knowledge thereof is insufficient to induce initial common expectations. …” The lack of common initial expectations leads to a willingness to trade to try and earn capital gains above fundamental value.2 Relaxing the conditions in these types of behavioral studies to admit more uncertainty about fundamental asset valuations works to enhance the propensity for bubbles by increasing the degree of divergence in participants’ initial expectations.\n\nLastly, over the past few decades, there simply have been too many episodes in which asset prices have dramatically overshot on the upside and then violently corrected to suggest that the behavioral studies conducted in the laboratory do not also have real world counterparts. In the United States, these include the run-up in the value of the dollar in the mid-1980s, the stock market rise and crash in 1987; the compression of spreads due to convergence trades in the run-up to the Long-Term Capital Management debacle in 1998; the technology stock market boom of the late 1990s; and the credit and housing price bubble and crash of recent years. All these episodes were marked by spectacular price booms, followed by subsequent collapses.\n\nAn examination of some of these recent bubbles suggests that while asset bubbles are idiosyncratic in terms of their causes, institutional features, duration and severity, they often share several significant features. These shared features are important in assessing how policy might be used to temper incipient bubbles in the future.\n\nIn my view, asset bubbles often come about through a particular sequence of events. First, there is typically an innovation that changes the fundamental valuation in a meaningful, but uncertain way.3 Asset valuations associated with the innovation change (as they should), but there is significant uncertainty about how valuable the innovation will turn out to be. This leads to a divergence in expectations concerning how much the fair value of the assets should increase. I believe that this uncertainty about what constitutes fair value is important in fueling the bubble.\n\nFor example, the technology stock market boom in the late 1990s coincided with the development of the Internet, which fostered the reorganization of many business processes and generated significant productivity improvements. At the time, it was unclear just how significant the innovation would be or how successful the companies would be that sought to take advantage of it. On the one hand, there were companies such as Cisco, which sold the “shovels”—the routers that enabled the Internet to work—that were very successful. On the other hand, there were companies such as Webvan, which sought to use the new technology to revolutionize the delivery of grocery supplies and services, and that failed miserably.\n\nSimilarly, the recent housing boom was driven by two innovations: (1) in housing finance, where subprime lending made mortgage credit available to households that were much less creditworthy, and (2) in structured finance instruments such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). The first innovation significantly broadened the availability of mortgage credit to households. The second innovation reduced the cost of this credit. Cash flows from the underlying mortgage assets were apportioned among senior and junior tranches. These tranches, which had been rated by the rating agencies, were then distributed to a wide range of investors. This structured finance innovation, in turn, was supported by innovations in the shadow banking system. Securities lenders, structured investment vehicles and conduits bought the highly rated tranches of the structured financed products and financed these assets in the wholesale short-term funding markets.\n\nThe second element common to many asset bubbles is a surge in economic activity in the particular sector associated with the innovation. In the case of the technology stock market boom, there was a surge in business investment in technology goods and services. In the subprime/structured finance boom, there was a surge in demand for housing as credit availability increased sharply. This surge in activity is important because it reinforces the notion that the innovation is indeed significant and that “this time is different.”\n\nThird, there is often a positive feedback mechanism that tends to reinforce the belief system that underpins the extreme valuations associated with the boom. Without this, the boom isn’t likely to persist for long or push valuations far above what is justified by the fundamentals. As a result, the asset price movements are unlikely to be big or broad enough to threaten financial and macroeconomic stability.\n\nDuring the technology stock boom there were a number of reinforcing mechanisms. One important reinforcing mechanism was the strong notion that those who got to the market with their new Internet innovations would achieve large first-mover advantages. This perception was due to the fact that successful Internet-based models could expect to achieve strong network effects, which created significant barriers to entry and the prospect of extraordinary profits. Amazon might be a good example of a company that (eventually) succeeded at this.\n\nIn this environment, many firms—both well-established companies and start-ups—invested heavily in the new technology. The ensuing sharp rise in investment in technology equipment and software led in turn to rapid earnings growth, which helped (for a time) to sustain stratospheric valuations.\n\nIn addition, the sharp rise in stock prices led to a re-assessment of the appropriate equity risk premium. The higher that stock prices rose, the more people thought that equities had little risk. Everyone could become a millionaire with little risk or effort.4\n\nSimilarly, in the subprime/structured finance boom, there were several important positive feedback mechanisms. In particular, the surge in credit availability drove up the demand for housing and pushed up housing prices. This increase in demand caused the default experience associated with such lending to be very low, reinforcing the notion that subprime lending was not very risky. It also reinforced the demand for the complex CDOs secured by such assets. During the boom, the structured finance models appeared to be sound because losses on the underlying subprime mortgage loans were low and because the correlation rates in performance across different assets in the pools were low, just as the models had assumed.\n\nFourth, the proportion of market participants who believe that a particular episode of asset price increases are justified by the innovation tends to rise as the boom persists. Those that had doubts about the importance of the innovation or the persistence of the gain in asset prices lose confidence in their opinions as they underperform and lose business and market share. Those who believed that the large gains in asset prices were justified by the innovation and who benefited from those beliefs become more dominant. Casual investors see the large rise in prices and jump in. This shift is important because, in markets, prices are driven by the marginal investor. As new and often less well-informed investors plunge in to participate in the boom, they can overwhelm the so-called “smart money” that gets frustrated after having lost repeatedly trying to take the other side.\n\nIn this respect, a bias toward optimism may also play an important role. Studies have found that most people believe that they are above average in terms of their acumen, be it as investors, car drivers or in other activities.5 This overconfidence may cause some people to keep investing in the asset, even when they are skeptical about its valuation because they are overly confident that they will anticipate the end of the bubble and be able to get out in time.\n\nFifth, asset bubbles occur more easily when it is difficult to short the assets. For example, the technology stocks associated with initial public offerings were very difficult to short because the available supply or “float” was small—a high proportion of the shares in the companies were held by the original venture capital investors and subject to lock-up periods before the shares could be lent out to short sellers or sold. Similarly, housing is notoriously difficult to short. The option of selling one’s home in order to rent is expensive not only in terms of time and effort, but also in terms of transaction costs. And, shorting complex structured finance products was difficult because there were no standardized instruments; the securities rarely traded and were very difficult to value. It was not until the development of the ABX indexes—which allowed investors to buy and sell credit default swaps on pools of structured finance obligations—that investors had a vehicle that allowed them to short subprime mortgage-backed securities more easily.6\n\nAsset bubbles often come to an end when the basic belief system is contradicted by events. This can happen very naturally as a matter of course because economic fundamentals deteriorate, or because there is a change in rules or regulations that disrupts the balance between supply and demand. In the technology boom, this might occur because each company cannot get to the market first. So even if there is a first-mover advantage, not everyone will be able to take advantage of it. Over time, the failure to achieve first-mover status becomes evident and valuations adjust to reflect this, or lock-up provisions on Internet stocks expire, leading to a large increase in supply that leads to a sharp fall in prices.7\n\nIn the housing boom, the end came about for several reasons. One limiting factor was that the rise in home prices outstripped income growth. Thus, for the boom to persist, underwriting standards had to be continually relaxed; only in this way could a new cohort of first-time buyers qualify for big enough mortgages to be able to “afford” to buy their homes. The difficulty in replenishing the pool of new home buyers limited how fast demand could keep rising. In addition, the rise in home prices led to an explosion of supply especially in areas like Arizona, Florida, Nevada and inland California, where buildable land was plentiful.\n\nAs supply caught up to demand, this led to a downturn in prices. Once this occurred, the poor underwriting standards associated with subprime mortgage lending became apparent. Subprime borrowers could no longer easily refinance or sell the house at a higher price and repay the original mortgage. As Warren Buffett reportedly once quipped: “Only when the tide goes out do you discover who has been swimming naked.”\n\nSo what does this analysis imply for a central bank that might want to limit the development of such bubbles? The first conclusion is that assessing whether there is a bubble or not or the size of the prospective bubble is going to be very challenging. Because there is an innovation, asset values should rise, but by how much? It is difficult to assess what is the new, appropriate valuation after an important innovation. For example, consider some questions that might have arisen relative to the technology bubble: What does the Internet mean for technology investment? How many of the new business startups will survive and prosper? Is an Amazon rare? How fast will the volume of Internet traffic grow and for how long?\n\nSimilar questions arose with respect to the recent housing bubble: How much will subprime lending increase the demand for housing? How will this increase in demand translate into prices? What will the default rate be once demand growth slows? What is the appropriate correlation rate in terms of the loss experience across the different subprime and Alt-A mortgage pools that should be used in assessing the value of collateralized debt obligations? How are such correlations likely to differ in the boom versus in the bust?\n\nThis uncertainty means that policymakers can never be sure about the existence, size or persistence of an incipient asset bubble. As a result, this task of dealing proactively with bubbles will be very difficult!\n\nSo what should the policymaker do? I think the first step is for the policymaker to work hard to investigate what is generating the sharp rise in prices for the asset in question. Sustained price increases are a symptom of changes in demand and supply. The policymaker needs to develop a perspective about whether these demand and supply changes are realistically sustainable to the extent implied by market prices. In particular, carefully analyzing the assumptions that underpin sustained increases in asset prices—which might be symptoms of a bubble—and considering the risk that these assumptions might be wrong is important. Also, looking carefully at the dynamics of the system on which the beliefs are based may be useful. In particular, are the dynamics of the system reinforcing or dampening? If the dynamics are reinforcing, then there is greater likelihood of an asset bubble.\n\nThe next step is for the policymaker to evaluate what tools might be available to curb the imbalances that have been identified. The idiosyncratic nature of the innovations and belief systems associated with particular bubbles implies that the tools used to respond to each bubble will likely have to be different and tailored to the features of the particular bubble in question.\n\nFinally, the policymaker needs to conduct a careful cost-benefit analysis, weighing how successful a particular policy might be in restraining the rise in asset prices versus how costly it would be to remain passive, letting the bubble grow and then potentially burst disruptively. Many factors will affect the outcome of this analysis including the magnitude of the potential asset bubble and whether the potential asset bubble is occurring in the equity or debt markets.\n\nIn this analysis, the policymaker is likely to find that compared with equity market bubbles, credit market bubbles are more prone to generate higher costs when they burst. Thus, the benefits of preventing credit bubbles from forming and collapsing are likely to be higher.\n\nCredit bubbles that burst threaten the stability of the financial system much more directly than equity bubbles.8 That is because much of the debt is held by banks and securities dealers that are highly leveraged. As a result, when the bubble deflates, it can take the financial system with it. In contrast, because most equities are held on an unleveraged basis by investors, such as pension and mutual funds, a sharp decline in equity prices will not typically threaten the entire financial system. A comparison of the consequences of the technology stock market crash in equities versus the mortgage debt market crash strongly supports this thesis. Although the wealth loss was roughly comparable, the bursting of the housing bubble had a much greater negative effect on the financial system and the macroeconomy.\n\nIn this cost-benefit analysis, the central bank must understand that it will make mistakes. On one hand, it may fail to temper bubbles that turn out to be disruptive when they collapse. Or, on the other hand, it may try to temper price movement that it thinks are bubbles but are not bubbles at all. The costs of these types of errors much be weighed against the potential benefits of tempering an asset bubble and limiting the damage from its subsequent collapse.9\n\nSo what are the tools with which the policymaker should respond? As I see it, there are three broad sets of tools available: 1) The bully pulpit; 2) macroprudential tools; and 3) monetary policy. Let me now discuss each of these in turn.\n\nThe first tool available is to simply lean against the wind of conventional wisdom by speaking out about the dangers associated with the incipient bubble. The policymaker could point out the assumptions embedded in the rapid rise in asset prices and question the accuracy of the assumptions. Obviously, the policymaker might be ridiculed by true believers about the lack of understanding about the important nature of the innovation. But I suspect that over time, a proactive central bank that laid out the risks clearly would gradually gain credibility with market participants. Use of the bully pulpit would allow the central bank to signal its concern. This might shift the risk/reward trade-off by raising the risks that the talk might foreshadow more forceful action. That, by itself, could temper behavior. Announcement effects can be very powerful, especially when they can be followed by changes in policy.\n\nThe second set of tools includes those that are macroprudential in nature. I would define macroprudential tools as regulatory and supervisory actions that are not applied on a firm-specific basis. These include tools designed to temper demand or increase supply in the asset subject to the bubble or to increase the ability of skeptics to take the other side of the market in which the bubble may be occurring. For example, to counteract a housing bubble, tools available might include limiting loan-to-value ratios, limiting debt service-to-income ratios or increasing the taxes on housing transactions. Several Asian and some European countries have used such tools to limit speculative real estate activity, apparently with some success, although the counterfactual cannot be known by definition.10 To limit a subprime lending boom, the authorities might wish to enforce strict underwriting practices, including verifying purchasers’ incomes and enforcing rigorous appraisal valuations. Increasing the ability of investors to short the assets in question might also be helpful.\n\nIn terms of macroprudential tools, I’d also include tools that influence how the financial system operates and functions. Such tools might include supervisory measures that set liquidity and capital requirements for financial institutions and other intermediaries. They might also include tools that try to limit the overall buildup of leverage in the financial system. For the equity market, macroprudential tools might include margin rules for cash, options, futures and equity over-the-counter derivatives. For the fixed income market, such tools might include raising the haircuts charged to securities dealers on their repo financing; raising the haircuts that the securities dealers assess against the collateralized borrowings of their customers as part of their prime brokerage business, or raising initial margin requirements on OTC derivatives transactions.\n\nMacroprudential tools are undoubtedly difficult to use effectively in practice. For example, it is difficult to judge their impact. If, for example, loan-to-value ratios for single-family mortgages are lowered by 5 percentage points, how big an impact will this have on housing demand? There also is a risk that the rules or regulations will simply be circumvented. For example, investors might move to instruments or to off-shore regimes with less stringent margin and leverage restrictions. Thus, it is important that the authorities have the ability to apply the macroprudential tools broadly throughout the financial sector.11\n\nNone of this is going to be easy. A lot more work will be required to develop a portfolio of tools that could be used, that would be effective and would not be subject to significant evasion or unintended consequences.\n\nIn terms of the use of macroprudential tools, let me briefly take note of another issue that requires significant consideration—the issue of governance. Who controls all these tools? Who decides when the tools will be deployed and how extensively or intensively? Having a sufficient toolkit seems like a good idea. But lodging all this authority within a single entity or institution might not be practical or desirable.\n\nThe final tool available to the central bank is monetary policy. This tool is not likely to work as well as macroprudential tools because it is too broad. Typically, monetary policy will not address specifically the sources of the changes in supply and demand that are driving the bubble and, obviously, monetary policy will have big effects elsewhere.\n\nSome argue that monetary policy should “lean against” incipient asset bubbles. The notion is that by pursuing a slightly tighter monetary policy, the central bank would take out insurance against the risk that the rise in asset prices is a bubble and that its busting would be disruptive. Although this sounds attractive, it critically depends on how expensive the insurance is relative to the losses that the insurance protects against. It is not clear to me that a modest tightening in monetary policy beyond that needed to achieve full employment and price stability in the absence of a bubble would represent a favorable cost-benefit trade-off. The costs of the deviation from the optimal monetary policy in terms of lost output and employment might be high relative to the benefits of a somewhat smaller bubble. This seems likely to be the case in most instances. Historical experience does not suggest that bubbles are very sensitive to the level of short-term interest rates.\n\nThat said, there is some evidence that a tighter monetary policy will reduce desired leverage in the financial system by flattening the yield curve and reducing the profitability of maturity transformation activities.12 To the extent this is true, that may imply a somewhat more favorable trade-off in “leaning against” a bubble. More research is needed on this subject. For now at least, monetary policy appears to be inferior to macroprudential tools that seek either to limit the size of prospective bubbles or to strengthen the financial system so that it is more resilient when asset prices fall sharply.\n\nIn conclusion, let me underscore the challenge that central bankers face in combating asset price bubbles. Doing so effectively requires us to be successful in both identifying the incipient bubble and in developing and implementing a response that will limit bubble growth and avert a destructive asset price crash. This is not easy because asset bubbles are hard to recognize in real time and each asset bubble is different. However, these challenges cannot be an excuse for inaction. Recent experience strongly suggests that asset bubbles exist and that their collapse can be very damaging to the financial system and the macroeconomy.\n\nIn my view, a proactive approach is appropriate when three conditions are satisfied: First, circumstances should suggest that there is a meaningful risk of a future asset price crash that could threaten financial stability. Second, we have identified tools that might have a reasonable chance of success in averting such an outcome. Third, we are reasonably confident that the costs of using the tools are likely to be outweighed by the benefits from averting the prospective crash. When these three conditions are satisfied, we should be willing to act.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.\n\n__________________________________________\n\n1See Vernon L. Smith, Gerry L.

For example, the run-up of the dollar in the mid-1980s was not associated with any particular innovation. Instead, a sharp shift in fiscal policy led to high real interest rates that stimulated a strong demand for the dollar, which caused the dollar to appreciate sharply. This eventually unwound as the dollar's rise undercut U.S. trade competitiveness. This caused the U.S. economy to slow, interest rates to decline and the dollar to fall. The lack of experience with a floating exchange rate regime undoubtedly played a role here. The world moved to a floating exchange rate system in the early 1970s. There was not much experience with how an expansive fiscal policy would affect exchange rates. This undoubtedly increased uncertainty about the sustainability of the dollar's appreciation.\n\n4In fact, one book, Dow 36,000, which was published in 1999 shortly before the stock market peaked, argued that “fair value” for the Dow Jones Industrial Average should be 36,000 because the appropriate risk premium for the equity market versus Treasury bonds should be zero.\n\n5Overconfidence actually applies to a broad range of activities, not just investing. For a more general treatment of this issue of overconfidence and other ways in which economic agents depart from complete rationality, see Richard Thaler. “From Homo Economicus to Homo Sapiens.” 2000. Journal of Economic Perspectives 14, no. 1 (Winter): 133-41.\n\n6This is not to argue that short positions could not be established at all. Monoline guarantors, AIG Financial Products and some securities dealers were willing to sell protection in the form of credit default swaps on some of these assets.

See, for example, Frederic Mishkin. How Should We Respond to Asset Bubbles?  May 15, 2008.\n\n9An example of a sustained rise in asset prices that was not a bubble is the bull market in U.S. equities that began in the 1950s. At the start of the sustained rise in equity prices, stock dividend yields exceeded the yields on Treasury bonds and this was perceived as normal, partly reflecting the searing experience of the Great Depression. Instead, corporate earnings rose relatively steadily, supporting dividend growth. This observation led investors to bid up stock prices and push down dividend yields and this proved—more or less—sustainable. Even today, the yield on the S&P 500 index is below the 10-year Treasury note yield.\n\n10However, in the recent crisis, the different outcomes in the United States and Canada might be instructive. Canada had a tougher regime in terms of mortgage underwriting standards. Also, Canada had imposed an overall leverage limit on its banks, which helped to limit the amount of gearing in the financial system. Both of these differences may help to explain why the Canadian financial system and macroeconomy were less affected by the global financial crisis than the United States.\n\n11Imposition of tighter rules and regulations may also be politically unpopular.\n\n12Adrian, Tobias, Arturo Estrella, and Hyun Song Shin. 2010.

        "content": "What I would like to do today is to explain in some detail the logic underlying this expectation that economic conditions will warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. This conclusion stems from the observation that the current economic environment is qualitatively different from previous post-World War II business cycles. Most post-war recessions were preceded by high rates of resource utilization and rising trend inflation. This prompted a tightening of monetary policy, which, in turn, dampened interest-rate sensitive spending, particularly on housing and consumer durable goods. Then, as underlying inflation pressures subsided, monetary policy was eased and interest-rate sensitive spending rebounded, often quite sharply.\n\nThe current business cycle is different in one key respect. It was preceded by a global financial crisis. The financial crisis was due, in large part, to excessive leverage and excessive investment in real estate assets. It will take time to unwind these excesses.\n\nToday, I will offer a framework for assessing the forces that have shaped the recent performance of the U.S. economy. This framework will provide context to the fiscal and monetary policy responses to what is now being called the “Great Recession.” Then, I will discuss the economic outlook for the United States over the next year. Before I proceed, I want to emphasize that these views are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the FOMC or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nBuilding an Analytical Framework\nSay's law—named after the French economist Jean-Baptiste Say—states that the aggregate value of incomes earned in an economy over some period of time must by definition equal the value of all goods and services produced over that same time period. Or, put somewhat differently, on an ex post (i.e., realized) basis, saving must equal investment. Investment in this case means current spending on new physical, human and intangible capital. This insight is the conceptual basis for national income accounting and the gross domestic product (GDP) statistics that we follow so carefully.\n\nEven so, economists have been debating the implications of Say's Law since it was first expounded. Classical economists argued that this ex post balance would occur in a way that kept the economy quite stable at full employment. If there were shocks to saving or investment spending that pushed the economy away from full employment, prices and wages would adjust quickly, providing the market signals needed to bring about the reallocation of resources required to restore full employment.\n\nThe global depression of the 1930s raised serious questions about this classical theory. Although saving must equal investment on an ex post basis, the two can diverge ex ante, potentially sharply. For example, when ex ante (i.e., desired) saving exceeds ex ante (desired) investment spending, inventories rise above desired levels. If prices of the products in question do not fall sufficiently rapidly so that this unwanted build-up of inventories is sold quickly, then production and employment must fall. Perhaps most famously, Keynes, in The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, argued that there are institutional rigidities that inhibit price and wage flexibility. This means that periods in which ex ante saving exceeds desired investment might lead to periods of persistent unemployment.\n\nIn this respect, the financial system plays an important role. Financial intermediaries match borrowers and savers. If the financial system is under stress and lending standards are being tightened, ex ante investment is likely to decline relative to saving, all else being equal.\n\nThe financial intermediation process and the creation of credit is the primary channel through which monetary policy affects the economy. By influencing the volume of credit creation, monetary policy strives to keep ex ante saving and investment—alternatively, aggregate demand and aggregate supply—in rough balance. Too rapid a pace of credit creation would overstimulate investment relative to saving, potentially increasing the rate of inflation and this, in turn, could damage the economy's long-run performance. Too slow of a pace of credit creation would likely lead to an ex ante shortfall of investment relative to saving, causing unemployment to increase.\n\nThis analytical framework also applies to the global economy, but with an added level of complexity. At the global level, income equals output and saving equals investment on an ex post basis. However, for an individual country, saving can exceed investment or, alternatively, production can exceed domestic demand to the extent that a country's exports exceed its imports. This requires that, for some other economy or group of economies, investment must exceed saving, or alternatively, domestic demand must exceed production and imports must exceed exports. This means that what happens abroad in terms of desired saving and investment also influences the performance of our domestic economy.\n\nThis framework provides a simple way to evaluate the recent economic environment and the current economic outlook. When desired investment rises relative to saving on an ex ante basis, then an economy tends to strengthen. If the strengthening persists, inflation may rise to levels above what is regarded as consistent with maximum sustainable growth and full employment. This was the story for much of the 2004-06 period. The Federal Reserve responded to rising trend inflation by tightening monetary policy to keep the economy from overheating.\n\nIn contrast, when investment falls relative to saving on an ex ante basis, an economy weakens and may slip into recession, as was the case between 2007 and mid-2009. During this period, the Federal Reserve tried to support employment by cutting its federal funds rate target nearly to zero; by creating a number of special liquidity facilities to support the extension of credit; and by engaging in a large scale asset purchase program, buying Treasuries, agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities.\n\nAn economic recovery requires that desired investment must rise relative to saving. This has happened recently as fiscal stimulus and an inventory cycle have led to a fall in ex ante saving relative to investment. But for the recovery to strengthen further, this process must continue. There has to be a further demand impulse—be it a decline in household saving rates, a rise in business investment relative to profits, a further expansion of fiscal stimulus or an improvement in the net trade balance via an increase in exports relative to imports.\n\nLet's now apply this framework to evaluate what happened over the past decade and what it implies for the economic outlook.\n\nThe last three decades have been marked by a shortage of U.S. domestic saving relative to investment. The United States has almost continuously run a current account deficit since the early 1980s (Chart 1). In 2005 and 2006 that current account deficit averaged around 6 percent of GDP. Yet, the real exchange value of the dollar today is not terribly different from what it was in the early 1990s (Chart 2). A massive flow of saving into the United States from around the world offset forces that otherwise would have driven the exchange value of the dollar lower.\n\nIn addition to its sheer size, this inflow of saving into the United States is significant in several respects. First, note the direction of the flow. One might expect that capital would flow from the developed world to the developing world, but just the opposite has been the case. In addition, foreign savers have been willing to lend to the United States in the U.S. currency. This means that foreign savers are exposed to the exchange rate risk that the dollar's value might change relative to their own currencies. Finally, one might expect that over time, as their holdings of dollar-denominated assets increased, foreign savers would demand higher interest rates, but, in fact, U.S. interest rates—in both nominal and real terms—have been generally declining over the past three decades1 (Chart 3).\n\nThese facts are at odds with the prevailing view that spendthrift U.S. consumers and governments are pulling those savings into the United States. Indeed, for some time the “twin deficits” view held that large fiscal deficits in the United States were causing large U.S. current account deficits. However, even when the federal government ran surpluses in the late 1990s, our current account deficit continued to increase. Subsequent research at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicates that the link between fiscal deficits and capital inflows is not as strong as commonly suggested.2\n\nBefore proceeding, a few important qualifications are in order. First, despite the large flow of foreign saving into the United States, our international financial position does not appear precarious at the present time. The United States still has substantial investments in foreign countries, and income from U.S. investments abroad still exceeds the income generated by U.S. assets owned by foreigners. Part of the reason is that U.S. firms operating abroad earn higher rates of profit than foreign firms operating here. In addition, low interest rates minimize the cost to the United States of our substantial negative net debt position.\n\nIn addition, the fact that our foreign indebtedness is for the most part denominated in our own currency is a huge advantage in the event the dollar were to come under significant downward pressure. That is because a decline in the dollar would raise the value of the income earned on our foreign direct investment and foreign-currency denominated assets, relative to the income that foreigners earned on their dollar-denominated investments in the United States. All else being equal, this would boost our net investment income balance.\n\nNote that borrowing per se is not necessarily a bad thing. The key is what the borrowing is used for—to finance consumption or investment. And, if it is used to fund investment, it is also important how productive that investment turns out to be over time.\n\nSo what did we do with this inflow of foreign saving? We invested in a substantial volume of physical capital, particularly residential and nonresidential real estate (Chart 4). It seems clear that one important factor behind this investment was the decline in long- term interest rates. For example, from 2003 through 2005 mortgage rates declined to just under 6 percent on average, the lowest level since the first half of the 1960s. These lower mortgage interest rates were capitalized into asset prices. Rising prices for residential and nonresidential real estate assets induced entrepreneurs to produce more of those assets. In the housing market, this increase in prices was helped along by the relaxation of loan underwriting standards, which made it easier to obtain a mortgage and become a homeowner. Credit growth was the strongest among households with relatively low credit scores (Chart 5). The homeownership rate rose after being relatively stagnant for two decades (Chart 6). The increased availability of credit to lower income borrowers and the sharp rise in housing values contributed to the rise of consumption as a share of GDP and the decline of the personal saving rate3 (Chart 7).\n\nNow, with the aid of hindsight, it is clear that we built too many houses, invested in too much commercial real estate and overvalued both significantly. The market overshot for several reasons. First, there was rampant speculative behavior. The longer these asset prices continued to rise, the stronger the belief became that they would keep rising in the future. Second, the rise in prices reinforced the initial relaxation of underwriting standards. During the period of rising prices, defaults and loan losses were very low. A homeowner who had difficulty servicing the debt could typically sell the home for a profit and pay off the loan. Third, the boom was fueled by new financial products, such as collateralized debt obligations that were backed by subprime and Alt-A mortgages. Investors misunderstood how risky these products were and this resulted in lower mortgage rates for non-conforming residential mortgages and lower funding costs for commercial real estate borrowing.\n\nIn the housing sector, these factors interacted to create a strong reinforcing dynamic. The relaxation of underwriting standards that made it easier to become a homeowner and the low mortgage rates—supported in part by the new financial products—made it easier to speculate in real estate. Moreover, as home prices rose, household net worth increased, making households more willing to consume a greater share of their current income.\n\nNot surprisingly, this bout of speculative fever ended badly. Eventually, the supply of houses caught up with and then vastly overshot demand. Easing underwriting standards to support demand could only go on for so long. Prices turned down. At the national level, home prices peaked in late 2005 to early 2006 with commercial real estate prices peaking about one year later (Chart 8). From those peaks, home prices have fallen by about 30 percent on average, with much larger declines in some areas, while commercial real estate prices have fallen by about 40 percent on average.\n\nAs price declines intensified, the number of serious mortgage delinquencies surged and, in fact, continue to rise (Chart 9). Research indicates that by 2007 the percentage of nonprime mortgages that went into default within their first year rose to 10 percent compared with 3 percent of such loans originated in 2003. While falling home prices appear to be the primary factor explaining this sharp increase in early defaults, most of the increase cannot be explained by traditional risk factors.4 A potential explanation is that individual home buyers often falsely indicated on their mortgage applications that the property they were buying would be their primary residence. Using an extensive set of data on loan performance that we have developed with Equifax, we find that multiple first mortgage lien holders—that is, people owning more than one home—account for about 40 percent of the dollar volume of seriously delinquent mortgage balances, up from about 5 percent in 2004 (Chart 10).\n\nAs delinquency and foreclosure rates rose, structured finance products backed by riskier mortgage loans performed particularly poorly. The securitization market for non-conforming mortgages collapsed. Credit availability tightened as underwriting practices became much more restrictive, even for plain vanilla mortgages.\n\nThe cascading effect of the sharp increase in mortgage delinquencies and the resulting steep decline in the market value of mortgage assets was a key contributing factor to the financial crisis. As the financial crisis intensified and the economic outlook deteriorated, equity prices eventually declined by 50 percent from their late 2007 peak before bottoming out about one year ago.\n\nBut while the value of real estate and equities plunged, the debt incurred to acquire those assets remained, leaving households very highly leveraged. According to the Flow of Funds Accounts, the ratio of household liabilities to net worth rose from around 20 percent to nearly 30 percent in just three years (Chart 11).\n\nThe result was a sharp decline in desired investment relative to saving. The number of housing starts plunged, commercial real estate investment fell and households cut back on their spending as their net worth plummeted. The economy slumped into what is now called the “Great Recession”.\n\nThe Dimensions of the Downturn\nAccording to the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), the U.S. economy has experienced 10 recessions since 1950. The duration of those previous recessions averaged slightly less than a year during which real GDP fell an average of 1.75 percent and the unemployment rate increased an average of 2.3 percentage points.\n\nThe Great Recession was far worse. From its peak, real GDP declined 3.8 percent—more than double the average decline of prior downturns (Chart 12). The unemployment rate began to increase in the second half of 2007. Over the next two years, it increased 5.5 percentage points. The rise would have been even more pronounced except that the average workweek and the labor force participation rate declined unusually sharply (Charts 13 and 14). Overall, total hours worked in the nonfarm business sector declined a staggering 10.6 percent (Chart 15). In addition to the decline in demand for labor, the manufacturing capacity utilization rate declined to 65.1 in June of 2009, the lowest level of the post-World War II period.\n\nThe result is that the “output gap”—that is, the difference between actual output and the output achieved at the highest resource utilization rate consistent with price stability—has climbed sharply. This, in turn, has put downward pressure on trend inflation. For example, on a year-over-year basis, the core inflation rate declined to 1.5 percent in January 2010 from nearly 3 percent in the fall of 2006 (Chart 16).\n\nThe Road Ahead\nFortunately, the U.S. economy is very flexible and resilient. Although it does not adjust as fast as classical economists envisioned, in the United States prices and wages respond relatively quickly. Moreover, policymakers have been aggressive in supporting the economy by easing monetary policy and by implementing a large fiscal-stimulus program.\n\nAs a result, although the unemployment rate remains unacceptably high, output has begun to expand again, and we appear to be on the verge of seeing sustained growth in employment. We'll know more about this tomorrow when the March employment figures are released. Equity prices have recovered sharply and home prices and commercial real estate prices appear to be stabilizing. Household indebtedness is declining, due to a combination of debt repayment and credit that has been written off by lenders. After falling off a cliff during the first half of 2009, global trade has rebounded. Both U.S. exports and U.S. manufacturing output have expanded rapidly over the past six months (Chart 17).\n\nAlthough these are encouraging developments, I believe that the recovery is likely to be quite muted compared with past recoveries. This comes back to the framework discussed earlier. For faster growth, we need ex ante investment to rise relative to saving and ex ante spending to rise relative to the current trend of income. But it is difficult to see where this impulse will come from in the near term.\n\nThe early stages of past recoveries have been led by consumer spending, particularly for durable goods and residential investment. For example, in the first year of recovery following the deep recessions of 1973-1975 and 1981-1982, real consumer spending increased an average of 6.5 percent and residential investment rose an average of 38 percent. It is unlikely that we will experience this type of strength this time. Households have suffered unusually large shocks to both income and wealth and many remain highly leveraged (Chart 18). Although the household debt to net worth ratio has declined considerably from its peak, it is still around 26 percent, well above the already elevated average of the past decade (Chart 19). Moreover, even if consumers wanted to borrow, credit availability is still constrained and underwriting standards remain relatively tight. Real consumer spending increased at a 2.25 percent annual rate over the second half of 2009 and looks to be growing at about that rate in the first quarter of 2010.\n\nGiven that the personal saving rate is still relatively low, it will be hard for consumer spending to grow more quickly without large increases in real labor income. But big increases in real labor income won't be possible without a much stronger recovery in output. And a much stronger recovery in output is unlikely without stronger consumption.\n\nResidential investment did increase over the second half of 2009, boosted by relatively low mortgage interest rates, lower home prices and the first-time home buyer tax credit. But recent data on the housing sector indicates that the recovery has stalled (Chart 20). As with consumption, we are unlikely to see the typical surge of housing starts and residential investment that was a key feature of most past recoveries. There is already an unusually large volume of vacant homes for rent and for sale (Chart 21). More are likely to come onto the market in the months ahead due to the large volume of mortgage loans currently in the foreclosure process.\n\nFor the government sector, large federal budget deficits are a constraint and fiscal policy is slowly shifting from an expansive policy back toward restraint. At the state and local level, the constraints are even more binding, as budgetary gaps will need to be addressed by spending cuts and tax increases (Chart 22).\n\nExports rebounded sharply over the second half of 2009, particularly to the emerging world (Chart 23). However, domestic demand in Europe and Japan—important export markets for the United States—remains very weak. This suggests that the U.S. trade balance is likely to change little over the next year or two, and, thus, will be relatively neutral in terms of its impact on growth.\n\nOnly business fixed investment is in a position to be a true locomotive of growth. Profits have stayed high relative to investment, and corporate balance sheets are awash with cash (Charts 24 and 25). However, even here, the growth impulse is likely to be weak. Prospective startup businesses are going to find it difficult to obtain funding. And larger businesses will unlikely increase investment spending sharply at a time when capacity utilization rates remain unusually depressed (Chart 26).\n\nRelatively sluggish growth implies that the output gap will be closed very gradually. This suggests that inflation pressures will stay subdued. The excess supply of housing is putting downward pressure on rents, which represent a large share of the consumer price index (CPI) (Chart 27). In addition, unit labor costs have declined sharply over the past year due to the combination of unusually rapid productivity growth and slowing labor compensation growth (Chart 28). Fortunately, longer term inflation expectations remain well anchored. These expectations have not declined and are broadly consistent with my views on the appropriate inflation goal (Chart 29). This is actually a welcome development right now because it will likely help to keep the trend inflation rate from falling too much.\n\nLessons to be Learned\nWe have just lived through a period in which rapid increases in asset prices led to a serious misallocation of resources and a severe financial crisis. What do we need to do to minimize the likelihood of this type of experience in the future?\n\nAs I noted in a recent speech, we face three major challenges that will determine how smooth this economic expansion turns out to be.5 First, we need regulatory reform that makes our financial system more stable and resilient. This requires many steps, including systemic risk oversight and solving the so-called too-big-to-fail problem. In this respect, we need to think hard about what we can do to prevent the type of speculative bubbles that occurred from causing so much damage in the future. In particular, are there macro prudential tools that the Federal Reserve and other regulators can use to limit leverage and speculation and thus prevent the type of asset price booms and busts that have proved so troublesome?\n\nSecond, we need viable exit strategies from this recent period of monetary and fiscal policy stimulus. On the monetary policy side, we have been working hard to ensure that we have the tools in place so that we can be effective in tightening monetary policy when the time is right, even with an enlarged balance sheet. Third, we need a rebalancing of global economic growth. That means a smaller share of consumption relative to GDP in the United States and offsetting shifts in Asia.\n\nCircumstances have improved considerably from what they were a year ago. But job creation is still much too slow and we have much to do on the regulatory side to make our financial system more resilient and robust.\n\nThank you very much for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n__________________________________________\n\n1Brender, Anton and Florence Pisani. 2007. “Global Imbalances: Is the World Economy Really at Risk?” Dexia SA.\n2 Bartolini, Leonardo and Amartya Lahiri. 2006.

Second, other forces were at work to push down the personal saving rate. Prominent among these is a secular decline in the share of health care expenditures paid out-of-pocket by consumers, lessening the motivation for precautionary savings.\n4Haughwout, Andrew, Richard Peach, and Joe Tracy. 2008. “Juvenile Delinquent Mortgages: Bad Credit or Bad Economy.”, Journal of Urban Economics, 64, no. 2 (September): 246-57.\n5Financial Market Turmoil: The Federal Reserve and the Challenges Ahead, William C.

        "content": "I am glad that Narayana Kocherlakota is here as well as I don’t think I qualify as the most “objective” person to be a panelist on this particular topic. After all, I have long been a proponent of using a financial conditions framework to think about the economic outlook and monetary policy. When I was working as the chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs, we built one of the earliest financial conditions indexes, the Goldman Sachs Financial Conditions Index (GSFCI).\n\nI am going to divide my remarks today into two parts. First, I will discuss why a financial conditions framework is useful when thinking about the economic outlook and monetary policy. Second, I will discuss the paper, “Financial Conditions Indexes: A New Look after the Financial Crisis,” by Jan Hatzius, Peter Hooper, Frederic Mishkin, Kermit L. Schoenholtz and Mark W. Watson, in some detail—evaluating its considerable strengths and pointing out some areas where additional work would be useful.\n\nThere are a number of reasons that a financial conditions framework is likely to be useful when evaluating the economic outlook and the conduct of monetary policy. Most important, monetary policy works its magic through its effect on financial conditions; it does not operate directly on real economic variables. That is because the level of the federal funds rate influences other financial market variables such as money market rates, long-term interest rates, credit spreads, stock prices and the value of the dollar, and it is these variables that influence real economic activity.1 This means that if the linkage between the fed funds rate and this broader constellation of financial indicators is not stable or completely predictable, then knowing what is happening to the fed funds rate is not sufficient to predict economic activity. The instability of the linkage between the fed funds rate and financial conditions indicators means that these indicators provide additional information about real activity and also are relevant in deciding the appropriate fed funds rate target. In contrast, if the transmission mechanism from the fed funds rate to financial conditions and onward to real economic activity were completely predictable, then there would be no need to focus on financial conditions as an intermediate target variable. The level and path of the fed funds rate matters, but it also matters how this gets transmitted to the real economy through the financial sector.\n\nOver the past 15 years, there have been two important instances in which the relationship between the fed funds rate and financial conditions have diverged significantly. The first was the late 1990s technology stock market bubble and its aftermath. The second was the mid-2000s credit market bubble that culminated in the recent financial crisis. During these episodes, the relationship between the fed funds rate and financial conditions was particularly unstable. As a result, developments in the financial markets became very important in the conduct of monetary policy.\n\nIn this respect, I would note that financial conditions indicators have implications for “Taylor Rule” formulations for monetary policy. As you all know, Taylor-type rules provide a short-hand metric for the appropriate stance of monetary policy. In such rules, the fed funds rate is set at a level equal to the equilibrium real fed funds rate, plus the inflation objective, plus the weighted deviation of output from its potential and of the inflation objective from actual or, if forward looking, expected inflation. Often, analysts and economists assume that the equilibrium real fed funds rate is equal to 2 percent, its long-term historical value. Although, in principle, such rules allow the equilibrium rate to be time varying, it typically is assumed to be constant.\n\nI have always been uncomfortable with this usage of a 2 percent equilibrium real rate assumption because it ignores the possibility that the equilibrium rate changes in response to technology shocks or in response to changes in how monetary policy is transmitted via the financial system to the real economy. For example, in the late 1990s, when trend productivity growth shifted upward, it seemed logical that this would also push up the equilibrium short-term real interest rate. That is because higher productivity growth, by raising the return on capital, spurs greater investment, thereby driving the equilibrium rate higher. Similarly, if stock prices rose sharply in response to higher productivity growth, this should also lead to a higher equilibrium real rate through the effect of greater stock market wealth on consumer spending. Higher stock prices meant that financial conditions were easier. This needed to be offset by a somewhat higher fed funds rate target.\n\nFinancial conditions also appear to have become more important in terms of their influence on business cycles. On the one hand, the fed funds rate has been more stable and the range of the fed funds rate over the cycle has been smaller. However, on the other hand, relative to what has happened to the fed funds rate target, financial conditions have become more volatile. The hypothesis that Ed McKelvey and I put forward in 1997 in response to evidence of the so-called “Great Moderation” seems to be well supported by the past two economic downturns and their aftermaths:\n\nPut simply, longer stretches of economic growth imply greater leverage and complacency and thus, greater financial problems when recessions do occur. In brief, longer U.S. business cycles logically lead to four linked consequences—more financial leverage, longer bouts of balance sheet repair, more subdued recoveries and longer periods of decline in inflation and interest rates during the early stages of recovery.2\n\nIf the economy is more stable, then market participants will have more appetite for risk. This works fine during the expansion stage, when growth is relatively stable. However, when a recession finally arrives, it is a bigger shock than when recessions were more frequent. This surprise results in a more substantial adjustment in financial conditions. Ironically, the increased stability of the business cycle during the expansion phase appears to increase the volatility and importance of financial conditions when recessions do occur.\n\nAt this stage, incorporating indicators of financial conditions into forecasting and into evaluating the conduct of monetary policy probably requires relying on constructing a “rough and ready” index. Macroeconomic models—especially dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models—do not incorporate robust financial sectors. Instead, these models have implicitly assumed that the monetary transmission mechanism and the financial intermediation process always works smoothly and predictably.3\n\nEvents of the past decade confirm that financial conditions matter and that the fed funds rate is not a sufficient statistic with which to assess the impact of monetary policy on the real economy. Of course, this is not news to the Federal Reserve, which has explicitly taken financial conditions into account in its conduct of monetary policy. This is evident in the transcripts of the FOMC meetings that are publicly available and the numerous references to financial conditions in the FOMC minutes that go back more than a decade.\n\nAn analysis of the FOMC minutes over the past decade indicates that references to financial conditions have been frequent, especially recently. Exhibit 1 illustrates the percentage of paragraphs in the minutes (excluding the directive and some other paragraphs associated with administrative matters such as the election of the chairman) that mention the phrase \"financial conditions.\" As can be seen, there have been frequent references over the past decade. One peak occurred in 2000 when the stock market peaked and began to deflate. Thereafter, references fell off a bit until rising sharply again recently. Clearly, the recent financial crisis has underscored the importance of financial conditions.\n\nToday’s paper makes clear the importance of financial conditions. The paper’s analysis of the many financial conditions indexes that have been constructed as proxies for overall financial conditions finds that many of these indexes have done better than the fed funds rate or other single-variable financial indicators as predictors of real economic activity.\n\nHowever, as the paper also makes very clear, the indexes that have been developed are still very rudimentary. In particular, most financial conditions indexes are ad hoc and incomplete. In their review of the existing financial condition indexes, the authors find considerable differences across the indexes in the way that they are constructed and in terms of the variables included.\n\nIn addition, there is another difficulty. As the financial system changes over time, both in terms of structure and in terms of financial products, the financial variables that we might determine to be important are also changing. For example, in the wake of the recent financial crisis, the variables that the paper’s authors call “neoclassical”—such as the yield curve and stock market prices—appear to have become less important relative to the variables that the authors term “non-neoclassical”—such as quantity and survey measures of credit availability. Variables that would work best 10 years ago as forecasting tools may no longer be very useful. As the structure of the financial system changes, the identity of variables that capture financial conditions naturally changes.\n\nLet me now discuss the paper in more detail. I will do this in two steps. First, I will discuss the considerable contributions of the paper. Second, I will talk about where the paper might be extended and other areas of future research that might seem appropriate.\n\nIn general, I liked the paper. I think it makes some important contributions in how to construct a more complete and robust financial conditions index. In particular, I thought the paper makes two important points:\n\nThe authors deserve considerable credit for constructing a financial conditions index (FCI) that is more rigorous and complete than any that have been developed in the past—44 financial variables divided across five categories. Moreover, this is not just innovation for its own sake. The new FCI does a better job than single-factor models in forecasting real gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nSo what are the shortcomings of this approach? First, including 44 variables may generate good results more because the additional variables add greater flexibility to soak up variability in real GDP, rather than providing a more solid theoretical underpinning. As the authors note, the variables were selected, in part, on the basis of what we know today about which variables are likely to be important. But this type of selection process—even if conducted on a pseudo real-time basis—introduces selection bias, which the authors do admit could be important.\n\nSecond, despite the inclusion of a large number of variables, some important ones may still be missing. In particular, leverage variables—such as the leverage ratio of the major securities dealers—may be an important component of financial conditions. The work of Tobias Adrian and Hyun Shin suggests that the increase in leverage of the major securities was a major factor that fueled the asset bubble preceding the recent crisis. If this was indeed the case as seems likely, this type of variable should also be included in a financial conditions framework.4\n\nThird, as the authors note, the resulting FCI is complex; it is difficult to estimate, update and to communicate what the results mean. I think FCIs have value as heuristic devices in highlighting what is important. One loses that benefit when the number of variables becomes large and the indexes become complex.\n\nFourth, it would be interesting to know how financial conditions indexes for other countries and regions would differ. The authors focus only on the United States. Thus, it is difficult to know whether the value of financial conditions indexes are specific to the United States or should be applied more broadly.\n\nFifth, I thought the paper could have gone further in exploring the implications of its results. The focus of the paper is on how to construct a financial conditions index that does a good job of forecasting economic activity. The paper does not tackle the implications for monetary policy stemming from developments in financial conditions as measured by the new FCI. If financial conditions evolve in an unanticipated way, how should this influence the conduct of monetary policy?\n\nIn particular, the authors note that during the 2003-06 period, financial conditions tightened less than expected given the rise in the fed funds rate and, during the 2007-08 period tightened even as the Federal Reserve slashed its fed funds rate target. These results raise a number of interesting questions. In particular, does the behavior of the new FCI imply that the Federal Reserve should have tightened more aggressively during the 2003-06 period or eased more aggressively during the 2007-09 period? The paper’s results seem to imply this, but it would be interesting to see whether this is the case or not.\n\nIt also would be useful to know how qualitatively important these differences are. If the differences are worth only a few basis points on the fed funds rate, then having a good indicator of financial conditions is not going to be a very important input in the formulation of monetary policy. In contrast, if a shift in financial conditions implies that the fed funds rate path was “off” by a hundred basis points relative to what actually occurred, then this obviously has big implications for monetary policy. The development of equilibrium models that incorporate financial conditions in a meaningful manner might prove helpful in answering these types of questions.5\n\nIn addition, I would like to know how the various linkages have changed over time. Is the linkage between the fed funds rate and financial conditions as measured by the new FCI loosening over time or not? If so, why is this happening? Is it due to financial market innovation or the growth in share of the non-bank financial sector? I also would like to know how the linkage between financial conditions and the real economy is changing over time. If this is happening, what are the implications for macroeconomic stability and monetary policy?\n\nFinally, I would like to know about the dynamic properties of the new FCI. Are particularly high (expansive) readings dangerous and should they be taken as suggestive of asset bubbles? Should the Federal Reserve try to prevent such occurrences because loose financial conditions precede episodes of financial instability? In this respect, when financial conditions become unusually expansive, is the fed funds rate the right tool to use to constrain or counteract such expansiveness? Or would it be better to use macroprudential tools such as leverage limits or loan-to-value requirements on residential real estate to keep financial conditions from becoming unusually expansive in the first place? I could imagine circumstances in which macroprudential tools might be used to tighten up the relationship between the fed funds rate and financial conditions. Would the use of such tools be helpful in achieving greater macroeconomic stability?\n\nAt this stage, there are many more questions than answers. I would strongly encourage the authors and others to continue their work on financial conditions and in exploring how developments in the financial sector influence both the real economy and monetary policy. The financial crisis has demonstrated that financial market developments matter greatly. The paper successfully makes the case that it would be useful to have a good set of summary statistics to serve as benchmarks to keep track of such developments. It also would be useful to have a better understanding of how shifts in financial conditions should be considered in the ongoing conduct of monetary policy.\n\nEXHIBIT 1\n\nThe percentage of paragraphs in the FOMC minutes that mention the phrase \"financial conditions,\" excluding the directive and paragraphs associated with administrative matters such as election of the chairman.\n\n__________________________________________\n\n1In my comments, I am going to assume that inflation expectations are always well anchored so that I do not need to distinguish between the real and nominal fed funds rate.\n2See The Brave New Business Cycle: No Recession in Sight, William Dudley and Edward McKelvey, January 1997, Goldman Sachs Economic Research Group.\n3Adding financial intermediation to these models has become a very active area of research.

        "content": "I welcome this opportunity to talk with business leaders, workers and educators. My goals are to hear what issues are on the minds of people here and to let you know what the Federal Reserve has been doing to help improve the economy. So I'm very grateful to the Center for the New Economy (CNE) for giving me the opportunity to speak to—and learn from—you. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI want to start by talking about the implications of the close economic ties between the mainland and Puerto Rico. Since the economies of the mainland and the Commonwealth are very tightly linked, what happens on the mainland has important consequences for Puerto Rico, as well. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, we anticipate that the mainland recovery will prove to be sustainable, and that this will ultimately benefit the economy here. But Puerto Rico faces some significant challenges beyond its ties to the weaknesses in the broader U.S. economy, including problems in its own financial sector. Dealing with these problems forcefully and expeditiously is crucial to ensuring that Puerto Rico benefits fully from the expected economic recovery over the next few years. The Fed is assisting in several ways: by setting the stage for a resumption of world economic growth, by helping to resolve problems in the U.S. mainland and Commonwealth financial sectors and by partnering with Puerto Rican groups to make meaningful contributions toward resolving some of the Commonwealth's other underlying issues.\n\nPuerto Rico's Special Economic Relationship with the Mainland\nPuerto Rico has what economists often call an “open economy.” What this means is that Puerto Rico is especially dependent on external trade, so what happens to the Puerto Rican economy is greatly affected by what is going on with its major trading partners. When demand from Puerto Rico's export customers is weak, then sales and prices for the Commonwealth's products fall, so jobs and incomes on the island suffer.\n\nIn the recent recession—as in many financial crises—global trade declined even faster than output. As a result, the shock generated by the financial crisis spread quickly throughout the world. Economies and regions far from where the problems began suffered. This was especially true for economies dependent on trade, such as Puerto Rico's. In fact, Puerto Rico suffered much more than most because the Puerto Rican economy was already in recession when the financial crisis struck.\n\nWhile Puerto Rico interacts with many other economies, one partner looms especially large for the Commonwealth. For generations, the mainland United States and Puerto Rico have had a special economic relationship in many dimensions. One of the most obvious of these ties is the free flow of people between the mainland and the island. Indeed, according to the U.S. Census, about one half of the people who identify their origin as Puerto Rican lived on the mainland in 2008. The active migration, return migration and remittances to family members reflect and reinforce the close personal and economic ties between Puerto Rico and the mainland.\n\nAnother link is our common use of the dollar. This means that tourists from the mainland can visit without worrying about changing currencies. In addition, businesses can make long-term investments in Puerto Rico without worrying that currency fluctuations against the dollar will undermine their competitiveness. It also means that when the U.S. dollar falls in value, Puerto Rico's exports become more competitive around the world, although not, of course, in the United States.\n\nSomewhat less obvious are the consequences of the mainland's role as Puerto Rico's largest trading partner. The mainland accounts for half of the island's imports and three-quarters of its exports. With such heavy trade flows, when the mainland economy does poorly—as during the past year—Puerto Rico's economy and job growth suffer.\n\nFinancial regulation also represents an important linkage. Of course, my presence here representing the New York Fed is one example of that particular connection—Puerto Rico is part of the Second District of the Federal Reserve System, along with New York, the U.S. Virgin Islands and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut. I'll return to the theme of financial regulation shortly. For now, let me just say that we share, along with the rest of the world, a commitment to taking the necessary steps to prevent the type of financial crisis that we just experienced from recurring in the future.\n\nThe Fed's Role in Coping with the Crisis and the Outlook for the United States\nThe close ties with the mainland means that the broader outlook for the United States is very important for Puerto Rico. The U.S. economy has been through a terrible period, having suffered the worst financial crisis in 70 years. Extensive study of banking crises shows that they tend to be “protracted affairs” with surprisingly similar, if unpleasant, contours. Downturns average four years, during which the unemployment rate rises an average of 7 percentage points. The peak-to-trough decline in output averages 9 percent.\n\nThose statistics point out the risks that we faced. Well aware of the threat of a second Great Depression, U.S. policymakers took very aggressive actions to support economic growth in 2008 and 2009. The Fed provided liquidity facilities and took many other actions to contain and reduce pressures in financial markets, while the U.S. Treasury supported the banking system and provided cash and incentives to households, businesses, and state and local governments to support spending during 2009.\n\nThe Fed's “lender of last resort” interventions—including facilities such as the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), as well as programs such as reciprocal currency agreements—are examples of the rapid application of central banking tenets to the unique challenges we faced as this crisis evolved. Indeed, in many ways, the crisis has underscored why the Federal Reserve was created almost a century ago: to provide a backstop for a banking system prone to runs and financial panics.\n\nWhere it proved necessary and feasible, the Fed also used its emergency lending authority to forestall the disorderly failure of systemically important institutions. These actions truly were extraordinary—well outside the scope of our normal operations—but our judgment was that not taking those actions would have risked a broader collapse of the financial system and a significantly deeper and more protracted recession. Faced with the choice between these otherwise unpalatable actions and a broader systemic collapse, the Fed, with the full support of the Treasury, invoked its emergency lending authority and prevented the collapse of certain institutions previously considered to have been outside the safety net.\n\nMake no mistake: these necessary moves were unprecedented and controversial. The U.S. government's financing of Treasury's actions required federal debt to rise sharply, and stabilizing the financial system temporarily boosted the size of the Fed's balance sheet.\n\nBut there still is a lot of work to do. Smaller banks—especially those with large commercial real estate exposures—are under pressure, while households and smaller businesses find that their access to credit is still constrained.\n\nMoreover, regulatory reform is essential to prevent this type of financial crisis going forward. We need to ensure that no financial institution is “too big to fail.” This means we need Congress to enact a resolution mechanism that allows large, complex financial firms to be wound down smoothly, without the need for extraordinary interventions. In addition, we need to take steps to make the financial system as a whole more resilient and robust. This requires many steps—some already in train—including higher capital requirements for large banks, bigger liquidity buffers, and changes to ensure that compensation practices are consistent with safety and soundness and financial stability. It's a long list—there is no single silver bullet—and it will take time, but the regulatory community and the political leadership will fail to meet our shared responsibility as stewards if we do not implement the necessary reforms in a timely and effective manner.\n\nOutlook for the Recovery and Risks from the Financial Sector\nThe U.S. economy has begun to recover. Growth in the second half of 2009 was a bit stronger than expected and the pace of layoffs has diminished. We currently expect that the economy will keep expanding, but at a somewhat slower growth rate than during the second half of 2009 as the temporary boost from the inventory cycle fades and the effects of the stimulus bill gradually weaken. With modest growth, we expect price pressures to remain well contained.\n\nNonetheless, it's far too early to pop the champagne corks. While the U.S. economy is growing, unemployment remains unacceptably high and certain impediments could restrict growth in the near term. One set of challenges are current conditions in the financial system.\n\nThe initial stages of the financial crisis have been widely attributed to a rapid rise in residential mortgage defaults. Many large financial institutions turned out to have direct exposure—and often indirect exposure through complex linkages—to residential real estate, and found themselves facing severe funding problems as the value and liquidity of their assets sharply diminished.\n\nAs the real economy slipped into recession in 2008 and unemployment began to rise, other financial instruments came under stress, including commercial real estate loans and instruments based on these loans. Commercial real estate loans are frequently originated by medium-sized regional banks that have significant expertise in their local areas and are often held in the lending bank's portfolio.\n\nIn many parts of the United States, including Puerto Rico, these commercial real estate loans have now soured, and many banks are seeing the value of their assets decline and their revenues shrink. In extreme cases, some banks have become insolvent. Finding ways to address problem assets and the health of the exposed banks is fundamental to restoring the banking industry to the firm footing that is needed to properly support economic growth.\n\nTo bring this point home, let me step back and offer some observations on the importance of a well-functioning financial system. A healthy banking sector is crucial for economic growth because banks and other parts of the financial system play a key role in determining how savings are allocated among competing projects and users of credit. If households and businesses cannot get credit on reasonable terms, then the economy sputters. To underline this point, the Fed and Treasury did not intervene during the recent crisis to save the financial system (and with it, some big financial firms) for its own sake. We intervened because a collapse of the financial system would have done irreparable harm to Main Street. With the limited tools at hand, we made our choices (often between unattractive options) with the goal of supporting the economy, households and small businesses.\n\nA well-functioning financial system is also crucial in fostering economic development. History shows that substantial risks to the economy come from a persistently weak banking sector. Economists have debated whether healthy banks drive real economic growth, or vice-versa, but a wealth of recent evidence suggests that the causality runs at least partly from banks to growth, and not just the other way around. So, from my perspective, getting Puerto Rico's banking system back onto solid footing is “job one” for supporting growth here.\n\nPreparing Puerto Rico to Benefit from Recovery in the World Economy\nOf course, that isn't the whole story. Growth may also be impeded by factors that are specific to particular regions or policies.\n\nI work in New York and live in New Jersey, where we know a thing or two about fiscal problems. Puerto Rico's large public debt has the potential to reduce its growth prospects as the world economy recovers. Puerto Rico's fiscal situation has deteriorated sharply over the last five years as the Commonwealth's recession has deepened. Throughout this period, public debt has risen quickly as revenues that are sensitive to economic activity—such as income taxes—have declined.\n\nBut the fiscal problem in Puerto Rico pre-dates the current crisis. Even when the economy was growing, public debt was growing even faster. This structural imbalance is difficult to sustain in the long run, and requires attention if Puerto Rico is to prosper.\n\nA critical factor here is ensuring that the Commonwealth's tax system is designed to generate the revenue required to sustain government operations. Furthermore, any good tax system should satisfy three important criteria: simplicity, fairness and neutrality. The current system suffers from some problems that make it difficult to meet these tests and generate adequate revenue. In particular, high rates are levied on a narrow tax base.\n\nOne of the key public services funded by these taxes is education. Workers need skills to produce the complicated technological products of the future. There is clear evidence that workers with the sort of flexible thinking skills not easily duplicated by computers have seen their productivity and earnings rise, a trend that is likely to persist in the future. Thus, technology and skills are essential for healthy economic growth and for the financial health of workers and their families.\n\nAs the economy and financial system become more complex, financial literacy is also increasingly central to family financial well-being. Improved understanding of budgeting, saving, financial products and planning for retirement is not only a high priority for people in their own lives, but also for the Fed with its responsibility for monetary policy.\n\nEducation thus plays a key role in fostering upward mobility for future generations. All of this underscores the importance of achieving the best possible education for all of Puerto Rico's young people and making lifelong learning and skills development a part of everyone's future. Yet, about half of Puerto Rico's low-income students drop out of high school. Reducing this dropout rate will not be easy, but should also be a priority for the Commonwealth.\n\nThe private and public sectors both need accurate, timely and comprehensive economic statistics to perform effectively. It is impossible to make good decisions without a solid factual basis for those decisions. For example, the government needs good economic information to develop effective fiscal, economic development and regulatory policy. Likewise, to make the best production, investment and pricing decisions, businesses need accurate and timely information on things such as wages, income and prices. Poor quality information increases uncertainty and this uncertainty inhibits well-considered risk-taking and investment decisions.\n\nAlthough Puerto Rico's statistical system was once a model for other countries, now there are major opportunities for improvement in comparison with the mainland and other countries. In recognition of this need, the government of Puerto Rico recently established the Institute for Statistics to work with its statistical agencies.\n\nOne key example of these efforts concerns the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as a measure of inflation. A recent study by the Institute, aided by the Department of Labor, found that the island's official inflation rate was overestimated by more than double between 2001 and 2006. Overestimating inflation can have tangible consequences, such as excessive wage increases in certain sectors that can damage the island's global competitiveness and cause unnecessary job loss.\n\nAlso thanks to the Institute, the government of Puerto Rico now has a release schedule, called the “calendario,” for its statistical publications. This basic tool helps people, businesses and investors by ensuring that they use the latest available data for their decisions. It also boosts confidence in the data, which reduces economic uncertainty.\n\nHow the Fed Is Helping\nThere are many challenges ahead, and we are committed to being an active partner in confronting them. The Fed's most important roles in helping Puerto Rico, of course, emanate directly from our responsibilities for economic growth, stable prices and a resilient financial system. We continue to take the actions required to promote maximum sustainable growth in the U.S. economy. These efforts have and will continue to benefit the mainland and the Commonwealth.\n\nIn addition, we are working very closely with all of the banking supervisors and other key parties to facilitate an effective resolution to the current problems facing the island's banking sector. Some consolidation is likely needed to produce stronger, healthier institutions more able to make the sound lending decisions that support economic growth.\n\nI mentioned financial literacy a few minutes ago. The Federal Reserve System and the New York Fed have taken a great interest in economic education and financial literacy and will continue to do even more in the future. I, personally, believe that financial literacy is essential so that households can make the type of good financial decisions that help to ensure better futures.\n\nThese teachers take what they learned back to the classroom and many of their students enter the Federal Reserve Economics Competition. The students apply analytical skills to a local problem of their choosing and work as a team to create a presentation outlining their solution and responding to questions. The winning team develops skills—in analysis, presentations and teamwork—that will help them in their future studies and careers in the knowledge economy.\n\nWe have also had a productive relationship with our good friends at the Puerto Rico Bankers Association. Each year during “Community Reinvestment Act Week,” our staff highlights new ideas and products especially suited to the Puerto Rican market.\n\nFor example, this November we held a forum for Puerto Rican and U.S. Virgin Islands financial institutions, state and local governments, and nonprofit organizations to introduce “Bank On,” a financial product proven to attract under-banked people into the financial mainstream. Since then, several local banks have formed a group to explore how to best implement it here.\n\nAnother example of collaboration is our work with the Bankers Association and local universities. During the fall, we held a “Financial Awareness Video Contest” for college students. This pilot project explores building peer-to-peer financial awareness among young adults by having contestants create a 90-second video. We look forward to hosting the first place winners during their trip to New York in the spring.\n\nTo improve our understanding of the Puerto Rican economy, the New York Fed has joined a group of local businesses—including some represented here—to sponsor and fund a household survey, undertaken by the Center for the New Economy, our hosts today, to benchmark Puerto Rican consumer finances. As of today, the data have been collected and Fed economists are collaborating with the CNE to provide technical assistance, to make the results of this study public and to make these data available for further research.\n\nTo help businesses and government in Puerto Rico, we have also been providing technical assistance to Puerto Rico's new Institute for Statistics. We recognize the importance of this work and applaud its efforts to improve Puerto Rico's inflation measures, national income accounting and business activity measures, just to name a few.\n\nAll of these activities, from monetary policy and financial regulation to fostering community development and economic literacy and measurement, complement and reinforce each other. Our policy actions are most effective when people understand how financial markets work. Our decisions are always better when we are well informed about the concerns of families and businesses. Thus, outreach to the region and communities we serve is an important part of my job. Thank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\nLos retos del futuro\nReflexiones de William C.

        "content": "As always, my views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWith respect to what went wrong, it is important to recognize that the financial crisis occurred for a host of reasons and, thus, there is no single silver bullet to avoid such crises in the future. At the heart of the crisis was a tremendous buildup in leverage, which our regulatory framework failed to prevent. Large amounts of opaque, illiquid, long-term assets were financed by short-term liabilities, and much of this financing occurred in the shadow banking system. When the housing bubble burst, financial asset prices fell and exposed the deep linkages and overall fragility of our system. Interbank funding markets seized up, the shadow banking system crumpled and several major financial firms—banks and nonbanks alike—collapsed or approached the brink of collapse. Extraordinary interventions of governments and central banks around the world were necessary to prevent a complete collapse of the financial system and the broader economy.\n\nAs a general matter, regulators did not appreciate beforehand how vulnerable the system was to shocks. In particular, there was a failure to appreciate the important interconnections among the banking system, capital markets, and payment and settlement system. For example, the disruption of the securitization markets caused by the poor performance of highly rated debt securities led to significant problems for major financial institutions. These banks had to take assets back on their books, backstop lines of credit were triggered, and banks could no longer securitize loans, thus increasing the pressure on their balance sheets. This reduced credit availability, which increased the downward pressure on economic activity, which caused asset values to decline further, and in turn, increased the degree of stress in the financial system.\n\nMoreover, regulators did not adequately understand how the dynamics of the system tended to exacerbate shocks, rather than dampen their impact. For example, with respect to capital, firms under stress had incentives to continue to pay dividends to show that they were strong. These dividend payments actually depleted capital, making the firms weaker and vulnerable to credit rating downgrades. When credit ratings were indeed cut, that increased collateral calls, which intensified the pressure on scarce liquidity resources.\n\nRegulatory gaps were another important factor in causing the crisis. American International Group, Inc. (AIG) is a case in point. AIG Financial Products, a subsidiary of the AIG parent company, provided guarantees against default on complex collateralized debt obligations, leveraging the AAA rating of the AIG parent company in the process. This activity was conducted with inadequate regulatory oversight, poor risk management and insufficient capital.\n\nFinally, many of the incentives built into the system ultimately undermined its stability. The problems with incentives were evident in a number of areas, including faulty compensation schemes and risk management that was too narrowly focused on one business area without regard for the broader entity. These incentives created important externalities in which participants did not bear the full costs of their actions.\n\nTurning to where we are now, the U.S. financial system is in much better shape today than it was a year ago. The capital markets are generally open for business—with the important exception of some securitization markets—and the major securities dealers that survived the crisis have seen a sharp recovery in profitability. The largest U.S. bank holding companies, which went through the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program exercise, have more and better quality capital, having raised more than $100 billion of common equity over the past year in the capital markets and generated nearly as much common equity via preferred stock conversions and from gains on asset sales.\n\nHowever, many smaller and medium-sized banks remain under significant pressure. This reflects several factors. First, such institutions hold assets that are carried mainly on the books on an accrual basis. Compared with mark-to-market assets, such assets adjust much more slowly to changes in market conditions and the economic environment. Second, many of these banks have a much more concentrated exposure to commercial real estate, a sector that remains under considerable pressure. Not only have capitalization rates risen sharply—meaning the investors will pay much less for a dollar of rental income than before—but the rental income streams on these properties also have declined as the performance of the U.S. economy has declined. Together, these two factors have pushed U.S. commercial real estate prices down by about 40 percent to 50 percent from the peak reached in 2006. Loan losses in commercial real estate and consumer and mortgage loans seem likely to continue to pressure smaller banks for some time to come. This in turn means that credit availability to households and small businesses will still be curtailed.\n\nThe improvement in the overall health of the financial system and in market function has allowed the Federal Reserve to phase out many of the special liquidity facilities that were enacted in response to the crisis. These facilities were generally successful in achieving their objectives—helping to restore confidence and rebuild market liquidity in a way that safeguarded the taxpayers' interests. When a full accounting of the special liquidity facilities is complete, it seems likely that the facilities will have generated substantial incremental earnings that the Federal Reserve will remit to the Treasury. Although these incremental earnings were not the objective of these facilities, they are a pleasant outcome relative to the alternative.\n\nAs the crisis has abated, our attention has shifted to what we need to do to prevent another crisis in the future. We need to take the necessary steps to build a strong and resilient financial system. In my opinion, three broad sets of actions are needed:\n\nMacroprudential supervision is essential for two reasons. First, it addresses the problem of gaps in the regulatory regime and the regulatory arbitrage that such gaps can encourage. Second, macroprudential supervision is needed because the financial system is interconnected. Siloed regulatory oversight is not sufficient. Supervisory practices must be revamped so that supervision is also horizontal—looking broadly across banks, nonbanks, markets and geographies. This also means that regulatory standards need to be harmonized across different regions. Without harmonization, there will inevitably be a \"race to the bottom\" and regulatory arbitrage will be encouraged, rather than inhibited.\n\nMany steps are needed to make financial institutions and infrastructure more robust. For example, we need to strengthen bank capital requirements, improve liquidity buffers and make financial market infrastructures more resilient to shocks when individual firms get into trouble.\n\nIn terms of capital requirements, many changes are needed, including global capital standards that put more emphasis on common equity, establish an overall leverage limit and better capture all of the sources of risk in the capital assessment process. Improved risk capture, for example, includes the trading accounts of banks. Some institutions had clearly not set aside adequate levels of capital given the risks that were embedded in their trading positions.\n\nIt would also be very desirable to develop a mechanism to bolster the amount of common equity available to absorb losses in adverse economic environments. This might be done most efficiently by allowing the issuance of debt instruments that would automatically convert to common equity in stress environments, under certain pre-specified conditions. Such \"contingent capital\" instruments might have proven very helpful had they been in place before and during this crisis. Investors would have anticipated that common equity would be replenished automatically if a firm came under stress, and this knowledge might have tempered anxieties about counterparty risk. At a minimum, contingent capital instruments might have enabled common equity buffers at the weaker firms to be replenished earlier and automatically, thereby reducing uncertainty and the risk of failure.\n\nOn the liquidity front, there are a host of initiatives underway. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is working on establishing international standards for liquidity requirements. There are two parts to this. The first is a requirement for a short-term liquidity buffer of sufficient size so that an institution that was shut out of the market for several weeks would still have sufficient liquidity to continue its operations unimpaired. The second is a liquidity standard that limits the degree of permissible maturity transformation—that is, the amount of short-term borrowing allowed to be used in the funding of long-term illiquid assets. Under these standards, a firm's holdings of illiquid long-term assets would need to be funded mainly by equity or long-term debt.\n\nWith respect to financial market infrastructures, the Federal Reserve is working with a broad range of private-sector participants, including dealers, clearing banks and tri-party repo investors to dramatically reduce the structural instability of the tri-party repo system. Similarly, over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives clearance activity is being pushed toward central counterparties and exchanges. In addition, the Federal Reserve and others are evaluating how greater transparency with respect to OTC derivatives prices would improve financial stability. The Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and the Technical Committee of the International Organization of Securities Commissions are doing a review of standards for payment, clearing and settlement systems. This work will inform the efforts of the Financial Stability Board to strengthen such standards.\n\nThere is also work underway on the problem of how to ensure that financial institutions have compensation structures that curb rather than encourage excessive risk-taking.\n\nFinally, it is critical that we ensure that no firm is too big to fail. This is about both fairness and having proper incentives in the financial system. Having some firms that are too big to fail creates moral hazard. These firms are able to obtain funding on more attractive terms because debt holders expect that the government will intervene rather than allow failure. In addition, too big to fail creates perverse incentives. In a too-big-to-fail regime, firms have an incentive to get large, not because it facilitates greater efficiency, but instead because the implicit government backstop enables the too-big-to-fail firm to achieve lower funding costs.\n\nTo solve the too-big-to fail problem, we need to do two things. First, we need to develop a truly robust resolution mechanism that allows for the orderly wind-down of a failing institution and that limits the contagion to the broader financial system. This will require not only domestic legislation, but also intensive work internationally to address a range of legal issues involved in winding down a major global firm.\n\nSecond, we need to reduce the likelihood that systemically important institutions will come close to failure in the first place. This can be done by mandating higher capital requirements, improving the risk capture of those requirements and by requiring greater liquidity buffers for such firms.\n\nAlthough the raging crisis appears to be over, our work is not close to being complete. Making sure this work keeps moving forward and is coordinated internationally is hugely important. Differences in views across countries and regions should not divert the international community from the more important prize—taking the actions collectively that will ensure a robust and resilient financial system."

        "content": "In my opinion, this crisis demonstrated that a systemic risk oversight framework is needed to foster financial stability. The financial system is simply too complex for siloed regulators to see the entire field of play, to prevent the movement of financial activity to areas where there are regulatory gaps, and, when there are difficulties, to communicate and coordinate all responses in a timely and effective manner.\n\nEffective systemic oversight requires two elements. First, the financial system needs to be evaluated in its entirety because, as we have seen, developments in one area can often have devastating consequences elsewhere. In particular, three broad areas of the financial system need to be continuously evaluated: large systemically important financial institutions, payments and settlement systems and the capital markets. The linkages between each must be understood and monitored on a real-time basis. Second, effective systemic risk oversight will require a broad range of expertise. This requires the right people, with experience operating in all the important areas of the financial system.\n\nIn this regard, I believe that the Federal Reserve has an essential role to play. The Federal Reserve has experience and expertise in all three areas—it now oversees most of the largest U.S. financial institutions; it operates a major payments system and oversees several others; and it operates in the capital markets every day in managing its own portfolio and as an agent conducting Treasury securities auctions. Also, as the central bank, it backstops the financial system in its lender-of-last-resort role.\n\nCompared with where we were in late 2008 and early 2009, financial markets have stabilized, and the prospect of a collapse of the financial system and a second Great Depression now seems extremely remote. Even with this progress, however, credit remains tight, especially for small businesses and households. Economic growth has resumed, but unemployment has climbed to punishing levels. So while circumstances have improved, they are still very far from where we want them to be. We have no cause for celebration when the challenges facing so many businesses and households remain so daunting.\n\nAggressive and extraordinary official interventions were imperative to bring about this nascent stabilization of our financial markets and economic recovery. The Federal Reserve has been at the center of many of these interventions. For example, its efforts over the past two years to promote market functioning and minimize contagion were critical in preventing the strains in our financial markets from resulting in even more severe damage to the economy. These “lender of last resort” interventions on the part of the Fed, including facilities such as the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), as well as programs such as the foreign exchange reciprocal currency agreements, are examples of the rapid and responsive application of basic central bank tenants to the unique challenges we faced as this crisis evolved. Indeed, in many ways, the crisis has underscored why the Federal Reserve was created almost a century ago: to provide a backstop for a banking system prone to runs and financial panics.\n\nWhere it proved necessary and feasible to do so, the Fed also used its emergency lending authority to forestall the disorderly failure of systemically important institutions. These actions truly were extraordinary—well outside the scope of our normal operations, but our judgment was that not taking those actions would have risked a broader collapse of the financial system and a significantly deeper and more protracted recession. Faced with the choice between these otherwise unpalatable actions and a broader systemic collapse, the Fed, with the full support of the Treasury, invoked its emergency lending authority and prevented the collapse of certain institutions previously considered to have been outside the safety net.\n\nThe fact that the Fed needed to take those actions provides a stark illustration of the significant gaps in our regulatory structure, gaps that must be eliminated. Among those holes was the absence of effective consolidated oversight of certain large and deeply interconnected firms; the collective failure of regulators—including the Federal Reserve—to appreciate the linkages and amplification mechanisms embedded in our financial system; and the absence of a resolution process that would allow even the largest and most complex of financial institutions to fail without imperiling the flow of credit to the economy more broadly. Addressing these shortcomings will require important reforms in our country's regulatory architecture.\n\nWe entered the crisis with an obsolete regulatory system. For one, our regulatory system was not structured for a world in which an increasingly large amount of credit intermediation was occurring in nonbank financial institutions. As a result, little attention was paid to the systemic implications of the actions of a large number of increasingly important financial institutions—including securities firms, insurance conglomerates and monolines. In addition, many large financial organizations were funding themselves through market-based mechanisms such as tri-party repo. This made the system as a whole much more fragile and vulnerable to runs when confidence faltered.\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that the Fed and other regulators, here and abroad, did not sufficiently understand the importance of some of these changes in our financial system. We did not see some of the critical vulnerabilities these changes had created, including the large number of self-amplifying mechanisms that were embedded in the system. Nor were all the ramifications of the growth in the intermediation of credit by the nonbank or “shadow banking” system appreciated and their linkages back to regulated financial institutions understood until after the crisis began.\n\nWith hindsight, the regulatory community undoubtedly should have raised the alarm sooner and done more to address the vulnerabilities facing our banks and our entire financial system. But this was difficult because our country didn’t have truly systemic oversight—oversight that would be better suited to the new world in which markets and nonbank financial institutions had become much more important in how credit was intermediated. Without a truly systemic perspective, it was unlikely that any regulator would have been able to understand how the risks were building up in our contemporary, market-based system. The problem was that both banking and nonbank organizations played an important role in credit intermediation but were subject to differing degrees of regulation and supervision by different regulatory authorities.\n\nAlthough these gaps had existed for years, their consequences were not apparent until the crisis. Difficulties in one part of the system quickly exposed hidden vulnerabilities in other parts of the system, in a way that our patchwork regulatory system had not been designed to detect or readily address. In the same way, the crisis revealed the critical deficiencies in the toolkits available to the regulators to deal with nonbank institutions in duress. Emergency lending by the Fed might be enough to forestall the disorderly failure of a systemically important institution and all the wider damage such a failure might cause, but it was a blunt and messy solution, employed as a stopgap measure because better alternatives were not available. What is needed—what our country still lacks—is a large-firm resolution process that would allow for the orderly failure even of a systemically important institution.\n\nThus, in the fall of 2008, regulators and policymakers found themselves facing the prospect of the total collapse of a complex and interconnected system. It was these circumstances, and the prospect they created for an even deeper and more protracted downturn in real economic activity and employment, that required truly extraordinary actions on the part of the Federal Reserve, as well as the Treasury and many other agencies. This is a situation in which the United States must never again find itself.\n\nFor its part, the Federal Reserve is hard at work on developing and implementing new regulations and policy guidance that take on broad lessons of the recent crisis. We are working with other banking regulators in the United States and overseas to strengthen bank capital standards, both by raising the required level of capital where appropriate and improving the risk capture of our standards. We are issuing new guidelines on compensation practices so that financial sector employees are rewarded for long-term performance and discouraged from excessive risk-taking. And we are working with foreign regulators to develop more robust international standards for bank liquidity. We are working to make the tri-party repo system more robust and reducing settlement risk by facilitating the settlement of over-the-counter derivatives trades on central counterparties (CCPs). But more needs to be done and much of this requires action by Congress.\n\nCongress is now considering several proposals for comprehensive regulatory reform, proposals that merit careful study and debate. Let me offer some general thoughts on the principles that should guide how we approach reform.\n\nFirst, it's important to take a clear-eyed and comprehensive view of the financial system we have today. As I've already suggested, if there is one overriding lesson to be drawn from the events of the past 18 months, it is that the financial system is just that: a system, and a very complex one at that. The operational, liquidity and credit interdependencies that characterize contemporary financial markets and institutions mean that the well-being of any one segment of the system is inextricably linked to the well-being of the system as a whole. Because of this, our approach to reform must be guided by a coherent sense of the system as a whole, not merely by a focus on some of its component parts, as important as they may be.\n\nWe need a new regulatory structure that provides for comprehensive and consistent oversight of all elements of the financial system. This includes effective consolidated oversight of all our largest and interconnected financial institutions and oversight of payment and settlement systems. We must make sure that the people doing the regulation have the power and expertise to ferret out and bring to heel regulatory evasion as it occurs to prevent abuse and excess from building up in the financial system. In the end, the gaps, not the overlaps, have been the main shortcoming of our existing regulatory framework.\n\nA second fundamental point is that regulatory reform has to ensure that the financial system will be robust and resilient even when it comes under stress so that it will not fail in its critical role in supporting economic activity. No economy can prosper without a well-functioning financial system—one that efficiently channels savings to the businesses that can make the most productive use of those savings, and to consumers that need credit to buy a home and support a family. The fact that our financial system isn't functioning well right now is part and parcel of our current economic difficulties. This critical link between the “real” and the “financial” is why we care so much about the systemic risks inherent in banking and finance.\n\nOne critical element of systemic risk is what is known as the “too big to fail” problem. Without sufficiently high capital and liquidity standards, and, as a backstop, a resolution mechanism that is credible, regulators are faced with a Hobson’s Choice when a large, systemically important financial firm encounters difficulties. On the one hand, if authorities step in to respond to prevent failure, contagion and collapse of the broader system, that action rewards the imprudent and can create moral hazard—that is, encouraging others to act irresponsibly or recklessly in the future in the belief that they will also be rescued or “bailed out.” On the other hand, if authorities do nothing and let market discipline run its course, they run the risk that the problem will spread and unleash a chain reaction of collapse, with severe and lasting damage to markets, to households and to businesses.\n\nSo what can we do about the “too big to fail” problem? It is clear that we must develop a truly robust resolution mechanism that allows for the orderly wind-down of a failing institution and that limits the contagion to the broader financial system. This will require not only legislative action domestically but intensive work internationally to address a range of legal issues involved in winding down a major global firm. Second, we need to ensure that the payments and settlement systems are robust and resilient. By strengthening financial market infrastructures, we can reduce the risk that shocks in one part of the system will spread elsewhere. Third, we need to reduce the likelihood that systemically important institutions will come close to failure in the first place. This can be done by mandating more robust capital requirements and greater liquidity buffers, as well as aligning compensation with the risks that are taken by the firm’s employees. In addition, instruments such as contingent capital–debt that would automatically convert to equity in adverse environments–need to be considered. Such instruments would enable equity capital to be replenished automatically during stress environments, dampening shocks rather than exacerbating them.\n\nI would now like to take some time to discuss some of the proposals that Congress is debating regarding regulatory reform. As Congress and the Administration consider what legislative changes are warranted, the Federal Reserve's actions before and during the crisis have been getting close inspection. Given the Federal Reserve's key role in our financial system, and the scale of the damage caused by the financial crisis, this careful scrutiny is necessary, appropriate and welcome.\n\nNot surprisingly, there are legislative proposals that would significantly alter the Federal Reserve's powers and responsibilities, particularly with respect to supervision of bank holding companies. Again, that's entirely within Congress's purview: the Federal Reserve only has the powers and responsibilities that Congress has entrusted to us. But in drawing up new legislation, it's important not to throw the baby out with the bathwater—we should preserve what has worked and fix what hasn’t. A dispassionate analysis of what is needed will almost certainly lead to better decisions and a more effective regulatory framework.\n\nThe legislative proposals concerning the Federal Reserve are not limited to the Federal Reserve’s role in supervision. Consider, for example, one proposal that calls for what it terms \"audits\" of the Federal Reserve by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), an arm of Congress. These wouldn't be audits at all in the commonly understood sense of the term. The Federal Reserve's financial books and transactions are already audited by wide range of professionals internal and external to the institution. Rather, these new audits would involve ex-post review of Federal Reserve monetary policy decisions, a potential first step toward the politicization of a process that Congress has carefully sought to insulate from political pressures.\n\nThe notion that the Federal Reserve's financial dealings are somehow kept hidden from the public is a surprisingly widely held view—and it is simply incorrect. An independent outside audit of the Federal Reserve's books is conducted annually. You can find the results online, including a detailed accounting of the Federal Reserve's income and operating expenses in its annual report. The financial books of the regional Federal Reserve Banks also undergo independent outside audits, also available online. In addition, the GAO is empowered to review almost all Federal Reserve activities other than the conduct of monetary policy, including the Federal Reserve's financial operations, which the GAO has done so frequently. The Federal Reserve's balance sheet is posted online weekly, with considerable detail, in what's called the H.4.1 report. Finally, an additional accounting of the Federal Reserve's emergency lending programs created over the last two years is available online in a monthly report.\n\nBut my objection that GAO oversight would be broadened to include a review of monetary policy decisions is not based just on the fact that the Fed is already subject to considerable oversight. My principal concern is the damage that could potentially result to the Fed’s ability to achieve its mandate of price stability and maximum sustainable employment. The effectiveness of monetary policy depends most of all on the Federal Reserve’s credibility with market participants and investors. In particular, both groups need to know that the Fed will always act to keep inflation in check. That's why Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin famously joked that the Fed would sometimes need \"to take the punchbowl away just as the party gets going.\" As you can well imagine, this may not always enhance our popularity, especially among those who were enjoying the party. But, the fact that markets know that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy when needed helps keep inflation expectations in check. This, in turn, helps keep inflation low since inflation expectations affect actual inflation. The consequence is credibility with respect to the conduct of monetary policy. This gives the Fed more latitude not to tighten when inflation rises for transient reasons—say, due to a short-lived spike in oil prices—and more scope to ease credit to support the economy during economic downturns.\n\nRecognizing these benefits, Congress wisely acted many years ago to exempt monetary policy decisions from the GAO's wide powers to review Federal Reserve activities. Congress' decision to bolster the Fed's monetary policy independence has been followed by similar actions around the world—substantial independence for the central bank in the conduct of monetary policy is now widely regarded as international best practice. Policy independence does not absolve the Federal Reserve from accountability for its monetary policy decisions and the need to clearly explain why they were taken. But it avoids the politicization of monetary policy decision-making. And this is good because politicized central banks generally do not have enviable records with regard to inflation, economic growth or currency stability. Risk premia on financial assets are typically much higher in countries with politicized central banks.\n\nOf course, a reversal of Congress's earlier decision would not amount to legislative control over monetary policy decisions. That's not the issue. The issue is that a reversal of Congress’ earlier decision could create the appearance that the legislature seeks to influence monetary policy decisions by establishing a mechanism to publicly second guess those decisions. Such a move would blur what has been a careful separation of monetary policy from politics. Market confidence here and abroad in the Federal Reserve would be undermined. Asset prices could quickly build in an added risk premium, which might lead to tighter credit conditions. These unintended consequences would undermine the legislation’s intent.\n\nI’m also concerned about those proposals under consideration that would move the regulatory and supervisory functions now held by the Federal Reserve to other agencies, new or existing. At present, the Federal Reserve is the consolidated supervisor for bank holding companies, a group that has expanded recently as investment banks and other companies formerly outside the Federal Reserve's purview have been brought under Federal Reserve oversight. In my view, further disaggregation or fragmentation of regulatory oversight responsibility is not the appropriate response to our increasingly interconnected, interdependent financial system. Funneling information streams into diverse institutional silos leads to communication breakdowns and too often to failure to \"connect the dots.\"\n\nIn addition, there are clear synergies between the supervisory process and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy and financial stability missions. The information we collect as part of the supervisory process gives us a front-line, real-time view of the state of the financial industry and broader economy. Monetary policy is more informed as a result. Only with this knowledge can a central bank understand how the monetary policy impulse will be propagated through the financial system and affect the real economy.\n\nSimilarly, involvement in the supervisory process gives us critical information in fulfilling our lender-of-last-resort responsibilities. Information sharing with other agencies is simply not as good as the intimate knowledge and understanding of markets and institutions that is gathered from first-hand supervision. Indeed, many institutions at the center of the crisis and arguably the most troubled—Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, AIG and the GSEs—were not supervised by the Federal Reserve. Consequently, when those institutions came under stress, the Federal Reserve had poorer quality and far less timely information about the condition of these institutions than would have been the case if we had had the benefit of direct supervisory oversight.\n\nIn fact, some of the hardest choices the Federal Reserve had to make during the most chaotic weeks of the crisis concerned systemically important firms we did not regulate. It is not surprising that, in the wake of the crisis, some countries that had separated bank supervision from the central bank monetary policy role are now reconsidering that division of labor. That is mainly because coordination problems created difficulties in responding quickly and effectively in the crisis. Separation made it more difficult to communicate in a timely way and to understand the broader implications of what was transpiring. It is critical that we not introduce new inefficiencies and impediments. No matter what steps are taken to improve our regulatory system and strengthen market discipline, history tells us that there will inevitably be circumstances in which an informed and effective lender of last resort will play a critical role in preventing shocks and strains in financial markets and institutions from generating a broader collapse of the financial system.\n\nOf course, there are legitimate questions as to how broad the Federal Reserve's regulatory and supervisory responsibilities should be. That question is up to Congress, and should be decided on the merits. What is fundamentally at issue here is not “turf,” but rather how we as a nation can best ensure that we never again re-live the events of the past few years—that the legitimate public interests associated with a safe, efficient and impartial banking and financial system are well served.\n\nIn the end, it is critical that financial reform be decided on the basis of the merits. If objective and careful policymaking prevails, we will all be the better off for it. In contrast, if we fail in this endeavor, that would truly be tragic. We must act informed by the important lessons that we have learned from this crisis.\n\nThank you for your kind attention."
