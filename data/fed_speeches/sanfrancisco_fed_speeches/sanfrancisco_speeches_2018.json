        "content": "This speech was posted on December 7, 2018.\n\nGood afternoon. I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you today. Most of my interactions with auto dealers are under more stressful circumstances. It’s a genuine pleasure to be meeting with you without any high-pressure talk about sticker prices and dealer costs, and no papers to sign.\n\nIn my comments, I’ll begin by discussing the current U.S. economic outlook, which by most reckonings is very good. And since I work for the organization that sets U.S. monetary policy, the Federal Reserve, or “the Fed” as it’s affectionately known, I’ll talk about that as well. As you know, interest rates have been going up, and that’s expected to continue. What may surprise you is just how little they’re expected to increase. This is guided by the intent of keeping the economic expansion going as long as possible. I’ll also talk about some longer-term economic challenges, specifically how technology has been changing the labor market, that monetary policy can only affect indirectly. I’ll be using a few slides and charts as guideposts, but not too many!\n\nBefore I proceed, I want to emphasize an important disclaimer: the views I express today are wholly my own and do not necessarily reflect those of other individuals or institutions in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nEconomic outlook\n\nI’ll start with the economic outlook. As I just mentioned, the U.S. economy is looking very good at the moment. The expansion is entering its 10th year. If it extends past June of next year, as widely expected, it will become the longest U.S. expansion in historical records dating back to the 1850s.1 The Great Recession from a decade ago is starting to fade from memory. Household and business balance sheets have been repaired, and there’s plenty of optimism fueling continued spending growth all around.\n\nWe typically assess the economy’s performance using a measure of overall activity, called gross domestic product, or GDP. It’s grown at a strong pace this year, and even though some slowing is expected, growth should remain quite healthy over the next few years.\n\nGDP is a good overall indicator, but it’s a bit opaque to the average person. Probably the clearest signs of the strong economy are in the labor market. Lots of new jobs are being created every month, and the unemployment rate has been running below 4 percent. This is the lowest it’s been since the 1960s. In other words, jobs are plentiful, and unemployed individuals to place in those jobs are becoming scarce. That can create challenges for employers, but from a broad economic perspective, it’s a situation that most people want to see continue.\n\nSustaining the expansion: An environment of rising interest rates\n\nThat’s where the Federal Reserve comes in. The goal of sustaining the expansion forms the backdrop for current and projected monetary policy.\n\nThe Fed has two main goals, as mandated by longstanding federal laws—this is the so-called dual mandate.\n\nThe first goal is maximum or full employment. That doesn’t mean everyone is working. Instead, it means a thriving labor market, with unemployment low enough that it largely reflects routine worker and job turnover. The low numbers I just mentioned strongly suggest that the labor market has not only reached but actually moved past full employment.\n\nThe Fed’s other goal is stable prices. In practice, this means a modest rate of inflation, specifically 2 percent.2 Inflation had been running below that target for much of the time since the Great Recession ended in 2009, but recently it has come back up and is basically on target.\n\nThese are not easy goals to achieve, especially when the Fed has only one main tool at its disposal: moving interest rates up and down. Low rates rev up the economy by stimulating borrowing, spending, and investment. High rates do the opposite, putting some brake pressure on the expansion. The Fed’s key policy rate is set by our monetary policy arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, which meets eight times per year. As I’m sure you know, the FOMC left rates at very low levels for a long time during and after the recession. This helped support the economic recovery.\n\nNow, with the targets largely met, and the economy able to stand on its own two feet, the Fed is well on the way to normalizing monetary policy. This means rising interest rates. The goal of this normalization process is to maintain the expansion and ensure that the Fed does not backslide on its dual mandate. If rates are left low, the economy could start running too hot, spurring an uptick in inflation. Recall that I mentioned the 1960s, another time when unemployment was very low. What was the aftermath? The 1970s, when, as I know from personal experience, rock music and fashion took a decided turn for the worse, and more importantly, inflation shot up to double digits.3\n\nThe problem with rapid increases in inflation is that they may require an aggressive monetary policy response, which can stifle the expansion. To minimize this risk and more generally keep the economy on an even keel, the FOMC has been raising interest rates over the past few years.\n\nBut here’s the really interesting part of the story. This process of raising rates has been occurring much more gradually than it did during recent economic expansions (see the first figure). For example, during the mid-2000s, the Fed’s policy rates rose by about 2 percentage points per year. By contrast, they’ve been rising half that pace or less during the current normalization cycle.\n\nInterest rates: Gradual, limited increase\nFederal funds rate (set by FOMC; with projections)\n\n\n\nThe economy already is seeing some impact from rising rates. This is mainly evident in the housing sector, where construction and sales have been easing this year. Of course, auto sales also depend heavily on borrowing, and they have slipped a bit over the past couple of years as well. Importantly, however, despite the restraining effects of higher rates for some sectors, the overall economic expansion has actually accelerated this year compared with 2017.\n\nIt’s also important to keep in mind that rates are not expected to rise anywhere near their past highs. This may be a pleasant surprise for you. The dashed line in the chart shows a likely path for the federal funds rate, based on the median projection in the FOMC’s most recent Summary of Economic Projections from late September.4 To be clear, these are only projections, not set plans. The FOMC has indicated that it will respond to changes in economic conditions accordingly. But if conditions evolve as expected, the funds rate is likely to top out at just under 3½ percent over the next few years, about 2 to 3 percentage points below its past highs. The reasons for these lower rates are complicated and would make for a separate talk in themselves.5 The key takeaway is that rates are likely to rise further but not by a lot.\n\nLong-term challenges: Technology and the labor market\n\nI’ve described a strong economy, in which the Fed’s main goals have largely been achieved. That’s the short of it. But all this happy talk often raises a question: if the economy is so good, why are some people feeling so bad? It’s a fair question. Many families, and in some cases entire communities, are struggling to make ends meet, and they are understandably baffled when people like me tell them that the economy is doing great.\n\nThe key longer-term challenges generally are coming from shifts in the labor market. And a key culprit is changing technology—by that, I mean the way work is organized, and the interactions between people and machinery that produce goods and services. Technology raises our standard of living in general, but it can be a major disrupter to the traditional economic order. With the expansion of computers and related technology, lots of jobs that used to be stable and well-paid are getting replaced by automation. This is well-known in manufacturing. But we also see this in a wide variety of services, from call centers to online retail and self-serve checkout at grocery stores. Auto dealers have been affected as well, although probably not as much—as far as I know, virtual reality test drives aren’t yet an adequate substitute for the real thing.\n\nEconomists refer to these shifts as job market polarization.6 This is the process by which changing technology and rising automation have been eroding the status of traditional middle-class jobs (depicted in the second figure). These so-called routine jobs are readily replaced by automation. Broadly speaking, this includes many white-collar sales and office jobs, as well as blue-collar factory jobs and related positions. These types of jobs have been disappearing over the past few decades, as shown by the gold and red bars in the chart. By contrast, the highly skilled professional positions have been doing well, as have lower-paying service positions that involve direct personal contact and hence are not routine—baristas and home health-care aides are basic examples, but there are lots of others.\n\nDisappearance of middle-class jobs\nEmployment growth by broad occupation category\n\n\n\nPolarization has had a profound impact on the job market. Wages have grown rapidly at the top, where workers tend to take advantage of the new technologies rather than being replaced by them. But those in the middle and below, who are competing for the same shrinking pool of jobs, generally have seen much slower gains.7\n\nRecent research conducted by myself and others suggests that polarization likely has contributed to lower labor force participation as well.8 This refers to the fraction of the working-age population that is either employed or actively looking for a job (in the third figure). You can see that the overall participation rate has declined during the past two decades. This occurred in part because the baby boom generation started heading off for retirement. But participation by individuals in their prime working years, between the ages of 25 and 54, also has declined. It has recovered somewhat but generally is expected to remain well below past highs.9 The disappearance of good middle-class jobs, without obvious and natural replacement jobs being created, has left large numbers of potential workers on the sidelines.\n\nLabor force participation has fallen\nLabor force participation rates\n\n\n\nAnd technology has affected the types of jobs available in other ways. Even with the labor market fully recovered from the Great Recession, there are still lots of workers who want to work full-time hours but are stuck in part-time jobs. My own research on this topic suggests that changing technology, reflected in job shifts toward industries that rely more heavily on unpredictable part-time schedules, has played a key role.10\n\nSimilarly, the growth of the gig economy reflects new technologies that have enabled ride-sharing services like Lyft and Uber to flourish. This is a great example of how new technologies can be a mixed bag. Gig jobs allow flexibility in work schedules and greater ability to supplement income, but they also lack traditional benefits and job security.\n\nAll this means that finding and staying in a well-paid job is not the same as it used to be. This makes for a challenging economic environment for workers and families buffeted by these changes, even when overall economic conditions are strong.\n\nWhere do the Fed and monetary policy come in? As I’ve argued, these challenges are largely created by changing technology and workplace practices, which monetary policy does not directly affect. But by keeping the expansion going, enabling job creation to continue and perhaps wages and job quality to improve, well-designed monetary policy can offset some of the negative impacts of these trends. Such challenges are easier to address when the economy is growing and the nation’s financial health is good, whether the solution is educational investments by households, training decisions by businesses, or spending decisions by government at all levels.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude, the United States economy is strong. The goal of monetary policy is to keep it strong by avoiding recessions without sparking unwanted inflation or other potential problems. This also helps create the best environment for addressing the challenges of a changing labor market. Thank you.\n\nEnd notes\n\n1. https://www.nber.org/cycles.html\n\n2.

        "content": "Introduction\n\nThanks very much for that kind introduction. I’d like to thank Park Price for helping organize this event and for his long service as a San Francisco Fed Director. Park is the definition of a Fed Family member, and I am delighted to deliver my first speech as the president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco in the community Park calls home.\n\nI would also like to recognize our veterans who have chosen to spend part of their day with us; we thank you for your service.\n\nI’ve been coming to Idaho since 1997, when I was just a rookie economist. It was love at first sight, the mix of agriculture and technology, rural and urban, the natural beauty, and all the things I love to do: skiing, biking, and hiking. Indeed, when days get hard my mantra is, I’m packing up and moving to Idaho. Apparently I am not the only one. Boise was recently flagged by Forbes magazine as the fastest-growing metro area in the country,1 and Eastern Idaho is sure to be right behind.\n\nMore generally, Idaho’s economy is flourishing, so it’s a perfect backdrop to talk about the broader U.S. outlook, which is very favorable. As the president of the San Francisco Fed, my job is to represent most of the western states—from Idaho and Utah out to Hawai’i and Alaska—in the formulation of the nation’s monetary policy. The Fed’s goal, simply put, is to keep the expansion on a solid and sustainable footing. Congress has given us two mandates meant to support this: full employment and stable prices. Most of our job focuses on the short run, not letting the economy get too hot or too cold, but we also have to consider the economy’s longer-term performance. My remarks today will focus on each of these in turn.\n\nNow, before I dive in, let me say that my views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nCurrent economic conditions\n\nI’ll start with the current state of the economy, which is very good. The expansion is over nine years old and seems destined to set a new record for the longest period without a recession in U.S. history, which it should reach in the middle of next year. The labor market is booming. Household and business balance sheets are very healthy, and confidence is high. All these factors point to significant underlying economic momentum, which is being boosted by tailwinds including the federal fiscal stimulus and global growth that, despite some recent unevenness, has been solid over the past few years.\n\nEven in this strong economy, though, some people are getting left behind. There are pockets of economic distress, and we need to do all we can to ensure that growth is inclusive and everyone has an opportunity to benefit.\n\nMonetary policy, however, can’t do everything. Our job is to keep the overall economy healthy, thus helping promote sustainable economic growth. By doing this, monetary policy supports economic well-being and creates opportunities for all to advance.\n\nImplications for monetary policy\n\nThis principle of sustaining a healthy expansion has guided our recent policy and plans. As you probably know, the Fed’s monetary policy group, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, meets eight times per year. We left interest rates unchanged at our meeting last week. More generally, though, we’ve been gradually increasing rates in order to bring the stance of monetary policy closer to neutral.\n\nThis policy normalization, or return to neutral, reflects our commitment to the Fed’s dual mandate. One goal is “maximum” or full employment. This means an unemployment rate that is very low, reflecting normal worker turnover in a thriving labor market. Recent unemployment numbers below 4 percent strongly suggest that the labor market has reached or exceeded full employment. But there are other indicators as well, and I’ll return to them in a moment.\n\nOur other goal is stable prices. In 2012, the FOMC determined that aiming for price inflation of 2 percent was most consistent with that broad long-run goal.2 We’d been mostly running below that target since the Great Recession ended in 2009. Recently, though, inflation has come back up and is basically on target. I expect this modest uptrend to continue, with inflation rising to just a bit above 2 percent over the next year or so. Of course, there are risks on both sides of that projection. Inflation could pick up more rapidly than expected, or it could drop back down again.3 For now, though, the inflation numbers are very encouraging.\n\nThese conditions, with both of the Fed’s goals essentially met, merit the gradual normalization of monetary policy.\n\nSo why gradual? I view this gradualism as a process of iterated learning, guided by incoming data. That is, we take a policy action, wait, learn about the economy’s response, and repeat. The information gathered through this gradual approach is crucial for determining the speed and size of the subsequent policy adjustments. Of course, since monetary policy acts with a significant lag—likely a few years—policymakers must plan ahead, but need to be ready to adjust if the data or the environment change.4\n\nIn other words, the FOMC is not on autopilot, with quarterly rate increases locked in. We’re constantly looking at the data and adjusting the monetary policy path as needed in response.\n\nAre we at full employment?\n\nThat summarizes where I see the economy and policy headed. But there are always uncertainties. We’ve been surprised at how long it’s taken inflation to return to target. This has raised questions about whether the economy has truly reached its full potential. In other words, are we at the point where growth will be increasingly constrained by bottlenecks and other supply factors, rather than inadequate demand?\n\nIn the labor market, this idea of an economy at its potential corresponds to full employment. Hence the question: “Are we at full employment?” While we frequently summarize the state of the labor market with the unemployment rate, we always look at a wide variety of other labor market indicators. These include broader measures of underemployment that take into account individuals who are out of the labor market or stuck in part-time jobs. We also watch an array of independent data series on job openings, worker quit rates, reported job availability and difficulties filling jobs, and others. Essentially all of these indicators are flashing bright green: they’ve met or moved beyond their values from past peaks, signaling a labor market that is indeed at full employment.\n\nThe key exception is continued low rates of labor force participation. This refers to the fraction of the working-age population that is either employed or is unemployed and actively seeking work. My first chart shows the patterns in participation over the past 25 years for the overall population ages 16 and over and for workers in their prime working years, corresponding to ages 25 to 54.\n\nYou can see that the overall rate has generally been on the decline since the year 2000. Demographics play a big role—specifically aging, as many of the baby boom generation head off for retirement.\n\nBut an aging population doesn’t explain everything. The chart also shows a drop in labor force participation among prime-age workers. Like the overall rate, prime-age participation peaked around the year 2000. It fell around the 2001 recession and then took an even steeper tumble during and after the Great Recession of 2007 through 2009. It reached a low point in 2015, nearly eight years after the initial downturn. We’ve seen a bit of improvement since then. But currently, the prime-age participation rate is significantly lower than it was in the 1990s.\n\nThis raises the question—why aren’t Americans working like they used to? Some observers think this reflects a labor market that hasn’t yet recovered from the last recession. But my reading of the evidence suggests that longer-term factors are at play.\n\nA number of influences have been identified. Research by San Francisco Fed economist Nicolas Petrosky-Nadeau and his coauthor Bob Hall suggests that some of the drop owes to economically secure families opting in favor of one employed spouse rather than two.5 In other words, there may have been some shift toward the “life” end of the work-life balance.\n\nAnother factor behind the decline is ongoing job polarization that favors workers at the high and low ends of the skill distribution but hinders those in the middle. This is mainly due to changing technology. I know for myself, I never call a travel agent anymore. With a few taps and swipes on my phone, I can book a trip to almost anywhere in the world in seconds. But it goes far beyond that: our economy is automating a wide range of jobs in the middle-skill range, from assembly lines, to call center workers, to grocery checkers.\n\nA growing body of research finds that these pressures on middle-skill jobs leave a big swath of workers on the sidelines, wanting work but not having the skills or flexibility to keep pace with the ever-changing economy.6\n\nWhat to do?\n\nI’ve argued that low workforce participation reflects long-term challenges. Good monetary policy can’t directly cure these problems. But as I’ve already noted, it can help by keeping the expansion going. Recessions cause long-term damage to workers’ employment and wage prospects.7 Keeping the economy on an even keel can help avoid these problems.\n\nBut much can be done beyond good monetary policy. We shouldn’t think of “full employment” as a fixed target, but instead think of it as something that can be moved. From that perspective, there appears to be quite a bit of upside potential for U.S. workforce participation.\n\nInternational comparisons are helpful on this point. The next chart shows the prime-age participation rate in Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In these other advanced economies, participation has increased overall and now stands well above the rates observed in the United States. This is especially striking because, just like the United States, these countries are facing long-term challenges like labor market polarization. Yet, they have managed to offset the downward pull on participation rates.\n\nWhat factors have contributed to this growing divergence between us and other countries?\n\nEducation is one. Like most advanced economies, job creation in the United States has tilted toward jobs that require a college degree.8 But we’re not adequately preparing our new workers for the jobs of the future. Although the share of young people with four-year college degrees is rising, we are falling behind many of our international competitors.9\n\nSo where should we focus our efforts when it comes to increasing college education? A good place to start would be reducing the educational attainment gap across students of different races and ethnicities. Equalizing opportunity and access to higher education has substantial upside potential for overall growth, as well as for enhancing the economic mobility that is at the core of our American identity.10\n\nBut education is not the only answer. There are other things that can be done. The United States versus Canada comparison is especially telling (chart). You can see a growing participation gap between the two countries since the late 1990s. By 2017, the prime-age participation rate was over 5 percentage points higher in Canada than in the States. This is a startling difference. It represents about 6.7 million additional individuals in the U.S. who could be in the labor force.\n\nIn a research report scheduled for public release tomorrow, I worked with current and former San Francisco Fed staff to try to understand this gap.11 We found that it’s mostly due to differences for women: they account for about three-fourths, or 5 million, of that 6.7 million total. And it’s not a matter of differences in educational attainment: the Canadian edge is generally evident across all educational groups.\n\nWhy is there such a large gap in women’s participation rates across the two countries? We discuss some tentative but compelling answers in our research note. Government subsidies for the cost of childcare in Canada may play a role, supporting the return to work for parents—especially mothers—with young children.\n\nProbably more important, though, are Canada’s generous parental leave policies. Workers are assured of being able to return to their prior job, with the same compensation, after taking a prolonged parental leave—up to a year and a half in some provinces. They also receive payments that replace much of their lost income during leave, funded out of the nation’s employment insurance system. This system encourages people to return to jobs rather than drop out of the labor force following the birth of children.\n\nNow I’m not advocating we adopt the Canadian system or recommending any particular policy. But the comparison with Canada, as well as with other industrialized nations, shows that policy matters and that, with the right mix of skills and support, there’s meaningful potential for increasing U.S. workforce participation.\n\nThe Fed can help by making sure that the economy continues to grow, creating work opportunities for wide swaths of the population. But over the long term, it is equally important to develop more supportive educational and family policies, so that individuals are encouraged to take advantage of those opportunities.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo wrap up, the U.S. economy is in very good shape. Keeping it that way requires continuing on the path of consistent, thoughtful monetary policy. In conjunction with policies designed to encourage workforce participation, this also may help boost our economy’s longer-term growth potential, thereby supporting economic advancement for all Americans.

        "content": "Introduction\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for the kind introduction. I know that here, at the Economic Club of Minnesota, you regularly host Fed presidents, so you’re no strangers to speeches on interest rates and monetary policy. Today I’m going to take advantage of that fact and take a step back. Today I’m going to talk about where I see interest rates going, not just over the next few months, but over the next several years, and discuss the economic fundamentals driving the changes taking place.\n\nOne of the key factors that influences my thinking on monetary policy is something called r-star. Today I hope you’ll indulge me while I describe what r-star is, where it’s headed, and how that affects the direction of interest rates.\n\nNow, I’ve already referred to interest rates and monetary policy several times. So before I go any further I should give the usual Fed disclaimer that the views I express are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else at the Minneapolis Fed, the San Francisco Fed, the New York Fed, or the Federal Reserve System as a whole!\n\nR-star and the new normal\n\nSo what is this r-star I keep referring to, and why is it so important when it comes to thinking about interest rates?\n\nR-star is what economists call the natural rate of interest; it’s the real interest rate expected to prevail when the economy is at full strength. While a central bank like the Fed sets short-term interest rates, r-star is a result of longer-term economic factors beyond the influence of central banks and monetary policy.1\n\nSuch is my fascination with interest rates, that r-star is an area I’ve researched extensively. If by the end of this speech you share just a tenth of my passion for r-star, I’ll feel like I’ve done my job!\n\nMy own view is that r-star today is around 0.5 percent. Assuming inflation is running at our goal of 2 percent, that means the typical, or normal short-term interest rate is 2.5 percent.2 When put into a historical context, r-star stands at an incredibly low level—in fact, a full 2 percentage points below what a normal interest rate looked like just 20 years ago.  This trend is not unique to the United States: Averaging across Canada, the euro area, Japan, and the United Kingdom, a measure of global r-star is a bit below 0.5 percent.3\n\nR-star matters a great deal, because it anchors where short-term interest rates will tend to be in the future. In a world of low r-star, policymakers, banks, businesses, and households all need to plan for lower interest rates than they’ve experienced in decades past.\n\nRecently some economists and central bankers have pointed to signs that the fortunes of r-star are set to rise. I wish I could join in this optimism, but I don’t yet see convincing evidence of such a shift. The longer-run drivers still point to a “new normal” of a low r-star and relatively low interest rates.\n\nWhat drives the fortunes of r-star?\n\nI’ve already mentioned that r-star is driven by longer-run structural factors, beyond the influence of central banks. But what are those factors, and how do they influence the fortunes of r-star?\n\nThree key global developments have caused r-star to come down in a number of developed economies over the past two decades: changes in demographics, a slowdown in productivity growth, and heightened demand for safe assets.4\n\nChanges in demographics affect r-star on a number of levels. We are living longer: Over the past three decades, life expectancy in developed economies has risen by nearly five years and is expected to keep rising.5 When people expect to live longer, they tend to save more for retirement, and this increased saving puts downward pressure on interest rates.6\n\nDespite the fact that we’re living longer, labor force growth in the United States has actually slowed, largely due to baby boomers retiring and a lower fertility rate. In fact, the labor force is forecast to grow just ½ percent per year over the next decade, well below past trends.7 Fewer people joining the labor force means fewer people working, producing, and consuming things, which leads to slower growth and less investment, which in turn drives r-star down.\n\nThe same thing is true of productivity growth, which has also slowed compared with earlier decades.8 In the 1990s and early 2000s, the explosion of the internet and computing power led to annual productivity gains averaging 2 to 3 percent. Productivity gains since the recession have generally hovered around 1 percent. I have a sneaking suspicion it’s because we’re using all that technology to play Candy Crush, instead of increasing productivity! But I don’t have the data to back that up.\n\nIn all seriousness, productivity growth is influenced by technological innovation, which is notoriously hard to predict. In my home state of California, the world appears to be reinvented every week, but if we look at data from the OECD, there’s no indication that we can expect a leap in productivity growth on an international scale. While I can hope we’re on the brink of another game-changing invention like the internet, for the moment, the data indicate productivity growth is still stuck in low gear.\n\nThe third and final factor holding down r-star is the high global demand for safe assets we’ve seen develop over the past two decades. This has driven down the returns on Treasury securities and safe short-term loans relative to those on riskier assets like corporate bonds and equities, and thereby depressed r-star.9\n\nA positive outlook\n\nAll this doom and gloom caused by demographics, productivity growth, and the demand for safe assets may come as a surprise. We’re now in the second-longest expansion in U.S. history, and like most people I feel very positive about the economic outlook, here and abroad.\n\nU.S. GDP increased about 2.5 percent last year, the unemployment rate is the lowest we’ve seen in 18 years, and inflation is nearing the Fed’s 2 percent target.\n\nThe latest inflation data show that the drop in inflation we saw in 2017 was temporary. It is very reassuring to me, as I spent the latter part of last year making predictions that inflation would start to rise this year. And it’s always a relief when one of your predictions comes true!\n\nLooking ahead, I expect the expansion to continue, with growth averaging around 2.5 percent over this year and the next.\n\nThere are a few tailwinds that account for this solid economic performance. These include strong financial conditions, solid global growth, and the fiscal stimulus. In fact, the International Monetary Fund recently reported that global growth registered an impressive 3.8 percent in 2017, and they expect it to be near 4 percent this year and next.10\n\nThe optimism about r-star is (sadly) misplaced\n\nIt’s these strong tailwinds that are leading some people to believe that we’ll see r-star move back up. But, as I said, this optimism is, sadly, misplaced.\n\nIt’s time to return to our trio of demographics, productivity growth, and the global demand for safe assets.\n\nWhen it comes to demographics, the thing I hear discussed is that the baby boomer generation is a peculiarity that will slowly work its way out of the data. That’s a polite way of saying that, once my generation has retired, labor force growth will return to the speed of recent decades. But research by my colleagues at the San Francisco Fed reveals that our increased longevity and propensity to save are the key demographic drivers keeping r-star low, and they’re not about to reverse.11\n\nPeople living longer and saving more are two trends I would like to see continue! But they do both spell bad news for the fortunes of r-star.\n\nThe second thing I hear discussed is that there’s more cause for optimism around productivity growth because of the fiscal stimulus and, more specifically, the tax cuts. In principle, if businesses have a smaller tax burden, they’ll have a greater incentive to invest in capital equipment and research and development, which will drive productivity growth.\n\nAlthough I agree that lower tax rates on businesses should spur greater investment and productivity, the resulting effect on r-star is likely to be relatively modest. By my own calculations, we can expect the fiscal stimulus to increase r-star over the next decade by no more than 0.25 percentage point. This modest effect is in part because the tax cuts are front-loaded—that is, they have a larger effect on growth in the next few years than in later ones.12\n\nIn addition, it’s important to remember that r-star is affected by global economic conditions and not just those in the United States. A bump in U.S. growth improves global growth, but if other countries don’t follow suit, the effect on r-star will be relatively modest.\n\nThe third leading factor in terms of a rising r-star is the demand for safe assets. The theoretical argument that, with such strong economic conditions, we should see the appetite for riskier investments increase, pushing up interest rates overall, makes sense. But that’s not what’s played out in the data, at least so far.\n\nThese three issues—demographics, productivity growth, and the demand for safe assets—all point to an r-star that’s set to hold its position low in the sky for quite some time.\n\nMonetary policy\n\nIf you’re not as passionate as I am about r-star at this point, listen up, because things are about to get more interesting. I’m going to discuss what all this means for monetary policy and the path of interest rates.\n\nFollowing the global financial crisis, the Fed cut interest rates and kept them low to stimulate the economy and get it back on its feet. Now that the expansion is well under way, we’re in the process of normalizing monetary policy and bringing interest rates back up. Based on the center of the distribution of projections from our March meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee has indicated a total of three to four rate increases this year and further gradual rate increases over the next two years will be appropriate.13 I view this to be the right direction for monetary policy.\n\nAt our most recent meeting at the beginning of May we decided not to change the federal funds rate, consistent with our gradual pace of policy normalization.14\n\nBut even as we raise rates, I’m conscious that the fundamental drivers that govern r-star are lower than we’ve seen in the past. With a new normal for short-term rates of around 2½ percent, interest rates are likely to remain low relative to historical experience.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, it’s important to distinguish between the current strong economic conditions and the key longer-run drivers underpinning interest rates. I am always keeping a close eye on both the short-term economic outlook and the longer-term factors that define the more fundamental changes taking place. I don’t have a crystal ball, so it’s always the numbers that inform my opinion. For the moment, r-star continues to shine brightly, guiding monetary policy, but hold steady, low on the horizon.\n\nEnd notes\n\n1. Consistent with this definition, my discussion will focus on the longer-term r-star that will prevail over the next decade, in contrast to a shorter-run concept that may fluctuate from year to year depending on economic developments.\n\n2.

        "content": "Introduction\n\nIn 1997 I was invited to give my first big presentation on the economy to the San Francisco Federal Reserve Board of Directors. It was a great success and many people came up to congratulate me afterwards. One of the most senior leaders at the bank appeared, slapped me on the back (spilling my coffee everywhere), and said, “That was amazing—I didn’t expect that.” He followed with, “You’re such a little tiny woman, who knew?” I don’t think he recognized what he was implying, but I did, and others did too, but in keeping with the mood of day, we laughed it off.\n\nIn the two decades since that event, I’ve given lots more presentations in many more venues, but the comments are often the same: “Wow, you surprised me.”\n\nBut I am no longer just laughing it off; instead, I’m asking, why? I’m an established economist, running a sizable research department, so why the amazement when I do or say something good. Apparently, it’s because I’m female, and relatively small.\n\nBefore I go any further, I should note that these comments are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of the San Francisco Fed or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nToday, I’m going to talk about how we need a new approach to the diversity crisis facing economics. If we’re going to encourage people to study and build careers in the field that we all love, we need to go beyond building the pipeline and fundamentally change the culture. I’m going to share with you why that’s the right way forward and discuss some of the work we’ve been doing at the San Francisco Fed, and across the entire Federal Reserve system, to shift the narrative, and the numbers, around diversity.\n\nMy sincere hope is that together, we can change our profession, so that when a woman, or anyone who looks different, stands up to speak, people expect it to be good and appreciate it when it’s great.\n\nThe data\n\nIn some ways it’s not surprising that people are shocked when they see a female economist present. For too long the number of women and minorities in economics has been stagnant.\n\nIn 1997 when I gave that first presentation, 28% of doctorate degrees were awarded to women, and 7% to minorities. That number has barely shifted, and more recently 31% go to women and 8% to minorities. The lack of progress is even more disappointing when we compare economics with other disciplines: The number of doctorate degrees awarded to women in STEM has increased from 42% in 1997 to more than 55% according to the latest data.1\n\nI’m sure that many of you in this room are familiar with the research produced last year by Alice H. Wu, a woman studying at University of California, Berkeley.2 Her senior thesis, “Gender Stereotyping in Academia: Evidence from Economics Job Market Rumors Forum,” documented the different language used to describe male and female economists on their message boards. Vocabulary used to describe men was related to intellect and career paths; vocabulary used to describe women, on the other hand, referred to appearance and was sexualized and objectifying.\n\nThe importance of inclusion\n\nI was deeply disturbed when the research was released—there is a moment of shock when you read it. I took the women in my department out to lunch to discuss their reactions and what we needed to do to keep women interested in economics despite such egregious revelations.\n\nTheir responses surprised me. What they described was not the overt sexism or extreme behavior that can be found on econjobrumors,3 but more a death by a thousand cuts: unfounded assumptions about career interests, unsolicited comments about appearance and behavior, and a general indifference towards whether they pursued economics or not.\n\nTo give an example, one colleague told me that on her first day on campus at an Ivy League college, the computer science department had a huge banner inviting women to learn more about what they had to offer. The other STEM subjects all had women’s resource groups and professional organizations, but the economics department had nothing. In fact, when she went to the economics department to inquire, they gave her a list of classes and told her to come back when she was done—not the enthusiastic welcome she was hoping for.\n\nThis is hugely concerning because the bottom line is, we’re all competing for the same minds. If engineering and IT departments are putting out the welcome mat and we’re not, that’s going to mean less diverse economists moving into the job market.\n\nBut when it comes to conversations about diversity in economics, the welcome mat too often doesn’t seem to have a role. What I hear is a paradigm that says our culture is fine, we just need to get more women into the pipeline, and eventually we’ll get a more diverse profession overall. This is despite the fact that we’ve been trying this approach for decades and we’re not moving the needle. The data are screaming that what we’re doing isn’t working, and yet we plow on regardless!\n\nWe’ve set up mentoring programs, we’ve published newsletters, and we’ve condemned bad behavior, and yet, women and minorities are not choosing to pursue careers in economics. I believe it’s because we’re asking people to fit a mold that they’re not comfortable with, rather than creating a culture where they feel welcome. We’re missing the “inclusion” part of diversity and inclusion. We’re not putting out the welcome mat and truly inviting them into our home.\n\nA culture of antagonism\n\nFrom my own experience, I know how constricting the culture can be. For years I was told to look and behave a certain way, so that I fit the norm of what it means to be an economist: “Tone down your enthusiasm, be more aggressive in your comments, be the first to interrupt when someone else is speaking!”\n\nRecently, I read an interview with the Princeton economist, Dr. Anne Case, and she said that, unlike economics, in other disciplines “the tenor of the seminars tends to be a lot less about scoring points and…trying to nail the speaker to the blackboard.”4 Her words really struck a chord because, when I compare going to an economics seminar with, for example, going to a computer science seminar (which I’ve done), one is super aggressive, while the other is super supportive. Which do you think does a better job at advancing science?\n\nThere are fixes for this. For example, at the San Francisco Fed, we’ve instituted a five-minute rule so that, when someone’s presenting, no one’s allowed to interrupt them for the first five minutes. My colleagues at the Board of Governors hired an outside consultancy to teach them how to run “safer” meetings and policy discussions so that all voices can be heard. These sound like small things, but they make a big difference because they signal that we’re here to create rich debate, rather than torpedo each other’s ideas.\n\nRewriting the rules\n\nSo what else can we do to change the culture, and the numbers, when it comes to economics?\n\nI hesitate to hold up tech companies and other university departments as role models when it comes to diversity and inclusion, because books like Brotopia,5 activists like Ellen Pao, and the glaring pay gap in academia6 all tell us that there are serious problems in Silicon Valley and research institutions alike. But because they’re also facing a lack of diversity in their ranks, there are things we can learn from their efforts to create change. The welcome groups on campus, the social media campaigns like #IAmAnEngineer, and the boot camps for diverse coders are starting to chip away at the diversity problem in STEM.\n\nWhat I find promising is the holistic approach these organizations are taking. They don’t just focus on one aspect of the issue; they use marketing, networking groups, and organized meet and greets to telegraph their interest and reinforce the commitment to recruit and retain diverse talent.\n\nCultural change at the San Francisco Fed\n\nA few years ago we set about investigating why female candidates for research assistant were, year after year, turning down our job offers at the San Francisco Fed. We were faced with the uncomfortable reality that their impression of the department was one of an old boys’ club.\n\nWe decided to roll out a campaign to better inform faculty and students about the inclusive work culture and diverse opportunities we offer.7 We sent letters to hundreds of colleges and universities, letting them know we were committed to increasing the female and minority representation in our department. And then I called every person we made an offer to and talked to them about the job. In short, we put out the welcome mat in a big way. At the end of the hiring cycle, the gender balance of male to female research assistants went from 80–20 to 50–50.\n\nTruth be told, it wasn’t easy. When we committed to increasing diversity, we got the usual objections: Standards will fall, targets are constraining, I know a good research assistant when I see one, etc., etc. Stripping these objections away and changing how we hired forced us to take a long, hard look at our internal culture and processes.\n\nOf course recruitment is just half the battle. It’s equally important to keep the conversation going. Being vocal about diversity and inclusion in forums like this and on social media sends a message, internally and externally, that these issues are important to the San Francisco Fed and the Federal Reserve System as a whole. Making sure I listen to what my staff are saying in the wake of Wu’s research, or the explosion of the #MeToo movement, helps us fine-tune our approach to the culture we’re creating.\n\nFinally, the whole team needs to be on board and understand the importance of change. A junior male colleague recently pointed out to me that visiting scholars are almost always escorted to our floor by a female staff person. He thought it was odd and demeaning, so we created a schedule to make sure that jobs like picking someone up from the lobby didn’t automatically fall to the junior females. I was encouraged when he raised the issue because it signaled that the mind-set of inclusion is starting to spread beyond the senior leaders.\n\nWhen I think back to that first presentation I gave to the San Francisco Fed Board of Directors, more than 20 years ago, the really troubling thing is that I don’t remember how well I did or the praise I got from colleagues. I remember the comment about my gender, and I remember the fact that I didn’t question it. More importantly, I remember that none of the senior colleagues standing next to me questioned it either.\n\nWhen it comes to creating cultural change, and preventing death by a thousand cuts, we can’t ask our junior women to shoulder the burden, but it’s absolutely something we can ask of ourselves and our institutions. It’s incumbent on all of us to use our voices to create both a more diverse and a more inclusive profession.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo sum up, we know there has been egregious, damaging behavior that needs to be taken very seriously. But if we want economics to be more diverse, we need to put our focus on the inclusion piece, too. We need to imagine what cultural change looks like in our organizations, put the wheels in motion, and then communicate those changes to the outside world. That’s how we’ll change the story, and the statistics, about the career that we all love.\n\nEnd notes\n\n1. Bayer and Rouse (2016).\n\n2. Wu (2017).\n\n3. econjobrumors\n\n4. Clement (2017).\n\n5.

        "content": "President Williams presented similar remarks at the National Association for Business Economics (NABE)-Bank of Spain International Symposium in Madrid, Spain on April 17, 2018.\n\nIntroduction\n\nGood afternoon everyone, and thank you for the kind introduction. I’ve spent this year so far giving “good news” speeches; talking about the strong economy, the long expansion, and robust job growth. And with good reason: We’re in the third—in fact, very soon to be the second—longest economic expansion in American history. We added over two million jobs last year, the unemployment rate is the lowest it’s been since 2000,1 and inflation is closing in on our 2 percent target.\n\nThe San Francisco Bay Area is a leading example of the growth we’re seeing across the country. Many of the things that drive us crazy—bad traffic, sky-high housing costs, and sidewalks and streets blocked by construction—are signs of a robust economy. It’s easy to blame the gridlock on 101 on all the techies flooding the Bay Area. But it’s not just tech that’s powering the American economy—far from it. This healthy expansion is taking place nationwide and across the full range of sectors. And it’s part of a global trend of stronger-than-expected growth.\n\nToday, I will continue to accentuate the positive and highlight the reasons I expect the economy will continue to improve, reaching milestones that we haven’t seen in nearly 50 years. I’ll finish with my views on what this means for monetary policy and how we can keep this economy, strong, resilient, and growing at a steady pace.\n\nBefore I go any further, it would be best to give the usual Fed disclaimer that the views I express are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhat drives sustainable growth?\n\nLast year real gross domestic product, or GDP, increased 2.6 percent. This is a solid performance. Importantly, it’s above the trend growth rate, which I peg at about 1¾ percent.\n\nI’m often asked what the trend growth rate is and how it differs from GDP growth. The trend growth rate is the rate of growth that can be sustained by the economy over the long term. It has two main drivers: labor force growth and productivity growth. With more people working, making things and using their income to buy things, the more we can produce. Equally, if innovations in technology mean that companies can make more state-of-the-art microprocessors in an hour than they could before, that will also contribute to higher sustainable growth.\n\nAn important development of the past decade is that the trend growth rate today appears to be considerably slower than the growth trends we’ve previously seen in our lifetimes. This slower pace of growth is a reflection of a sharp decline in labor force growth and relatively slow productivity growth.2\n\nWhat’s behind the decline in labor force growth? Two main things: First, the baby boomers are retiring in droves, and second, the fertility rate in the United States has declined to a low level.3\n\nAnd despite the rampant innovations we’re seeing around us, especially in the Bay Area—robots delivering take-out, driverless cars, and Alexa in every living room—these aren’t yet translating into rapid gains in productivity growth. To give some context, in the 1990s and early 2000s, annual productivity gains in the United States averaged 2 to 3 percent. By contrast, productivity gains over the past decade have averaged only about 1 percent per year.\n\nLooking ahead, I expect growth to average around 2.5 percent over this year and next. Strong financial conditions, better-than-expected global growth, and fiscal stimulus of lower taxes and higher spending have all created tailwinds that account for growth running above trend.\n\nGrowth above trend doesn’t necessarily pose a particular risk at this time. But it’s one of the factors I’m assessing when I’m thinking about how to best support economic growth over the medium term. In that regard, a question I’m frequently hearing as the expansion closes in on nine years is: are we “due” for a recession?\n\nThe short answer is no. Recessions don’t happen because a timer goes off. Research shows that the odds of going into a recession are the same whether you’re in the seventh, eighth, or ninth year of the expansion.4 Instead, recessions generally happen because of some big event: the housing crash of a decade ago or the bursting of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s. These kinds of events are notoriously hard to predict, and the recessions that often follow don’t happen because the business cycle has a time limit on it.\n\nGiven that the current pace of growth is above trend, my view is that we need to continue on the path of raising interest rates. This will keep things on an even footing and reduce the risk of us getting to a point where the economy could overheat, and create problems that could end badly.\n\nObviously, growth figures are the ones that many people are focused on. But as President of the San Francisco Fed and a voting member on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), I’m judged on what happens to employment and inflation. The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability, so my day job is about understanding what’s going on with those figures and then making appropriate monetary policy recommendations.\n\nEmployment\n\nWhen it comes to the maximum employment goal, we have made enormous strides and I see the labor market continuing to improve. We added about 2.2 million jobs in 2017. That’s about twice the number needed to keep pace with normal labor force growth.5 Based on the data we’ve seen recently, we are set to add even more jobs to the economy this year.\n\nWith jobs growth being so robust, the unemployment rate has moved down to around 4 percent. Based on my forecast for the economy, I expect the unemployment rate to continue to edge down to 3-1/2 percent by next year. That would be the lowest rate of unemployment recorded in the United States since 1969. What’s happening in the nation as a whole is also happening here in California, where the unemployment rate is already the lowest since 1969.\n\nThese low unemployment numbers have many people asking why we’re not seeing greater wage growth, but that number actually has been slowly ratcheting up. And this is consistent with the reports I’ve been hearing from business leaders for a while. As talent becomes increasingly scarce, they’re offering higher wages in a bid to compete for employees. I expect this to intensify as the competition for workers gathers steam.\n\nInflation\n\nWage growth is the perfect segue to discuss inflation. Six years ago, the FOMC set itself the goal of 2 percent inflation. Admittedly, since then, inflation has been running below that mark most of the time. This underrun of our target reflects a number of influences. These include the weak economy following the recession, a strong dollar that reduced the costs of imported goods and services, and some special factors that had a temporary effect on prices in certain categories.\n\nInflation undershooting its target by a few tenths of a percentage point probably doesn’t sound that concerning to most people. In fact, historically, high and rising inflation has acted as an alarm bell to warn that the economy is on an unsustainable footing. But inflation that’s too low also poses a risk. Very low inflation raises the possibility of deflation—that is, falling prices—which carries with it its own set of problems for the economy. That’s why, as a policymaker, I’m keeping such a close eye on the behavior of inflation, even when the economy is performing so well.\n\nThe good news is for most of the past year, inflation has been running closer to 2 percent.6 With the economy strong, and strengthening further, I expect that we’ll see inflation reach and actually slightly exceed our longer-run 2 percent goal for the next few years.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\n\n\nI began by describing a very positive economic outlook of strong growth, low and falling unemployment, and inflation that is closing in on our 2 percent long-run goal. Against this background, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point at our most recent meeting.7\n\nWe also indicated that we expect further gradual interest rate increases to be appropriate. In particular, our recent projections indicate that the center of the distribution of FOMC projections foresees a total of three to four rate increases this year and further gradual rate increases over the next two years, bringing the target federal funds rate to around 3-1/2 percent by the end of 2020.8 In my view, this is the right direction for monetary policy.\n\nWe are certainly not “due” for a recession, but it’s equally important we keep growth on a sustainable footing to keep the strong economy going as long as possible. This gradual process of removing the monetary stimulus put in during the recession is designed to keep the healthy expansion on track, maintain inflation near our 2 percent goal, and to minimize the risk that the economy could overheat down the road.\n\nNote that the rate increases we have put in place so far have not stalled the economy. In fact, the economy continues to steam ahead. For that reason, I am confident that we can carry on the process of gradually moving interest rates up over the next two years while seeing solid growth and historically low rates of unemployment.\n\nThat’s our plan. Of course, even the best-laid plans can go awry when the unexpected happens. Therefore, my approach is to always follow the data very carefully and adjust my recommendations accordingly. If actual growth is paltry, or if there are signs of an economy that’s overheating and inflationary pressures are building too fast, then I’ll reevaluate my position and advocate for adjusting the path of rates accordingly.\n\nTo sum up: the outlook is very positive. The economy is on course to be as strong as we have seen in many decades and inflation is moving closer to our target. The challenge for monetary policy is to keep it that way. This is never an easy task, but we are well positioned to achieve our goals, and to respond to any unexpected twists and turns that may lie in the economic road ahead.\n\nThank you.

        "content": "Introduction\n\nThank you for the kind introduction. It’s wonderful to be here in such beautiful surroundings. I always enjoy coming to Phoenix; the person who inspired me to pursue a career in economics lives here, and he’s also the reason I’m standing in front of you today. He said it’s important to do economics, but it’s even more important to share economics to advance a productive and vibrant society, and that’s what I hope to do with this talk.\n\nNow, before I get too far along with the sharing, let me say that my remarks are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nToday I’m going to talk about economic growth past, present, and future and shed some light on the factors holding back the pace at which we are likely to expand going forward. I’m also going to highlight some ways in which we can alter that path and achieve greater prosperity.\n\nCurrent economic conditions\n\nBefore I consider the future or even the past, I want to give you an overview of the economy’s current performance, and it’s good news: We’re in the third (soon to be the second) longest expansion in history. The labor market is booming, consumer and business spending are solid, and all the other key economic indicators are flashing green. An added boost is coming from a number of tailwinds, including supportive financial conditions, strong global growth, and the recent fiscal stimulus.\n\nThe national picture is reflected here in Arizona. If the airport is any indication things are good, especially in Phoenix. And as a whole, Arizona is adding jobs at a rapid clip, unemployment is low, and the housing market, so negatively affected in the aftermath of the financial crisis, is getting its legs back.\n\nSo overall, the U.S. economy is in good shape and the prospects are bright. We expect ongoing solid growth in coming years, with further tightening in labor markets and a gradual return of inflation to 2 percent. With the economy doing so well, it’s a good time to ask, what is the sustainable speed limit going forward?\n\nAverage GDP growth over the 60 years preceding the Great Recession, was just under 3.5 percent. But if we look ahead, economists forecast numbers closer to 2 percent. The economic pie is going to grow at nearly half the speed we’re used to. In the remainder of my time, I want to take a step back and talk about why growth is forecast to be slower than what we’ve seen in previous expansions and what we might do about it. The data reveal answers that may be surprising, but nonetheless they are ones we must contend with if we are to create a more prosperous future.\n\nDrags on future growth\n\nSo how did we go from an economy with a speed limit of 3.5 percent to one bridled by a number closer to 2 percent? Many potential candidates make the news: excessive regulation, taxes, lack of competitiveness, etc. And all of those play some role in shaping our future. But in the end, none of them can really account for the dramatic change in prospects we see. To explain that, we need to look at the fundamental drivers of economic growth: growth in productivity and the labor force.\n\nAnd here, the data tell the story. The chart shows the contributions to GDP growth from 1950 to 2025. The data come from the Congressional Budget Office1, the organization responsible for supporting policymakers in budgeting. The dark blue sections of the bars represent potential labor force growth and the light blue sections represent potential productivity growth. What this shows us is that productivity growth has varied over time, but since the 1980s has contributed on average about 1.5 percent to growth and is forecast to do the same going forward.\n\nSlow labor force growth hinders GDP growth\n\n\n\nThe pattern for labor force growth is quite a bit different. In the 1970s, labor force growth alone contributed 2.7 percentage points to GDP growth, meaning that even if productivity growth had been zero, the economy would have expanded at 2.7 percent, slightly faster than the pace of our current expansion. Since that peak, labor force growth has come down substantially. As the forecast for 2025 shows, labor force growth is expected to remain stuck at 0.5 percent for the next decade. This means that, absent a surge in productivity, slow growth in the labor force will be a restraining factor on the U.S. economic speed limit.\n\nWhere have the American workers gone?\n\nWhere have all the workers gone? Demographics play a big role in labor force growth, and at the moment many baby boomers are heading off for retirement. At the same time, the fertility rate has slowed: Put simply, people are having fewer babies. Together, these two factors explain a large share of the changes in labor force growth displayed in the graph. Notably, the United States is not unique in these respects. Population aging is a global phenomenon, and many industrialized nations have seen their birth rates fall.\n\nBut these trends don’t explain everything. We’ve also seen a drop in the level of labor force participation among workers in their prime employment years, a pattern that does look quite a bit different from other countries.\n\nU.S. labor participation rate declining\n\n\n\nLabor force participation in the United States for prime-age workers reached a peak in the late 1990s and then took a steep dive in the 2001 recession. In the 2007 recession, it took an even steeper tumble, reaching a low point in 2015, nearly eight years after the initial downturn. While we have seen improvements since, they have been modest. So today, the share of men and women in their prime working years who are employed or actively searching for a job is far lower than it was in the 1990s.\n\nWhat’s really interesting in these data is that, unlike the trends for retirement and fertility, this one is unique to the United States. We don’t see the same thing happening in other advanced economies.\n\nThis chart compares the percentage of prime-age workers in the labor force in Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In these other advanced economies, labor force participation of prime-age workers has increased overall and now stands far—several percentage points—above the rates observed in the United States.\n\nU.S. diverging from international trends\n\n\n\nWhich raises the question—why aren’t American workers working?\n\nThe answer is not simple, and numerous factors have been offered to explain the decline in labor force participation. Research by a colleague from the San Francisco Fed and others suggests that some of the drop owes to wealthier families choosing to have only one person engaging in the paid labor market.2 And I emphasize paid here, since the other adult is often staying at home to care for house or children, invest in the community, or pursue education. Whatever the alternative activity, some of the lost labor market participation seems related to having the financial ability to make work–life balance choices.\n\nAnother factor behind the decline is ongoing job polarization that favors workers at the high and low ends of the skill distribution but not those in the middle. I know for myself, I never call a travel agent anymore. With a few taps and swipes on my phone, I can book a trip to almost anywhere in the world in seconds. But it goes far beyond that: Our economy is automating thousands of jobs in the middle-skill range, from call center workers, to paralegals, to grocery checkers.\n\nA growing body of research finds that these pressures on middle-skilled jobs leaves a big swath of workers on the sidelines, wanting work but not having the skills to keep pace with the ever-changing economy.3\n\nThe final and perhaps most critical issue I want to highlight also relates to skills: We’re not adequately preparing a large fraction of our young people for the jobs of the future. Like in most advanced economies, job creation in the United States is being tilted toward jobs that require a college degree.4 Even if high school-educated workers can find jobs today, their future job security is in jeopardy. Indeed by 2020, for the first time in our history, more jobs will require a bachelor’s degree than a high school diploma.5\n\nThese statistics contrast with the trends for college completion. Although the share of young people with four-year college degrees is rising, in 2016 only 37 percent of 25- to 29-year-olds had a college diploma.6 This falls short of the progress in many of our international competitors,7 but also means that many of our young people are underprepared for the jobs in our economy.\n\nSo where should we focus our efforts when it comes to getting more young people into college? One place to start is in working to equalize educational attainment across students of different races and ethnicities.\n\nAs the slide shows, the lion’s share of young Americans of Asian descent complete a four-year college degree. A smaller but still sizable share of white Americans, about 45 percent, also get a degree. The numbers drop off dramatically from there. Less than 25 percent of black and Hispanic young people go on to complete a college diploma.8 This is troubling from an equal opportunities perspective, but it’s also incredibly bad news for the economy, both today and certainly in the future. Our population is growing increasingly diverse: By 2024, just short of 40 percent of our labor force will be ethnicities other than white and Asian.9\n\nRoom to grow\n\n\n\nGiven the important role that education plays in labor force participation, employment, and wages, equalizing the educational attainment across these groups has big benefits for the economy.\n\nFaster growth through human capital\n\nThe really good news is that education is generally a win–win, beneficial to individuals and to taxpayers. We know that those with a college degree are much more likely to become top earners during their career, regardless of their financial background.10 They have lower unemployment rates, and they’re less likely to become unemployed during a recession. And while there’s no doubt the cost of college is a strain for many, the average time it takes to recoup that cost is 10 years.11 This means that, relative to many other investments, education pencils out, even if graduates don’t go on to earn top salaries.\n\nFor taxpayers the math is even more straightforward. A detailed study by the OECD shows that college is a great investment for taxpayers.12 The costs paid to educate are more than covered by increased productivity, longer and more stable work lives, and higher tax revenues from graduates.\n\nIn the parlance of economics, education is incentive compatible, good for everyone involved.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo wrap up, the U.S. is facing a future of slow growth, a “new normal.” But it doesn’t have to be that way. The United States has considerable room to run in actively engaging working age people in the labor market. Investing on this front is a lever we can pull that changes the fundamentals of economic growth and gives us an opportunity to raise the speed limit.\n\nEnd notes\n\n1.

        "content": "President Williams presented similar remarks to the Financial Women of San Francisco on February 2, 2018 and at Town Hall Los Angeles on February 23, 2018.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAloha… and thank you for the kind introduction.\n\nOne of the best things about speaking in Hawaii is that when I come here I can wear my Hawaiian shirts. They are much more comfortable than my usual business attire and I always promise myself that I’ll start wearing them more often when I’m back in San Francisco. Of course, I get back to San Francisco and realize that it’s a terrible plan because we just don’t have the weather for year-round short sleeves! I suppose it gives me an excuse (as if I needed one) to come back more often.\n\nI’m very happy to be able to kick off today’s speech with positive news about the economy. The expansion is now in its ninth year, the stock market is at near record levels, and all the key economic indicators are headed in the right direction.\n\nHawaii is a strong example of the growth we’re seeing across the country. Visitor numbers are up, and people are spending more, which is great for the local economy.1 But I know it can also create serious headaches like astronomical home prices, terrible traffic, and tourists stealing your parking place. Trust me—we feel your pain on these issues in San Francisco too. I’ve spent too many hours of my life on a bus stuck in traffic on the Bay Bridge.\n\nThe good news about this expansion is that it’s taking place nationwide and across the full range of sectors. Consumer spending, manufacturing activity, and construction are all showing strong numbers. And it’s part of a global trend of stronger-than-expected growth. Both Europe and Japan have seen a significant acceleration in GDP growth. The International Monetary Fund expects global growth in 2017 will register an impressive 3.7 percent when the final numbers are in.2\n\nWith so much momentum, you’d think people would be happy. But no, instead I’m coming across a lot of anxiety about how the Fed’s going to respond to such buoyancy. There’s a concern that we’re either behind the curve or going to have a knee-jerk reaction to all this positivity when it comes to monetary policy.\n\nI was amused to see that, in a Bloomberg article titled “5 Things to Fear in a Strong Global Economy,” the most terrifying thing was the possibility of a Fed overreaction!3\n\nSo today I’m going to look at the key economic indicators: growth, employment, and the enigma that is low inflation. I’m going to discuss the evidence, show what’s driving the numbers, and assess whether the economy really has shifted into a higher gear. Finally, I’m going to talk about my own view on appropriate monetary policy.\n\nI think now is the perfect time to give the usual Fed disclaimer that the views I express are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nGrowth\n\nI’ve already talked a bit about growth, but there are two questions I want to address now: First, with all the positivity, is the economy taking off far more than expected? And second, given that we’re in the third-longest (soon to be the second-longest) expansion in history, are we at risk of recession? Will the expansion die of old age?\n\nThe answers to both these questions lie in the data. Growth in 2017 came in at 2.5 percent. This is a solid performance. Indeed, it’s above the trend growth rate, which I peg at about 1¾ percent. The trend growth rate is the rate of growth that can be sustained over the long term, and it’s determined by economic fundamentals like demographics and productivity growth.\n\nI expect the same this year, with growth again coming in at 2.5 percent. Strong financial conditions, better-than-expected global growth, and the tax cuts have all created tailwinds that can account for the healthy pace of growth. Because of these tailwinds I have boosted my growth forecasts for this year, but I don’t see an economy that’s fundamentally shifted gear.\n\nTurning to the second question: Will the expansion die of old age? The short answer is no. Recessions don’t happen because a timer goes off.4 Recessions generally happen because of unanticipated shocks: The global financial crisis of 2008 was caused by the subprime mortgage crisis, the recession of the early 2000s was caused by the dot-com bubble, and the recession of the early 1990s was triggered by the sharp rise in oil prices.\n\nThese kinds of shocks are notoriously hard to predict, but they happen for a reason, not because the business cycle has a time limit on it. Given that the pace of growth is somewhat above trend, my view is that we need to continue on the path of raising interest rates. This will keep the economy on an even footing and reduce the risk of us getting to a point where things could overheat.\n\nObviously, growth figures are the ones the media are most focused on. But as President of the San Francisco Fed and a voting member on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), I’m judged on what happens to employment and inflation. The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability, so my day job is about understanding what’s going on with those figures and then making appropriate monetary policy recommendations.\n\nEmployment\n\nWhen it comes to the Federal Reserve’s report card on employment, I think it’s more than fair that we give ourselves an A grade. We added over two million jobs in 2017, about twice the number needed to keep pace with normal labor force growth.5 The unemployment rate in the United States is 4.1 percent. Hawaii wins the prize for the state with the lowest unemployment rate in the country, at just 2 percent.\n\nThe last time national unemployment dropped so low was in the year 2000, and Hawaii’s rate is the lowest on record, going back to the mid-70s. These low unemployment numbers have many people asking why we’re not seeing greater wage growth, but that number actually has been slowly ratcheting up.\n\nThis is consistent with the reports I’ve been hearing from business leaders for a while. As talent becomes increasingly scarce, they’re offering higher wages in a bid to compete for employees. I expect this to intensify as the labor market heats up further.\n\nInflation\n\nSuch economic optimism, coupled with low unemployment, normally would be associated with rising inflation. But I’m afraid our report card here is not so glowing. The Fed has set itself a goal of 2 percent inflation, a target we have missed more often than not. I spent much of 2017 talking about the enigma of low inflation, why it’s occurred, and my expectations for the future. Of course most normal people are very pleased with a strong economy, plentiful jobs, and stable prices. But economists are not so easily satisfied!\n\nOne of the fundamentals of economics is the Phillips curve, which describes the relationship between unemployment and inflation. If the Phillips curve is right, when unemployment falls, inflation should rise. Because when unemployment falls, wages go up, which pushes up business costs and should increase consumer demand and, in turn, raise prices. Last year’s paltry inflation figures have led many economic commentators to pose the question: Is the Phillips curve dead?\n\nBased on the research of my colleagues at the Fed, the Phillips curve still holds true.6\n\nI have two main reasons for my confidence. First, last year we saw a number of transitory factors holding down inflation. These included price drops for pharmaceuticals, airline tickets, and cell phone services. An even bigger contribution to low inflation came from the health-care sector, where mandated cuts to Medicare payment growth muted price rises for health-care services. These factors are slowly disappearing from the data. Second, it always takes a while for the effects of low unemployment and a strong economy to translate into higher inflation, with a common delay of about 12 months.\n\nThe recent price data have been encouraging in this regard, and I expect that we’ll continue to see inflation pick up this year and the next. Fear not, the Phillips curve is alive and will soon be kicking!\n\nMonetary policy\n\nI began by describing a very positive economic outlook of strong growth, low unemployment, and inflation that looks like it’s finally headed in the direction Fed economists have been hoping for. But despite all this optimism, there’s anxiety about how the Federal Reserve is going to react. Will we raise rates too rapidly? Or will we raise rates too slowly because we fail to spot a financial bubble? Both scenarios could knock the expansion off track, and that’s the last thing I want to see happen.\n\nI am optimistic about the economy, but I expect continued moderate growth, with no Herculean leap forward. So given that the economy’s performing almost exactly as expected, you can expect policymakers to do the same.\n\nAnd how should you know what to expect? In the aftermath of the financial crisis the FOMC started issuing clearer guidance about future policy, indicating how policymakers plan to manage interest rates based on the latest data and projections. Last year the Committee signaled the likelihood of further gradual rate increases in 2018, and, as I said earlier, my own view is we should stick to that plan.7 It will keep the expansion on track, prevent the economy from exceeding its potential by too much, and get interest rates back up closer to more normal levels.\n\nPolicymaking is, by its very nature, a long game. The full effects of a change the FOMC makes today are unlikely to be felt for two years: A knee-jerk reaction would have far-reaching consequences, and my FOMC colleagues and I are well aware of that. My approach is to always follow the data very carefully and then adjust my recommendations accordingly.\n\nAnd of course, this is where I give a caveat for everything I’ve said so far by underlining my focus on the data. If actual growth is paltry, or if there are signs of an economy that’s growing at an unsustainable rate, or if inflationary pressures are building too fast, then I’ll reevaluate my position and advocate for adjusting the path of rates accordingly. But at the moment, while I’m buoyed by the optimism, I don’t see an economy at risk of shifting into overdrive.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the outlook is positive: The expansion is proceeding at a good pace, unemployment is low, and inflation is finally headed in the right direction again. Even if most people don’t want higher prices, it’s a great relief to me that the Phillips curve isn’t broken.\n\nBut while the outlook is positive, it’s not so strong that it’s driving a sea change in my position. For the moment, I don’t see signs of an economy going into overdrive or a bubble about to burst, so I have not adjusted my views of appropriate monetary policy. So my message to those concerned about a knee-jerk reaction from the Fed is that, as always, we’ll keep our focus on the dual mandate and let the data guide our decisions.\n\nMahalo.

        "content": "Introduction\n\nThank you for the kind introduction. It’s wonderful to be here in such beautiful surroundings. When I speak to an audience that spends their professional lives thinking about finance, business, and the economy, I always look forward to the questions, so I’ll keep my prepared remarks relatively brief.\n\nThis is one of my first public speaking engagements of 2018, and I’m very happy to be able to kick off with positive news about the economy. The expansion is now in its ninth year, the stock market is at record levels, and all the key economic indicators are headed in the right direction.\n\nSan Francisco is a leading example of the growth we’re seeing across the country. Many of the things that drive us crazy about this city—bad traffic, sky-high rents, and sidewalks blocked by construction—are signs of a strong economy. Of course, I blame the gridlock on 101 on all the techies flooding the Bay Area. But it’s not just tech that’s powering the American economy—far from it.\n\nThe really good news about this expansion is that it’s taking place nationwide and across the full range of sectors. Consumer spending, manufacturing activity, and construction are all showing strong numbers. And it’s part of a global trend of stronger-than-expected growth. Both Europe and Japan have seen a significant acceleration in GDP growth. The International Monetary Fund expects global growth in 2017 will register an impressive 3.7 percent when the final numbers are in.1\n\nWith so much momentum, you’d think people would be happy. But no, instead I’m coming across a lot of anxiety about how the Fed’s going to respond to such buoyancy. There’s a concern that we’re either behind the curve or going to have a knee-jerk reaction to all this positivity when it comes to monetary policy.\n\nI was amused to see that, in a Bloomberg article titled “5 Things to Fear in a Strong Global Economy,” the most terrifying thing was the possibility of a Fed overreaction!2\n\nSo today I’m going to look at the key economic indicators: growth, employment, and the enigma that is low inflation. I’m going to discuss the evidence, show what’s driving the numbers, and assess whether the economy really has shifted into a higher gear. Finally, I’m going to talk about my own view on appropriate monetary policy.\n\nI think now is the perfect time to give the usual Fed disclaimer that the views I express are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nGrowth\n\nI’ve already talked a bit about growth, but there are two questions I want to address now: First, with all the positivity, is the economy taking off far more than expected? And second, given that we’re in the third-longest (soon to be the second-longest) expansion in history, are we at risk of recession? Will the expansion die of old age?\n\nThe answers to both these questions lie in the data. Growth in 2017 came in at 2.5 percent. This is a solid performance. Indeed, it’s above the trend growth rate, which I peg at about 1¾ percent. The trend growth rate is the rate of growth that can be sustained over the long term, and it’s determined by economic fundamentals like demographics and productivity growth.\n\nI expect the same this year, with growth again coming in at 2.5 percent. Strong financial conditions, better-than-expected global growth, and the tax cuts have all created tailwinds that can account for the healthy pace of growth. Because of these tailwinds I have boosted my growth forecasts for this year, but I don’t see an economy that’s fundamentally shifted gear.\n\nTurning to the second question: Will the expansion die of old age? The short answer is no. Recessions don’t happen because a timer goes off.3 Recessions generally happen because of unanticipated shocks: The global financial crisis of 2008 was caused by the subprime mortgage crisis, the recession of the early 2000s was caused by the dot-com bubble, and the recession of the early 1990s was triggered by the sharp rise in oil prices.\n\nThese kinds of shocks are notoriously hard to predict, but they happen for a reason, not because the business cycle has a time limit on it. Given that the pace of growth is somewhat above trend, my view is that we need to continue on the path of raising interest rates. This will keep the economy on an even footing and reduce the risk of us getting to a point where things could overheat.\n\nObviously, growth figures are the ones the media are most focused on. But as President of the San Francisco Fed and a voting member on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), I’m judged on what happens to employment and inflation. The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability, so my day job is about understanding what’s going on with those figures and then making appropriate monetary policy recommendations.\n\nEmployment\n\nWhen it comes to the Federal Reserve’s report card on employment, I think it’s more than fair that we give ourselves an A grade. We added over two million jobs in 2017, about twice the number needed to keep pace with normal labor force growth.4 During the final three months of 2017, unemployment was an unusually low 4.1 percent.5 The last time we saw unemployment this low was in the year 2000. These low unemployment numbers have many people asking why we’re not seeing greater wage growth, but that number actually has been slowly ratcheting up.\n\nThis is consistent with the reports I’ve been hearing from business leaders for a while. As talent becomes increasingly scarce, they’re offering higher wages in a bid to compete for employees. I expect this to intensify as the labor market heats up further.\n\nInflation\n\nSuch economic optimism, coupled with low unemployment, normally would be associated with rising inflation. But I’m afraid our report card here is not so glowing. The Fed has set itself a goal of 2 percent inflation, a target we have missed more often than not. I spent much of 2017 talking about the enigma of low inflation, why it’s occurred, and my expectations for the future. Of course most normal people are very pleased with a strong economy, plentiful jobs, and stable prices. But economists are not so easily satisfied!\n\nOne of the fundamentals of economics is the Phillips curve, which describes the relationship between unemployment and inflation. If the Phillips curve is right, when unemployment falls, inflation should rise. Because when unemployment falls, wages go up, which pushes up business costs and should increase consumer demand and, in turn, raise prices. Last year’s paltry inflation figures have led many economic commentators to pose the question: Is the Phillips curve dead?\n\nBased on the research of my colleagues at the Fed, the Phillips curve still holds true.6\n\nI have two main reasons for my confidence. First, last year we saw a number of transitory factors holding down inflation. These included price drops for pharmaceuticals, airline tickets, and cell phone services. An even bigger contribution to low inflation came from the health-care sector, where mandated cuts to Medicare payment growth muted price rises for health-care services. These factors are slowly disappearing from the data. Second, it always takes a while for the effects of low unemployment and a strong economy to translate into higher inflation, with a common delay of about 12 months.\n\nThe recent price data have been encouraging in this regard, and I expect that we’ll continue to see inflation pick up this year and the next. Fear not, the Phillips curve is alive and will soon be kicking!\n\nMonetary policy\n\nI began by describing a very positive economic outlook of strong growth, low unemployment, and inflation that looks like it’s finally headed in the direction Fed economists have been hoping for. But despite all this optimism, there’s anxiety about how the Federal Reserve is going to react. Will we raise rates too rapidly? Or will we raise rates too slowly because we fail to spot a financial bubble?
