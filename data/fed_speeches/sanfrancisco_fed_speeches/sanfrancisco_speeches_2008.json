        "content": "\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for inviting me to speak to you today. This conference on “The Mortgage Meltdown, the Economy, and Public Policy” could not be more timely. The mortgage meltdown is far from over, the economy and financial markets are still reeling from it, and policymakers have responded by taking some of the most momentous steps in decades. Today I’d like to consider these developments from my perspective at the Federal Reserve. I know you also will be hearing from Chairman Bernanke later in the conference. As always, these are my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n \nMy aim is to help tee up the other sessions in the conference by providing a look at the current interactions between mortgage markets, financial markets more generally, financial institutions, and macroeconomic performance. In brief, if anyone ever needed a demonstration of the strength of the links between the functioning of the financial system and the functioning of the economy, this is it. The downturn in housing construction directly weakened economic activity, while the drop in house prices precipitated a genuine crisis in financial markets, which has generated a severe credit crunch. The credit crunch, in turn, has left households and firms with fewer resources to finance spending, and as a result, output growth has weakened further and unemployment has risen. And, of course, weak output growth and higher unemployment undermine households and the housing sector, which worsens the credit crunch, which saps spending, and the adverse feedback loop goes on.\n\nThe Fed has responded both by easing the stance of monetary policy—including the 50 basis point cut earlier this week—and by supporting financial stability through enhancing market liquidity. I believe that these actions have been helpful. But, the enormity of this crisis required more. In particular, the passage earlier this month of The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 made possible an infusion of capital into the financial sector, a crucial step in breaking the momentum of the adverse feedback loop.\n\nAnother approach to resolving the crisis involves addressing the problems plaguing the housing market directly, through increased aid to distressed homeowners to mitigate foreclosures or through broad-based incentives to boost the demand for housing. Such policies deserve consideration because they go to the heart of the problem, the fallout from the boom and bust in the housing market, and that is what I will turn to next.\n\nHousing\n\nThe bust in the housing markets has, of course, been hitting the economy for some time.  Although residential investment accounts for only a small share of overall economic activity, its decline over the past three years has been a major drag on real GDP growth.  During this period, housing starts have plummeted and are down by over 30 percent just in the past year. Yet inventories of unsold new and existing homes remain at very high levels, especially relative to sales, making it difficult to predict with any confidence when starts will bottom out.\n  \nIndeed, the possibility of ongoing contraction in this sector is intensified by the interplay of the economic downturn and the credit crunch. Understandably, financial institutions have tightened lending terms, making it more difficult to qualify for a mortgage by requiring higher down payments, higher income-to-payment ratios, and higher FICO scores. Moreover, private-label securitized markets for residential mortgages are essentially closed for business. The only remaining sources of mortgage securitization are the government-sponsored enterprises, especially Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which provide backing mainly for conventional conforming mortgages. For higher risk borrowers, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is close to the only game in town.\n\nAlong with the decline in construction, house prices have fallen by around 15 to 20 percent from their peak, depending on which measure you use.  Unfortunately, this is another case where the bottom is not yet in sight. First, the ratio of house prices to rents still remains high by historical standards, suggesting that further price declines are needed to bring housing markets into long-run balance. Second, the large inventories of unsold homes I mentioned—a growing share of which are foreclosures—also can be expected to continue to put downward pressure on prices. In view of these factors, it’s not surprising that futures contracts for house prices developed by Chip Case and Bob Shiller predict further declines. They may have more to say about this later in this conference.\n\nThe Mortgage Meltdown\n\nThe decline in house prices appears to be the crucial “falling domino” that set off the chain of distress that now plagues financial markets and the economy. Problems first appeared with the growing delinquencies and foreclosures in the subprime mortgage market. Currently, more than 20 percent of them are seriously delinquent2 or in foreclosure. Real trouble spots include parts of Nevada, Florida, and Ohio, and here in California, the highest delinquency rates are in the Central Valley—with Merced and Stockton as leading examples.\n\nAs many of you know, the Fed has embarked on a number of studies relating to the subprime mortgage market.  In fact, two colleagues of mine who are prominently involved—Paul Willen of the Boston Fed and John Krainer of the San Francisco Fed—are on the program for this conference. The research they and others have done on the variation in subprime delinquency rates across regions and over time confirms that the riskiness of the borrower pools and the quality of the underwriting standards help to explain the incidence of subprime delinquencies. However, the single best predictor of the level and change in these delinquency rates is the pace of house price increases or decreases. In fact, the research suggests that differences in house-price changes account for much of the regional differences in delinquency rates, whether borrowers are prime or nonprime, or whether loans have fixed or variable rates.3\n\nIt is not hard to see why falling house prices matter so much.  The amount of equity in a home affects the ability or willingness of homeowners to keep current on their mortgage payments when they face personal setbacks, such as illness, divorce, or the loss of a job.  In a market in which house prices have been declining, a borrower with a recent mortgage secured with little or no down payment does not have the flexibility to tap into the equity in the house to weather these problems or may be unable to refinance or sell the house for enough to cover the outstanding mortgage balance. Moreover, in states like California, where a primary residence represents no-recourse collateral for many mortgages, some borrowers who may be able to afford their loans may nevertheless be unwilling to make the payments if house prices are expected to remain low or to decline. I would note, however, that historically many homeowners with under-water mortgages have not ended up in foreclosure.\n   \nAn additional factor that intensified the effect of house price declines on subprime delinquencies is that many of those loans were designed to be bridge loans. For example, so-called 2-28 loans were set up at fairly high initial mortgage rates for borrowers with low FICO scores. If such a borrower made the payments, and if the price of the house rose as expected, the borrower would be able to refinance, presumably at a lower rate, in two years.  However, once it became apparent that house prices were falling and, therefore, that the refinancing opportunity was lost, many of these loans went into default even before the initial two-year period expired.\n\nSo far, I’ve focused on problems with subprime mortgages.  But more recently, the problems have spread:  the number of serious delinquencies on alt-A loans and even adjustable-rate prime mortgages, is now on the rise. In addition, foreclosures on the 2007 vintages of mortgages are rising at about the same rate as those of earlier vintages. This is sobering, because many of the loans in these later vintages—especially those issued in the second half of 2007—benefited from the tighter underwriting standards put in place once the crisis hit.  Most likely, then, the rising foreclosures are related not just to falling house prices, but also to the weakened economy and, in particular, to the nearly 1½-percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate over the past year.\n\nThe erosion in credit quality that afflicts not only subprime but also prime mortgage and home equity loans has also now spread across the full spectrum of consumer loans, including, credit card, closed-end consumer, and automobile loans. These losses are compounding the pressures on financial institutions and exacerbating the resulting credit crunch.\n\nThe Financial System\n\nSome have asked why policymakers and others didn’t see all of this coming. A lot of people talked about a bubble in home prices that could eventually collapse and lead to sizable credit losses and significant negative wealth effects.  I think the answer is that a lot of people also did not fully understand how these effects would be magnified by several key features of the financial system—features that have interacted with one another to produce a deep wariness about counterparty risk and a freezing up of credit flows. Each of these features corresponds to one of the three main elements of a balance sheet: assets, capital, and liabilities.\n\nI’ll start with assets. Here, a part of the problem is with the new securities and related derivatives that have been used extensively in this decade in mortgage finance and, in fact, throughout the financial system. They were once considered “state of the art”—dazzlingly complex, capable of spreading risk, and constructed using sophisticated mathematical models to price the risk. But it turns out that their very complexity makes it incredibly difficult now to know where the risk actually resides or how to price it, giving rise to major concerns about counterparty risk.\n\nTurning to capital, the problem is that there is a shortage—in other words, too much leverage—among financial institutions as a whole. Capital in many banking organizations has been adversely affected because of write-downs of many of the complex instruments I referred to and because of credit losses primarily associated with delinquencies and foreclosures on real estate loans. Moreover, investment banks and other entities in the so-called shadow banking sector were very highly leveraged, with the ratio of assets to capital exceeding 30 to 1 in many cases. Such slim equity cushions increase firms’ exposure to insolvency in the face of credit losses or asset write-downs.\n\nFinally, on the liability side, the problem is that many leveraged financial institutions relied heavily on very short-term debt—often overnight loans—to fund their operations.  This has made them vulnerable to “runs,” especially in an environment where everyone knows that the system is exposed to impaired assets, where it is hard to determine exactly where those risks reside, and where some firms are known to have only slim equity cushions.\n\nAs financial firms have struggled to fix their own problems, the systemic consequences have become painfully apparent. Firms have tightened lending standards, trying to improve credit quality, and reduced the volume of loans. They have also been selling assets in an effort to deleverage their balance sheets. However, the simultaneous attempts of so many firms to deleverage have depressed asset prices to fire-sale levels, producing additional losses and thereby creating selling pressures for other firms holding similar positions. Write-downs on such securities are reducing the already diminished equity cushions in some firms and raising their leverage at a time when they desire less leverage, not more.\n\nThis vicious cycle has led to outright illiquidity in markets for certain asset-backed securities, making it almost impossible to determine appropriate prices and largely eliminating them as a source of new funding to borrowers.  Moreover, financial institutions, and even nonfinancial firms, have become very reluctant to lend to each other, except at the shortest maturities, since they are uncertain about what demands they could face and whether they will be able to borrow to meet them; as a result, they are hoarding their liquidity. These responses have led to a greatly reduced flow of credit in the economy, which is the major factor responsible for the economic downturn that now is under way. In other words, we are in the grip of an adverse feedback loop in which a credit crunch exacerbates economic weakness, which in turn weakens financial institutions, intensifying the credit crunch.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nIndeed, recent data on the economy have been deeply worrisome. Data released this morning reveal that the economy contracted slightly in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, it appears likely that the economy is contracting significantly. Mainly for this reason, inflationary risks have diminished greatly.\n\nOver the past year or so, the FOMC has cut its federal funds rate target by 425 basis points to its current level of 1 percent.  Nonetheless, most private-sector borrowing rates are higher now than at the beginning of this crisis in August 2007. In pointing this out, I don’t mean to imply that the rate cuts did no good: borrowing rates in my view would be substantially higher absent the reduction in our base lending rate. It’s just that the effects of the growing credit crunch have outpaced the easing of policy, and, indeed, every major sector of the economy has been adversely affected by it.\n\nFor consumers, the credit crunch is one of several negative factors accounting for the decline in spending in recent months. Consumer credit is costlier and harder to get: loan rates are up, loan terms are tougher, and increasing numbers of borrowers are being turned away entirely. This explains, in part, the exceptional weakness we have seen in auto sales. In addition, of course, employment has now declined for nine months in a row, and personal income, in inflation-adjusted terms, is virtually unchanged since April. Furthermore, household wealth is substantially lower as house prices have continued to fall and the stock market has declined sharply.\n\nBusiness spending, too, is feeling the crunch in the form of a higher cost of capital and restricted access to credit. In particular, many companies find that the financial markets have become unreceptive to their commercial paper, an important source of short-term funding.  Some of our business contacts report that bank lines of credit are more difficult to negotiate, and many indicate that they have become cautious in managing liquidity, in committing to capital spending projects that can be deferred, and even in extending credit to customers and other counterparties. Nonresidential construction also is headed lower largely because of the financial crisis; the market for commercial mortgage-backed securities, a mainstay for financing large projects, has all but dried up.\n\nMany state and local governments are being dragged deeper into the financial mess as well. The downturn in the economy has bitten into their tax revenues, and disruptions in financial markets have made it harder for them to issue bonds.\n\nUntil recently, weakness in domestic final demand was offset by a major boost from exporting goods and services to our trading partners. Unfortunately, economic growth in the rest of the world has slowed noticeably. There are a number of reasons for the slowdown abroad, including spillovers from the U.S. downturn, and most importantly, the financial meltdown that now has intensified substantially in Europe and elsewhere. In addition, the dollar has appreciated recently against the currencies of many of our trading partners, offsetting a portion of the depreciation that was boosting U.S. exports. As a result, exports will not provide as much of an impetus to growth as they did earlier in the year.\n\nPolicy Approaches\n\nNow that I’ve reviewed the current economic situation, I’d like to turn to policy, with a discussion of actions taken so far, and additional remedies that bear serious consideration. I’ve already mentioned the FOMC’s substantial easing of monetary policy.  In addition, the Fed has ramped up its use of an arsenal of liquidity tools, devising new facilities to lend directly to banks, primary dealers, money market mutual funds, and nonfinancial firms that have been frozen out of the credit markets. These facilities reduce the chance of runs on financial institutions by providing the assurance of short-term funding from the Fed based on an expanded range of collateral.  Beyond these facilities, the Fed has provided direct financing to prevent the outright bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and AIG, whose failure, in the judgment of the Fed and the Treasury, would have significantly undermined financial stability.\n\nEven though the Fed has done much to attack the financial crisis, more was obviously needed. A comprehensive solution requires actions that are “fiscal,” in the sense that they use taxpayer funds or place them at risk, and thus extend beyond the Fed’s legislative mandate. The actions that have now been announced or implemented fall into three main categories, corresponding to the three underlying problems in the financial system that I identified earlier: impaired assets, capital shortage, and uncertainty about short-term funding. With respect to impaired assets, the Treasury is formulating plans to purchase mortgage-related assets from financial institutions.  This could reduce uncertainty about the valuation of these instruments, restore some liquidity in the secondary markets, and improve capital positions if the actual purchase prices exceed the fire-sale levels that now prevail for many asset-backed securities. The second problem afflicting the financial sector—capital shortage—is critical. It is therefore extremely heartening that the governments of all countries involved in the crisis have announced immediate plans to inject capital into their financial systems. With respect to short-term funding, direct government guarantees against default have been extended on an emergency basis to boost public confidence in lending to financial institutions. The guarantees cover most deposits as well as newly issued senior debt.   \n  \nI believe that these steps are extremely constructive and will help over time to ease some of the wariness about counterparty risk and thaw credit flows.  So far, we’ve seen very tentative signs of an easing of stress in money markets. For example, LIBOR-OIS and credit default swap spreads are down somewhat. However these spreads remain at levels that are well above normal and other measures of stress have risen even further. Clearly, we have a long way to go before the credit crunch shows significant healing. So it is worth considering other types of policies to address the crisis.\n \nFor example, several programs to mitigate the problem of foreclosures and the credit losses precipitated by falling house prices are either in effect or have been proposed. They fall into two broad categories:  those aimed more or less directly at reducing the number of foreclosures by focusing mainly on helping homeowners who are at risk of losing their homes, and those designed to reduce borrowing costs for a much wider population, thereby supporting the overall demand for housing and, hence, house prices.\n\nIn the first category is the Hope Now Alliance, a voluntary program that started in October 2007 which brings together counselors, servicers, investors, and other mortgage market participants.  It facilitates the reworking of mortgage loans by marshalling the incentives of lenders and borrowers to avoid the deadweight losses associated with foreclosures. A second example is Hope for Homeowners, a federal program resulting from legislation sponsored by U.S. Congressman Frank and Senator Dodd. This program went into operation at the beginning of this month. It expands the role of the FHA to improve loan “workout options” by providing a government guarantee of payment to lenders. In return, lenders must forgive a portion of the principal to make the new loan more affordable. In addition, the program includes a shared-appreciation feature in which the FHA and homeowner divide both the equity created at the beginning of the new mortgage loan and any future house-price appreciation.\n\nMoreover, expanded versions of such workout approaches have been proposed. In particular, FDIC Chairwoman Sheila Bair has suggested guidelines to target and streamline the loan modification process. She also proposes using loan guarantees authorized by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act as an incentive for servicers to lower mortgage payments so as to make them affordable and sustainable. 4 Other proposals are modeled on the Homeowners’ Loan Corporation instituted in the Great Depression. 5 The basic idea is that the government would offer to buy under-water loans—now about 15 percent of total mortgages—from lenders and refinance a new mortgage for qualifying homeowners at a lower rate.\n \nPrograms like these are targeted at borrowers who are already or are likely to end up in foreclosure. They have the potential to keep qualifying homeowners in their homes with sustainable mortgages, thus avoiding the deadweight losses and negative community spillovers of foreclosure. By mitigating foreclosure sales at fire-sale prices, these programs may also support housing prices more generally and serve to limit the credit losses that have done so much damage to the financial system. The broader the debt-relief that a plan provides to households, the more it is apt to spur consumer spending and reduce credit losses; but the cost to taxpayers is likely to increase as well. Speed of implementation is another key consideration, and loan modification plans that involve dealing with and analyzing the individual situations of large numbers of borrowers tend to be quite time-consuming.\n    \nA second category of proposals is aimed at a much broader set of borrowers, and would boost the overall demand for housing by reducing borrowing costs through low-cost government loans or tax credits. 6 They hold the potential to reduce the number of foreclosures and associated credit losses both directly—by reducing after-tax house payments—and indirectly—by providing support to house prices. It is true that house prices do need to adjust, and, until they do so, potential buyers may stay out of the market. 7 However, the concern is that house prices may “overcorrect” for a number of reasons, not the least of which could be today’s extraordinarily tight credit conditions. This overcorrection could have devastating effects on the financial system and the economy, and such programs seek to avoid that outcome. \n    \nMy objective in discussing these ideas is not to support one plan or the other. Rather, I want to emphasize that such programs, which provide direct assistance to homeowners and the housing market, are worthy of serious consideration as additional steps beyond the policies recently adopted to address stress in financial markets. Needless to say, the pros and cons of each that I’ve described give just a glimpse of how difficult it will be to design approaches that are both effective and timely. Moreover, there is no doubt that, beyond these short-term strategies designed to quell the crisis, long-term, more fundamental reforms are needed as well. 8 This conference, which has brought together so many experts on these subjects, is a perfect forum for discussing such important issues.\n\n# # #\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1.

        "content": "\n\nGood evening. It’s a pleasure to have the chance to speak with you tonight, and I’m very grateful to your colleague and mine, Ken Wilcox, for inviting me to do so.  I have come to know him well during his tenure as a member of the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and I thank him for his service. He and our other Directors not only provide oversight for the management of the Bank, but they also give us valuable, real-time information on what is happening in their industries and their local economies.\n\nThis information is of crucial importance now, because it helps us assess the impact of the financial market crisis on the borrowing, spending, and hiring decisions of households, firms, and state and local governments.  It is because of such impacts that the turmoil in financial markets affects the prospects for growth and job creation in the months and years ahead.  Financial crises are hardly unprecedented.  In fact, over half of all International Monetary Fund member countries have experienced a systemic banking crisis since 1980. But the financial crisis that began here in August 2007 has intensified in recent weeks, becoming exceptionally severe and global in its dimensions.  Its potential ramifications for the economic well-being of citizens here and around the globe are a matter of grave concern. My goal tonight is to give you my perspective on both financial and economic developments, and to discuss the array of policy responses to them.  As always, my comments represent my own views and do not necessarily reflect those of any of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nTo preview my discussion, financial sector distress has led to a credit crunch in the United States that is making it extremely difficult for financial institutions and many corporations and households to borrow and spend. These developments have also shaken confidence, causing households and firms to pull back, acting defensively and cautiously. Such behavior weakens economic growth and employment. At the same time, the weakening economy is exacerbating the stress in financial markets. Such linkages between the “real” and financial sectors of the economy have created a feedback loop that is intensifying the economic downturn. Over the last year, Fed policymakers have acted to address both the escalating financial crisis and rising unemployment. But inflation has also been an important concern, since it has been running at unacceptably high levels. In recent months, however, the outlook for inflation has noticeably changed. Commodity prices, including the price of oil, have plunged. And I expect this development, along with a further increase in slack in labor and product markets, to push inflation down to, and possibly even below, rates that I consider consistent with price stability.\n\nIn the view of many observers, the current financial crisis ranks as the worst since the Great Depression. But I do not believe that the U.S. economy, in the years ahead, faces a period of economic misery that will begin to rival the suffering associated with that historic economic calamity. The American economy is more resilient now than then, due in part to “automatic stabilizers” that were put in place to shield the incomes of households from fluctuations in the economy. More important, this is by no means a case of having forgotten the past and being doomed to repeat it. Far from forgetting, much research has focused on that calamitous economic event, as well as on more recent banking crises around the world. As a result, we have learned the importance of prompt action in a financial crisis. We also have learned what fundamental issues to address, even when the crisis has unique features, as this one does. Those fundamental issues are how to implement appropriate macroeconomic policy and how to shore up the financial sector and thaw credit flows, thereby shielding the real economy from the worst potential spillovers from the turmoil. Last Friday, the G-7 finance ministers issued a statement outlining a comprehensive set of general principles to address the financial crisis. The statement importantly recognized the need for international coordination to prevent beggar-thy-neighbor financial and economic spillovers among countries of the type that worsened the Great Depression. It is heartening that such global coordination is indeed taking place: the governments of the euro-area countries and the United Kingdom have announced measures that translate these general principles into concrete policies. And this morning, the Treasury, Federal Reserve, and FDIC announced a similar set of detailed emergency actions. I will discuss these policies at the conclusion of my talk.\n\nEconomic developments and prospects\n\nI would first like to discuss the performance of the U.S. economy in some depth. The recent flow of economic data suggests that the economy was weaker than expected in the third quarter, probably showing essentially no growth at all.  Growth in the fourth quarter appears to be weaker yet, with an outright contraction quite likely. Indeed, the U.S. economy appears to be in a recession. This is not a controversial view, since the latest Blue Chip consensus projects that there will be three consecutive quarters of contraction in real GDP starting last quarter.\n\nBy now, virtually every major sector of the economy has been hit by the financial shock. I’ll start with consumer spending, where the news has not been good. Employment has now declined for nine months in a row, and personal income, in inflation-adjusted terms, is virtually unchanged since April. Household wealth is substantially lower as house prices have continued to slide and the stock market has declined sharply. On top of this, consumer credit is costlier and harder to get: loan rates are up, loan terms are tougher, and increasing numbers of borrowers are being turned away entirely. Even before the extraordinary deterioration in financial market conditions over the past few weeks, the evidence was accumulating that consumer spending had weakened. In real terms, consumer spending was flat or contracted in recent months.  Vehicle sales in September plummeted, even with lower gas prices and continued incentives in place, a development that partially reflects the difficulties that people are having in obtaining auto loans.\n\nBusiness spending, too, is feeling the crunch, as firms face weak final demand for their products, a higher cost of capital, and restricted credit.  In particular, many companies find that the financial markets have become unreceptive to their commercial paper, an important source of short-term funding.  Some of our business contacts report that bank lines of credit are more difficult to negotiate, and many indicate that they have become cautious in managing liquidity, in committing to capital spending projects that can be deferred, and even in extending credit to customers and other counterparties. Some companies are drawing down existing credit lines to have cash on hand in the event that these lines are capped.\n\nWe’ve even begun to see some signs of a slowdown for the previously very strong IT industry across the country and in the Bay Area in particular.  Several leading tech companies have announced plans for layoffs, and funding for start-ups has grown increasingly tight. Among my own contacts, many expect spending to be largely flat or down for the remainder of the year. A tech slowdown could intensify with the fall-off in consumer spending, and the weakening in business spending could come into play since the financial industry is a heavy user of both IT equipment and software. Despite these troubling developments, the downturn in the local economy is likely to be far less severe than the bust of the early 2000s, when the Bay Area was ground zero for the tech implosion. This time, the downturn is centered elsewhere—in the real estate and finance sectors—so that the Bay Area economy is a victim of collateral damage rather than the primary target.\n\nNonresidential construction is another sector that has been affected by the financial crisis, in part because the market for commercial mortgage-backed securities, a mainstay for financing large projects, has all but dried up. Banks and other traditional lenders have also become less willing to extend funding. With financing unavailable, I’m hearing talk about substantial cutbacks on new projects and planned capital improvements on existing buildings.\n\nAlthough residential investment accounts for under 5 percent of overall economic activity, the decline in housing construction over the past three years has created a major drag on overall real GDP growth.  Housing starts have plummeted. Yet inventories of unsold new and existing homes remain at very high levels, making it difficult to predict with any confidence when housing starts will bottom out. Indeed, the possibility of ongoing contraction in this sector is intensified by the economic downturn, by the drop in jobs, and by the high cost and tighter terms on mortgage credit. Understandably, financial institutions have made it more difficult to qualify for a mortgage by requiring much higher down payments, higher income-to-payment ratios, and higher FICO scores.  Moreover, private-label securitized markets for residential mortgages are essentially closed for business. The sole, but important, sources of mortgage securitization are the government agencies, especially Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which provide backing mainly for conventional conforming mortgages. One piece of good news is that interest rates on conforming mortgages have come down a bit in recent weeks as a result of the takeover of these entities by the federal government and the now explicit government backing of both their debt and mortgage insurance guarantees.\n\nHouse prices have fallen along with construction. As I mentioned, the associated loss of wealth is a drag on consumer spending. Moreover, falling house prices are a major factor behind the delinquencies and foreclosures on subprime and other mortgages that precipitated the current financial crisis. Unfortunately, the bottom for house prices is not obviously in sight. For example, futures contracts for house prices predict further declines this year and next.\n\nMany state and local governments are being dragged deeper into the financial mess as well. The downturn in the economy has bitten into tax collections and made it harder to issue bonds. As you know, this has recently become a problem in California, adding uncertainty to the state’s already difficult budget situation, which has been eroded by a revenue shortfall due to the economic slowdown.\n\nSo far, my comments should have made it clear that domestic spending has weakened substantially. Until recently, we have received a major boost from exporting goods and services to our trading partners.  Unfortunately, the news on foreign demand has also turned weaker. Economic growth in the rest of the world, particularly in Europe and Japan, has slowed for a number of reasons, including spillovers from the U.S. slowdown, and most importantly, the financial meltdown that now has intensified substantially in Europe and elsewhere.  In addition, the dollar has recently appreciated against the euro and British pound, offsetting a portion of the depreciation that was boosting U.S. exports. As a result, exports will not provide as much of an impetus to growth as they did earlier in the year.\n\nAs I noted at the outset, inflation has been a source of significant concern over the past year or so.  However, economic developments in this country and abroad can be expected to ease inflationary pressures.  In the first place, prospects for weaker economic activity around the world have led to a drop in food, energy, and other commodity prices, and this has relieved a good deal of the pressure on inflation from the earlier run-up in their prices. Secondly, slow growth here seems likely to boost both unemployment and unused industrial capacity. This additional slack in labor and product markets will put downward pressure on inflation, moving it toward rates that I consider consistent with price stability. In fact, some prominent forecasters at this stage are concerned that inflation in future years could decline to levels below what is consistent with price stability.\n\nFinancial System\n\nI have highlighted a number of ways in which stresses in the financial sector are impinging on economic activity through their effects on the spending decisions of consumers, businesses, and governments. A precondition, in my view, for the economy to recover is that the financial system must get back on its feet. Last week, plunging stock markets in the U.S. and around the world received front page attention. But stocks were not the only market that had a bad week. Indeed, the declines in stock prices were symptomatic of deeper, fundamental problems. Term funding in the money markets became virtually unavailable to financial institutions: spreads on interbank term loans spiked. Financial firms found it necessary to fund themselves disproportionately overnight. In addition, both financial and nonfinancial corporations had difficulty issuing commercial paper as purchases by money market mutual funds declined. Borrowing rates have also risen dramatically for lower-grade bond issuers. This freezing up of credit flows reflects a breakdown of the trust and confidence needed for potential lenders to extend credit beyond overnight to counterparties and widespread flight to the very safest assets, to the point where Treasury bill yields have fallen to close to zero at various times in recent weeks. With near or outright failure afflicting firms like Lehman, Washington Mutual, AIG, and Wachovia, investors have become exceptionally wary of a host of financial institutions, and aversion to counterparty risk is extremely high.\n\nI’d like to take a few moments to consider three key features of the financial system that interact with one another and lie behind this wariness about counterparty risk. Each of these features corresponds to one of the three main elements of a balance sheet: assets, capital, and liabilities. First, on the asset side, the wariness began with mounting credit losses on subprime mortgages, but the concern about credit losses has since spread to other kinds of loans. The banking system has dealt with large credit losses at times in the past, but this episode has a novel element. Many of the new financial instruments used in mortgage finance, and in fact throughout the financial system, were considered “state of the art”—complex, capable of spreading risk, and constructed using sophisticated mathematical models to price the risk.  As we have since discovered, the pricing of the risk in these instruments has now become not a marvel of financial engineering, but a fog of confusion. Such complex instruments make it incredibly difficult now to know where the risk actually resides or how to price it. In other words, people need more information about these assets to be willing to participate in the markets for them, and they don’t have it. The problem is compounded by the uncertainty about the value of the assets ultimately being financed, in particular, real estate.\n\nSecond is a shortage of capital—or, to put it another way, too much leverage among financial institutions as a whole.  While conventional commercial banks were well capitalized when the crisis started a year ago last summer, and they have raised a good deal of capital over the last year, capital has still been negatively affected due to the write-down of many of the complex instruments I referred to and credit losses primarily associated with delinquencies and foreclosures on real estate loans. However, the crisis extends beyond the banking sector to institutions in the so-called “shadow banking sector”; these include investment banks, as well as hedge funds, Structured Investment Vehicles, or SIVs, and other conduits. During the years of the credit bubble, their strategy involved becoming very highly leveraged; in many investment banks, for example, the ratio of assets to capital exceeded 30 to 1.  Of course, high leverage means that credit losses can very quickly turn into insolvency.\n\nThird, on the liability side, many financial institutions have relied heavily on short-term debt to fund their operations, making them vulnerable to “runs.”  Investment banks, for example, commonly used very short-term—often overnight—repurchase agreements, and SIVs and conduits issued asset-backed commercial paper which was commonly sold to money market mutual funds. No institution that borrows very short to hold a portfolio of longer-term, illiquid assets can satisfy the demands of its lenders for repayment when they desire to flee en masse.  It is for this reason that banks have been protected with deposit insurance and access to the Federal Reserve’s discount window. In the current crisis, however, this bank-like profile of borrowing short and lending long extends well beyond the commercial banking sector. Financial institutions are vulnerable now to runs, because everyone knows that the system is exposed to impaired assets, because it is hard to determine exactly where those risks reside, and because some firms are known to have only slim equity cushions. We have seen in the last few weeks that even the fear that a firm may encounter future difficulties in rolling over debt can cause funding to evaporate quickly.\n\nFinancial firms have been struggling mightily to fix their individual business problems.  They have tightened lending standards, trying to improve credit quality, and reduced the volume of loans.  They have also been trying to sell assets. But attempts to deleverage—to enhance balance sheet strength by selling assets—tend to further depress asset prices, producing additional losses and thereby creating selling pressures for other firms holding similar positions. Write-downs on such securities are reducing the already diminished equity cushions in some firms and raising their leverage at a time when the growing risks in the financial markets make them and their counterparties desire less leverage, not more. This vicious cycle has led to outright illiquidity in markets for certain asset-backed securities, making it almost impossible to determine appropriate prices and largely eliminating them as a source of new funding to borrowers. A final factor compounding the credit crunch is that financial institutions, and even nonfinancial firms, are hoarding liquidity, becoming very reluctant to lend to each other, except at the shortest maturities, since they are uncertain what demands they could face and whether they will be able to borrow to meet them.\n\nWhile these responses make sense for individual institutions, they have led to a greatly reduced flow of credit in the economy, which is the major factor responsible for the economic downturn that now is under way. In other words, we are in the grip of an “adverse feedback loop” in which a credit crunch exacerbates economic weakness, which in turn weakens financial institutions, intensifying the credit crunch.  Moreover, as I have explained, the efforts of the private sector to fix itself through deleveraging and other means are only making matters worse. This is why government action was urgently needed. I will now turn my attention to economic policies, beginning with those implemented by the Federal Reserve.\n\nEconomic Policies\n\nThe Fed has potent tools to address the financial crisis and has used them aggressively to shield the economy from its fallout. It also has demonstrated a commitment to work with other central banks to coordinate policy. The policies available to the Fed fall into two categories—monetary policy and actions to improve liquidity in financial markets.\n\nLet me start with monetary policy. Since the onset of the financial crisis, the FOMC has cut its federal funds rate target by 375 basis points to its current level of 150 basis points. The most recent cut of 50 basis points took place last week, in an action coordinated with the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada, the Swiss National Bank, and the Swedish National Bank. I strongly supported this action. Recent financial developments and economic data make it clear that the outlook for the U.S. economy has weakened noticeably, and inflationary pressures have substantially abated. Coordinated action symbolizes the determination of central banks to act together to address what is now a global crisis. And it diminishes the potential exchange rate repercussions of any single country’s solo action.\n\nRate cuts are by no means a panacea, but they do at least partially offset the tightening of financial conditions due to higher spreads, reflecting heightened credit and liquidity risk and a marked increase in general risk aversion. Most private-sector borrowing rates are higher now than at the beginning of this crisis in August 2007 in spite of these substantial cuts. In pointing this out, I don’t mean to imply that the rate cuts did no good: borrowing rates in my view would be substantially higher absent the reduction in our base lending rate.\n\nNext let me turn to the Fed’s direct actions to improve liquidity in financial markets.  Since the onset of the crisis, the Fed has ramped up its use of an arsenal of liquidity tools, devising new facilities to lend directly to banks and other borrowers that have been frozen out of the credit markets. These facilities reduce the chance of runs on financial institutions by providing the assurance of short-term funding from the Fed based on an expanded range of collateral. For example, the Term Auction Facility (TAF) provides loans to meet the liquidity needs of depository institutions.  Other facilities—particularly the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) and Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF)—address the funding difficulties facing primary dealers. The Fed recently implemented a facility to provide liquidity support to money market mutual funds.  This complements the Treasury’s initiative to provide insurance against loss to investors in money market mutual funds. Last week, the Fed announced a plan to purchase high-grade commercial paper from both financial and nonfinancial corporations in response to the freezing up of commercial paper markets. In addition, the Fed has cooperated with foreign central banks by providing dollar funding to foreign financial institutions through swap arrangements and has announced its willingness to adjust the size of its swap lines with several central banks to accommodate whatever quantity of U.S. dollar funding is demanded. Beyond these facilities, the Fed has provided direct financing to prevent the outright bankruptcy of two institutions—Bear Stearns and AIG—whose failure, in the judgment of the Fed and the Treasury, would have significantly undermined financial stability.\n\nLast week, the Fed took advantage of authority just granted to it under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act passed by Congress to pay interest on the reserves held by banks in their accounts at the Fed.  This new tool is important because it enables the Fed to expand its liquidity facilities by any magnitude that may ultimately be deemed necessary to provide direct credit to institutions and sectors that are frozen out of the credit markets.  Without this new tool, increases in the overall scale of the Fed’s balance sheet resulting from expanded liquidity operations would have pushed the funds rate below the FOMC’s target level, compromising its monetary policy objective.\n\nEven though the Fed has deployed an arsenal of weapons to attack the financial crisis, more was obviously needed.  A comprehensive solution requires actions that are “fiscal” in the sense that they use taxpayer funds or place them at risk, and thus extend beyond the Fed’s legislative mandate. The actions that have now been announced or implemented fall into three main categories, corresponding to the three underlying problems in the financial system that I identified earlier: short-term funding, impaired assets, and capital shortage.\n\nWith respect to short-term funding, in addition to the Fed initiatives I described, direct government guarantees against default have now been extended on an emergency basis to boost public confidence in lending to financial institutions. The Treasury has implemented an insurance program for deposits in money market mutual funds; Congress temporarily raised FDIC deposit insurance from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor. And this morning, the FDIC announced an important program to temporarily guarantee the senior debt of all FDIC-insured institutions and their holding companies, and all deposits in non-interest bearing transaction accounts. Along the same lines, the G-7 pledged in their action plan to “use all available tools to support systemically important financial institutions and prevent their failure.” Guarantees that address counterparty risk head-on are obviously confidence boosting. There is a danger, however, that funds could shift in ways that would harm stability if the guarantees apply in some countries or financial sectors but not others. In light of this concern, it is constructive that the U.S. actions mirrored policies announced by other countries. Last week, the United Kingdom pledged to guarantee bank debt, an initiative intended to jumpstart the near-frozen interbank market, and a similar step is included in the plan adopted Sunday by the governments of the euro-area countries.\n\nWith respect to impaired assets, experience reveals that programs to remove nonperforming loans from the balance sheets of financial institutions have proven helpful in resolving a number of earlier financial crises in both industrial and developing countries.  Under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, the Treasury is formulating plans to purchase mortgage-related assets. Such purchases could reduce uncertainty about the valuation of financial institutions, which is a barrier to raising private capital. They may also succeed in restoring some liquidity in the secondary markets where there is now little trading activity. To the extent that the prices that the government pays through auctions exceed the fire-sale prices now used to value them, some institutions will see an improvement in their capital.\n\nThe third problem afflicting the financial sector—capital shortage–is critical. It is therefore extremely heartening that the governments of all countries involved in the crisis have announced immediate plans to inject capital into their financial systems. Among economists, there is a remarkable consensus on the importance of recapitalizing the financial sector. Moreover, it emerges as the clearest lesson learned from the global financial crises of recent decades. Adequate capital is a sine qua non for a sound financial institution and thus a prerequisite for the restoration of confidence in the financial system.  Financial sector capital must also be augmented for the sector to be capable of meeting the economy’s credit needs. To accomplish this key objective, the Treasury this morning announced a voluntary plan to make $250 billion in capital available to a wide array of U.S. banks and thrifts in the form of preferred stock. The authority for this equity purchase program was granted by Congress in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act.  The program has been designed to encourage financial institutions to raise additional capital in the private sector. This is a critical step toward financial stability.\n\nLet me conclude by saying that the turmoil in global financial markets poses a serious and direct threat to the well-being of all citizens of the global economy. Although the challenges are daunting, I am encouraged that policymakers around the globe are now responding rapidly and forcefully to resolve the financial crisis. The global economic outlook depends on how well these policies succeed.\n\n# # #\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1.

        "content": "\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for coming. It’s always a pleasure to visit Los Angeles, where our Reserve Bank has a major branch, and I’m honored by the invitation to speak to you today. My remarks today will focus on conditions in the U.S. economy. There is a lot to cover, but I plan to leave a few minutes for questions and hope you will share with me your own perceptions concerning the economy and its prospects.\n\nRegrettably, the nation’s economy has been in rough waters for over a year now. Last summer, a precipitous slide in house prices triggered a crisis in financial markets and a credit crunch that is making it hard for consumers and some firms to borrow. These developments are ongoing and perhaps deepening, as banks and other financial intermediaries are continuing to delever by scaling back their balance sheets and shrinking their lending activity. In the face of these developments, firms and consumers have also been pulling back, causing unemployment to rise. As if this cycle of events feeding back on each other weren’t bad enough, oil and other commodity prices have surged in recent years, generating worrisome numbers for headline consumer inflation. So, the problems facing the Fed have been myriad, complex, and difficult. We have had to balance concerns about economic weakness with equally compelling, but conflicting, concerns about inflation.\n\nQuite recently, there has been a bit of a shift in the inflation picture, however. Commodity prices—most notably oil prices—have fallen well below their earlier peaks. I will argue that this development probably largely reflects a weakening in economic conditions in many industrialized countries, including European nations and Japan. By reducing the worldwide demand for commodities, weaker global growth should relieve upward pressure on U.S. inflation. Lower commodity prices should also be good for U.S. economic growth, although this benefit is likely to be counterbalanced to some degree by the detrimental effects of slower foreign economic growth on our exports, which have been surging. If commodity prices keep falling—or even if they remain at current levels—the Fed’s objective of promoting both price stability and full employment will become more readily achievable. In the remainder of my remarks, I want to elaborate on these points.\n\nHousing\n\nI’ll begin with housing, because the “boom and bust” cycle in the housing market was the trigger for many of the developments I’ll be discussing. The effect of the collapse in the national housing market on our economy has been profound. First, outlays for residential construction have been falling at double-digit rates in inflation-adjusted terms since 2005 and this decline has been a huge drag on growth. Slower economic growth has pushed up the national unemployment rate to 6.1 percent—over a full percentage point above the level that, in my view, is consistent with “full employment.” Going forward, it seems unlikely that construction activity will pick up any time soon. Inventories of unsold homes remain at elevated levels, and although home sales have shown signs of leveling off recently—certainly a ray of hope—the volume of sales remains quite weak.\n\nSecond, the drop in house prices—around 15 to 20 percent off its peak depending on which measure you use—has weakened the financial condition of many consumers. The value of their homes is an important part of their wealth and equity in those homes serves as collateral for home equity loans and other types of borrowing. The result is that consumers are likely to spend less, reducing the pace of economic activity. Declining house prices also appear to be the single biggest factor behind the recent rise in mortgage delinquencies and home foreclosures. When families face financial difficulties due to illness, job loss, or divorce, an equity cushion often allows them to get through the hard times by borrowing needed funds or even selling the house. But when home price declines have wiped out home equity or driven it into negative territory, people often end up in delinquency or foreclosure. The vitality of the subprime mortgage market appeared to depend on continued home price appreciation, and, of course, it is now in shambles with around 20 percent of subprime mortgages currently delinquent or in foreclosure nationwide. Delinquency rates on prime mortgages are far lower. But they too are on the rise.\n\nThe Los Angeles area is among the regions hardest hit by the national housing slump. Except for a slight pickup in recent months, home sales have plummeted over the past few years, and depending on the price measure that you use, home prices are down about 15 to 30 percent from their peak.\n\nNot surprisingly, financial conditions for many homeowners in the area are quite shaky. Subprime mortgages accounted for a significant share of new mortgages during the area’s housing boom, particularly in downtown Los Angeles and parts of the Inland Empire. Conditions here aren’t as bad as the most exposed areas of the state, such as Merced and Stockton. However, delinquencies and foreclosures have grown significantly in this area, and given the continued weak prognosis for the housing market in general, more unpleasant adjustments in ownership and equity are likely before the market stabilizes.\n\nFinancial Markets\n\nThe third profound impact of the national housing market collapse has been on financial markets, and the turmoil that began last August is still alive and well. For example, spreads between the rates that must be paid by risky borrowers over those on Treasury securities remain very high. And, as you know, we’ve begun to see a growing number of failures of depository institutions—notably IndyMac, which represented the largest failure in decades.\n\nIn addition, many financial markets are still not operating efficiently or effectively. In particular, the market for so-called private-label securitized mortgages of even the highest quality remains moribund. These complex instruments were the primary source of financing for nonconforming residential mortgages, including subprime loans.\n\nOutside of expanded lending by the FHA, there is now little or no lending to higher-risk residential mortgage borrowers. Jumbo mortgages for prime borrowers are available, but at historically high spreads over rates on conventional mortgages, as banks have been reluctant to make these loans. Beyond higher rates, many depositories are tightening the terms of their lending, capping or terminating some home equity loans, and in general trying to reduce their exposure to credit losses by reducing the scale of their lending. Importantly, the government-sponsored agencies—Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the largest of all mortgage lenders—have suffered credit losses and are having to pare back their crucial roles in the mortgage market. The result of all of this is a severe economy-wide credit crunch, comparable to the one that hit the economy in the recession of the early 1990s.\n\nThe story of how falling house prices, and, in particular, their effects on the subprime mortgage market, triggered the problems in financial markets is well-known. At the most basic level, financial market participants suddenly realized that house price declines could result in substantial losses on subprime mortgages through delinquencies and foreclosures, that the extent of those losses was highly uncertain, and that the complexity of mortgage-backed securities and the collateralized debt obligations incorporating them made it difficult to know which participants would suffer the losses.\n\nThe story of how these problems will ultimately be resolved is far less clear. Obviously, it would help a lot if house prices stopped falling. But even though the rate of decline of house prices has shown signs of moderating, it appears that these prices will keep heading down for some time. The ratio of house prices to rents—a kind of price-dividend ratio for housing—still remains high by historical standards, despite having fallen substantially from its historical peak in early 2006. This suggests that further price declines are needed to bring housing markets into long-run balance. Moreover, large inventories of unsold homes can be expected to continue to put downward pressure on housing prices. In view of these factors, it’s not surprising that the futures market for house prices predicts further declines this year.\n\nGoing forward, the ability and willingness of commercial banks and other intermediaries to extend credit depends in part on their capital levels. Capital has been depleted by large losses, but it is encouraging that financial institutions have raised a considerable amount of new capital over the past year. Even so, balance sheet pressures and broader financial market dislocations may well be with us for some time. My guess is that market functioning will improve in 2009, but things could get worse before they get better. One major concern is that home prices could fall more than markets now expect, leading to larger losses for financial institutions, which would further impair their ability to make new loans. The deepening of the credit crunch could then lead to further declines in house prices, intensifying the adverse feedback loop that seems to be operating in our economy.\n\nCommodities\n\nBeyond the many repercussions of falling house prices, another factor putting a damper on economic activity has been surging prices for commodities, including energy, food and metals. There’s plenty of debate about where this surge in commodity prices came from. Some have argued that speculative trading in commodity markets is the main cause but, personally, I’m not persuaded by that explanation. I’m more persuaded by arguments based on the fundamentals of demand and supply—and I think they explain not only much of the run-up in commodity prices, but also the recent declines. In the run-up, demand was boosted by rapid worldwide economic growth, with China and other developing countries accounting for a good deal of the increase. At the same time, new supplies of oil have been harder to come by. As for food prices, supply has been constrained by a number of factors, including drought conditions that hampered wheat production in Australia, and demand for biofuels that has diverted crops away from food usage.\n\nThe fundamental forces of supply and demand can also explain the drop in energy and some other commodity prices since June. Most important is that the demand for commodities has probably fallen in response to a weakening of economic growth in many industrialized countries. In the second quarter, it was only barely positive in the 30-country OECD bloc as a whole, and Japan, France, Germany and Italy all experienced outright contractions. Moreover, prospects for growth do not appear to be that good for the second half of this year.\n\nSeveral factors are behind the worsening outlook abroad. First, as in the U.S., higher oil and food prices have cut into consumer spending. Second, although most of Europe had little subprime lending of its own, deteriorating U.S. financial market conditions have affected banks and markets abroad that invested in structured products originated in the U.S.; this is particularly true for banks in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany, and France. As in the U.S., this exposure has led to higher funding costs, tighter bank lending standards, and wider spreads for riskier borrowers. Third, several countries, including Spain, Ireland, and the U.K., have experienced their own housing booms and downturns, creating further stress on their banking sectors. Fourth, slower growth in the U.S. and the depreciation of the dollar against their currencies have dampened European and Japanese exports.\n\nFinally, monetary policy in Europe has been less accommodative during this period than in the U.S. For example, while the Fed cut its target interest rate substantially to 2 percent during the course of the credit crisis that began last summer, the European Central Bank kept its policy interest rate steady throughout, and then tightened by 25 basis points to 4¼ percent in July. Part of the reason for the difference is that the European Central Bank’s mandate requires it to focus exclusively on controlling headline inflation, which reached 4 percent for the twelve months ending in July—a rate well above its official objective of below, but close to, 2 percent. In addition, even though much of the recent increase in inflation is attributable to commodity prices, and therefore likely to be a temporary phenomenon, the central bank has been worried about second-round effects on inflation expectations, wages, and other costs, and justifiably so. The euro zone has a greater degree of wage indexation and collective bargaining than the U.S. So it is more likely that higher headline inflation will fairly quickly get built into wages there, setting off a wage-price spiral that could be persistent and difficult to stop.\n\nU.S. Outlook\n\nTurning back to our own economy now, it was recently reported that growth in the second quarter came in at a fairly robust rate of 3¼ percent. And this seems like good news—especially considering what the economy has just been through. Growth slowed sharply in the fourth quarter of last year, and, indeed, the data show that activity actually contracted slightly. Though growth turned positive in the first quarter, it was tepid at best.\n\nWhile one might be tempted to interpret the recent strong numbers as a sign that things are turning around, there are three important reasons to think that the strength will not hold up, and that economic performance will be decidedly subpar in the second half of the year. First, consumer spending in the second quarter came in at only a moderate rate, even though it was boosted by substantial tax rebates. But there are no plans in place to repeat those rebates, so by the fourth quarter, the economy will no longer benefit from that fiscal stimulus.\n\nSecond, export growth alone contributed one-half of the total real GDP growth registered in the second quarter. This element has been an important source of strength in our economy for over a year, buoyed by strong growth abroad and by the weakening of the dollar. However, the dollar has rebounded some in recent months and, as I noted, economic growth in many of our industrialized trading partners has slowed or even turned negative, suggesting that exports will no longer give much of a boost to the pace of our economic growth.\n\nThird, the problems in the housing markets, financial markets, and labor markets continue to be a drag on growth and employment. Fortunately, the recent fall in commodity prices should help to cushion some of this downward pressure on activity.\n\nOverall, I anticipate that real GDP growth in the second half of this year will come in below the growth of potential output, which implies that the unemployment rate will rise further. On its own, this obviously is not good news. And its interaction with the housing and financial markets raises the potential for worse news—a deepening of the adverse feedback loop I’ve been describing: more unemployment causing more people to fall behind on their mortgage payments, leading to further delinquencies and foreclosures, tighter credit conditions and further downward pressure on activity and employment. This kind of process represents a downside risk for the economy, and today’s jump in the unemployment rate highlights that risk.\n\nFinally, let me turn to inflation where recent performance has been a serious concern. As of July, the headline PCE Price Index—a comprehensive measure of consumer prices—was up by a whopping 4¼ percent over the past year, compared to 2½ percent over the prior year. An important reason why inflation was so high, of course, was because of the steep increases we experienced in food and energy prices. On top of that, the rise in commodity prices boosted the costs of the wide array of businesses that use them as inputs and some have responded by passing those cost increases through to their own prices. The consequence is that core inflation, which excludes food and energy is also up. The core PCE Price Index rose by 2½ percent over the past twelve months, which is somewhat above the range that I consider consistent with price stability, but close to its pace of increase over the last several years.\n\nAs bad as inflation has been, I am very hopeful that inflation will come down quite substantially, though perhaps not as fast as I’d like; we probably need to live through another quarter or two of higher inflation, as previous increases in commodity prices boost the prices paid by consumers for food and energy.\n\nOne reason for inflation to come down thereafter is the recent decline in commodity prices. As long as they don’t keep going up, they will cease to put direct upward pressure on headline inflation. Furthermore, the slack we now have in labor and product markets will impart some downward pressure on the growth of labor compensation. The pace of wage and salary increases has been stable and quite modest in recent years and a weak labor market may cause it to decline even further.\n\nAnother important factor in the inflation outlook is inflation expectations. If the public were to conclude that the recent experience of high inflation will be long-lasting and not temporary, then workers might demand higher compensation and firms might satisfy those demands, setting off a wage-price dynamic that would be costly to unwind. I argued earlier that such a wage-price spiral was less likely here than in Europe because our economy has less wage indexation than exists in the euro area. However, that does not mean that we can afford to ignore the risk that such a damaging spiral could develop here.\n\nFortunately, I do not see signs of this development at this point. Outside of a few booming sectors such as energy, there are no real signs of escalating wage pressures and the two broad measures of national labor compensation that we monitor have shown remarkably small increases recently and over the past year. Taking productivity growth into account, growth in labor costs per unit of output in the overall economy has been quite modest. Moreover, various measures of longer-term inflation expectations suggest that they remain relatively well contained. In summary, it seems clear that inflation risks have diminished somewhat in recent months as commodity prices have come down from their highs. But they have by no means disappeared and are very much at the forefront of the FOMC’s attention.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nThis brings me to my views on monetary policy. The Committee responded to the difficult economic conditions that emerged last year by easing monetary policy substantially, cutting the federal funds rate to 2 percent, which is more than 3 full percentage points below where it was just last summer. Although this rate is low by historical standards, I still don’t consider the stance of monetary policy to be excessively stimulatory. In light of all of the disruptions to the financial system I described, I consider financial conditions to be more restrictive overall now than when the financial crisis struck a year ago. Policy must be calibrated to push through the substantial headwinds the economy faces.\n\nSo, to summarize the outlook, while the economy did well in the second quarter, that strength is unfortunately likely to prove ephemeral. I anticipate sluggish growth in the second half of this year. Overall inflation over the past year has been unacceptably high. But, the prognosis for the not too distant future is favorable. The recent drop in commodity prices has improved the policy choice facing the Committee. However, going forward, it is clear that we must keep a close eye on both inflation and inflation expectations to ensure that we continue to earn the inflation credibility that we have built up over the past two and a half decades.\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1.

        "content": "\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for coming. It is always a pleasure to visit Salt Lake City. Our branch office was established here in 1918, and the Fed’s ties to this community are long and deep. This morning, the directors of our Salt Lake City Board met with their counterparts from Seattle and Portland to discuss economic trends and to share insights on factors affecting the outlook for both our region and the nation as a whole. The Fed’s Twelfth District comprises nine western states, 20 percent of the American population and economy, and one-third of the country’s landmass. We are by far the largest and most diverse Reserve District in the nation, so we rely extensively on our directors—those of our four branches and of our head-office Board in San Francisco—and members of the larger business communities we serve to help us identify emerging economic trends. The main focus of my remarks today will be on conditions in the U.S. economy as a whole and their implications for monetary policy. But I will touch on some of the unique factors that are affecting the Utah economy as well.\n\nRegrettably, the nation’s economy has been in rough waters for over a year now. Last summer, a precipitous slide in house prices triggered a crisis in financial markets and a credit crunch that is making it hard for consumers and some firms to borrow. These developments are ongoing and perhaps deepening, as banks and other financial intermediaries are continuing to delever by scaling back their balance sheets and shrinking their lending activity. Indeed, some sources of funding have completely dried up. In the face of these developments, firms and consumers have also been pulling back, causing unemployment to rise. As if this cycle of events feeding back on each other weren’t bad enough, oil and other commodity prices have surged in recent years, generating worrisome numbers for headline consumer inflation. So, the problems facing the Fed have been myriad, complex, and difficult. We have had to balance concerns about economic weakness with equally compelling, but conflicting, concerns about inflation.\n\nQuite recently, there has been a bit of a shift in the inflation picture, however. Commodity prices—most notably oil prices—have fallen well below their earlier peaks. I will argue that this development probably largely reflects a weakening in economic conditions in many industrialized countries, including European nations and Japan. By reducing the worldwide demand for commodities, weaker global growth should relieve upward pressure on U.S. inflation. Lower commodity prices should also be good for U.S. economic growth, although this benefit is likely to be counterbalanced to some degree by the detrimental effects of slower foreign economic growth on our exports, which have been surging. If commodity prices keep falling—or even if they remain at current levels—the Fed’s objective of promoting both price stability and full employment will become more readily achievable.\n\nBefore I turn to a brief review of where the U.S. economy stands now, I want to remind you that my remarks represent my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nHousing\n\nBecause the “boom and bust” cycle in the housing market was the trigger for many of the developments I’ll be discussing, I would like to start there. Since the end of 2005, outlays for residential construction have been falling at double-digit rates, in inflation-adjusted terms, and house prices have fallen by 15 to 20 percent, depending on the measure you use. In what may be a ray of hope for the future, sales of new homes show tentative signs of stabilizing—albeit at a level that is a mere 40 percent of their 2005 peak—and the pace of price declines has slowed in the past several months, although these prices are still down substantially from year-ago levels.\n\nBehind these national figures, of course, lies considerable geographic diversity. Salt Lake City and Utah have fortunately done much better than the national average in terms of prices; house prices continued to rise at a healthy pace in 2007, and show only modest declines thus far in 2008. Nonetheless, the state is not immune from the housing slump. The pace of home sales in Utah is down substantially since peaking in 2006, and new home construction plummeted at the start of this year.\n\nThe effect of the collapse in the national housing market on our economy has been profound. First, the decline in the pace of housing construction directly subtracted a full percentage point from overall real GDP growth in 2006, 2007, and the first half of this year, and slower economic growth has pushed up the national unemployment rate to 5.7 percent—almost a full percentage point above the level that, in my view, is consistent with “full employment.” Going forward, it seems unlikely that construction activity will pick up any time soon—inventories of unsold homes remain at elevated levels, and although home sales have shown signs of leveling off recently, the volume of sales, as I noted, remains quite weak.\n\nSecond, the drop in house prices has weakened the financial condition of many consumers because the value of their homes is an important part of their wealth and equity in those homes serves as collateral for home equity loans and other types of borrowing. The result is that consumers are likely to spend less, reducing the pace of economic activity. Declining house prices also appear to be the single biggest factor behind the recent rise in mortgage delinquencies and home foreclosures. When families face financial difficulties due to illness, job loss, or divorce, an equity cushion often allows them to get through the hard times by borrowing needed funds or even selling the house. But when home price declines have wiped out home equity or driven it into negative territory, people often end up in delinquency or foreclosure. Indeed, the vitality of the subprime mortgage market appeared to depend on continued home price appreciation, and, of course, it is now in shambles. After posting delinquency rates in the single digits in 2005, around 20 percent of subprime mortgages are currently delinquent or in foreclosure nationwide. Delinquency rates on prime mortgages, which are far lower, are nonetheless also on the rise.\n\nUtah has been fortunate that mortgage delinquencies barely budged during 2007 and early 2008, remaining at historically low levels while they were rising precipitously in other parts of the nation. Home foreclosures in the state have risen over the past few quarters, though, and further increases are likely before the slowdown ends.\n\nFinancial Markets\n\nThe third profound effect of the national housing market collapse, of course, has been felt in the financial markets since last August. Unfortunately, the turmoil is still alive and well, and conditions remain very fragile. For example, spreads between the rates that must be paid by risky borrowers over those on Treasury securities remain very high. The debt ratings for several important bond insurers have been cut, and stock prices for financial institutions have plummeted. We’ve begun to see a growing number of failures of depository institutions—notably IndyMac, which represented the largest failure in decades.\n\nIn addition, many financial markets are still not operating efficiently or effectively. In particular, the market for so-called private-label securitized mortgages of even the highest quality remains moribund. These complex instruments were the primary source of financing for nonconforming residential mortgages, including subprime loans.\n\nOutside of expanded lending by the FHA, there is now little or no lending to higher-risk residential mortgage borrowers. Jumbo mortgages for prime borrowers are available, but at historically high spreads over rates on conventional mortgages, as banks have been reluctant to make these loans. Beyond higher rates, many depositories are tightening the terms of their lending, capping or terminating some home equity loans, and in general trying to reduce their exposure to credit losses by reducing the scale of their lending. Importantly, the government-sponsored agencies—Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the largest of all mortgage lenders—have suffered credit losses and are having to pare back their crucial roles in the mortgage market. The result of all of this is a severe economy-wide credit crunch, comparable to the one that hit the economy in the recession of the early 1990s.\n\nThe story of how falling house prices, and, in particular, their effects on the subprime mortgage market, triggered the problems in financial markets is well-known. At the most basic level, financial market participants suddenly realized that house price declines could result in substantial losses on subprime mortgages through delinquencies and foreclosures, that the extent of those losses was highly uncertain, and that the complexity of mortgage-backed securities and the collateralized debt obligations incorporating them made it difficult to know which participants would suffer the losses.\n\nThe story of how these problems will ultimately be resolved is far less clear. Obviously, it would help a lot if house prices stopped falling. But even though the rate of decline of house prices has shown signs of moderating, it still appears that these prices will keep heading down for some time. The ratio of house prices to rents—a kind of price-dividend ratio for housing—still remains high by historical standards, despite having fallen substantially from its historical peak in early 2006, suggesting that further price declines are needed to bring housing markets into long-run balance. Moreover, large inventories of unsold homes can be expected to continue to put downward pressure on housing prices. In view of these factors, it’s not surprising that the futures market for house prices predicts further declines this year.\n\nGoing forward, the ability and willingness of commercial banks and other intermediaries to extend credit depends in part on their capital levels, which have been harmed by large losses, and their capacity to expand equity capital. It is encouraging that financial institutions have raised a considerable amount of new capital over the past year. Even so, balance sheet pressures and broader financial market dislocations may well be with us for some time. My guess is that market functioning will improve in 2009, but things could get worse before they get better. One major concern is that home prices could fall more than markets now expect, leading to larger losses for financial institutions, which would further impair their ability to make new loans. The deepening of the credit crunch could then lead to further declines in house prices, intensifying the adverse feedback loop that seems to be operating in our economy.\n\nCommodities\n\nBeyond the many repercussions of falling house prices, another factor putting a damper on economic activity has been surging prices for commodities, including energy, food and metals. There’s plenty of debate about where this surge in commodity prices came from. Indeed, some have argued that speculative trading in commodity markets is the main cause. Personally, I’m not yet persuaded by that explanation. For example, if speculators were important in driving prices up, then inventories would have risen as these speculators sought to profit from future sales at higher prices. However, inventories have instead been declining in most commodity markets, apparently reflecting high fundamental demand from buyers who actually use the commodities in the production of other products.\n\nIn fact, in general, I’m more persuaded by arguments based on the fundamentals of demand and supply—and I think they explain not only much of the run-up in commodity prices, but also the recent declines. In the run-up, demand was boosted by rapid worldwide economic growth, with China and other developing countries accounting for a good deal of the increase. At the same time, new supplies of oil have been harder to come by. As for food prices, supply has been constrained by a number of factors, including drought conditions that hampered wheat production in Australia, and demand for biofuels that has diverted crops away from food usage.\n\nThe fundamental forces of supply and demand can also explain the drop in energy and some other commodity prices since June. Most important is that the demand for commodities has most likely fallen in response to a weakening of economic growth in many industrialized countries. Economic growth of industrialized countries slowed markedly in the second quarter. In fact, growth was only barely positive in the OECD bloc as a whole. The OECD is a Paris-based organization comprising 30 developed nations. Japan, France, Germany and Italy all experienced outright contractions. Moreover, prospects for growth do not appear to be that good for the second half of this year; for example, the OECD Economic Outlook projects growth of only 1¼ percent for Japan, the euro area, and the total of 30 OECD countries in this period.\n\nSeveral factors are behind the worsening outlook abroad. First, as in the U.S., higher oil and food prices have cut into consumer spending. Second, although most of Europe had little subprime lending of its own, deteriorating U.S. financial market conditions have affected banks and markets abroad that invested in structured products originated in the U.S.; this is particularly true for banks in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany, and France. As in the U.S., this exposure has led to higher funding costs, tighter bank lending standards, and wider spreads for riskier borrowers. Third, several countries, including Spain, Ireland, and the U.K., have experienced their own housing booms and downturns, creating further stress on their banking sectors. Fourth, slower growth in the U.S. and the appreciation of their currencies against the dollar will tend to dampen European and Japanese exports.\n\nFinally, monetary policy in Europe has been less accommodative during this period than in the U.S. For example, while the Fed cut its target interest rate substantially to 2 percent during the course of the credit crisis that began last summer, the European Central Bank kept its policy interest rate steady throughout, and then tightened by 25 basis points to 4¼ percent in July. Part of the reason for the difference is that the European Central Bank’s mandate requires it to focus on controlling headline inflation, which reached 4 percent for the twelve months ending in July—a rate well above its official objective of below, but close to 2 percent. In addition, even though much of the recent increase in inflation is attributable to commodity prices, and therefore likely to be a temporary phenomenon, the central bank has been worried about second-round effects on inflation expectations, wages, and other costs, and justifiably so. The euro zone has a greater degree of wage indexation and collective bargaining than the U.S.2 So it is more likely that higher headline inflation will fairly quickly get built into wages there, setting off a wage-price spiral that could be persistent and difficult to stop.\n\nNow that growth appears to be weakening outside the United States, and prospects for inflation have improved with recent declines in commodity prices, financial markets have revised down expected future levels of interest rates in the euro zone and elsewhere. As a result, in recent months the course of the dollar has changed from the steady decline over the prior six years to an appreciation. A stronger dollar will tend to weaken demand for our exports, reinforcing the effects of weaker growth abroad.\n\nU.S. Outlook\n\nNow let me turn to the outlook for our own economy, starting with a brief look at conditions in Utah. This state had been among the nation’s fastest-growing in recent years; indeed in 2007, the pace of real GDP growth here—5¼ percent—placed it first among all states. Not surprisingly, Utah also has had one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation over the past few years. However, the national slowdown now seems to have caught up with Utah’s economy. Growth in the state has slowed noticeably this year, and the more general slowdown in national consumer spending and travel activity has been reflected in a drop in visitor counts and hotel occupancy rates in the state in recent months.\n\nTurning to the national economy, it was recently reported that growth in the second quarter came in at a fairly robust rate of 3¼ percent. This seems like good news–especially considering what the economy has just been through. Growth slowed sharply in the fourth quarter of last year, and, indeed, the data show that activity actually contracted slightly. Though growth turned positive in the first quarter, it was tepid at best.\n\nWhile one might be tempted to interpret the recent strong numbers as a sign that things are turning around, there are three important reasons to think that the strength will not hold up, and that economic performance will be decidedly subpar in the second half of the year. First, consumer spending in the second quarter came in at only a moderate rate, even though it was boosted by substantial tax rebates. But there are no plans in place to repeat those rebates, so by the fourth quarter, the economy will no longer benefit from that fiscal stimulus.\n\nSecond, export growth alone contributed one-half of the total real GDP growth registered in the second quarter. This element has been an important source of strength in our economy for over a year, being buoyed by strong growth abroad and by the weakening of the dollar. However, as I discussed, in recent months the dollar has risen somewhat and economic growth in many of our industrialized trading partners has slowed or even turned negative, suggesting that we can no longer count on exports as an important source of strength.\n\nThird, the problems in the housing markets, financial markets, and labor markets continue to be a drag on growth and employment. Fortunately, the recent fall in commodity prices should help to cushion some of this downward pressure on activity.\n\nOverall, I anticipate that real GDP growth in the second half of this year will come in below the growth of potential output which implies that the unemployment rate will rise. On its own, this obviously is not good news. And its interaction with the housing and financial markets raises the potential for worse news—a deepening of the adverse feedback loop I’ve been describing: more unemployment causing more people to fall behind on their mortgage payments, leading to further delinquencies and foreclosures, tighter credit conditions and further downward pressure on activity and employment. This kind of process represents a downside risk for the economy, especially if it intensifies the sagging consumer and business confidence we’ve seen.\n\nNow let me turn to inflation where recent performance has been a serious concern. As of July, the headline PCE Price Index was up by a whopping 4¼ percent over the past year, compared to 2½ percent over the prior year. An important reason why inflation was so high, of course, was because of the steep increases we experienced in food and energy prices. Moreover, the rise in commodity prices raised the costs of the wide array of businesses that use them as inputs and some have responded by passing those cost increases through to their own prices. The consequence is that core inflation, which excludes food and energy is also up. The core PCE Price Index rose by 2½ percent over the past twelve months, which is somewhat above the range that I consider consistent with price stability, but close to its pace of increase over the last several years.\n\nWhat can we expect going forward? Headline inflation is likely to remain much higher than I would like for a quarter or two as previous increases in commodity prices boost the prices paid by consumers for food and energy. With regard to core inflation, I wouldn’t be surprised if it runs modestly higher for a while, too, as businesses pass on some of their higher energy, transportation, and other costs to customers. However, for several reasons, I expect both headline and core inflation to move down to a much more moderate rate of just over 2 percent next year.\n\nOne obvious reason is the recent decline in commodity prices, and the prospect that they will remain at present levels, thus ceasing to put direct upward pressure on headline inflation. Indeed, commodity prices may drop further. While this is by no means certain, it does seem more likely than it did just a few months ago since the odds have risen that activity in most industrialized economies will weaken further, translating into downward pressure on commodity prices. Furthermore, the current slack in labor and product markets—together with prospects for more slack in the future—will impart some downward pressure on the growth of labor compensation. The pace of wage and salary increases has been modest and stable in recent years and a weak labor market may cause it to decline even further.\n\nBut there is more to inflation than these direct pressures. We also have to pay close attention to inflation expectations and the dynamics that they can generate. If the public were to conclude that the recent experience of high inflation will be long-lasting and not temporary, then workers might demand higher compensation and firms might satisfy those demands, setting off a wage-price dynamic that would be costly to unwind. I argued earlier that such a wage-price spiral was less likely here than in Europe because our economy has less wage indexation than exists in the euro area. However, that does not mean that we can afford to ignore the risk that such a damaging spiral could develop here.\n\nFortunately, I do not see signs of this development at this point. First, the reports of our directors and business contacts are consistent with the view that no such dynamic has taken hold. Outside of a few booming sectors such as energy, we hear no reports of escalating wage pressures even though higher food and energy prices have eroded the real incomes of American workers. Our contacts note that high unemployment is holding down labor turnover, suppressing the need to raise wages more rapidly. The two broad measures of national labor compensation that we monitor have shown remarkably small increases recently and over the past year. Taking productivity growth into account, growth in labor costs per unit of output in the overall economy has been quite modest.\n\nMoreover, various measures of longer-term inflation expectations suggest that they remain relatively well contained. With the recent decline in commodity prices, inflation expectations for the next five years have edged down slightly in both the Michigan Survey of households and the Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of Professional Forecasters. Furthermore, since June, compensation for inflation and inflation risk over the next five years—as measured in markets for Treasury Inflation Protected Securities—has dropped noticeably and is now under 2 percent. For the period from 5 to 10 years ahead, compensation has dropped a bit and remains at the lower end of its trading range of recent years. In summary, it seems clear that inflation risks have diminished somewhat in recent months as commodity prices have come down from their highs. But they have by no means disappeared and are very much at the forefront of the FOMC’s attention.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nThis brings me to my views on monetary policy. The Committee responded to the difficult economic conditions that emerged last year by easing monetary policy substantially, cutting the federal funds rate to 2 percent, which is more than 3 full percentage points below where it was just last summer. Today, there is a great deal of debate about just how accommodative the stance of policy actually is. This issue is especially acute given that the Fed has been facing a difficult policy choice, with risks to both economic activity and inflation.\n\nIn measuring the stance of policy, it’s common to look at the real federal funds rate—the nominal rate less a measure of the rate of inflation that is likely to prevail over the period ahead. For inflation, I have tended to use core PCE price inflation, that is, without the effects of food and energy prices. Of course, food and energy are important costs faced by consumers, but I think it appropriate to exclude them in this computation because, as I argued, their effects on overall inflation are likely to be temporary. As a result, recent core inflation is often a good indicator of future overall inflation. In my view, this is true right now. As I said earlier, core PCE price inflation averaged 2½ percent over the past year, well below the 4¼ percent headline number, but I’m expecting both core and headline inflation to come in a bit over 2 percent in 2009 as a whole.\n\nDoing the math leaves us with a slightly negative real federal funds rate. Does this mean that policy is highly accommodative? Normally, a negative real funds rate would imply that the answer is “yes” because it is typically associated with low borrowing costs and easy credit terms—that is, easy overall financial conditions. But, as I discussed, overall financial conditions are probably more restrictive now than when the financial crisis struck a year ago, so the slightly negative real funds rate does not imply a highly accommodative policy stance. In other words, policy must be calibrated to push through the substantial headwinds the economy faces. While the economy did well in the second quarter, that strength, as I indicated, is likely to prove ephemeral. My forecast is for sluggish growth in the second half of this year, with substantial downside risks—especially emanating from the financial system.\n\nOverall inflation over the past year has been unacceptably high. But, the prognosis going forward is favorable. Inflation expectations remain relatively well contained, reducing the chance that a wage-price spiral will develop. Moreover, if new lower commodity prices hold, even at today’s high levels, we are likely to see improvements in overall and core consumer inflation coming through the pipeline soon.\n\nIn summary, the recent drop in commodity prices has improved the policy choice facing the Committee. However, going forward, it is clear that we must keep a close eye on both inflation and inflation expectations to ensure that we continue to earn the inflation credibility that we have built up over the past two and a half decades.\n\n# # #\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1. I would like to thank the Economic Research staff for support in preparing these remarks and, in particular, John Judd, Reuven Glick, Rob Valletta, and Judith Goff.\n\n2. According to the ECB, wage indexation exists for roughly 13 percent of workers in France, 2/3 in Spain and Cyprus, and 100 percent in Belgium and Luxembourg (“Wage growth dispersion across the euro area countries,” ECB Occasional Paper No. 90, July 2008). In other cases, wages are indirectly linked to inflation through collective bargaining agreements. For example, the IG Metal trade union negotiated a 5.2 percent wage increase in the German steel industry. Other sectors, such as the automotive industry or the civil service, also won wage increases above 4 percent.\n\nIn the euro zone, 18 percent of private sector workers and 22 percent of all workers are unionized. In the U.S., 7.5 percent of private sector workers and 12 percent of all workers are unionized. Moreover, in Europe, big unions often engage in centralized negotiations with employer associations to set wages for large sectors of the labor force (WSJ, Aug. 22, 2008).\n\n"

        "content": "\n\nGood afternoon everyone. It is a pleasure to be here today. On behalf of my colleagues at the San Francisco Fed, I would like to thank you for taking the time to participate in this symposium, and more specifically, to engage in a discussion of what strategies are needed to stabilize communities in the wake of foreclosures. This discussion is critical: not only to minimize the negative impacts of foreclosure on borrowers and neighborhoods, but also to help promote local and regional economic recovery and growth.\n\nThe rapid rise in mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures has had significant negative ripple effects, and not just at the neighborhood level. My colleagues and I have been assessing the impact of these trends on the financial markets and the U.S. economy. Last week, in both San Diego and Portland, I shared my views on how the current credit crunch, the downturn in the housing market, and rising commodity prices are affecting the economic outlook. From my perspective as a monetary policymaker, these developments pose serious challenges and will require vigilance both in monitoring events going forward and in acting as needed to achieve our dual mandate of low and stable inflation and maximum sustainable employment and economic growth.\n\nIn my remarks today, I will take a broader perspective, reflecting not only some of the other responsibilities of a Reserve Bank president, but also a more personal perspective. I have been, and remain, deeply concerned about the impact that foreclosures are having on families and neighborhoods, and the long-term implications of foreclosure for low-income communities, particularly within the Federal Reserve’s 12th District.\n\nThey say “a picture is worth a thousand words,” so let me begin with a few slides that illustrate the scale of foreclosures in our District. While some communities have been struggling with high rates of foreclosure for some time, 1 the recent rise in delinquencies and foreclosures in Arizona, California, and Nevada has been sudden and substantial. Data from the Mortgage Bankers Association show that at the start of 2006, these states had among the lowest foreclosure rates in the country; by the first quarter of this year, they were among the top five states in the nation in overall foreclosure rates.\n\nMoreover, as the following national maps show, the number of communities affected by foreclosures has grown dramatically in a very short time. In September of 2007, data at the zip code level on the percent of loans in foreclosure, as well as properties held by lenders or servicers as “real estate owned,” or “REOs,” showed high foreclosure rates in some areas, particularly in Midwestern states, but also in some distinct hotspots in California’s Central Valley, Florida, and Colorado. Data from April of this year, however, show that the crisis has intensified significantly. This map paints a daunting picture for many regions of the country, but it is hard to ignore the wave of foreclosures and REOs in California’s Central Valley and Inland Empire, as well as in the cities of Las Vegas and Phoenix. At a more localized level, cities such as Los Angeles are also struggling with areas of concentrated foreclosures and REOs, while other neighborhoods seem less affected by the crisis.\n\nThe impacts of these foreclosures are devastating on a number of levels. For borrowers, foreclosures can exact significant costs and hardships, involving not only the loss of home equity and impaired credit, but also potentially limiting access to stable, decent housing and disrupting labor market participation.\n\nIn addition, as foreclosures have become increasingly concentrated in certain neighborhoods, they threaten to have significant negative spillover effects on the wider community. Research indicates that foreclosures tend to reduce the value of nearby properties significantly, especially when vacancies drag out and the local housing market is weak.  In such neighborhoods, “For Sale” signs become bad omens of a self-reinforcing cycle of decline—more homes for sale put downward pressure on the local housing market that in turn can lead to yet more defaults and foreclosures. While more research is needed to get a better handle on the size of these impacts, there is no doubt that the mortgage crisis is contributing to a loss of equity for a large number of homeowners in low-income communities, and that it threatens to undermine ongoing neighborhood revitalization efforts.\n\nWe are also beginning to see direct impacts from foreclosures and the concurrent decline in house values on municipal budgets. For example, there’s the loss of tax revenue associated with vacant properties, and there are rising costs associated with foreclosure-related services, such as increased policing to deter crime around abandoned properties. As declining property taxes and transfer fees shrink local government revenues, vital services to low- and moderate-income families may also suffer.\n\nWhat this means is that the foreclosure crisis is likely to have profound impacts on low-income communities, with effects that go well beyond the housing sector. And countering them will require more robust and direct responses—at both the local and federal level.\n\nBefore turning to the issue of how to respond to rising neighborhood foreclosures, I would like to emphasize that the Federal Reserve views the high rate of mortgage foreclosures as an urgent problem and preventing unnecessary foreclosures should be a key priority for both the private and public sectors. Our goal should be to keep existing owners in their homes wherever possible as a way of avoiding the significant costs of foreclosure. Over the past year, much emphasis has been placed on improving borrower outreach through public service announcements and community events, developing systematic and streamlined approaches to restructuring adjustable rate loans, and creating new refinance options to help borrowers shift into more sustainable loan products. These efforts are having some success. To use California as an example, according to data reported by the HOPE NOW Alliance, in the 1st quarter of 2008, approximately 11,500 borrowers received a modification to their loan terms, while another 20,500 entered into formal repayment plans. 2 While these efforts are important and reflect significant progress, I would note that in the state we had about same number of foreclosure sales, 32,000 in the 1st quarter, according data from HOPE NOW. Also, the scale of the loan modifications and repayment plans to date are small compared to the volume of loans that are 60 or more days delinquent—an estimated 186,000 loans in California alone. It is critical that we continue to explore a broader range of interventions that would help keep families in their homes, including efforts to give servicers more flexibility in the loan modification process.\n\nAt the same time, we need to maintain a perspective on what can be achieved in terms of foreclosure prevention, and many communities are already grappling with large numbers of foreclosures. The reasons for this jump in foreclosures are complex and intertwined, yet research at the San Francisco Fed finds that house price declines have been the most important determinant of mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures. 3 Areas of Arizona, California, and Nevada have all seen dramatic adjustments in house prices. By one index (Standard & Poor’s Case Shiller House Price Index), house prices here in Los Angeles are down over 25 percent from the peak in late 2006 (September). While there likely has been some feedback from foreclosures to house prices in various markets, most of the decline in house values to date reflects a realignment of prices that had risen sharply relative to fundamentals during the earlier housing boom. The potential for further realignment and, thus, lower house prices will make it that much more difficult to limit foreclosures.\n\nThat is why this symposium on responding to the foreclosures that have already occurred and will occur is so important. The central question driving this symposium is: how can we best minimize the negative impacts of these foreclosures on cities, neighborhoods, and families?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this question, and our hope is that this symposium will give you the opportunity to discuss emerging strategies and develop solutions that can help to overcome the challenges that nonprofits, municipalities, and lenders face in responding to this still unfolding, multi-faceted crisis. Let me just raise a few of the issues that the symposium will help to address.\n\nThe first issue—and perhaps the most formidable—is identifying sources of funding to allow either nonprofits or local governments to acquire and rehab foreclosed properties where needed. Several of the workshop panelists will be describing their efforts to leverage investment and subsidies—both public and private—for the redevelopment of foreclosed properties. Some are diverting existing funds for housing to respond to rising foreclosures, while others are tapping into financing tools such as equity equivalent, or EQ2 investments, New Markets Tax Credits, and loan pools to generate much needed capital. In addition, many of you have been involved in developing federal and state legislation that would direct funding to help communities reduce downward pressure on local housing markets. Given the significant negative spillover effects of foreclosures, I believe that there is a strong case for directing public funding to the acquisition and rehab of REO properties. Yet questions remain regarding the targeting of these types of funds, and determining how they can best be directed to neighborhoods most in need of public subsidy. One particularly important question is how to respond to foreclosures that are occurring in suburban neighborhoods in areas like the Central Valley, which saw rapid construction and growth during the housing boom. How will interventions in these areas need to differ from those in older, low-income neighborhoods within the urban core?\n\nThe second objective of this symposium is to help foster the partnerships that will be needed to implement comprehensive acquisition and redevelopment strategies. The complexity and scale of the foreclosure issue calls for broad cross-sectoral partnerships among nonprofits, community development financial institutions, lenders, real estate professionals, and government agencies, both locally and nationally. In addition, local organizations and government agencies will need to develop new capacities to manage and redevelop large numbers of foreclosed properties. Changes in institutional structures within financial institutions will be necessary as well, especially to promote flexibility in working with nonprofits and the public sector on this issue. The current nature of pooling and servicing agreements—which often include a variety of levels of authorization and interests—can not only thwart loan modification efforts, but also limit the ability of servicers to negotiate with governmental agencies and nonprofits for discounted sales of REO properties.\n\nThird, the symposium sets out the ambitious goal of thinking about how the current crisis can be used as an opportunity to expand the supply of affordable housing. Despite recent price declines, housing affordability remains a critical issue in many parts of the12th District. 4 During this symposium, we’ll ask you to be creative in wrestling with a number of issues related to expanding affordability. How can we convert foreclosed properties into affordable rental or homeownership opportunities? Is it possible to develop strategies that can keep delinquent borrowers in their homes—perhaps under lease-to-purchase agreements— thereby avoiding foreclosure and contributing to family and neighborhood stability at the same time? The current environment of tighter credit and underwriting standards means that we also need to develop new products and programs that can help low-income families access responsible loans going forward. We should not view the current crisis as justification to abandon the goal of expanding access to credit among low-income households, since access to credit, and the subsequent ability to buy a home, remains one of the most important mechanisms we have to help low-income families build wealth over the long term. 5\n\nConclusion\n\nLet me close by emphasizing the Federal Reserve’s commitment to addressing the mortgage and foreclosure crisis on multiple fronts as part of our Homeownership and Mortgage Initiatives. On Monday, the Federal Reserve Board issued its new Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, or HOEPA regulations, which are designed to strengthen protections for borrowers and to prohibit unfair and deceptive practices in the mortgage market. Importantly, the new regulations establish a new category of “higher-priced mortgages, and prohibit a lender from making a loan without regard to borrowers’ ability to repay the loan from income and assets other than the home’s value. Moreover, to show that a lender violated this prohibition, a borrower does not need to demonstrate that it is part of a “pattern or practice.” In addition, the rules place tighter restrictions on prepayment penalties. 6\n\nThe Federal Reserve is also leveraging its strengths in data analysis and research, and many of the Reserve Banks are publishing new papers that can help us to understand the multi-faceted nature of the current mortgage crisis. Finally, in addition to our regional outreach events that aim to educate stakeholders about foreclosure trends and support local foreclosure prevention efforts, we have also launched a System-wide partnership with NeighborWorks America to share best practices from across the country for mitigating the impact of foreclosures on communities.\n\nThis symposium is one part of the Fed’s efforts in this area, and is part of a Federal Reserve System conference series, Recovery, Renewal, Rebuilding, that seeks to develop and disseminate innovative strategies and policies that can help to address the broad range of challenges related to the rise in mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures.  At the San Francisco Fed, we decided that, given the scale of foreclosures in communities in Arizona, California, and Nevada, it would be most important to focus the discussion primarily on the issue of redeveloping foreclosed properties into affordable housing. Over the next day and a half, practitioners from across the country have agreed to share the models that they are developing; some are already well on their way to acquiring and redeveloping REO properties, while others are still figuring out how to raise capital or structure holding companies. The goal of this symposium is to provide all of you with the chance to share your ideas, your successes and your failures, and to learn from your colleagues in other cities. We hope that you find that these discussions are productive, and we look forward to disseminating the best practices that emerge from this symposium through our website and publications, so that others grappling with foreclosures in their communities can benefit as well. Thank you for your time, and I hope you enjoy the rest of the conference.\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1.

        "content": "\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you very much for coming. The topic of my talk today is the nation’s economic outlook. I recently returned from a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, where we voted to leave our policy target, the federal funds rate, unchanged for the time being. The discussion around the table focused on three developments that for some time have been presenting serious challenges to the Federal Reserve in meeting its dual mandate of low and stable inflation and maximum sustainable employment and economic growth. These three developments, of course, are the housing slump, the financial market turmoil and ensuing credit crunch, and the surge in commodity prices, especially oil prices.\n\nToday I’d like to give you my own perspective on these developments, focusing on where things stand now, their likely impact on the near-term outlook for economic activity and inflation, and their implications for monetary policy.\n\nBefore discussing the current economic situation—that is, where things stand now—let me set the stage by describing briefly how we got here. To get a little fanciful with the stage-setting metaphor for a moment, it is a bit like the opening of Macbeth, with the three ghastly witches brewing up trouble amid thunder and lightning—only here, the three troublemakers are the housing market, the financial markets, and commodity prices. The housing market has been declining for a few years now. For example, residential investment has fallen by more than a third, in inflation-adjusted terms, since the end of 2005. And house prices have tumbled—according to the various Case-Shiller home price indices, they are down some 15 to 20 percent over the past two years. For the first couple of years, the housing downturn appears to have had remarkably few spillovers to the rest of the economy in terms of curtailed spending. However, knock-on effects to the financial sector were brewing, for as house prices continued to fall, home mortgage delinquencies started to rise. Indeed, the subprime mortgage market, which took off after 2001 and ran strong through late 2005 largely on the expectation of continued home price appreciation, is now in shambles. After posting delinquency rates in the single digits in 2005, around 20 percent of subprime mortgages are currently delinquent or in foreclosure nationwide.\n\nLast summer, it became clear that losses on subprime and other mortgages would be far higher than markets had anticipated. This realization contributed to a broad reappraisal of credit market risks, which sparked the severe, ongoing financial market crisis and credit crunch.\n\nMeanwhile, prices for oil and other commodities have continued a breathtaking rise. The average retail gasoline price was about $1.10/gallon at the beginning of 2002 and is now above $4 a gallon. Food prices also spiked in early 2007.\n\nWeighed down by these growing troubles, the economy slowed sharply starting in the fourth quarter of last year. Indeed, in the first quarter of this year, the growth rate of consumer spending slowed to its lowest pace since the 2001 recession, and business fixed investment stalled. On the consumer side, falling home and equity values have eroded household wealth. Employment has fallen steadily since late last year, reducing disposable income. In addition, surging food and gas prices mean that the income people have gotten doesn’t go as far. So it’s not surprising that consumer sentiment has soured on the economy. On the business side, the slowdown in demand, the elevated levels of uncertainty,2 and tight financing conditions have continued to weigh on investment.\n\nIn the face of these adverse developments, the recent strength of spending data has been somewhat reassuring. The pace of consumer spending, in particular, has been surprisingly robust of late, fueled in part by tax rebates. The spending appeared to be broad-based, with the not-so-surprising exception of motor vehicles, where sales have been very weak in recent months. On the business side, orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft also look to have rebounded somewhat in recent months. In addition, export growth has been a continuing bright spot. It has been buoyed by continued strong growth abroad and by the weakening of the dollar. The strong incoming data on spending ease my concerns somewhat about the intensity of the slowdown. However, a few months of data don’t make a trend, particularly because we can’t be sure how large the effects of the roughly $100 billion temporary tax rebate program have been. About $50 billion of the rebates were sent out in May.\n\nInflation has become an increasing concern. Over the past twelve months, the personal consumption expenditures—or PCE—price index rose 3.1 percent, up from 2.4 percent over the prior year. An important reason for these disappointing numbers, of course, is the rise in commodity prices. Some of those increases may have also passed through to core PCE price inflation, which excludes food and energy. This measure has averaged 2.1 percent over the past twelve months, which is slightly above the range that I consider consistent with price stability, but very close to its pace of increase over the last several years.\n\nLet me say a few words on how conditions in Oregon compare with the national economy. After bouncing back in the wake of the 2001 recession, Oregon has seen relatively strong economic growth compared with the rest of the country. Since 2002, real economic growth in the state has averaged about 4.5 percent per year, well above the national pace, and the unemployment rate has fallen from the highest in the nation during much of 2002-2003 to close to the national average more recently.\n\nLike much of the country, however, growth in Oregon slowed in 2007 and has continued to decelerate thus far in 2008. The manufacturing sector accounts for an unusually high share of economic activity in the state—nearly double the share nationwide—and several of the state’s manufacturing sectors have been struggling of late. One particularly notable group is manufacturers of wood products, who have been forced to slash production and jobs as the housing boom turned to bust. Local makers of IT equipment also have reduced payrolls, as competition in this sector has stiffened.\n\nThese negatives have been offset by some important positives. Mirroring the key role of the manufacturing sector, the share of exports in Oregon’s state economy is unusually large and highly oriented towards the fast-growing economies of East Asia. Given the reduced exchange value of the dollar and strong growth conditions overseas, exports from the state have grown rapidly over the past few years. Moreover, while IT equipment makers have been struggling this year, the smaller IT software and services sector has been expanding rapidly, partly offsetting the losses on the hardware side. This view from Oregon highlights the point that, although the macroeconomic effects of the shocks hitting the economy are felt broadly, they are not felt evenly—either in Oregon or anywhere else.\n\nReturning to the national outlook, the key questions looking forward are: when will economic activity get back to normal? And when will inflationary pressures moderate? The answers to these questions depend, to a great extent, on how conditions in the housing, financial, and commodity markets evolve. Let me discuss each of them in turn, beginning with housing.\n\nHousing\n\nChanges in housing prices are inextricably linked to household wealth, which in turn affects consumer spending, as well as prospects for housing construction. Unfortunately, it appears to me that there are at least three reasons for thinking that housing prices have further to fall. First, the ratio of house prices to rents—a kind of price-dividend ratio for housing— still remains quite high by historical standards, despite having fallen from its historical peak reached in early 2006. That suggests that further price declines may be needed to bring housing markets into balance. Second, inventories of unsold homes remain at elevated levels. This “excess supply” of available homes will put downward pressure on housing prices. Indeed, these inventories are likely to directly depress construction activity, since there is little point in building new homes when there is already a large backlog of unsold homes. Third, the futures market for house prices predicts further declines in a number of metropolitan areas this year. In particular, the Case-Shiller composite index for home prices shows a 15 to 20 percent year-over-year decline in the second half of this year. The bottom line is that construction spending and house prices seem likely to continue to fall well into 2009.\n\nCompared with most of the country and especially parts of the West, the Portland metro area joined the housing party late and may end up with less of a hangover. The pace of home price appreciation was slower in Portland than in the U.S. from 1998 until 2005. Indeed, as things were beginning to cool nationally, the pace remained strong here in 2006 up to the latter half of 2007. Since then, prices appreciation has been flat or down as much as 6 percent, depending on what index you look at.\n\nOne factor that helped sustain housing markets here is the state’s relatively limited exposure to the sub-prime mortgage crisis. In 2006, the share of sub-primes in new mortgages was about one-fifth in Portland and Oregon, versus one-third or more in some of the hardest hit areas of California, Arizona, and Nevada. However, the pace of sales has fallen significantly, and mortgage delinquencies and home foreclosures have been rising since late 2006 in the state, although they have remained well below their levels in the nation as a whole. Therefore, while Oregon is likely to emerge from the national housing crisis in better shape than most of the country, there is still a ways to go. And, as with the rest of the country, it seems likely that further unpleasant adjustments in ownership and equity will be necessary before the housing market stabilizes.\n\nFinancial Markets\n\nThe ongoing fall in house prices has important implications for the financial markets, and it is one reason that we may continue to get troubling news from that part of the economy. As I mentioned, falling house prices and, in particular, their effects on the subprime market, helped trigger the financial market crisis last August. At that time, the Fed and other central banks took the first steps to pump substantial volumes of reserves into the system to respond to the surge in demand for liquidity. These and other further actions helped alleviate some of the stress in financial markets. But earlier this year, renewed stress culminated in the near failure of Bear Stearns in March. Again, the Fed took actions to avert the peril that such a failure could have posed for financial markets and the real economy. Since then, market stress has subsided to some degree, and better quality borrowers are still able to get credit. For example, investment-grade corporate bond issuance has been very strong in recent months, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been able to issue substantial quantities of mortgage-backed securities.\n\nBut markets remain very fragile. For example, credit-default-swap spreads for many financial institutions are again on the rise, the debt ratings for several important bond insurers have been cut, and stock prices for financial institutions have plummeted.\n\nThere is further evidence that financial markets are still not operating efficiently or effectively. In particular, the market for private-label securitized mortgages of even the highest quality remains moribund. These securities were the primary source of financing for nonconforming residential mortgages, including subprime lending. Outside of the expanded FHA lending, there is little or no lending to higher-risk residential mortgage borrowers. Jumbo mortgages for prime borrowers are available, but at historically high spreads over rates on conventional mortgages, as banks have been reluctant to make these loans.\n\nUnfortunately, progress toward sturdier and more efficient financial markets is going to take some time, and that means the flow of credit is likely to remain impeded. Let me explain by using a plumbing metaphor. For one thing, it’s going to take time to clear the pipes of the problem debt. The gyrations in the prices of a number of securities suggest that there are still hitches in the price discovery process. This may not be surprising given that there is still a good deal of uncertainty about the valuation of complex, nontransparent financial instruments. There also is considerable uncertainty about the extent of the ultimate losses and the exposure of different institutions. In the case of residential mortgages, where delinquency rates are still rising, the single most important determinant of performance has been the pace of house price changes.3 But no one is sure how much more house prices will fall, or how that will affect delinquency rates on mortgages. The considerable uncertainty has added to the difficulty of valuing the underlying mortgages and related asset-backed securities. Credit quality problems also are emerging outside residential mortgages. At commercial banks, for example, delinquencies are now rising almost across the board. Especially notable is the rise in delinquency rates on construction loans that is affecting even institutions that had steered clear of the subprime market.\n\nMoreover, it is not just a matter of clearing the pipes of the problem debt. The plumbing itself needs to be redesigned and rebuilt. Indeed, to deal with some of the vulnerabilities laid bare by the turmoil over the past year requires some restructuring in parts of the financial market and the channels for allocating credit. Key areas of change include the originate-to-distribute model and securitization used to finance higher-risk mortgage debt, financial risk management, re-intermediation and deleveraging more generally, and regulation and oversight of financial markets.\n\nLet me take these one at a time. First, securitization was a key driver of the credit expansion. Financial institutions originated loans that they then bundled into securities and sold to other investors. With hindsight, it is clear that this originate-to-distribute model suffered severe incentive problems—the originator had insufficient incentive to ensure the quality of the loans, since someone else ultimately held them. Conflicts of interest and moral hazard problems also are nested in the many other linkages in the securitization process. 4 Before private-label mortgage securitization can recover, financial markets must design mechanisms to align the incentives of originators with the interests of the ultimate investors. Second, there was a widespread failure of risk management, both in terms of liquidity and credit risk. An important shortcoming in credit risk management was an excessive reliance on what turned out to be flawed assessments of risk by rating agencies of certain asset-backed securities. Investors, even large sophisticated financial institutions, did not take adequate steps to assess risk independently. The lack of transparency in the credit process and the complexity of many of the newer financial products did not help. Third, even with changes in contracting and financial modeling, the re-intermediation process and deleveraging more generally is likely to continue. Re-intermediation involves a larger share of financing held in the portfolios of institutions such as commercial banks and less by other investors holding securitized assets. The re-intermediation is part of deleveraging—that is less reliance on debt and more on equity financing—to the extent banks tend to hold more capital than other less regulated financial institutions. We also will likely see less leverage in financing more generally. That is certainly evidenced by the greater shares of equity required in leveraged buyouts, as the pendulum is swinging back from the leveraged financing run amok that we saw even as late as the first part of 2007. While these changes can improve the functioning of credit markets, they also likely will mean that the cost of credit will be higher going forward. Finally, policymakers are likely to revise the regulatory and supervisory environment in ways that will affect the structure, functioning, and oversight of financial markets, and that, too, will not be a speedy or simple process.\n\nDuring the transition, financial institutions are struggling against forces that have expanded their balance sheets even as they have sought to deleverage. Borrowers have tapped outstanding credit lines, institutions have booked leveraged loans that they couldn’t sell, and banks have brought onto their books assets from off-balance-sheet funding conduits. The potential for further pressures on capital, along with institutions’ lower tolerance for risk and concern about economic conditions, has resulted in banks tightening credit conditions for virtually all borrowers. In recent weeks, large banks have been cutting back on lending.\n\nGoing forward, the ability and willingness of commercial banks and other intermediaries to extend credit depends in part on their capacity to expand equity capital internally and externally. The encouraging news is that large commercial banks, investment banks, and mortgage specialists have, to some extent, been able to issue new equity capital and to rebuild capital positions that have come under pressure from a combination of losses and growth in assets.\n\nThe balance-sheet pressures, and broader financial market dislocations, are likely to be with us for some time. My expectation is that market functioning will improve markedly by 2009. But things could get worse before they get better. For example, home prices could fall more than markets expect, leading to larger losses for financial institutions and further impairing their ability to make new loans. The credit crunch could then lead to further declines in house prices. The resulting decline in household wealth could then further reduce spending, leading to additional knock-on effects. So an adverse feedback loop could develop, with consequences for both financial markets and economic activity.\n\nCommodities\n\nAs if housing and a credit crunch weren’t enough, prices for food and energy have gone through the roof. The spot price of West Texas intermediate crude oil has surged over 40 percent since January and over 100 percent in the last year, rising above $140 per barrel in late June. Prices for other commodities, such as many metals and foods, have risen sharply as well. Corn and wheat prices are up some 50 to 80 percent from a year ago.\n\nThe debates about why commodity prices have surged are heard everywhere from the nightly newscasts to the halls of Congress. While I don’t have a definitive answer myself, I do think it makes sense to start by looking carefully at the supply and demand fundamentals, and, to my mind, they do appear to play a central role. On the demand side, booming economic activity in developing countries has boosted their appetite for commodities. For example, since 2000, world demand for oil has increased by roughly 11 million barrels per day, with China accounting for roughly 30 percent of this increase, and other developing countries accounting for another 60 percent. In addition, ethanol production accounts for a substantial amount of the increased demand for corn.\n\nOn the supply side, there have been constraints. Oil production has become more expensive, major discoveries are increasingly difficult to find, and spare capacity to supply more oil in the short run has been declining. As a result, energy supplies have not kept pace with growing worldwide demand. In some crop markets, bad weather has reduced supply. For example, drought conditions have hampered wheat production in Australia, while excessive rainfall is affecting corn production here in the Midwest.\n\nNeither supply nor demand for commodities adjusts quickly, so large price changes can occur in response to new information and other shocks to the market. Recent volatility in oil prices appears to reflect a combination of news related to intensifying geopolitical concerns, falling inventories, and further deterioration in estimates of long-term supply.\n\nThere has been much discussion about speculative trading in commodities markets and its possible influence on recent price movements. Hedge funds, institutional investors, and other traders have certainly increased their positions in commodity markets, typically by investing in commodity index funds, which consist of baskets of different commodities that trade on exchanges. But I am not yet persuaded that speculation, rather than the fundamentals of global supply and demand, has played an important role in driving up prices. For example, it should be harder to speculate and take positions on commodities that are not easy to trade on futures markets and are not included in index funds. But the prices of individual commodities that are not in index funds have risen just as fast as those that are.\n\nIn addition, if speculators were important in driving prices up, then, at the high prices now prevailing, demand by nonspeculative end users would fall short of current supply, causing inventories to rise. In fact, however, inventories appear to have been declining in most commodity markets.\n\nThere is no dearth of stories about how rising prices for oil, food, and other commodities are hitting U.S. consumers and businesses. In the case of oil, we all feel the pain when we go to the gas pump. Businesses also buy gasoline and other products made from oil, so their costs go up as well. If rising commodity prices reflect supply and demand fundamentals, then the situation is not likely to turn around any time soon, and the consequence is that everyone is going to see that their dollar just doesn’t stretch as far anymore. In economists’ terms, “real wages”—that is, dollar wages expressed in terms of the goods and services they can buy—will rise more slowly or even fall. There is little that monetary policy can do to prevent this.5\n\nThis is not a pleasant scenario, I grant you. Indeed, it raises the specter of the oil price shocks of the 1970s, when over and above the inflation and real wage cuts due to soaring energy costs, a more general inflation took hold, with wages and prices escalating throughout the economy. The story of how it happened goes roughly like this.6 Workers—reasonably enough—asked for wage increases to pay the higher costs of food and energy. Their employers—mainly firms outside the energy sector–were in the same tough position as their employees: their costs were rising to the extent that they used oil as an input in production; and the prices they were receiving for their products were, at least initially, rising no faster than before. But in spite of the fact that firms outside the energy sector were not well positioned to assent to faster wage increases, they granted them anyhow, figuring—reasonably enough, it turned out—that they could pass those costs on into higher prices for their goods. Why was this reasonable enough thinking by firms? Because both they and their competitors were all in the same unpleasant straits, and they did not believe that the Fed was willing or able to keep a lid on overall prices. The result was an upward wage-price spiral that led to double-digit inflation. That inflation ended only after a major recession that sent the unemployment rate over 10 percent. So we have learned from hard experience that, as unpleasant as lower real wages are, they are an unavoidable consequence of a fundamentals-driven rise in commodity prices. But the development of a wage-price spiral, due to a loss of credibility in the Fed’s determination to suppress it, may have even more devastating consequences.\n\nOutlook\n\nNow I’d like to pull all of these threads together to give you my outlook for the economy. Activity has been weak since late last year, and, given the three shocks I’ve discussed, I expect the economy to grow only modestly for the remainder of the year, but to pick up next year. The earlier policy easing by the Federal Reserve will help cushion the economy from some of the effects of the shocks, and the fiscal stimulus program is helping at present. Over time, the drag from housing will wane and credit conditions should improve.\n\nOn the inflation front, the predominant problem so far has been soaring food and energy prices. Headline inflation is likely to remain much higher than I would like over the next few quarters. My best guess, which could easily be wrong, is that, consistent with futures prices, commodity prices will level off and cease to put direct upward pressure on headline inflation. Core inflation has been better contained, but has still been running a bit higher than I would like. In the next few quarters, I wouldn’t be surprised if it runs modestly higher, as businesses pass some of their higher energy and transportation costs on to customers. By early next year, however, I expect that, assuming commodity prices level off, core as well as headline inflation will moderate, as more slack in labor and product markets emerges.\n\nPolicy\n\nLet me now turn to monetary policy. We’re approaching a crossroads. The FOMC responded to the difficult economic conditions that emerged last year by easing monetary policy substantially. Between September and April, the Committee reduced the federal funds rate by 3¼ percentage points to its current rate of 2 percent. With core consumer inflation running at about the same rate, the real funds rate is now around zero. These cuts in the target rate, along with the actions to foster greater liquidity in financial markets, have mitigated the worst effects of the squeeze on spending. I am somewhat reassured by the recent data, which suggest that my biggest fears on the downside have, so far, been avoided. Of course, the underlying housing, credit, and commodity-price issues are far from fully resolved. My discussion of those issues makes clear that a lot of uncertainty surrounds my outlook. A lot could still go wrong.\n\nBut maximum sustainable employment is only one of our mandates. The other is low and stable inflation. In the wake of rapid increases in prices for gasoline and food, consumer survey measures of longer term inflation expectations have turned up. In contrast, other surveys, such as the Survey of Professional Forecasters, show little erosion in long-term inflation expectations. In addition, the anecdotes I hear are more consistent with credibility than with an upward wage-price spiral. In particular, my contacts uniformly report that they see no signs of general wage pressures.\n\nOn balance, I still see inflation expectations as reasonably well anchored and I anticipate that consumer survey measures will come down once oil and food prices stop rising. But the risks to inflation are likely not symmetric and they have definitely increased. We cannot and will not allow a wage-price spiral to develop.\n\nAs I began with a reference to Shakespeare, let me end with one as well: For monetary policymakers, “readiness is all.” By this I mean that, in the face of these competing risks, we will monitor developments carefully and be prepared to act as needed to fulfill our mandate for sustainable economic growth and price stability.\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1.

At the margins, the Federal Reserve might have some effect on the relative price of oil to the extent that changes in interest rates affect the exchange rate. But the real value of the dollar has depreciated only modestly over the past year, while oil prices have doubled. For this reason, the price of a barrel of oil has risen sharply, whether valued in terms of a depreciating currency, like the dollar, or in terms of an appreciating currency, like the euro.\n\n6.

        "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for inviting me to meet with you. The topic of my talk today is the nation’s economic outlook. I recently returned from a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, where we voted to leave our policy target, the federal funds rate, unchanged for the time being. The discussion around the table focused on three developments that for some time have been presenting serious challenges to the Federal Reserve in meeting its dual mandate of low and stable inflation and maximum sustainable employment and economic growth. These three developments, of course, are the housing slump, the financial market turmoil and ensuing credit crunch, and the surge in commodity prices, especially oil prices.\n\nToday I’d like to give you my own perspective on these developments, focusing on where things stand now, their likely impact on the near-term outlook for economic activity and inflation, and their implications for monetary policy.\n\nBefore discussing the current economic situation—that is, where things stand now—let me set the stage by describing briefly how we got here. To get a little fanciful with the stage-setting metaphor for a moment, it is a bit like the opening of Macbeth, with the three ghastly witches brewing up trouble amid thunder and lightning—only here, the three troublemakers are the housing market, the financial markets, and commodity prices. The housing market has been declining for a few years now. For example, residential investment has fallen by more than a third, in inflation-adjusted terms, since the end of 2005. And house prices have tumbled—according to the various Case-Shiller home price indices, they are down some 15 to 20 percent over the past two years. For the first couple of years, the housing downturn appears to have had remarkably few spillovers to the rest of the economy in terms of curtailed spending. However, knock-on effects to the financial sector were brewing, for as house prices continued to fall, home mortgage delinquencies started to rise. Indeed, the subprime mortgage market, which took off after 2001 and ran strong through late 2005 largely on the expectation of continued home price appreciation, is now in shambles. After posting delinquency rates in the single digits in 2005, around 20 percent of subprime mortgages are currently delinquent or in foreclosure nationwide.\n\nLast summer, it became clear that losses on subprime and other mortgages would be far higher than markets had anticipated. This realization contributed to a broad reappraisal of credit market risks, which sparked the severe, ongoing financial market crisis and credit crunch.\n\nMeanwhile, prices for oil and other commodities have continued a breathtaking rise. The average retail gasoline price was about $1.10/gallon at the beginning of 2002 and is now above $4 a gallon. Food prices also spiked in early 2007.\n\nWeighed down by these growing troubles, the economy slowed sharply starting in the fourth quarter of last year. Indeed, in the first quarter of this year, the growth rate of consumer spending slowed to its lowest pace since the 2001 recession, and business fixed investment stalled. On the consumer side, falling home and equity values have eroded household wealth. Employment has fallen steadily since late last year, reducing disposable income. In addition, surging food and gas prices mean that the income people have gotten doesn’t go as far. So it’s not surprising that consumer sentiment has soured on the economy. On the business side, the slowdown in demand, the elevated levels of uncertainty,2 and tight financing conditions have continued to weigh on investment.\n\nIn the face of these adverse developments, the recent strength of spending data has been somewhat reassuring. The pace of consumer spending, in particular, has been surprisingly robust of late, fueled in part by tax rebates. The spending appeared to be broad-based, with the not-so-surprising exception of motor vehicles, where sales have been very weak in recent months. On the business side, orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft also look to have rebounded somewhat in recent months. In addition, export growth has been a continuing bright spot. It has been buoyed by continued strong growth abroad and by the weakening of the dollar. The strong incoming data on spending ease my concerns somewhat about the intensity of the slowdown. However, a few months of data don’t make a trend, particularly because we can’t be sure how large the effects of the roughly $100 billion temporary tax rebate program have been.  About $50 billion of the rebates were sent out in May.\n\nInflation has become an increasing concern. Over the past twelve months, the personal consumption expenditures—or PCE—price index rose 3.1 percent, up from 2.4 percent over the prior year. An important reason for these disappointing numbers, of course, is the rise in commodity prices. Some of those increases may have also passed through to core PCE price inflation, which excludes food and energy. This measure has averaged 2.1 percent over the past twelve months, which is slightly above the range that I consider consistent with price stability, but very close to its pace of increase over the last several years.\n\nLet me say a few words on how conditions in San Diego compare with the national economy. The troubles in the housing and finance sectors have perhaps been even more severe than elsewhere, with the unemployment rate in the area rising about 2 percentage points since 2006—from a rate that was well below to a rate that is somewhat above the national average. Not everyone is affected equally, of course, either here or elsewhere. For example, San Diego arguably is the nation’s leading center for biotechnology research and development, and activity in this sector has continued expanding strongly. Tourism is another important element of the local economy, and this sector also has been performing well—possibly reflecting, in part, an increase in foreign tourism spurred by the lower value of the dollar. The resulting job gains at restaurants and hotels, along with the associated income gains, have helped offset losses in other sectors. This view from San Diego highlights the point that, although the macroeconomic effects of the shocks hitting the economy are felt broadly, they are not felt evenly—either in San Diego or anywhere else.\n\nReturning to the national outlook, the key questions looking forward are: when will economic activity get back to normal? And when will inflationary pressures moderate? The answers to these questions depend, to a great extent, on how conditions in the housing, financial, and commodity markets evolve. Let me discuss each of them in turn, beginning with housing.\n\nHousing\n\nChanges in housing prices are inextricably linked to household wealth, which in turn affects consumer spending, as well as prospects for housing construction. Unfortunately, it appears to me that there are at least three reasons for thinking that housing prices have further to fall. First, the ratio of house prices to rents—a kind of price-dividend ratio for housing—still remains quite high by historical standards, despite having fallen from its historical peak reached in early 2006. That suggests that further price declines may be needed to bring housing markets into balance. Second, inventories of unsold homes remain at elevated levels. This “excess supply” of available homes will put downward pressure on housing prices. Indeed, these inventories are likely to directly depress construction activity, since there is little point in building new homes when there is already a large backlog of unsold homes. Third, the futures market for house prices predicts further declines in a number of metropolitan areas this year. In particular, the Case-Shiller composite index for home prices shows a 15 to 20 percent year-over-year decline in the second half of this year. The bottom line is that construction spending and house prices seem likely to continue to fall well into 2009.\n\nI would note that the housing market slowdown hit earlier and harder in San Diego than in most other parts of the state and the nation. Using the Case-Shiller index for San Diego, the cumulative decline from the 2006 peak is approaching 30 percent. San Diego illustrates that the housing problems are not simply a consequence of too much subprime lending, since the growth in subprime mortgages during the housing boom was much more limited in the San Diego area than it was in the most highly exposed parts of California, Arizona, and Nevada. Nonetheless, mortgage delinquencies and home foreclosures in San Diego have grown noticeably over the past two years as prices have dropped. As with the rest of the country, it seems likely that further unpleasant adjustments in ownership and equity will be necessary before the housing market stabilizes.\n\nFinancial Markets\n\nThe ongoing fall in house prices has important implications for the financial markets, and it is one reason that we may continue to get troubling news from that part of the economy. As I mentioned, falling house prices and, in particular, their effects on the subprime market, helped trigger the financial market crisis last August. At that time, the Fed and other central banks took the first steps to pump substantial volumes of reserves into the system to respond to the surge in demand for liquidity. These and other further actions helped alleviate some of the stress in financial markets. But earlier this year, renewed stress culminated in the near failure of Bear Stearns in March. Again, the Fed took actions to avert the peril that such a failure could have posed for financial markets and the real economy. Since then, market stress has subsided to some degree, and better quality borrowers are still able to get credit. For example, investment-grade corporate bond issuance has been very strong in recent months, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been able to issue substantial quantities of mortgage-backed securities.\n\nBut markets remain very fragile. For example, credit-default-swap spreads for many financial institutions are again on the rise, the debt ratings for several important bond insurers have been cut, and stock prices for financial institutions have plummeted.\nThere is further evidence that financial markets are still not operating efficiently or effectively. In particular, the market for private-label securitized mortgages of even the highest quality remains moribund. These securities were the primary source of financing for nonconforming residential mortgages, including subprime lending. Outside of the expanded FHA lending, there is little or no lending to higher-risk residential mortgage borrowers. Jumbo mortgages for prime borrowers are available, but at historically high spreads over rates on conventional mortgages, as banks have been reluctant to make these loans.\n\nUnfortunately, progress toward sturdier and more efficient financial markets is going to take some time, and that means the flow of credit is likely to remain impeded. Let me explain by using a plumbing metaphor. For one thing, it’s going to take time to clear the pipes of the problem debt. The gyrations in the prices of a number of securities suggest that there are still hitches in the price discovery process. This may not be surprising given that there is still a good deal of uncertainty about the valuation of complex, nontransparent financial instruments. There also is considerable uncertainty about the extent of the ultimate losses and the exposure of different institutions. In the case of residential mortgages, where delinquency rates are still rising, the single most important determinant of performance has been the pace of house price changes.3 But no one is sure how much more house prices will fall, or how that will affect delinquency rates on mortgages. The considerable uncertainty has added to the difficulty of valuing the underlying mortgages and related asset-backed securities. Credit quality problems also are emerging outside residential mortgages. At commercial banks, for example, delinquencies are now rising almost across the board. Especially notable is the rise in delinquency rates on construction loans that is affecting even institutions that had steered clear of the subprime market.\n\nMoreover, it is not just a matter of clearing the pipes of the problem debt. The plumbing itself needs to be redesigned and rebuilt. Indeed, to deal with some of the vulnerabilities laid bare by the turmoil over the past year requires some restructuring in parts of the financial market and the channels for allocating credit. Key areas of change include the originate-to-distribute model and securitization used to finance higher-risk mortgage debt, financial risk management, re-intermediation and deleveraging more generally, and regulation and oversight of financial markets.\n\nLet me take these one at a time. First, securitization was a key driver of the credit expansion. Financial institutions originated loans that they then bundled into securities and sold to other investors. With hindsight, it is clear that this originate-to-distribute model suffered severe incentive problems—the originator had insufficient incentive to ensure the quality of the loans, since someone else ultimately held them. Conflicts of interest and moral hazard problems also are nested in the many other linkages in the securitization process.4 Before private-label mortgage securitization can recover, financial markets must design mechanisms to align the incentives of originators with the interests of the ultimate investors. Second, there was a widespread failure of risk management, both in terms of liquidity and credit risk. An important shortcoming in credit risk management was an excessive reliance on what turned out to be flawed assessments of risk by rating agencies of certain asset-backed securities. Investors, even large sophisticated financial institutions, did not take adequate steps to assess risk independently. The lack of transparency in the credit process and the complexity of many of the newer financial products did not help. Third, even with changes in contracting and financial modeling, the re-intermediation process and deleveraging more generally is likely to continue. Re-intermediation involves a larger share of financing held in the portfolios of institutions such as commercial banks and less by other investors holding securitized assets. The re-intermediation is part of deleveraging—that is less reliance on debt and more on equity financing—to the extent banks tend to hold more capital than other less regulated financial institutions. We also will likely see less leverage in financing more generally. That is certainly evidenced by the greater shares of equity required in leveraged buyouts, as the pendulum is swinging back from the leveraged financing run amok that we saw even as late as the first part of 2007. While these changes can improve the functioning of credit markets, they also likely will mean that the cost of credit will be higher going forward. Finally, policymakers are likely to revise the regulatory and supervisory environment in ways that will affect the structure, functioning, and oversight of financial markets, and that, too, will not be a speedy or simple process.\n\nDuring the transition, financial institutions are struggling against forces that have expanded their balance sheets even as they have sought to deleverage. Borrowers have tapped outstanding credit lines, institutions have booked leveraged loans that they couldn’t sell, and banks have brought onto their books assets from off-balance-sheet funding conduits. The potential for further pressures on capital, along with institutions’ lower tolerance for risk and concern about economic conditions, has resulted in banks tightening credit conditions for virtually all borrowers. In recent weeks, large banks have been cutting back on lending.\n\nGoing forward, the ability and willingness of commercial banks and other intermediaries to extend credit depends in part on their capacity to expand equity capital internally and externally. The encouraging news is that large commercial banks, investment banks, and mortgage specialists have, to some extent, been able to issue new equity capital and to rebuild capital positions that have come under pressure from a combination of losses and growth in assets.\n\nThe balance-sheet pressures, and broader financial market dislocations, are likely to be with us for some time. My expectation is that market functioning will improve markedly by 2009. But things could get worse before they get better. For example, home prices could fall more than markets expect, leading to larger losses for financial institutions and further impairing their ability to make new loans. The credit crunch could then lead to further declines in house prices. The resulting decline in household wealth could then further reduce spending, leading to additional knock-on effects. So an adverse feedback loop could develop, with consequences for both financial markets and economic activity.\n\nCommodities\n\nAs if housing and a credit crunch weren’t enough, prices for food and energy have gone through the roof. The spot price of West Texas intermediate crude oil has surged over 40 percent since January and over 100 percent in the last year, rising above $140 per barrel in late June. Prices for other commodities, such as many metals and foods, have risen sharply as well. Corn and wheat prices are up some 50 to 80 percent from a year ago.\n\nThe debates about why commodity prices have surged are heard everywhere from the nightly newscasts to the halls of Congress. While I don’t have a definitive answer myself, I do think it makes sense to start by looking carefully at the supply and demand fundamentals, and, to my mind, they do appear to play a central role. On the demand side, booming economic activity in developing countries has boosted their appetite for commodities. For example, since 2000, world demand for oil has increased by roughly 11 million barrels per day, with China accounting for roughly 30 percent of this increase, and other developing countries accounting for another 60 percent. In addition, ethanol production accounts for a substantial amount of the increased demand for corn.\n\nOn the supply side, there have been constraints. Oil production has become more expensive, major discoveries are increasingly difficult to find, and spare capacity to supply more oil in the short run has been declining. As a result, energy supplies have not kept pace with growing worldwide demand. In some crop markets, bad weather has reduced supply. For example, drought conditions have hampered wheat production in Australia, while excessive rainfall is affecting corn production here in the Midwest.\n\nNeither supply nor demand for commodities adjusts quickly, so large price changes can occur in response to new information and other shocks to the market. Recent volatility in oil prices appears to reflect a combination of news related to intensifying geopolitical concerns, falling inventories, and further deterioration in estimates of long-term supply.\n\nThere has been much discussion about speculative trading in commodities markets and its possible influence on recent price movements. Hedge funds, institutional investors, and other traders have certainly increased their positions in commodity markets, typically by investing in commodity index funds, which consist of baskets of different commodities that trade on exchanges. But I am not yet persuaded that speculation, rather than the fundamentals of global supply and demand, has played an important role in driving up prices. For example, it should be harder to speculate and take positions on commodities that are not easy to trade on futures markets and are not included in index funds. But the prices of individual commodities that are not in index funds have risen just as fast as those that are.\n\nIn addition, if speculators were important in driving prices up, then, at the high prices now prevailing, demand by nonspeculative end users would fall short of current supply, causing inventories to rise. In fact, however, inventories appear to have been declining in most commodity markets.\n\nThere is no dearth of stories about how rising prices for oil, food, and other commodities are hitting U.S. consumers and businesses. In the case of oil, we all feel the pain when we go to the gas pump. Businesses also buy gasoline and other products made from oil, so their costs go up as well. If rising commodity prices reflect supply and demand fundamentals, then the situation is not likely to turn around any time soon, and the consequence is that everyone is going to see that their dollar just doesn’t stretch as far anymore. In economists’ terms, “real wages”—that is, dollar wages expressed in terms of the goods and services they can buy—will rise more slowly or even fall. There is little that monetary policy can do to prevent this.5\n\nThis is not a pleasant scenario, I grant you. Indeed, it raises the specter of the oil price shocks of the 1970s, when over and above the inflation and real wage cuts due to soaring energy costs, a more general inflation took hold, with wages and prices escalating throughout the economy. The story of how it happened goes roughly like this.6 Workers—reasonably enough—asked for wage increases to pay the higher costs of food and energy. Their employers—mainly firms outside the energy sector–were in the same tough position as their employees: their costs were rising to the extent that they used oil as an input in production; and the prices they were receiving for their products were, at least initially, rising no faster than before. But in spite of the fact that firms outside the energy sector were not well positioned to assent to faster wage increases, they granted them anyhow, figuring—reasonably enough, it turned out—that they could pass those costs on into higher prices for their goods. Why was this reasonable enough thinking by firms? Because both they and their competitors were all in the same unpleasant straits, and they did not believe that the Fed was willing or able to keep a lid on overall prices. The result was an upward wage-price spiral that led to double-digit inflation. That inflation ended only after a major recession that sent the unemployment rate over 10 percent. So we have learned from hard experience that, as unpleasant as lower real wages are, they are an unavoidable consequence of a fundamentals-driven rise in commodity prices. But the development of a wage-price spiral, due to a loss of credibility in the Fed’s determination to suppress it, may have even more devastating consequences.\n\nOutlook\n\nNow I’d like to pull all of these threads together to give you my outlook for the economy. Activity has been weak since late last year, and, given the three shocks I’ve discussed, I expect the economy to grow only modestly for the remainder of the year, but to pick up next year. The earlier policy easing by the Federal Reserve will help cushion the economy from some of the effects of the shocks, and the fiscal stimulus program is helping at present. Over time, the drag from housing will wane and credit conditions should improve.\n\nOn the inflation front, the predominant problem so far has been soaring food and energy prices. Headline inflation is likely to remain much higher than I would like over the next few quarters. My best guess, which could easily be wrong, is that, consistent with futures prices, commodity prices will level off and cease to put direct upward pressure on headline inflation. Core inflation has been better contained, but has still been running a bit higher than I would like. In the next few quarters, I wouldn’t be surprised if it runs modestly higher, as businesses pass some of their higher energy and transportation costs on to customers. By early next year, however, I expect that, assuming commodity prices level off, core as well as headline inflation will moderate, as more slack in labor and product markets emerges.\n\nPolicy\n\nLet me now turn to monetary policy. We’re approaching a crossroads. The FOMC responded to the difficult economic conditions that emerged last year by easing monetary policy substantially. Between September and April, the Committee reduced the federal funds rate by 3¼ percentage points to its current rate of 2 percent. With core consumer inflation running at about the same rate, the real funds rate is now around zero. These cuts in the target rate, along with the actions to foster greater liquidity in financial markets, have mitigated the worst effects of the squeeze on spending. I am somewhat reassured by the recent data, which suggest that my biggest fears on the downside have, so far, been avoided. Of course, the underlying housing, credit, and commodity-price issues are far from fully resolved. My discussion of those issues makes clear that a lot of uncertainty surrounds my outlook. A lot could still go wrong.\n\nBut maximum sustainable employment is only one of our mandates. The other is low and stable inflation. In the wake of rapid increases in prices for gasoline and food, consumer survey measures of longer term inflation expectations have turned up. In contrast, other surveys, such as the Survey of Professional Forecasters, show little erosion in long-term inflation expectations. In addition, the anecdotes I hear are more consistent with credibility than with an upward wage-price spiral. In particular, my contacts uniformly report that they see no signs of general wage pressures.\n\nOn balance, I still see inflation expectations as reasonably well anchored and I anticipate that consumer survey measures will come down once oil and food prices stop rising. But the risks to inflation are likely not symmetric and they have definitely increased. We cannot and will not allow a wage-price spiral to develop.\n\nAs I began with a reference to Shakespeare, let me end with one as well: For monetary policymakers, “readiness is all.” By this I mean that, in the face of these competing risks, we will monitor developments carefully and be prepared to act as needed to fulfill our mandate for sustainable economic growth and price stability.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd Notes\n\n\n\n1.

At the margins, the Federal Reserve might have some effect on the relative price of oil to the extent that changes in interest rates affect the exchange rate. But the real value of the dollar has depreciated only modestly over the past year, while oil prices have doubled. For this reason, the price of a barrel of oil has risen sharply, whether valued in terms of a depreciating currency, like the dollar, or in terms of an appreciating currency, like the euro.\n\n6.

        "content": "Good morning.  I’m delighted to be part of the Northern California Regional Financial Planning conference this year.  I’d like to thank the organizers for inviting me and for giving me an opportunity to talk about the U.S. economy and the conduct of monetary policy to such a large and knowledgeable group of professionals.  Most, if not all, of you have been first-hand witnesses to one of the most significant economic shocks in our memories—one that is seriously affecting the U.S. outlook.  I mean, of course, the events that have been roiling U.S. and global financial markets since midsummer of last year and that have led to the current credit crunch.\n\nIn my assessment of the economy, I will also focus on two additional factors that are shaping the outlook—the downturn in housing markets and the unanticipated surge in food, oil, and other commodity prices.  These developments have taken a toll on the U.S. economy, resulting in weak growth since late last year.  To preview my discussion, I expect that the economy’s performance will improve somewhat in the second half of the year.  But I am also well aware that the risks surrounding my forecast are large because of uncertainty about how these three factors—the financial turmoil, the housing cycle, and commodity prices—will evolve.  Before I begin, let me note, as usual, that these remarks reflect my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nFinancial Markets and the Credit Crunch\n\nLet me turn first to the financial market turmoil.  From a monetary policy perspective, one of its most important consequences is the serious credit crunch that has developed.  Stories about the credit crunch are in the news every day, and they highlight how widespread its effects are. Students are finding it harder to obtain college loans.  Households are more often receiving notice that their home equity lines have been capped.  Companies report that it is more challenging to secure credit lines from their banks.  Some municipal governments and nonprofits have experienced unexpected jumps in interest payments on their debt due to disruptions in their funding markets.  Homeowners seeking jumbo mortgages face interest rates that have risen since last summer, even though both short- and long-term Treasury rates have declined substantially. And subprime mortgages are all but unavailable at any price.\n \nHow did such a situation come about?  To my mind, it represents a rapid and disruptive unwinding of a bubble-like situation that had developed in credit markets over a number of years.  At the time, many observers noted that the world appeared to be “awash in liquidity.”  The “bubble” was characterized by very low long-term real interest rates.  Investors seemed willing to accept very modest compensation for the risks they were taking. The abundance of liquidity was reflected in a number of investment strategies.  For example, a wave of leveraged buyouts was financed at low interest rates with exceptionally favorable terms. Substantial quantities of funds were also attracted into so-called “carry trades” involving exposure to significant exchange rate risk. And, most importantly, there was a rapid rise in lending on home mortgages in general, and importantly, in the subprime mortgage market, reflecting an exceptionally benign view of the underlying risks.\n\nThis benign view may well have been linked, in part, to rapid transformations taking place in our financial system.  Securitization and financial engineering fundamentally changed financial markets in a relatively short period of time, appearing to make it possible to slice and dice and spread risk more effectively—indeed, it appeared that these innovations had made the usual terms of the risk-return tradeoff more favorable.2 The surge in lending occurred as securitization promulgated the originate-to-distribute business model—that is, underlying loans were securitized and sold to investors.  Notably, the main compensation of many participants in the securitization chain came in the form of upfront origination fees.  Without the strong incentives to maintain underwriting standards that exist when originating institutions keep loans on their own books, the credit quality of many of the securitized loans deteriorated significantly. Subprime mortgages are a good example, as combined loan-to-value ratios and the percentage of low- or “no-doc” loans rose steadily through 2006. And, in any case, even subprime mortgages looked like a good bet, with house prices seeming to be on an ever-upward march.\n\nFurthermore, with the economy booming, investors, including highly leveraged investment banks, hedge funds, and SIVs (structured investment vehicles)—the so-called “shadow banking sector”—were actively seeking projects to finance and willing to increase their leverage.  With interest rates so low, they were motivated to reach for higher yields on these projects.3 Many investors found reassurance in getting involved in many of these complex securities by relying on the evaluations given by rating agencies.  Unfortunately, these ratings turned out not to be very reliable.\n \nSo long as house prices kept soaring, as they did until a couple of years ago, these credit problems did not show up.  But once house prices flattened out and then began to fall, it became clear that delinquencies and foreclosures on subprime and other mortgages would be far higher than had been anticipated. This arguably was the trigger of a far broader reappraisal of credit market risks and attitudes.\n \nClearly, the market discipline that “sophisticated investors” are supposed to provide was lacking.  As we saw, even some of the largest, most sophisticated financial institutions inadequately incorporated into their risk-management models the full range of hazards entailed in the originate-to-distribute business and the liquidity risks that would result from a drying up of short-term funding. Also lacking were reliable ratings from the agencies. But financial supervisors and regulators, including the Federal Reserve, were behind the curve, as well.  We missed some of the risky developments that were unfolding.  Our consumer regulations were unfortunately insufficient to protect households from some egregious and unfair lending practices. And we took too long to ramp up some supervisory policies in the face of mounting risks. On a broader level, the situation exposed holes in the existing regulatory framework for financial services, which allowed some risky activities to flourish, hurting both consumers and financial stability.  Significantly, the Fed was compelled to open the discount window to investment banks because of the outsized risks some took and their significant interconnectedness with the financial market infrastructure. Investment banks thus were able to operate with less capital and supervision than such access otherwise entails.\n\nNow that I’ve taken a broad view of the crisis, let me go into some of the more specific developments that influence my views on the economy and monetary policy. Given the importance of the subprime market in initiating the crisis and its relevance to the broader housing market, I would like to spend a few minutes at the outset reviewing what happened there before returning to the main “story line” concerning the financial turmoil.  This market took off after 2001 and, by one estimate, in late 2007 there were over 7 million subprime mortgages outstanding, or about 14 percent of the overall mortgage market. Through late 2005, things seemed to be going well, with subprime delinquencies remarkably low in most areas of the country. But now, close to 20 percent of subprime mortgages are delinquent or in foreclosure nationwide.\n\nResearch suggests that it was not so much interest rate resets that triggered the rise in subprime problems, as many expected. Indeed, reductions in short-term interest rates since the onset of the crisis should diminish the danger of foreclosures from such resets going forward. Rather, the single most important determinant of the level and change in subprime delinquency rates has been the pace of house price changes.4\n\nThe link between house prices and delinquency rates is not surprising.  Although delinquencies and foreclosures are often precipitated by life crises, such as illness, divorce, or the loss of a job, the amount of equity in the home affects the ability or willingness of a homeowner to keep current on their mortgage payments when these events occur. In a market in which house prices have been stagnant or declining, a borrower with a recent mortgage secured with little or no down payment does not have the flexibility to refinance or to tap into the equity in the house to weather a life event.  Even some borrowers who might be able to afford their loans may be unwilling to make the payments if house prices are expected to remain low or decline putting their mortgages underwater. Declining house prices have also affected prime borrowers. While default rates on prime mortgages are lower than for adjustable-rate subprime loans, delinquency rates among all categories are highly correlated with house price declines across regions of the country.\n\nRising delinquencies on subprime mortgages triggered huge disruptions in the markets for asset-backed securities (ABS) and these problems are central to the emergence of the credit crunch. Because most subprime mortgages were packaged into mortgage backed securities (MBS), and into the more complex collections called collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, surging credit losses, and prospects for further losses, meant lower values for all of the securities that were based on them.  Losses related to the subprime market even inflicted collateral damage on a completely unrelated market—the market for municipal bonds. Some companies that insure these bonds had exposure to the subprime market as well, precipitating downgrades in their credit ratings or the potential for such downgrades in the future.\n \nThe problems afflicting mortgage-related ABS spread to some other classes of ABS as well. Many types of underlying loans, including credit card, commercial real estate, auto, business and student loans, had been packaged into such securities.  The contagion to these sectors occurred for a variety of reasons, including a general flight to safety by now-risk-averse investors;  the recognition that similar, although less pronounced, declines in underwriting standards may have occurred in some other credit areas such as commercial real estate and leveraged lending; widespread concern about the validity of the evaluations of securities that had been issued by the rating agencies; and a drying up of short-term funding for a set of vehicles and institutions that were significant investors in these securities.\n\nLosses from holding asset-backed securities have been suffered by a broad range of investors. As it turns out though, a large share of the exposure resided with commercial banks, with nonbank subsidiaries of financial holding companies, and with the highly leveraged entities in the “shadow banking sector.”  Write-downs on ABS reduced the equity cushions in all of these firms and increased their leverage at a time when the growing risks in the financial markets made them desire less leverage, not more.  Some commercial banks suffered additionally because they had an unanticipated buildup of mortgages and loans related to leveraged buyouts on their balance sheets.  Because they were active securitizers themselves, these loans were in the pipeline for securitization but could not be sold. In addition, when SIVs they had sponsored were in danger of failing, some banks decided to rescue them by taking the underlying assets back onto their own balance sheets.  All of these factors raised banks’ own leverage levels and diminished their capital cushions.  Many banks are raising additional capital, but most are also tightening credit terms and restricting availability of loans to many households and businesses. For example, the Federal Reserve’s Senior Loan Officers Survey documents a broad-based tightening in terms and reduction in the availability of credit since last summer.\n\nAt the same time that availability of bank funding has tightened, new issuance of asset-backed securities has all but disappeared as a viable funding option for several types of borrowing.  In particular, the markets for securities backed by private-label mortgages, commercial mortgages, and leveraged loans have all become quite illiquid as a consequence of the turmoil. As leveraged institutions sought to strengthen their balance sheets and, in some cases, meet margin calls, by selling ABS, asset prices declined, exacerbating losses and escalating the market pressures in a vicious cycle, making it almost impossible, in some cases, to determine appropriate prices for the securities.\n\nIlliquidity and higher risk premia have also afflicted the money markets that serve as sources of short-term funding for banks, a further factor reducing their willingness to lend.  Banks are accustomed to borrowing in the term interbank markets from one another to manage liquidity.  However, many banks that normally borrow and lend to each other, have become reluctant to lend.  This presumably reflects recognition of the need to preserve their own liquidity to meet unexpected credit demands and greater uncertainty about the creditworthiness of counterparties.\n\nEven as we move beyond those portions of the credit markets dominated by bank lending and loan securitization, we still see evidence of tighter credit conditions. For example, in the corporate bond market, which is still functioning fairly well, spreads facing all borrowers have risen. Riskier borrowers, issuing low-grade corporate bonds, face higher rates even though a worldwide “flight to safety,” coupled with an easing of monetary policy by the Fed, has contributed to a sharp decline in interest rates on Treasury securities since last June. The increase in spreads presumably reflects both higher risk aversion among investors and heightened perceptions of the possible downside risks to firms that would result from a weaker economy.\n\nAt the end of March, the credit market stresses I have described actually escalated to the point where they posed the risk of a systemic meltdown.  In particular, the Bear Stearns episode showed how concerns about credit quality and solvency for an intermediary can devolve into liquidity problems. The fear that Bear Stearns would be unable to meet its obligations to its creditors triggered a sudden withdrawal of credit—as in an old- fashioned bank run. Of course, the perceived inability of one institution to meet its obligations is likely to cast doubt on the ability of others to meet theirs, triggering chains of distress and systemic risk.\n\nThe Federal Reserve was created precisely to stem such systemic risks by acting as a lender of last resort, although not since the Great Depression has it acted to accomplish it by lending directly through its discount window to an entity other than a depository institution.  Had the Fed not intervened, however, Bear Stearns would have been unable to meet the demands of the counterparties in its repurchase agreements and thus intended to file for bankruptcy. Doing so might well have led to widespread fears in the financial markets, with declining prices for asset-backed securities triggering margin calls, forced selling pushing prices down further, and mark-to-market losses triggering reductions in capital and escalating problems in other highly leveraged institutions. The Fed’s recent decision to set up a facility to provide credit to other primary dealers reflects the potential of this important group of institutions to create systemic risk with unacceptable consequences for the economy as a whole.\n\nIn addition to the actions with respect to Bear Stearns and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, the Fed has responded in a number of ways to improve and protect market liquidity.  We’ve lowered the spread of the discount rate above the federal funds rate from 100 to 25 basis points; created a new auction facility to make term loans to banks based on a broader range of collateral (the Term Auction Facility); set up another facility to lend Treasury securities in exchange for certain asset-backed securities (the Term Securities Lending Facility); engaged in term repurchase agreements with primary dealers; and approved swaps with the ECB and Swiss National Bank to enable them to increase dollar liquidity to institutions in their markets.\n\nThese liquidity-enhancing actions are different from standard monetary policy because they do not involve changes in the federal funds rate—the Fed’s monetary policy target—and, unlike open market operations, they do not entail any change in the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  Instead, they involve a change in the composition of the Fed’s roughly $800 billion balance sheet away from outright ownership of U.S. Treasury securities and toward, for example, both short-term and term loans backed by a wider range of collateral to both depository institutions and primary dealers.\n\nI believe that the Fed’s liquidity operations, combined with its 325-basis-point cut in the federal funds rate—a substantial easing of monetary policy—are having a beneficial effect on financial markets.  Although overall financial conditions are still far from normal, there are some rays of hope that the strains may be easing a bit.  Over the past couple of months, for example, spreads in the markets for conventional GSE-sponsored securitized mortgages and in corporate borrowing markets have declined.  Moreover, credit default swap spreads on many exposed financial institutions, a measure of their perceived chance of default, are down substantially. Treasury rates have moved up, suggesting reduced aversion to risk. And the major stock indexes have regained some ground.\n\nHousing\n\nNow let me turn to the second of the three main factors behind the current economic weakness—namely, the housing cycle.  I have mentioned that earlier in this decade when financial markets were “awash in liquidity,” bubble-like conditions emerged in many areas of the economy, including housing.  During this period, housing construction was very strong and housing prices soared.  In fact, the ratio of house prices to rents—a kind of price-dividend ratio for housing—reached historical highs by early  2006, suggesting that house prices might be well above those that could be justified by fundamentals.\n\nSince then, housing markets have “hit the skids.”  In inflation-adjusted terms, residential construction fell by 13 percent in 2006 and by 14 percent in the first half of last year.  Of course, once the financial shock hit last summer, things got even worse, with real residential construction dropping at a 24 percent rate on average since then. And, indicators of conditions in housing markets are pointing lower for the future.  Housing starts and permits as well as sales are trending down, and inventories of unsold homes remain at very high levels. These inventories will need to be worked off before construction can begin to rebound.\n\nI’ve already discussed the precipitous fall in house prices nationally, so it’s striking to note that, even with these declines, the ratio of house prices to rents remains quite high by historical standards. That, of course, suggests that further price declines may be needed to bring housing markets into balance.  This perspective is reinforced by futures markets for house prices, which expect further declines in a number of metropolitan areas this year.  In particular, the Case-Shiller composite index for home prices shows a 15 to 20 percent year-over-year decline in the second half of this year.\n\nThe bottom line is that construction spending and house prices seem likely to continue to decline well into 2009.\n\nCommodity Prices\n\nThe behavior of commodity prices is the final of the three factors that lie behind our economic troubles.  Prices for many commodities, not only crude oil, but also many metals and foods, have risen sharply in recent years.  On the demand side, pressure is coming from several quarters.  World real GDP growth has been exceptionally robust in recent years, and the strength of demand has been particularly notable in the large emerging economies of China and India.  In addition, biofuel production has added to demand for some food commodities, like corn, and this has shifted demands to other foods, raising their prices as well.  Finally, some commentators have argued that commodity prices have been pushed up by investors shifting demands to commodities in the face of the current financial turmoil as debt and equity investments appear much riskier.  However, if this factor were playing a significant role, I would expect to see big increases in inventories of commodities as investors were expecting to make profits on rising prices. So far, I have not seen the evidence that this is occurring.\n\nNormally, commodity price increases are transitory, in part because they elicit a strong increase in supply that reverses the upward pressure on prices.  But today, especially for oil, supplies are increasingly coming from unconventional and more expensive sources, so the supply responses tend to be smaller and to have longer lags.  In the case of food, government policies in the U.S. that have stimulated the production of biofuels promise to maintain tight market conditions.  Indeed, futures markets and some forecasts—for example, the IMF World Economic Outlook—expect many commodity prices to remain at around their current high levels rather than reverse course.\n\nOutlook for the economy\n\nThese three factors—the credit crunch, the deflating housing bubble, and the rising price of commodities—have combined to weigh heavily on demand by both consumers and businesses.  Let me start with consumer spending, which is the largest sector of the economy.  National surveys show that consumer sentiment has plummeted, an indication of the many hurdles households face. Consumer spending slowed in the first quarter to only 1 percent growth from 2½ percent last year.  Falling house prices have reduced household spending by lowering total wealth and the value of mortgage equity.  In addition, consumers face constraints due to declines in the stock market and tighter lending terms at depository institutions.  The rise in delinquency rates across the spectrum of consumer loans is strongly indicative of the growing strains on households.  And, the rise in the prices of energy, food, and other commodity prices have “taxed” the disposable incomes of households and weighed on consumer spending.  Yet another negative factor is that labor markets have weakened.  In recent months, growth in nonfarm payroll employment slowed sharply, actually falling by 260,000 jobs over the past four months.  Job loss will have a negative impact on the disposable income available to households and therefore will provide an additional restraint on consumer spending.\n\nAs for business investment in equipment and software, this category registered a decline in the first quarter following years of strong growth, and it would not be surprising to see this weakness continue into next year.  Nonresidential investment also dropped in the first quarter and is likely to face more problems as the year progresses since the securitized finance markets used to finance these expenditures have all but dried up.\n\nFortunately, there are some countervailing factors helping to mitigate the substantial drags on the U.S. economy.  U.S. exports have been strong, as foreign real GDP has advanced robustly over the past few years and as the falling dollar has made U.S. goods more competitive in global markets.  I expect our net exports to continue to make a positive contribution to U.S. growth.  However, this result is not assured, as some countries—especially in Europe—are suffering from the turmoil in financial markets, and the sluggishness in the U.S. economy is likely to have a dampening effect on many economies abroad. \n  \nEconomic policies in this country are also likely to provide a boost to growth.  As I have mentioned, the FOMC has eased the stance of monetary policy substantially in the past six months, and I would expect these actions to contribute most strongly to growth in the second half of this year.  Moreover, the fiscal stimulus package signed into law recently is well timed, and I am hopeful that this action will have a substantial stimulatory effect.  The rebates to households in 2008 will total more than $100 billion, with more than half of that amount set for distribution in May. Of course, the effects of the program on GDP will depend on the fraction of the money that is spent.  In this regard, there is reason for optimism.  First, the fact that we are in the midst of a credit crunch means that a higher portion of the population is credit constrained than usual, and this means that more of the rebates are likely to be spent.  Second, the design of the program puts emphasis on channeling more of the money to lower-income households who are more likely to be credit constrained in any event.  The main effects of the program are likely to hit in the current and next quarters, and they could be substantial.\n\nThis brings me to my bottom line for the outlook.  The economy slowed starting in the fourth quarter.  With stimulus from monetary and fiscal policy, economic performance seems likely to improve later this year.  With the unemployment rate currently at 5 percent, it is a little above my estimate of its sustainable level, and the sluggish  performance I expect this year is likely to push unemployment up further.\n\nForecasting is always an uncertain business.  But I want to emphasize that we are facing a high degree of uncertainty at the present time.  One only has to look at the latest Blue Chip forecasts to see that point.  The range between the highest and lowest forecasts for real GDP growth is among the largest on record.  The ten most optimistic forecasters are predicting over 2½ percentage points faster growth over the next four quarters than the ten most pessimistic ones.\n\nOutlook for inflation\n\nNow let me turn to inflation.  Much of the recent data have been disappointing. Over the past twelve months, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 3.2 percent, up from 2.5 percent over the prior year.  An important reason for these disappointing numbers, of course, is the rise in commodity prices that I have discussed.  Some of this increase has probably also passed through to core PCE price inflation, which excludes food and energy.  This measure has averaged 2.1 percent over the past twelve months, and it is slightly above the range that I consider consistent with price stability.\n\nUnder present circumstances, judging future changes in commodity prices is obviously an important part of any inflation forecast.  As I noted, future markets generally are expecting these prices to flatten out and remain at around today’s very high levels.  If this happens, then the effects of commodity prices on inflation will dissipate.  In order to continue to put upward pressure on inflation—which, after all, is the rate of change of prices—commodity prices would have to do more than remain at today’s high levels.  They would need to keep on rising.\n\nWhile this seems unlikely based on experience in recent decades, we can’t rule out this possibility.  Futures markets have been expecting a leveling out of most commodity prices for several years now, and they keep being surprised by ongoing increases.  As I mentioned before, in part, this could reflect growing supply limitations on some commodities, especially oil.  However, there also is the possibility that commodity prices could fall in the future as the economic weakness in the U.S. and slowing in Europe could spread to the rest of the world, reining in demand for commodities.  I mentioned before that there is an unusually wide spread in Blue Chip forecasts for real GDP growth—well, not surprisingly, the dispersion for inflation forecasts is also unusually large at the present time, perhaps reflecting these divergent possibilities.\n\nEven if the direct influences of commodity prices on inflation eventually dissipate, they could still cause trouble.  Some argue that before this happens, higher inflation could become built into inflation expectations and become self-perpetuating.  In other words, some fear that the specter of stagflation may rear its ugly head as it did in the 1970s and early 1980s.  Stagflation is thought to arise from a cycle of wage and price increases—a wage-price spiral—initiated by a shock such as rising commodity prices—and perpetuated by poor monetary policy credibility and unanchored inflation expectations.  In the 1970s and early 1980s, the wage-price spiral was spun from the pass-through of rising food and energy prices to inflation, which was in turn passed along to wages and, then again, through to final goods prices. Fueling the movement were expectations that monetary policy would allow inflation to continue to rise for the foreseeable future.\n\nI see little reason to believe that we have entered, or are about to enter, such a period of stagflation.  For one thing, although current data on growth and inflation have departed from desirable levels, matters looked far worse 30 years ago than they do now.\n\nFor another, there is no evidence that wages have started to spiral up, as broad measures of compensation have expanded quite moderately over the past year.  Moreover, productivity growth has been fairly robust, and, after incorporating its effects, unit labor costs were up by only ¼ of 1 percent over the past year.  In addition, the slack in labor and product markets stemming from the weakening in economic activity that seems likely should put somewhat greater downward pressure on inflation going forward.  Therefore, my forecast of the most likely outcome over the next couple of years is that total and core inflation will moderate from present levels.\n\nThe Federal Reserve cannot, however, be complacent about inflation. Some survey measures of long-run inflation expectations have inched up, and measures of inflation compensation derived from the differential between nominal and real Treasury yields are slightly higher, too. While none of these measures are perfect indicators of inflation expectations, recent movements highlight the risk that our attempts to deal with problems in the real economy could lead to higher inflation expectations and an erosion of our credibility.\n\nPolicy\n\nLet me now turn to monetary policy. As I’ve just indicated, core inflation remains on the high side of where I would like it to be. At the same time, activity is weak across most sectors of the economy, as the housing downturn, the escalation of commodity prices, and the ongoing financial shock are weighing on consumption spending, business capital investment, and employment.\n \nThe FOMC has responded to these conditions by easing monetary policy substantially since September, cutting the federal funds rate by 3¼ percentage points to 2 percent.  With core consumer inflation running at about the same rate, the real funds rate now stands at an accommodative level of around zero. These cuts in the target rate, along with the actions to foster greater liquidity in financial markets, have mitigated the worst effects of the credit crunch. But they have not resolved it. Indeed, my sense is that the process of resolution will unfold only gradually.\n \nUnder these circumstances, I consider the current level of monetary accommodation to be appropriate. That, together with the fiscal package, should be sufficient to promote a step up to moderate economic growth later this year. Likewise, I would expect that inflation will moderate in coming quarters, as more slack in labor and product markets emerges and as commodity prices level off.  Of course, we will continue to monitor developments and act as needed to fulfill our mandate for sustainable economic growth and price stability.\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1.

        "content": "Presentation charts (pdf, 324 kb)\n\nGood morning. I’m delighted to be part of the CFA’s annual conference this year. I’d like to thank the organizers for inviting me and for giving me an opportunity to talk about the U.S. economy and the conduct of monetary policy to such a large and knowledgeable group of professionals. Most, if not all, of you have been first-hand witnesses to one of the most significant economic shocks in our memories—one that is seriously affecting the U.S. outlook. I mean, of course, the events that have been roiling U.S. and global financial markets since midsummer of last year and that have led to the current credit crunch.\n\nIn my assessment of the economy, I will also focus on two additional factors that are shaping the outlook—the downturn in housing markets and the unanticipated surge in food, oil, and other commodity prices. These developments have taken a toll on the U.S. economy, resulting in very weak performance for the past two quarters. To preview my discussion, I expect that the economy’s performance will improve somewhat in the second half of the year. But I am also well aware that the risks surrounding my forecast are unusually large because of uncertainty about how these three factors—the financial turmoil, the housing cycle, and commodity prices—will evolve. Before I begin, let me note, as usual, that these remarks reflect my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nFinancial Markets and the Credit Crunch\n\nLet me turn first to the financial market turmoil. From a monetary policy perspective, one of its most important consequences is the serious credit crunch that has developed. Stories about the credit crunch are in the news every day, and they highlight how widespread its effects are. Students are finding it harder to obtain college loans. Households are more often receiving notice that their home equity lines have been capped. Companies report that it is more challenging to secure credit lines from their banks. Some municipal governments and nonprofits have experienced unexpected jumps in interest payments on their debt due to disruptions in their funding markets. Homeowners seeking jumbo mortgages face interest rates that have risen since last summer, even though both short- and long-term Treasury rates have declined substantially. And subprime mortgages are all but unavailable at any price.\n\nHow did such a situation come about? To my mind, it represents a rapid and disruptive unwinding of a bubble-like situation that had developed in credit markets over a number of years. At the time, many observers noted that the world appeared to be “awash in liquidity.” The “bubble” was characterized by very low long-term real interest rates. Investors seemed willing to accept very modest compensation for the risks they were taking. The abundance of liquidity was reflected in a number of investment strategies. For example, a wave of leveraged buyouts was financed at low interest rates with exceptionally favorable terms. Substantial quantities of funds were also attracted into so-called “carry trades” involving exposure to significant exchange rate risk. And, most importantly, there was a rapid rise in lending on home mortgages in general, and importantly, in the subprime mortgage market, reflecting an exceptionally benign view of the underlying risks.\n\nThis benign view may well have been linked, in part, to rapid transformations taking place in our financial system. Securitization and financial engineering fundamentally changed financial markets in a relatively short period of time, appearing to make it possible to slice and dice and spread risk more effectively—indeed, it appeared that these innovations had made the usual terms of the risk-return tradeoff more favorable.2 The surge in lending occurred as securitization promulgated the originate-to-distribute business model—that is, underlying loans were securitized and sold to investors. Notably, the main compensation of many participants in the securitization chain came in the form of upfront origination fees. Without the strong incentives to maintain underwriting standards that exist when originating institutions keep loans on their own books, the credit quality of many of the securitized loans deteriorated significantly. Subprime mortgages are a good example, as combined loan-to-value ratios and the percentage of low- or “no-doc” loans rose steadily through 2006. And, in any case, even subprime mortgages looked like a good bet, with house prices seeming to be on an ever-upward march.\n\nFurthermore, with the economy booming, investors, including highly leveraged investment banks, hedge funds, and SIVs (structured investment vehicles)—the so-called “shadow banking sector”—were actively seeking projects to finance and willing to increase their leverage. With interest rates so low, they were motivated to reach for higher yields on these projects.3 Many investors found reassurance in getting involved in many of these complex securities by relying on the evaluations given by rating agencies. Unfortunately, these ratings turned out not to be very reliable.\n\nSo long as house prices kept soaring, as they did until a couple of years ago, these credit problems did not show up. But once house prices flattened out and then began to fall, it became clear that delinquencies and foreclosures on subprime and other mortgages would be far higher than had been anticipated. This arguably was the trigger of a far broader reappraisal of credit market risks and attitudes.\n\nClearly, the market discipline that “sophisticated investors” are supposed to provide was lacking. As we saw, even some of the largest, most sophisticated financial institutions inadequately incorporated into their risk-management models the full range of hazards entailed in the originate-to-distribute business and the liquidity risks that would result from a drying up of short-term funding. Also lacking were reliable ratings from the agencies. But financial supervisors and regulators, including the Federal Reserve, were behind the curve, as well. We missed some of the risky developments that were unfolding. Our consumer regulations were unfortunately insufficient to protect households from some egregious and unfair lending practices. And we took too long to ramp up some supervisory policies in the face of mounting risks. On a broader level, the situation exposed holes in the existing regulatory framework for financial services, which allowed some risky activities to flourish, hurting both consumers and financial stability. Significantly, the Fed was compelled to open the discount window to investment banks because of the outsized risks some took and their significant interconnectedness with the financial market infrastructure. Investment banks thus were able to operate with less capital and supervision than such access otherwise entails.\n\nNow that I’ve taken a broad view of the crisis, let me go into some of the more specific developments that influence my views on the economy and monetary policy. Given the importance of the subprime market in initiating the crisis and its relevance to the broader housing market, I would like to spend a few minutes at the outset reviewing what happened there before returning to the main “story line” concerning the financial turmoil. This market took off after 2001 and, by one estimate, in late 2007 there were over 7 million subprime mortgages outstanding, or about 14 percent of the overall mortgage market. Through late 2005, things seemed to be going well, with subprime delinquencies remarkably low in most areas of the country. But now, close to 20 percent of subprime mortgages are delinquent or in foreclosure nationwide.\n\nResearch suggests that it was not so much interest rate resets that triggered the rise in subprime problems, as many expected. Indeed, reductions in short-term interest rates since the onset of the crisis should diminish the danger of foreclosures from such resets going forward. Rather, the single most important determinant of the level and change in subprime delinquency rates has been the pace of house price changes.4\n\nThe link between house prices and delinquency rates is not surprising. Although delinquencies and foreclosures are often precipitated by life crises, such as illness, divorce, or the loss of a job, the amount of equity in the home affects the ability or willingness of a homeowner to keep current on their mortgage payments when these events occur. In a market in which house prices have been stagnant or declining, a borrower with a recent mortgage secured with little or no down payment does not have the flexibility to refinance or to tap into the equity in the house to weather a life event. Even some borrowers who might be able to afford their loans may be unwilling to make the payments if house prices are expected to remain low or decline putting their mortgages underwater. Declining house prices have also affected prime borrowers. While default rates on prime mortgages are lower than for adjustable-rate subprime loans, delinquency rates among all categories are highly correlated with house price declines across regions of the country.\n\nRising delinquencies on subprime mortgages triggered huge disruptions in the markets for asset-backed securities (ABS) and these problems are central to the emergence of the credit crunch. Because most subprime mortgages were packaged into mortgage backed securities (MBS), and into the more complex collections called collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, surging credit losses, and prospects for further losses, meant lower values for all of the securities that were based on them. Losses related to the subprime market even inflicted collateral damage on a completely unrelated market—the market for municipal bonds. Some companies that insure these bonds had exposure to the subprime market as well, precipitating downgrades in their credit ratings or the potential for such downgrades in the future.\n\nThe problems afflicting mortgage-related ABS spread to some other classes of ABS as well. Many types of underlying loans, including credit card, commercial real estate, auto, business and student loans, had been packaged into such securities. The contagion to these sectors occurred for a variety of reasons, including a general flight to safety by now-risk-averse investors; the recognition that similar, although less pronounced, declines in underwriting standards may have occurred in some other credit areas such as commercial real estate and leveraged lending; widespread concern about the validity of the evaluations of securities that had been issued by the rating agencies; and a drying up of short-term funding for a set of vehicles and institutions that were significant investors in these securities.\n\nLosses from holding asset-backed securities have been suffered by a broad range of investors. As it turns out though, a large share of the exposure resided with commercial banks, with nonbank subsidiaries of financial holding companies, and with the highly leveraged entities in the “ shadow banking sector.” Write-downs on ABS reduced the equity cushions in all of these firms and increased their leverage at a time when the growing risks in the financial markets made them desire less leverage, not more. Some commercial banks suffered additionally because they had an unanticipated buildup of mortgages and loans related to leveraged buyouts on their balance sheets. Because they were active securitizers themselves, these loans were in the pipeline for securitization but could not be sold. In addition, when SIVs they had sponsored were in danger of failing, some banks decided to rescue them by taking the underlying assets back onto their own balance sheets. All of these factors raised banks’ own leverage levels and diminished their capital cushions. Many banks are raising additional capital, but most are also tightening credit terms and restricting availability of loans to many households and businesses. For example, the Federal Reserve’s Senior Loan Officers Survey documents a broad-based tightening in terms and reduction in the availability of credit since last summer.\n\nAt the same time that availability of bank funding has tightened, new issuance of asset-backed securities has all but disappeared as a viable funding option for several types of borrowing. In particular, the markets for securities backed by private-label mortgages, commercial mortgages, and leveraged loans have all become quite illiquid as a consequence of the turmoil. As leveraged institutions sought to strengthen their balance sheets and, in some cases, meet margin calls, by selling ABS, asset prices declined, exacerbating losses and escalating the market pressures in a vicious cycle, making it almost impossible, in some cases, to determine appropriate prices for the securities.\n\nIlliquidity and higher risk premia have also afflicted the money markets that serve as sources of short-term funding for banks, a further factor reducing their willingness to lend. Banks are accustomed to borrowing in the term interbank markets from one another to manage liquidity. However, many banks that normally borrow and lend to each other, have become reluctant to lend. This presumably reflects recognition of the need to preserve their own liquidity to meet unexpected credit demands and greater uncertainty about the creditworthiness of counterparties.\n\nEven as we move beyond those portions of the credit markets dominated by bank lending and loan securitization, we still see evidence of tighter credit conditions. For example, in the corporate bond market, which is still functioning fairly well, spreads facing all borrowers have risen. Riskier borrowers, issuing low-grade corporate bonds, face higher rates even though a worldwide “flight to safety,” coupled with an easing of monetary policy by the Fed, has contributed to a sharp decline in interest rates on Treasury securities since last June. The increase in spreads presumably reflects both higher risk aversion among investors and heightened perceptions of the possible downside risks to firms that would result from a weaker economy.\n\nAt the end of March, the credit market stresses I have described actually escalated to the point where they posed the risk of a systemic meltdown. In particular, the Bear Stearns episode showed how concerns about credit quality and solvency for an intermediary can devolve into liquidity problems. The fear that Bear would be unable to meet its obligations to its creditors triggered a sudden withdrawal of credit—as in an old- fashioned bank run. Of course, the perceived inability of one institution to meet its obligations is likely to cast doubt on the ability of others to meet theirs, triggering chains of distress and systemic risk.\n\nThe Federal Reserve was created precisely to stem such systemic risks by acting as a lender of last resort, although not since the Great Depression has it acted to accomplish it by lending directly through its discount window to an entity other than a depository institution. Had the Fed not intervened, however, Bear Stearns would have been unable to meet the demands of the counterparties in its repurchase agreements and thus intended to file for bankruptcy. Doing so might well have led to widespread fears in the financial markets, with declining prices for asset-backed securities triggering margin calls, forced selling pushing prices down further, and mark-to-market losses triggering reductions in capital and escalating problems in other highly leveraged institutions. The Fed’s recent decision to set up a facility to provide credit to other primary dealers reflects the potential of this important group of institutions to create systemic risk with unacceptable consequences for the economy as a whole.\n\nIn addition to the actions with respect to Bear Stearns and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, the Fed has responded in a number of ways to improve and protect market liquidity. We’ve lowered the spread of the discount rate above the federal funds rate from 100 to 25 basis points; created a new auction facility to make term loans to banks based on a broader range of collateral (the Term Auction Facility); set up another facility to lend Treasury securities in exchange for certain asset-backed securities (the Term Securities Lending Facility); engaged in term repurchase agreements with primary dealers; and approved swaps with the ECB and Swiss National Bank to enable them to increase dollar liquidity to institutions in their markets.\n\nThese liquidity-enhancing actions are different from standard monetary policy because they do not involve changes in the federal funds rate—the Fed’s monetary policy target—and, unlike open market operations, they do not entail any change in the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. Instead, they involve a change in the composition of the Fed’s roughly $800 billion balance sheet away from outright ownership of U.S. Treasury securities and toward, for example, both short-term and term loans backed by a wider range of collateral to both depository institutions and primary dealers.\n\nI believe that the Fed’s liquidity operations, combined with its 325-basis-point cut in the Federal funds rate—a substantial easing of monetary policy—are having a beneficial effect on financial markets. Although overall financial conditions are still far from normal, there are some rays of hope that the strains may be easing a bit. Over the past month or so, for example, spreads in the markets for conventional GSE-sponsored securitized mortgages and in corporate borrowing markets have declined. Moreover, credit default swap spreads on many exposed financial institutions, a measure of their perceived chance of default, are down substantially. Treasury rates have moved up, suggesting reduced aversion to risk. And the major stock indexes have regained some ground.\n\nHousing\n\nNow let me turn to the second of the three main factors behind the current economic weakness—namely, the housing cycle. I have mentioned that earlier in this decade when financial markets were “awash in liquidity,” bubble-like conditions emerged in many areas of the economy, including housing. During this period, housing construction was very strong and housing prices soared. In fact, the ratio of house prices to rents—a kind of price-dividend ratio for housing—reached historical highs by early 2006, suggesting that house prices might be well above those that could be justified by fundamentals.\n\nSince then, housing markets have “hit the skids.” In inflation-adjusted terms, residential construction fell by 13 percent in 2006 and by 14 percent in the first half of last year. Of course, once the financial shock hit last summer, things got even worse, with real residential construction dropping at a 24 percent rate on average since then. And, indicators of conditions in housing markets are pointing lower for the future. Housing starts and permits as well as sales are trending down, and inventories of unsold homes remain at very high levels. These inventories will need to be worked off before construction can begin to rebound.\n\nI’ve already discussed the precipitous fall in house prices nationally, so it’s striking to note that, even with these declines, the ratio of house prices to rents remains quite high by historical standards. That, of course, suggests that further price declines may be needed to bring housing markets into balance. This perspective is reinforced by futures markets for house prices, which expect further declines in a number of metropolitan areas this year. In particular, the Case-Shiller composite index for home prices shows a 15 to 20 percent year-over-year decline in the second half of this year.\n\nThe bottom line is that construction spending and house prices seem likely to continue to decline well into 2009.\n\nCommodity Prices\n\nThe behavior of commodity prices is the final of the three factors that lie behind our economic troubles. Prices for many commodities, not only crude oil, but also many metals and foods, have risen sharply in recent years. On the demand side, pressure is coming from several quarters. World real GDP growth has been exceptionally robust in recent years, and the strength of demand has been particularly notable in the large emerging economies of China and India. In addition, biofuel production has added to demand for some food commodities, like corn, and this has shifted demands to other foods, raising their prices as well. Finally, some commentators have argued that commodity prices have been pushed up by investors shifting demands to commodities in the face of the current financial turmoil as debt and equity investments appear much riskier. However, if this factor were playing a significant role, I would expect to see big increases in inventories of commodities as investors were expecting to make profits on rising prices. So far, I have not seen the evidence that this is occurring.\n\nNormally, commodity price increases are transitory, in part because they elicit a strong increase in supply that reverses the upward pressure on prices. But today, especially for oil, supplies are increasingly coming from unconventional and more expensive sources, so the supply responses tend to be smaller and to have longer lags. In the case of food, government policies in the U.S. that have stimulated the production of biofuels promise to maintain tight market conditions. Indeed, futures markets and some forecasts—for example, the IMF World Economic Outlook—expect many commodity prices to remain at around their current high levels rather than reverse course.\n\nOutlook for the economy\n\nThis grim trio—the credit crunch, the deflating housing bubble, and the rising price of commodities—has combined to weigh heavily on demand by both consumers and businesses. Let me start with consumer spending, which is the largest sector of the economy. National surveys show that consumer sentiment has plummeted, a stark indication of the many hurdles households face. Consumer spending slowed in the first quarter to only 1 percent growth from 2½ percent last year. Falling house prices have reduced household spending by lowering total wealth and the value of mortgage equity. In addition, consumers face constraints due to declines in the stock market and tighter lending terms at depository institutions. The rise in delinquency rates across the spectrum of consumer loans is strongly indicative of the growing strains on households. And, the rise in the prices of energy, food, and other commodity prices have “taxed” the disposable incomes of households and weighed on consumer spending. Yet another negative factor is that labor markets have weakened. In recent months, growth in nonfarm payroll employment slowed sharply, actually falling by 260,000 jobs over the past four months. Job loss will have a negative impact on the disposable income available to households and therefore will provide an additional restraint on consumer spending.\n\nAs for business investment in equipment and software, this category registered a decline in the first quarter following years of strong growth, and it would not be surprising to see this weakness continue into next year. Nonresidential investment also dropped in the first quarter and is likely to face more problems as the year progresses since the securitized finance markets used to finance these expenditures have all but dried up.\n\nFortunately, there are some countervailing factors helping to mitigate the substantial drags on the U.S. economy. U.S. exports have been strong, as foreign real GDP has advanced robustly over the past few years and as the falling dollar has made U.S. goods more competitive in global markets. I expect our net exports to continue to make a positive contribution to U.S. growth. However, this result is by no means assured, as some countries—especially in Europe—are suffering from the turmoil in financial markets, and the sluggishness in the U.S. economy is likely to have a dampening effect on many economies abroad.\n\nEconomic policies in this country are also likely to provide a boost to growth. As I have mentioned, the FOMC has eased the stance of monetary policy substantially in the past six months, and I would expect these actions to contribute most strongly to growth in the second half of this year. Moreover, the fiscal stimulus package signed into law recently is well timed, and I am hopeful that this action will have a substantial stimulatory effect. The rebates to households in 2008 will total more than $100 billion, and more than half of that amount will be distributed in May. Of course, the effects of the program on GDP will depend on the fraction of the money that is spent. In this regard, there is reason for optimism. First, the fact that we are in the midst of a credit crunch means that a higher portion of the population is credit constrained than usual, and this means that more of the rebates are likely to be spent. Second, the design of the program puts emphasis on channeling more of the money to lower-income households who are more likely to be credit constrained in any event. The main effects of the program are likely to hit in the current and next quarters, and they could be substantial.\n\nThis brings me to my bottom line for the outlook. Starting in the fourth quarter, the economy slowed to a crawl. With stimulus from monetary and fiscal policy, economic performance may improve later this year. Nonetheless, the economy is still likely to turn in a very sluggish performance for the year as a whole. With the unemployment rate currently at 5 percent, it is a little above my estimate of its sustainable level, and the weak performance I expect this year is likely to push unemployment up further.\n\nForecasting is always an uncertain business. But I want to emphasize that we are facing an unusually high degree of uncertainty at the present time. One only has to look at the latest Blue Chip forecasts to see that point. The range between the highest and lowest forecasts for real GDP growth is among the largest on record. The ten most optimistic forecasters are predicting over 2½ percentage points faster growth over the next four quarters than the ten most pessimistic ones.\n\nOutlook for inflation\n\nNow let me turn to inflation. Much of the recent data have been disappointing. Over the past twelve months, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 3.2 percent, up from 2.5 percent over the prior year. An important reason for these disappointing numbers, of course, is the rise in commodity prices that I have discussed. Some of this increase has probably also passed through to core PCE price inflation, which excludes food and energy. This measure has averaged 2.1 percent over the past twelve months, and it is slightly above the range that I consider consistent with price stability.\n\nUnder present circumstances, judging future changes in commodity prices is obviously an important part of any inflation forecast. As I noted, future markets generally are expecting these prices to flatten out and remain at around today’s very high levels. If this happens, then the effects of commodity prices on inflation will dissipate. In order to continue to put upward pressure on inflation—which, after all, is the rate of change of prices—commodity prices would have to do more than remain at today’s high levels. They would need to keep on rising.\n\nWhile this seems unlikely based on experience in recent decades, we can’t rule out this possibility. Futures markets have been expecting a leveling out of most commodity prices for several years now, and they keep being surprised by ongoing increases. As I mentioned before, in part, this could reflect growing supply limitations on some commodities, especially oil. However, there also is the possibility that commodity prices could fall in the future as the economic weakness in the U.S. and slowing in Europe could spread to the rest of the world, reining in demand for commodities. I mentioned before that there is an unusually wide spread in Blue Chip forecasts for real GDP growth—well, not surprisingly, the dispersion for inflation forecasts is also unusually large at the present time, perhaps reflecting these divergent possibilities.\n\nEven if the direct influences of commodity prices on inflation eventually dissipate, they could still cause trouble. Some argue that before this happens, higher inflation could become built into inflation expectations and become self-perpetuating. In other words, some fear that the specter of stagflation may rear its ugly head as it did in the 1970s and early 1980s. Stagflation is thought to arise from a cycle of wage and price increases—a wage-price spiral—initiated by a shock such as rising commodity prices—and perpetuated by poor monetary policy credibility and unanchored inflation expectations. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the wage-price spiral was spun from the pass-through of rising food and energy prices to inflation, which was in turn passed along to wages and, then again, through to final goods prices. Fueling the movement were expectations that monetary policy would allow inflation to continue to rise for the foreseeable future.\n\nI see little reason to believe that we have entered, or are about to enter, such a period of stagflation. For one thing, although current data on growth and inflation have departed from desirable levels, matters looked far worse 30 years ago than they do now.\n\nFor another, there is no evidence that wages have started to spiral up, as broad measures of compensation have expanded quite moderately over the past year. Moreover, productivity growth has been fairly robust, and, after incorporating its effects, unit labor costs were up by only ¼ of 1 percent over the past year. In addition, the slack in labor and product markets stemming from the weakening in economic activity that seems likely should put somewhat greater downward pressure on inflation going forward. Therefore, my forecast of the most likely outcome over the next couple of years is that total and core inflation will moderate from present levels.\n\nThe Federal Reserve cannot, however, be complacent about inflation. Some survey measures of long-run inflation expectations have inched up, and measures of inflation compensation derived from the differential between nominal and real Treasury yields are slightly higher, too. While none of these measures are perfect indicators of inflation expectations, recent movements highlight the risk that our attempts to deal with problems in the real economy could lead to higher inflation expectations and an erosion of our credibility.\n\nPolicy\n\nLet me now turn to monetary policy. As I’ve just indicated, core inflation remains on the high side of where I would like it to be. At the same time, activity is weak across most sectors of the economy, as the housing downturn, the escalation of commodity prices, and the ongoing financial shock are weighing heavily on consumption spending, business capital investment, and employment.\n\nThe FOMC has responded to these conditions by easing monetary policy substantially since September, cutting the federal funds rate by 3¼ percentage points to 2 percent. With core consumer inflation running at about the same rate, the real funds rate now stands at an accommodative level of around zero. These cuts in the target rate, along with the actions to foster greater liquidity in financial markets, have mitigated the worst effects of the credit crunch. But they have not resolved it. Indeed, my sense is that the process of resolution will unfold only gradually.\n\nUnder these circumstances, I consider the current level of monetary accommodation to be appropriate. That, together with the fiscal package, should be sufficient to promote a gradual step up to moderate economic growth later this year. Likewise, I would expect that inflation will moderate in coming quarters, as more slack in labor and product markets emerges and as commodity prices level off. Of course, we will continue to monitor developments and act as needed to fulfill our mandate for sustainable economic growth and price stability\n\nEnd Notes\n\n\n\n1.

        "content": "Good morning. I’d like to thank the Bay Area Council for inviting me to speak at this year’s annual outlook conference. This important event is just one of the many significant contributions the Council makes to help shape the future of the Bay Area economy, and I’m privileged to be part of the distinguished lineup of speakers.\n\nDuring the last nine months financial markets have been in turmoil. The disruptions have impacted households, businesses and state and local governments throughout the country. In my remarks today, I’ll review the developments that led to the current economic and financial situation and offer my perspective on the outlook and Federal Reserve policy. Along the way, I’ll comment on developments in the Bay Area economy.\n\nLet me begin with what seems to have been a trigger for the financial turmoil now facing the nation, namely, the decline in house prices in recent years. It was hardly surprising that house prices flattened out in 2006 and even began to decline more recently. There had been plenty of talk before then about a house price “bubble” and no one expected house prices to ratchet up at double digit rates forever.\n\nIn themselves, house price declines are a concern for monetary policymakers because they reduce the wealth of households, and that can have a chilling effect on consumer demand, which, in turn, can put a chill on overall economic activity. Indeed, even as house prices were rising, economists in the Fed and elsewhere were analyzing how a downturn in the housing sector might affect the economy and evaluating potential policy responses. At the time, however, it was simply not anticipated that house price declines would contribute to such burgeoning delinquencies and defaults among subprime borrowers, and that those problems would set off a chain of events that would rattle the financial system, resulting in the credit crunch that is now severely restraining economic activity and employment.\n\nSubprime markets\n\nLet me briefly trace this chain of events, beginning with developments in the subprime market. In the late 1990s, the subprime market was fairly small and slow-growing, but after the 2001 recession, it took off. By one estimate, in late 2007, it made up about 13 percent of the overall mortgage market. Through late 2005, things seemed to be going well, with subprime delinquencies remarkably low in most areas of the country, including the West.\n\nToday the picture is very different: Close to 20 percent of subprime mortgages are delinquent or in foreclosure nationwide. “Hot spots” include parts of Nevada, Florida, Ohio, and California, where the highest delinquency rates are in the Central Valley.\n\nThe Bay Area has not been immune. In some cities, such as Fairfield and Vallejo, subprime mortgages accounted for over one-fourth of new originations in 2006, and in 2007, delinquencies and foreclosures there increased sharply. By contrast, subprimes accounted for only about one-tenth of new mortgages in 2006 in San Francisco and the peninsula, and delinquencies and defaults there have remained relatively low.\n\nResearch confirms that the factors one would intuitively expect to influence delinquencies and defaults have, in fact, mattered; these include broad economic conditions and the riskiness of the borrowers, which, as is well known, was heightened by increasingly lax underwriting standards. But research also reveals that the single best predictor of subprime delinquency rates is the pace of house price changes. For example, in Vallejo and Fairfield, house prices fell more than 20 percent over the past twelve months and are down nearly 30 percent since late 2005. By contrast, house prices have held up better in San Francisco and Marin, due largely to supply constraints and local amenities that keep housing in very high demand. But for the Bay Area as whole, median home prices have come down substantially—by 11.6 percent in February relative to twelve months earlier. Based on futures markets for home prices, further downward adjustments are likely to occur.\n\nThe link between house prices and delinquency rates is not surprising. When house prices have been stagnant or declining, a borrower with a recent mortgage secured with a very small or no down payment has little, if any, equity in the house and, therefore, can’t rely on it to help weather income and wealth stresses like job loss, illness, or divorce. Moreover, though some borrowers may be able to afford their loans, they may decide just to walk away, if, for example, their house is worth less than their mortgage.\n\nI should also note that, while default rates for prime loans are lower than for subprime loans, delinquency rates among all categories are highly correlated with house price declines across the country, whether borrowers are prime or nonprime, or whether loans have fixed or variable rates.\n\nFinally, though many thought that interest rate resets played a major role in the growing delinquencies and foreclosures, research indicates that they did not—at least, not yet. The vast majority of subprime loans are recent vintages, so only a fraction had hit reset dates as of late 2007. Moreover, in many cases, the initial, or so-called “teaser,” rates were not set that far below prevailing rates on variable-rate mortgages, which indeed, have come down since last summer.\n\nCredit crunch\n\nThe chain of events leading from delinquent subprime mortgages to an economy-wide credit crunch is long and complex, so I will only sketch out the main links. When it became apparent that the problems in the subprime mortgage market were far worse than expected, the ratings on securities that had been backed by these mortgages and other similar assets were downgraded dramatically. That started a race to unload them, driving the prices of these assets lower. Declining asset prices, combined with growing credit losses, have eroded the capital cushions of banks and other leveraged financial institutions. Some banks have also been stuck holding loans they intended to securitize but now cannot due to the illiquidity in the markets for such assets. Most financial institutions now face intense pressure to reduce the leverage on their balance sheets. Though some are succeeding in raising new capital, they also are seeking to scale back their leverage by reducing their total volume of loans outstanding. The consequence is that banks are stiffening up their terms of lending to households and business and are reducing the availability of credit. For example, interest rates are up on the jumbo mortgages which are so prevalent in the Bay Area.\n\nThe credit crunch has had widespread repercussions, even in markets unrelated to residential mortgages. There are now notably wide spreads between the rates on ultra-safe Treasury bonds and the rates on many other debt instruments—a sign of general risk aversion among investors. This has caused the interest rates on low-grade corporate bonds to shoot way up. Moreover, securities backed by other types of loans—such as those on credit cards, commercial real estate, and autos, as well as business, and student loans—also have sharply declined in price or become illiquid. In addition, the market for auction-rate securities, or ARS, has been in a meltdown. The low rates available on these bonds versus traditional fixed-rate debt have been attractive to municipal agencies and nonprofit institutions in recent years, and they have grown accordingly. In recent months, however, investors grew wary about these bonds, because of concerns about the reliability of ARS debt insurers, who were exposed to securitized subprime mortgages. This pullback by investors led to widespread auction failures, leaving some borrowers saddled with much higher interest costs due to automatic rate resets. As a result, local government agencies, including some in the Bay Area, have been scrambling to refinance their ARS debt through fixed-rate bonds or other variable-rate debt—at noticeably higher interest rates than were available before the ARS meltdown.\n\nEconomic outlook\n\nTurning to the economic impacts, the credit crunch combined with, and intensified, the housing downturn to deliver a double blow to national economic activity in the fourth quarter of last year. Growth slowed from a robust pace earlier in the year to a rate of only about ½ percent. In fact, the contraction in spending on housing construction subtracted a full percentage point from U.S. real GDP growth last year, and nearly as much the year before. It seems likely that this sector will be a major drag on the overall economy through the end of this year and into 2009.\n\nUntil recently, the deflating housing bubble had not spilled over to the rest of the economy. But now it has. It appears that growth in consumption and business investment spending has slowed markedly after years of robust performance, and, as a result, the economy has all but stalled and could even contract over the first half of the year.\n\nThe factors weighing down consumer spending go beyond the effects of the credit crunch and the falling house prices. Consumers also face constraints due to the declines in the stock market, which have diminished their wealth. Furthermore, energy, food, and other commodity prices have risen sharply in recent years, essentially “taxing” their incomes. Finally, and very importantly, labor markets have weakened. Business payrolls have declined in recent months, and the unemployment rate jumped in March. In the Bay Area employment has fallen since the beginning of the year and job losses are especially pronounced in construction and financial activities. It is no wonder that the Council’s poll results show Bay Area business confidence at its lowest level since the poll started in 2001, and that nationally consumer confidence has declined to a 26-year low.\n\nAlthough business capital investment remained robust through the end of last year, it would not be surprising to see firms slow and perhaps even cut into this spending this year in response to overall economic softening and tighter credit conditions. This is especially true for nonresidential construction, which grew by over 15 percent in real terms last year, but now faces serious financing constraints from the credit crunch.\n\nInvestment in high-tech equipment and software was strong through the fourth quarter and this sector looks set for growth in the months ahead. But there are some signs of slowing, as orders have fallen off, and there are indications that the demand for computers is softening. This is, of course, a big issue for the Bay Area, since it is the nation’s leading metropolitan area in the size and density of its information technology—or, IT—manufacturing and services sectors.\n\nSpending on IT is a large and growing share of total capital spending, and it exhibits substantial cyclical volatility. Close links are evident between its growth and job growth in urban technology centers such as the Bay Area.2 The most recent IT cycle—the spending boom of the late 1990s followed by the bust between 2000 and 2003—is one that all of us here will long remember. During the bust, about one-third of Bay Area IT manufacturing and services jobs disappeared. This consolidation was painful, but it left the local industry well-positioned to take advantage of domestic and international growth in IT demand during 2005 to 2007. During these years, the Bay Area IT sector saw substantial gains in jobs and output, which helped produce vibrant local economic conditions more generally. Even though signs of a slowdown have emerged this year, our area’s unique combination of a highly skilled and mobile labor force, an extensive and energetic venture capital community, active involvement from local research universities, and far-reaching ties to overseas production networks leaves the Bay Area IT sector well-positioned for long-term growth.\n\nA bright spot for the national and Bay Area economies is foreign trade. Exports have done very well due to stronger economies abroad and the dollar’s decline. Here in the Bay Area, IT manufacturers and service providers appear to have kept expanding despite the national economic slowdown partly because of strong demand from abroad. And San Francisco has been benefiting from growth in foreign tourism spurred in part by the lower value of the dollar. I expect trade to remain a source of strength for the national and regional economies, but there are some risks. For some countries—especially in Europe—the ongoing financial turmoil is having direct negative impacts, and other countries are likely to suffer indirect impacts from any slowdown in the U.S.\n\nEconomic policies are another important factor in gauging the economic outlook. The stance of monetary policy has eased substantially in the past six months, and the fiscal stimulus package signed into law recently is well timed—with checks beginning to hit the mail in May. Both actions can be expected to boost growth in coming quarters. At the state and local level, however, the downturn is curtailing the growth of revenues from property, income and sales taxes, resulting in widespread cutbacks in planned spending. In California, these pressures have prompted Governor Schwarzenegger to declare a “fiscal emergency”.\n\nThis brings me to my bottom line for the outlook. Current indicators suggest that, starting in the fourth quarter, the national economy, at best, slowed to a crawl. I anticipate little or no growth in the first half of this year. With stimulus from monetary and fiscal policy, economic performance should improve in the second half of this year. Nonetheless, these are particularly uncertain times. I see the risks to this outcome as skewed to the downside given the ongoing turmoil in financial markets, the continued contraction in housing, and the growing caution of households and businesses.\n\nNow let me turn to inflation. Over the past year, inflation has been elevated by rising food, energy and other commodity prices and declines in the value of the dollar that have boosted import prices. However, several developments suggest that inflation is likely to moderate over the next couple of years. For example, broad measures of compensation have expanded quite modestly over the past year, and productivity growth has been fairly robust. In addition, futures markets point to a leveling out of energy and other commodity prices. Furthermore, the weakening in economic activity should put somewhat greater downward pressure on inflation going forward.\n\nThe Federal Reserve cannot, however, be complacent about inflation. Most survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations have remained reasonably well behaved. But measures of inflation compensation derived from the differential between nominal and real Treasury yields have moved up for the period of five-to-ten years ahead. Such measures are an imperfect indicator of inflation expectations, because they are affected by inflation risk and illiquidity. Nevertheless, these movements highlight the risk that our attempts to deal with problems in the real economy could lead to higher inflation expectations and an erosion of our credibility.\n\nMonetary policy\n\nWith that in mind, let me discuss the Fed’s responses—first to the financial market turmoil, which poses a threat to economic activity and employment, and second to the weakness in economic activity itself. We’ve developed a number of approaches to improve liquidity. Part of this effort, of course, was the arrangement to facilitate the resolution of Bear Stearns’ liquidity problems, which threatened to worsen the turmoil in financial markets, deepen the credit crunch, and further depress economic activity and employment.\n\nWe have also sought to improve and protect market liquidity by making funding available to a broader range of institutions—depository institutions and primary securities dealers—for a longer term, and based on a broader range of collateral, including in some cases mortgage-backed securities.3 These actions are distinct from monetary policy itself because any effect they might have on reserves or the federal funds rate is offset by open market operations. Their purpose is to avoid sharp disruptions of economic activity and employment and to keep the transmission channels of monetary policy open and functioning effectively.\n\nWith regard to monetary policy, the FOMC has taken significant steps since September, cutting the federal funds rate by 3 full percentage points to an accommodative level of 2¼ percent. I consider such accommodation an appropriate response to the contractionary effects of the ongoing financial shock and the housing downturn, and I anticipate that the resulting stimulus, combined with that of the fiscal package, will foster a moderate pickup in growth later this year. At the same time, consumer inflation seems likely to decline gradually to somewhat below 2 percent over the next couple of years, a level that is consistent with price stability.\n\nHowever, economic prospects remain unusually uncertain, and the downside risks to growth are significant. Going forward, the Committee must carefully monitor and assess the effects of ongoing financial and economic developments on the outlook for output and inflation, and be prepared to act in a timely manner to promote the economy’s return to sustainable paths for output and employment.\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1.

        "content": "Good afternoon, everyone. It’s always a pleasure to participate in events at SIEPR, and I’d like to thank my long-time friend, John Shoven, for inviting me to join you today. These are challenging times for economic policymakers. The financial turmoil that has been unfolding since last summer raises fundamental questions about the structure of our financial system. We are grasping to understand the causes even as we grapple with the consequences. I am certain that they will be the subject of research and debate for years to come. These developments highlight the importance of sound economic policy grounded in objective analysis—the mission that has long guided the work of SIEPR and also of the Federal Reserve. We need creative policy responses to mitigate the adverse effects of the financial disruptions today and the deep analysis required to prevent their recurrence in the future. The research carried out by the leading thinkers here at SIEPR will be more valuable than ever in accomplishing these objectives.\n\nI plan to discuss recent financial developments in some detail tonight and to draw out their implications for the economic outlook as well as for the Federal Reserve, both in its role as monetary policymaker and in its role in fostering order and confidence in our financial markets. Let me stress at the outset that my remarks this evening reflect my own views and not those of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nFinancial markets\n\nThe turmoil afflicting our financial markets began last summer and is now resulting in diminished availability of credit in many sectors of the economy. Central to the financial disruptions are problems in the markets for asset-backed securities and related derivatives. Asset-backed securities are created when underlying assets, such as mortgages, are bundled together into securities that can be traded in financial markets. Such instruments enhance the liquidity of the underlying assets and aim to diversify and spread risk, potentially improving economic welfare by broadening access to credit and lowering its cost. Of course, the process of securitization is not new. It began decades ago in mortgage markets with the government-sponsored agencies—Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac.\n\nSince around 2003, however, securitization by private organizations has grown by leaps and bounds. It involves many types of underlying loans—including credit card, commercial real estate, auto, business, and student loans, in addition to residential mortgages. Importantly, a high fraction of subprime mortgages were securitized.\n\nThe biggest players in this business—and, therefore, the locus of much of the current difficulty—make up what has come to be called “the shadow banking sector.” By this, I’m referring to a set of highly leveraged institutions that serve as intermediaries in financial markets. Like traditional banks, they borrow short-term—commonly through repurchase agreements or the issuance of asset-backed commercial paper—to hold long-term assets—including a substantial fraction of outstanding asset-backed securities earning higher yields. These institutions include investment banks such as Bear Stearns, as well as hedge funds, Structured Investment Vehicles, or SIVs, and other conduits. Such entities are typically more highly leveraged than banks and some pursue riskier business strategies. For example, a recent estimate showed that brokers and hedge funds had leverage ratios that are more than three times that of commercial banks.2\n\nThe current problems afflicting the shadow banking sector began when it became apparent that delinquencies and foreclosures on subprime mortgages would be far more prevalent than had previously been appreciated. Surging credit losses, and prospects for further losses, meant lower values for the securities that were based on them, such as mortgage-backed securities, the more complex collections of mortgage-backed securities called collateralized debt obligations or CDOs, and a variety of related derivatives. Write-downs on such assets reduced the equity cushions in these firms and increased their leverage at a time when the growing risks in the financial markets made them desire less leverage, not more. Attempts to sell assets to enhance the strength of their balance sheets resulted in even lower prices of the assets and yet further selling pressure.3 This vicious cycle has led to outright illiquidity in markets for private-label mortgage-backed securities, making it almost impossible to determine appropriate prices for the securities and largely eliminating them as a source of new funding to borrowers.\n\nIn markets that are functioning fairly well, the turmoil also has led to a tightening of credit conditions, as the interest rates facing many households and firms, especially riskier borrowers, have risen. This has occurred even though a worldwide “flight to safety,” coupled with an easing of monetary policy by the Fed, has contributed to a sharp decline in interest rates on Treasury securities since last June. For example, rates are up on low-grade corporate bonds and jumbo mortgages. The notably wide “spread” between the rates on ultra-safe Treasuries and many other instruments points to a high risk premium that many borrowers have to pay and is evidence of significant risk-aversion in the markets.\n\nThe credit crunch has hit equity markets as well. Broad U.S. equity indices have been very volatile, and, on the whole, have declined since June, in part because profits have come in below market expectations for some financial firms due to write-downs of the value of mortgage-backed securities. The stock market also has been adversely affected by the general economic downturn which has further dampened prospects for profits.\n\nSome commercial banks also have become embroiled in this process. In addition to the markdowns that some have suffered on their direct holdings of asset-backed securities, several had an unanticipated buildup of mortgages as well as loans related to leveraged buy-outs on their balance sheets. These loans were in the pipeline for securitization but could not be sold. This problem hit the banks in part because they themselves were involved in creating structured credits that held mortgages and leveraged loans that they had originated. In addition, they face problems with some SIVs they had sponsored. When the SIVs were in danger of failing, some banks decided to rescue them by taking the underlying assets back onto their own balance sheets. All of these factors raised banks’ own leverage levels and diminished their capital cushions. Although some have raised additional capital, most are tightening credit terms and restricting availability of loans to many households and businesses.\n\nCompounding this problem, banks have faced illiquidity in the money markets that serve as sources of short-term funding. In the term interbank funding markets, in which banks normally borrow from and lend to each other, some banks have become reluctant to lend. This reflects recognition of the need to preserve their own liquidity to meet unexpected credit demands, greater uncertainty about the creditworthiness of counterparties, or concerns about their capital positions.\n\nMy basic point is that a process of deleveraging, in which many financial intermediaries are simultaneously trying to shrink the size of their balance sheets, has produced a situation in which the quantity of credit available in the overall economy from a wide range of intermediaries has contracted sharply and suddenly—a credit crunch. Moreover, concerns about credit quality and solvency for intermediaries can devolve into liquidity problems, as in an old-fashioned bank run. Firms in the shadow banking sector are particularly vulnerable to this because, like banks, they typically issue short-term, highly liquid debt. The fear that an institution may be unable to meet its obligations to its creditors may trigger a withdrawal of credit—as in a bank run. Of course, the perceived inability of one institution to meet its obligations is likely to cast doubt on the ability of others to meet theirs, triggering chains of distress and systemic risk.\n\nThe Federal Reserve was created precisely to stem such systemic risks by acting as a lender of last resort, although not since the Great Depression has the Fed acted to accomplish it by lending directly through its discount window to an entity other than a depository institution. Had the Fed not intervened, however, Bear Stearns would have been unable to meet the demands of the counterparties in its repurchase agreements, and thus intended to file for bankruptcy. Doing so might well have led to widespread fears in the financial markets, with declining prices for asset-backed securities triggering margin calls, forced selling pushing prices down further, and mark-to-market losses triggering reductions in capital and escalating problems in other highly leveraged institutions. The Fed’s recent decision to set up a facility to provide credit to other primary dealers reflects the potential of this important group of institutions to create systemic risk with unacceptable consequences for the economy as a whole.\n\nIn addition to the actions with respect to Bear Stearns and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, the Fed has responded in a number of ways to improve and protect market liquidity. We’ve lowered the spread of the discount rate above the federal funds rate; created a new auction facility to make term loans to banks based on a broader range of collateral (the Term Auction Facility); set up another facility to lend Treasury securities in exchange for certain asset-backed securities (the Term Securities Lending Facility); engaged in term repurchase agreements with primary dealers; and approved swaps with the ECB and Swiss National Bank to enable them to increase dollar liquidity to institutions in their markets. These approaches are designed to improve market liquidity by making funding available for a longer term, to a broader range of institutions, and based on a broader range of collateral including in some cases mortgage-backed securities. I will return to these liquidity-enhancing actions and how they relate to Fed monetary policy at the end of my presentation.\n\nNow that we have examined the nature of the credit crunch and how the Fed has responded, let me turn to some of the underlying forces that might have led to the turmoil. One major problem was that underwriting standards deteriorated substantially. This development is most evident in the mortgage market where subprime mortgages were created with high loan-to-value ratios, high debt-to-income ratios, or little or no documentation. However, some deterioration in underwriting standards probably also had occurred in other forms of lending, such as commercial real estate and leveraged loans for private equity buyouts. One factor behind the slippage in underwriting standards may be that the originators of the underlying loans earn profits from up-front fees, holding the loans on their own balance sheets only long enough to bundle them up and sell the resulting securities to investors.4\n\nWhile this explanation may account for why originators of loans would participate in a relaxation of underwriting standards, one might wonder about those investors who bought the securitized assets. Why weren’t they more concerned about the quality of the assets they were buying? A number of interrelated explanations have been offered. First, the desire for leverage tends to be procyclical, so that, during booms when risk recedes, highly leveraged investors, like intermediaries in the shadow banking sector, actively seek projects to finance.5 Moreover, real interest rates have been extremely low in recent years. This phenomenon—famously referred to as a “conundrum” by former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan—might have motivated investors to reach for higher yields, which normally would be seen as taking on bigger risks.6 However, with advances in financial engineering promising to offer higher returns without commensurate increases in risk, the complex securities and derivatives that are involved in the current turmoil may have seemed especially attractive at the time. Indeed, even though the complexity of these instruments made it difficult for investors themselves to evaluate and price the risk embedded in them, in many cases, they were reassured by the triple-A ratings given by the rating agencies. It is now clear that these risk assessments were often not reliable. Indeed, the turmoil began after the rating agencies substantially downgraded these instruments.\n\nFinally, a key factor was that the boom in the securitization of mortgages occurred when home prices were soaring, making deals go well even if underwriting standards were lax. But once house prices leveled off in early 2006 and then began to decline, the stage was set for big trouble—and, of course, the trouble initially erupted in the subprime mortgage market.\n\nSubprime mortgages7\n\nSo now let me look at the subprime market more closely. In the late 1990s, it was fairly small and slow-growing, but after the 2001 recession, it took off. By one estimate, in late 2007, there were over 7 million subprime mortgages outstanding, or about 13 percent of the overall mortgage market. And for much of that time—through late 2005—things seemed to be going well, with subprime delinquencies remarkably low in most areas of the country, including the West. The hot spots that did crop up were not surprising—the Gulf Coast states hit by Hurricane Katrina and the Midwestern states experiencing poor economic performance.\n\nOf course, the picture is quite different today. Currently, close to 20 percent of subprime mortgages are delinquent or in foreclosure. Hot spots now include inland areas of California and parts of Nevada, Florida, and Ohio. In the West, the highest delinquency rates are in California’s Central Valley. Stockton, for example, jumped from about 3½ percent at the end of 2005 to over 27 percent in late 2007.8 The regional distribution of actual foreclosures largely mirrors that for delinquencies.\n\nResearch points to several factors that contributed to the subprime meltdown and its regional variation; these include broad economic conditions, housing market conditions, and the riskiness of borrower pools. Borrower characteristics, such as FICO scores, which are a measure of creditworthiness, and mortgage characteristics, such as loan-to-value ratios, are related to the probability that a borrower will default. It appears that declining underwriting standards played a key role by increasing the overall riskiness of the pool of subprime borrowers.\n\nHowever, the underlying risk of many subprime loans was masked until late-2005 when housing markets started to weaken. Indeed, research on the variation in subprime delinquency rates across regions and over time suggests that the pace of house price increases, or decreases, is the single best predictor of the level and change in subprime delinquency rates. The Stockton area, which I mentioned earlier, provides a good example. From 2003 to 2005, one prominent measure of house prices there averaged an increase of nearly 30 percent a year; but from 2005 to 2007, this measure was down at about a 7½ percent rate, and delinquencies soared. This strong link between house-price change and the performance of subprime loans is confirmed by formal statistical analysis that controls for other factors, such as economic conditions.\n\nThe link between house prices and delinquency rates is not surprising. It remains true that delinquencies and foreclosures are often precipitated by life events such as illness, divorce, or the loss of a job. However, the amount of equity in the home affects the ability or willingness of homeowners to keep current on their mortgage payments when these events occur. In a market in which house prices have been stagnant or declining, a borrower with a recent mortgage secured with little or no down payment does not have the flexibility to tap into the equity in the house to weather a life event. Moreover, some borrowers may be able to afford their loans but still be unwilling to make the payments if house prices are expected to remain low or to decline. In that case, some borrowers may conclude that they should just walk away.\n\nMuch has been made in the news about the role of interest rate resets in causing delinquencies and foreclosures. After all, delinquency rates on variable-rate subprime loans are far higher and are rising much faster than those on fixed-rate subprime mortgages. However, research suggests that this has not been a major factor, at least so far. The vast majority of subprime loans are recent vintages, so only a fraction had hit reset dates as of late 2007. Moreover, in many cases, the initial—or “teaser”—rates were not set that far below the formula, and some of the short-term rates that enter into these formulas have come down since last summer. Moreover, it turns out that variable-rate subprime loans are more likely to become delinquent because the pool of borrowers that took out these loans had higher risk characteristics than those who took out fixed rate loans.\n\nTo the extent that the subprime meltdown is tied to declining house prices rather than interest rate resets, other borrowers, including prime borrowers, also could be affected. Indeed, while default rates for the latter loans are lower than for subprime loans, delinquency rates among all categories are highly correlated with house price declines across regions of the country. More formal statistical analysis confirms that differences in house-price change account for most of the regional differences in delinquency rates, whether borrowers are prime or nonprime, or whether loans have fixed or variable rates.\n\nThis analysis underscores the importance of house-price movements both to future developments in the housing sector and also to the ultimate magnitude of credit losses that are likely to be realized by leveraged financial institutions on their holdings of mortgage-backed securities and other housing-related loans. Looking ahead, it seems likely that the period of house price declines will not be over very soon, since some models of the fundamental value of houses suggest that prices are still too high, and futures markets for house prices indicate further declines this year. This trajectory of house prices plays a critical role in the economic outlook, and I will turn to it next.\n\nEconomic outlook\n\nThe sudden tightening of financial conditions in the economy’s private sector hit economic activity hard in the fourth quarter. Growth slowed from a robust pace earlier in the year to a rate of only about ½ percent as the financial shock combined with, and intensified, an interrelated and ongoing shock—a pronounced housing downturn. In inflation-adjusted terms, spending on housing construction fell by nearly 13 percent in 2006 and by nearly 19 percent last year—subtracting ¾ of a percentage point and a full percentage point from U.S. real GDP growth in those same two periods. Moreover, forward-looking indicators—notably huge inventories of unsold new and existing homes—suggest that the end is not yet in sight. It seems likely that residential construction will be a major drag on the overall economy through the end of this year and into 2009.\n\nUntil recently, the deflating housing bubble had not spilled over to the rest of the economy. But now it has. Based on monthly data that cover most of the first quarter, it appears that growth in consumption and business investment spending has slowed markedly after years of robust performance, and, as a result, the economy has all but stalled and could contract over the first half of the year.\n\nWith respect to consumer spending, a long list of factors can be expected to have a depressing effect going forward. With house prices falling, homeowners’ total wealth is declining. At the same time, the fall in house prices has lowered the value of mortgage equity; less equity reduces the quantity of funds available for credit-constrained consumers to borrow through home equity loans or to extract through refinancing. In addition, consumers face constraints due to the declines in the stock market and the tightening of lending terms at depository institutions. The rise in delinquency rates across the spectrum of consumer loans is strongly indicative of the growing strains on households. And, energy, food, and other commodity prices have risen sharply in recent years, and this is “taxing” the disposable incomes of households and holding back consumer spending. Consumer spending also appears depressed by all of the bad economic and financial news, as national surveys show that consumer confidence has plummeted.\n\nYet another negative factor for consumption is that labor markets have weakened. In recent months, growth in employment from a survey of business establishments slowed sharply, actually falling in January and February. Slower job growth will have a negative impact on the disposable income available to households and therefore will provide an additional restraint on consumer spending.\n\nWhile business investment in equipment, software, and structures remained robust through the end of last year, it would not be surprising to see spending in this area slow or even decline this year in response to overall economic softening and tighter credit conditions. Recent monthly indicators of industrial activity and orders and shipments of capital goods point in this direction. Commercial real estate may face problems this year as securitized finance markets have all but dried up.\n\nOne bright spot for our economy is that foreign real GDP has advanced robustly over the past three years and American goods have become more competitive in global markets due, in part, to the decline in the dollar over the past several years. As a result, U.S. exports have done very well and I expect net exports to remain a source of strength. But there are some risks to consider. Some countries—especially in Europe—are experiencing direct negative impacts from the ongoing turmoil in financial markets, and others are likely to suffer indirect impacts from any slowdown in the U.S.\n\nEconomic policies are another important factor in gauging the economic outlook. The FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) has eased the stance of monetary policy substantially in the past six months, and the fiscal stimulus package signed into law recently is well timed—with checks beginning to hit the mail in May. Both of these actions can be expected to boost growth in coming quarters.\n\nThis brings me to my bottom line for the outlook. Current indicators suggest that, starting in the fourth quarter, the economy, at best, slowed to a crawl. With stimulus from monetary and fiscal policy, economic performance should improve in the second half of this year. Nonetheless, the economy is still likely to turn in a sluggish performance for the year as a whole. With the unemployment rate currently at 4.8 percent, it is still about in line with my estimate of its sustainable level. But the weak performance I expect this year is likely to push unemployment into a range indicating the presence of some slack.\n\nI’ve described what I see as the most likely outcome for the economy. However, these are particularly uncertain times. Given the ongoing turmoil in financial markets, the continued contraction in housing, and growing caution by households and businesses, I see the risks to this outcome as skewed to the downside.\n\nNow let me turn to inflation. Much of the recent data have been disappointing. Inflation has been boosted by rising energy and other commodity prices and declines in the value of the dollar. Over the past twelve months, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCEPI) rose 3.4 percent, up from 2.3 percent over the prior year. Some of this increase has been passed through to core PCE price inflation, which excludes food and energy prices. This index has averaged 2 percent over the past twelve months, which is at the upper end of the range that I consider consistent with price stability. This development presents a risk that bears careful attention. However, my forecast of the most likely outcome over the next couple of years is that inflation will moderate from present levels.\n\nDevelopments in labor compensation are an important part of the transmission process from monetary policy to inflation, and it is reassuring that broad measures of compensation have expanded quite moderately over the past year. Moreover, productivity growth has been fairly robust, and, after incorporating its effects, unit labor costs are up by less than 1 percent over the past four quarters. In addition, the weakening in economic activity that seems likely should put somewhat greater downward pressure on inflation going forward. Inflation tends to fall noticeably during recessions, and that provides a downside risk for my inflation forecast.\n\nThe Federal Reserve cannot, however, be complacent about inflation. Most survey measures of long-run inflation expectations have remained well behaved. But some measures of inflation compensation derived from the differential between nominal and real Treasury yields have moved up. Such measures are an imperfect indicator of inflation expectations, because they are affected by inflation risk and illiquidity. Nevertheless, these movements highlight the risk that our attempts to deal with problems in the real economy could lead to higher inflation expectations and an erosion of our credibility.\n\nOverall, I expect PCE price inflation to fall below 2 percent next year based on futures markets’ expectations of a leveling out of energy and other commodity prices, and the projected weakening of labor and product markets.\n\nMonetary policy\n\nLet me finally turn to how the Fed has responded to the difficulties in the financial and real economies. We’ve taken a two-pronged approach. First, as I have already indicated, a number of actions have been aimed at improving the functioning and liquidity of funding markets for depository institutions and primary securities dealers. These actions are distinct from monetary policy per se because any effect they might have on reserves or the federal funds rate is offset by open market operations. Their purpose is to avoid sharp disruptions of economic activity and employment and to keep the transmission channels of monetary policy open and functioning effectively.\n\nWith regard to monetary policy, the FOMC has taken significant steps since September, cutting the federal funds rate by 3 full percentage points to 2¼ percent. With core PCE price inflation running at around 2 percent, the real—inflation-adjusted—funds rate is at an accommodative level of around zero or slightly higher.\n\nI consider such accommodation an appropriate response to the contractionary effects of the ongoing financial shock and the housing downturn, and I anticipate that the resulting stimulus, combined with that of the fiscal package, will foster a moderate pickup in growth later this year. At the same time, consumer inflation seems likely to decline gradually to somewhat below 2 percent over the next couple of years, a level that is consistent with price stability.\n\nHowever, economic prospects remain unusually uncertain, and the downside risks to growth are significant. Going forward, the Committee must carefully monitor and assess the effects of ongoing financial and economic developments on the outlook for output and inflation, and be prepared to act in a timely manner to promote a return of the economy to a sustainable path.\n\nNow, I’d be glad to take your questions.\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1.

And each individual who succeeds in getting more liquid forces down the price of assets in the process of getting liquid, with the result that the margins of other individuals are impaired and their courage undermined.”\n\n4.

The classification generally is a lender-given designation for loans extended to borrowers with some sort of credit impairment, say, due to missing installment payments on debt or the lack of a credit history. Characteristics of the loan can also be a factor: these include having little or no documentation or high loan-to-value and payment-to-income ratios. This means that figures regarding subprime lending differ depending on the source of the data.

Indeed, since the first conference back in 1991, the field has evolved considerably—the CRA itself has undergone significant revisions, New Markets Tax Credits have replaced Low Income Housing Tax Credits as the complicated investment instrument of the day, and financial products and services are increasingly being targeted to meet the financial services needs of the unbanked.\n\nPerhaps the most notable change, however, is that in the last 25 years, consumer credit markets have shifted dramatically, moving from a credit rationing approach to a risk-based pricing system. In other words, today, far fewer applicants are denied credit—rather, they are offered credit at higher prices intended to reflect the greater risk posed by these loans.1 This shift, coupled with other innovations in the financial markets, has significantly increased access to credit, with both positive and negative effects.\n \nOn the positive side, expanded access to credit has greatly increased the ability of low- and moderate-income households of all races and ethnicities to become homeowners.2 None of us would want to turn back the clock to the days when the prospects of being approved for a loan were more limited in certain neighborhoods and for certain classes of borrowers. But, as has become apparent over the past year with the rise in mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures, the risks associated with the changes in the consumer credit markets were greatly underestimated, and we are now grappling with the consequences.\n\nMy colleagues and I have been deeply involved in assessing the impact of rising foreclosures on the financial markets and the U.S. economy, and in developing the Fed’s policy response.3 On the monetary policy front, we have undertaken several actions designed to stimulate demand in the face of contractions in the housing market and the tightening of credit. We have also sought to bolster market liquidity and promote orderly market functioning through several new lending facilities. We continue to carefully monitor trends in the financial markets and the economy, and we are committed to acting in a timely manner to address new developments.\n\nIn my remarks today, however, I would like to focus on the implications of the trends in the consumer credit markets—particularly in the area of subprime mortgage lending—for all of you here working in the field of community development. Personally, one of my greatest concerns is how the rise in foreclosures is affecting low-income families and communities. As I think many of you in this room have seen firsthand, the impact of foreclosures has been felt most acutely in people’s homes and neighborhoods. Losing one’s home—from having to pack up boxes and face the uncertainty of “what’s next” to the long-term financial consequences—is not the dream anyone imagines for themselves when they pick up the keys to their first house.\n\nFor these reasons, I believe it is incredibly important to develop and share innovative solutions that can help to prevent foreclosures as well as mitigate the negative impact of foreclosures on borrowers and communities. In the words of the late Federal Reserve Board Governor Ned Gramlich, who had the foresight to see the risks in the credit market well before many of us, “…one of the nation’s primary goals over the next few years should be the avoidance of a domino effect that forces large and unnecessary losses on households through unnecessary or premature foreclosures.” 4 It is in pursuit of this goal that I offer my remarks today.\n\nForeclosure Trends and their Impact on Low-Income Communities\n\nTo begin the discussion, let me just quickly provide some context about the current scale of delinquencies and foreclosures. While some communities have been struggling with high rates of foreclosure for a much longer time,5 the recent national rise in delinquencies and foreclosures has been sudden and substantial. By one estimate, in 2007, more than 1.25 million homes entered foreclosure, and more than twice as many (2.6 million) were at least 30 days past due on their mortgage payments as of the fourth quarter of last year.6\n\nMost of the problems have been concentrated in the subprime market, and in particular, among subprime adjustable-rate mortgages, although more recently we’ve begun to see increases in foreclosures on subprime fixed-rate mortgages and even on prime adjustable rate mortgages.7\n\nThe reasons for the current crisis are complex and intertwined. Perhaps the most significant factor driving the current rise in delinquency and foreclosures is declining house values.  Economic research has shown that downward changes in house prices are strongly associated with subprime delinquency “hotspots.” 8 Of particular concern, however, is how relaxed underwriting standards and abusive lending practices have increased the risk of delinquency and foreclosure. As Chairman Bernanke recently noted, “far too much of the lending in recent years was neither responsible nor prudent.” 9 Between 2001 and 2006—right when we saw the largest growth in subprime lending—the quality of loans deteriorated fairly steadily as underwriting criteria eased.10 Many subprime loans included additional risk factors, such as a lack of full documentation, high combined loan-to-values, and high debt-to-income ratios.\n\nWhile much attention has focused on interest rate resets as a trigger for delinquencies and defaults—particularly on loans with artificially low introductory rates—so far they have not played a significant role.11 This is not to say, however, that resets won’t matter. In 2008, about 1.5 million loans are scheduled to reset. The Federal Reserve Board estimates that for the average subprime borrower, this could lead to a 10 percent increase in their monthly mortgage payments.12 Especially for borrowers already stretched to the limit, these resets may significantly increase the likelihood of delinquency.\n\nThe mortgage crisis has serious implications for the people and communities that all of us serve.  For instance, data collected under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act show that minorities are more likely to receive higher-priced loans than non-Hispanic whites, and that an increase in the incidence of higher-priced lending is associated with an increase in serious mortgage delinquency rates.13 In addition, studies of cities like Baltimore, Chicago, and Cleveland have found that low-income and minority communities have been the hardest hit by concentrations of foreclosures.14 The rise in foreclosures may have other negative implications as well, such as reducing neighborhood property values and increasing crime.15 Furthermore, as declining property taxes and transfer fees shrink local government revenues, vital services to low- and moderate-income families may also suffer. What this means is that the foreclosure crisis is likely to have a profound impact on the communities you work in, with effects that go well beyond the housing sector.\n\nBefore I turn to potential interventions, I want to make one final point.  There has been a tendency to conflate the current problems in the subprime market with CRA-motivated lending, or with lending to low-income families in general.  I believe it is very important to make a distinction between the two. Most of the loans made by depository institutions examined under the CRA have not been higher-priced loans,16 and studies have shown that the CRA has increased the volume of responsible lending to low- and moderate-income households.17 We should not view the current foreclosure trends as justification to abandon the goal of expanding access to credit among low-income households, since access to credit, and the subsequent ability to buy a home, remains one of the most important mechanisms we have to help low-income families build wealth over the long term.18\n\nBuilding a Foundation for Sustainable Homeownership\n\nWith that in mind, the current foreclosure crisis suggests to me the need to craft responses that will mitigate the negative impacts of foreclosure, and compels us to revisit the question of how to ensure that the tools that enable homeownership create sustainable benefits, both for families and for the communities in which they live.\n\nAs a first step, it is clear that avoiding preventable foreclosures should be a key priority for both the private and public sectors. Many important initiatives are already underway, including efforts to improve borrower outreach through public service announcements and community events, to develop a systematic and streamlined approach to restructuring adjustable rate loans, and to create new refinance options to help borrowers shift into more sustainable loan products. I support these efforts, as well as the collection of data that can help us to ascertain their effectiveness. I am particularly encouraged that efforts such as the HOPE NOW Alliance and the Mortgage Relief Fund supported by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston are the result of collaborative agreements among government agencies, regulators, lenders, investors, servicers and nonprofits. The complexity and seriousness of the foreclosure issue, and its deep impact on borrowers, neighborhoods, and the economy, call for these kinds of cross-sector partnerships, both locally and nationally.\n\nThere are some signs that these efforts are working, and that the number of loan modifications is growing.19 In addition, the FHASecure plan and the increase in the FHA conforming loan limits should enable more borrowers to refinance into an FHA-insured mortgage.20 The recent announcement by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on plans to increase liquidity in the mortgage markets is also promising.21 Still, the scale and impact of these efforts to date are small compared to the volume of loans that are delinquent, and many counselors and servicers lack the capacity to respond effectively to demand.  In addition, as home prices decline, many borrowers are finding themselves with loan amounts that are higher than their home values, limiting their refinance options. It is critical that we continue to explore the possibility of a broader range of interventions that would help keep families in their homes.\n\nBut, I think it is equally important to begin thinking now about how to ensure that access to credit and homeownership provides a long-term benefit for low-income households and communities.\n\nAs a first step, there is a need to develop new strategies that help low-income borrowers—particularly those that may not have extensive financial knowledge—make better and more informed credit choices. Additional investments in financial education and homeownership counseling must be a key component of this strategy. Financial education has been shown to help households manage their finances more prudently, especially in decisions concerning credit, saving, and investment, and it has been shown to reduce the likelihood of default.22 Calling for more financial education is not a new idea, but challenges remain in funding educational programs and developing appropriate curricula and delivery channels for diverse audiences.  Later this morning, you will have a chance to see one new fun approach to teaching children about financial management skills.\n\nSecond, we need to expand access to affordable homeownership opportunities.  The gap in homeownership affordability—especially in states like California—is as high as it has ever been.<23 As long as an adjustable rate, interest-only or high LTV subprime loan is the only way to afford a house, low-income families will continue to take on loans that they cannot sustain over the long term, and may be at greater risk of falling prey to unscrupulous lending practices. In stark contrast to the results we are seeing in the subprime market, the vast majority of new homeowners who have gone through affordable homeownership programs—which often involve pre- and post-purchase counseling and support as well as a savings component such as an Individual Development Account—have not defaulted on their loans.\n\nThis evidence also speaks to a much greater need for savings options for low-income families, both owners and renters.24 Helping families save for a downpayment, and ensuring that they have a savings buffer to help them weather adverse economic times or life events, may lead to better outcomes overall than mortgages that make homeownership affordable only through risky loan terms.25\n\nIn addition, strategies to increase the supply of affordable homes are also needed.  For example, I know many of you in this room have been extremely proactive in thinking about innovative ways to convert foreclosed properties into affordable rental or homeownership opportunities.26 These efforts, as well as other potential strategies, such as the establishment of housing trust funds and community land trusts, can serve as mechanisms for creating long-term housing affordability.\n\nThird, to be successful, policies that help low-income and minority households enter homeownership must be linked with broader community development strategies.  Low-income households, and particularly low-income minority households, may be especially vulnerable to buying homes in disadvantaged neighborhoods, where job opportunities are limited, schools are often subpar, and the financial benefits of homeownership may be more limited.27 Much of the work that you already do to stimulate neighborhood economic development, increase local employment opportunities and wages, and improve neighborhood-linked amenities such as schools and transportation options, are critical in transforming the opportunities available to low-income households.\n\nLast, but certainly not least, we need to think more broadly about how homeownership fits into the overall asset-building picture for low-income households, and what other programs or policies are necessary to ensure that homeownership is sustainable.  In one study of low-income homeowners, researchers found that two-thirds of households that refinanced their homes did so to pay down other debt, including higher cost credit card debt.  Others borrowed against the equity in their homes to pay for medical and educational expenses.28 It is troubling that so many low-income families have had to use  home equity to help manage their overall debt load, or to bridge a gap in health care insurance.  We need to help households learn how to manage their finances and to create safety nets that offer protection against economic shocks, so that low-income families are less vulnerable to losing their homes.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude, I would like to note some of the ways the Federal Reserve is responding to this crisis, even beyond the steps designed to stabilize the financial markets. These efforts are taking place across the System, and are built on our strengths in research and data analysis and on our regional presence.\n\nAt the San Francisco Fed, this work has included providing research, data and maps to community groups and local governments on neighborhood hotspots as well as establishing local task forces that can leverage local resources and stakeholders to respond to local needs. Through our convenings, we are working to improve communication between borrowers, counselors, and servicers to put a human face on what is often a distant, lengthy, and bureaucratic process. And, as always, we are committed to sharing best practices in foreclosure mitigation, both through our publications and through our convenings.  Three of the panels at this year’s conference address this topic, and will present strategies for preventing foreclosure and for mitigating the negative impact on neighborhoods. In addition, the San Francisco Fed will be sponsoring a national conference specifically on how to address REO property issues in high-cost markets later this year.\n\nFinally, while the issues of foreclosure are certainly capturing center stage, it is important not to forget all of the other aspects of the work you do in low- and moderate-income communities. Over the next two and a half days, whether you’re immersed in the CRA regulations, learning the basics of underwriting multi-family rental properties, or exploring emerging topics in community development, I’m confident that you will return to your own communities with new ideas and contacts.  I applaud the dedication of each and every one of you to improving the lives of low-income families, and I know that working together, you will continue to help lay the foundation for sustainable and vibrant communities.\n\nThank you. I hope you enjoy the conference.\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1. Eric S. Belsky and Ren S.

        "content": "\n\nI would like to thank Governor Noyer and the Banque de France for organizing this stimulating conference on globalization, inflation and monetary policy. With strong global growth boosting oil, food and materials prices, the linkages between globalization and domestic inflation—one focus of Bill White’s interesting paper–are very much on the minds of monetary policymakers these days. I will return to this development as I conclude my remarks.\n\nBill White’s paper is an ambitious attempt to identify the main factors responsible for the decline in global inflation since the 1970s and the persistence of low global inflation in recent years. The stylized facts about inflation that Bill documents are striking. Over the past 25 years, the level and volatility of domestic inflation rates have declined significantly worldwide. The decline began in industrial countries in the early 1980s and then occurred in many developing countries in the 1990s. In addition, the inflation process has changed noticeably over this period. Inflation expectations have declined and become better-anchored, shocks to inflation have become less persistent, and there is less pass-through of shocks to energy and food prices and exchange rates into the overall inflation rate.\n\nThese developments raise two basic questions about the determinants of domestic inflation which Bill addresses. First, why did inflation fall in the 1980s and 1990s in so many countries? Second, is there a common factor or set of factors that explains why inflation has remained low in these countries in recent years despite, in Bill’s view, increasing monetary stimulus?\n\nBill considers four possible explanations, finding each to have serious shortcomings.\n\nThe first explanation is “more effective central bank policy.” But, in Bill’s view, this does not explain why inflation fell sharply in countries with different degrees of economic and financial development, central bank independence, and exchange rate regimes. Nor does it account for why inflation has remained low recently despite accommodative monetary policy.\n\nThe second is domestic deregulation. Here he argues that it is unlikely to have been of sufficient magnitude to explain the phenomenon of sharply lower inflation worldwide, particularly since the extent of deregulation has varied across countries and has been notably lower in emerging market countries.\n\nThe third explanation is excess global saving, or, equivalently a global investment “drought.”  He argues that any resultant decline in aggregate demand might have been expected to lower not only inflation but also output growth, contrary to the robust growth evidenced worldwide, until this past year.\n\nFourth is globalization. He argues that it explains neither the sharpness with which inflation declined in the first place in the early 1980s in industrial countries, nor the long delay before inflation began to come down in emerging markets.\n\nBecause no single hypothesis adequately explains the full set of “stylized facts”, Bill advocates a global aggregate demand-aggregate supply approach in which all four explanations matter to inflation to varying degrees and at varying times. Demand-side factors, driven mainly by tighter domestic monetary policy, were central to the decline of inflation in the 1980s and 1990s. Supply-side factors, associated with both domestic deregulation and globalization, as well as lower aggregate demand associated with excess global saving, all have played a role in restraining inflation more recently\n \nI find Bill’s complementary approach–giving weight to factors that are global in scope and have impacted both demand and supply—to be sensible and appealing.  For the United States, I agree that all four factors are relevant to inflationary trends. That said, I would probably ascribe somewhat less importance than Bill to the role of globalization and somewhat more to effective monetary policy in explaining why inflation was tamed in the 1980s and 1990s and why it has remained low since then.\n\nWith respect to globalization, I agree with Bill that, through its effect on relative prices, globalization has created both tailwinds and headwinds for central banks in their quest for price stability.  Such shocks do not, in my view, alter in the least the ability of a central bank to attain its desired inflation objective over the medium term in a flexible exchange rate regime. But they do affect inflation in the short run, and they can make the attainment of a particular inflation goal easier or more painful by impacting NAIRU, at least for a time. Increases in the prices of oil and other commodities due to strong global growth, have certainly created headwinds in recent years.  In contrast, declines in the relative price of manufactured imports, due partly to the rapid expansion of capacity in China and other emerging markets, have created tailwinds that, for a time, made the Fed’s job somewhat easier. The impact on inflation was similar to that associated with the pickup in productivity growth during the second half of the 1990s.\n\nIn my view, however, the impact of the tailwinds associated with global competition are frequently overstated.1 Most research to assess the magnitude of direct and indirect linkages between import prices and inflation for the U.S. and other industrial countries finds that the impact, thus far, has been surprisingly limited. For example, a 2006 IMF analysis calculates that non-oil import price reductions lowered U.S. inflation by an average of ½ percentage point a year over the period from 1997 to 2005.2 This finding is in line with an analysis at the Federal Reserve Board that estimates that lower (core) import prices reduced core U.S. inflation by an annual average of ½ to 1 percentage point over the past 10 years.3 A Fed study focusing specifically on China’s impact on U.S. consumer prices also finds only modest effects—since 1993, about 0.1 percentage point per year.4 Remember that, even now, non-traded goods and services represent the large majority of U.S. domestic consumption.\n\nBill emphasizes, and I agree, that the effect of globalization on inflation may operate not just through import prices but also through other channels, including those relating to the labor market. Globalization has certainly enhanced the opportunities for firms to substitute imports for domestic output.  And firms operating plants in several countries are increasingly able to shift production from domestic plants to those in lower-cost countries. These growing opportunities for substitution could certainly affect wage and price dynamics explaining, in particular, why the Phillips curve appears to have flattened in many industrial countries.\n\nA review of the literature suggests that there is substantial empirical evidence that inflation in the U.S. has become less sensitive to measures of the domestic output gap.5  One possible reason is that firms have become less willing to grant wage increases that would impair their cost-competitiveness, even in the face of tight domestic labor markets. This might diminish the sensitivity of wage inflation to domestic slack.  However, San Francisco Fed staff find no change in the coefficient on the unemployment rate in wage-price Phillips curve in recent years. This suggests that, insofar as globalization has flattened the price-price Phillips curve, it is more likely to have done so through changes in firms’ ability to mark up costs in setting prices than through changes in the effects of domestic slack on wage growth. This finding seems consistent with recent research at the Federal Reserve Board that finds evidence that U.S. tradeable goods prices and markups are increasingly sensitive to movements in foreign prices.6\n\nA flattening of the Phillips curve could explain why inflation has become less volatile in industrial countries.  However, the finding of a flatter Phillips curve is open to differing interpretations. For example, a Board study estimates Phillips curve equations over the period 1977-2005 for 11 OECD countries and found the sensitivity of inflation to the domestic output gap has declined over time in many of the countries in the sample, but it found no evidence that this decline was attributable to globalization.7  Other studies by the OECD8 and by Larry Ball draw similar conclusions.\n \nIt is also worth considering the possibility that globalization could be holding inflation down by making workers in the U.S. and elsewhere more fearful of job loss, thus lowering wage demands. I agree with Bill that this may account for the declining wage share in output in the G-10 countries and could explain why, in the U.S. at least, there has been so little evidence of “real wage resistance” in the face of energy, food, and import price shocks. The empirical challenge is to estimate the effects of globalization through these channels when the actual substitution of inputs and outsourcing is limited, but the threat is large.\n\nProvocative research at the BIS suggests that globalization is affecting inflation in yet another way, namely, by making domestic inflation increasingly sensitive to foreign, rather than domestic output gaps. This phenomenon could reflect an intensification of the degree of effective competition between domestic and foreign workers in the labor market due to globalization and might explain why inflation movements are so highly correlated across countries. Empirically, Borio and Filardo find that a measure of the global output gap has a significant effect on inflation in estimates of Phillips curve equations for a sample of 16 countries.9 As Bill is careful to acknowledge, however, other empirical studies have drawn different conclusions.  For example, the Board study I just referred to does not find any significant effect of foreign output gaps on domestic consumer price inflation. Moreover, San Francisco Fed staff found that measures of world capacity are not significant when added to the Phillips curves that they use to forecast inflation, and that the usual measures of domestic labor and product market slack retain their significance.\n\nAs I mentioned at the outset, I probably attach more weight than would Bill to effective monetary policy in explaining why inflation was tamed in the 1980s and 1990s and why it has remained low since then. So let me turn to the two problems that Bill cites concerning the role of monetary policy in explaining the stylized facts about inflation. First, Bill said he was puzzled that such a diverse set of countries have appeared to be so successful in bringing down inflation through greater monetary policy credibility. I don’t find it so puzzling.\n\nThe policy shift was in part a response to earlier adverse experiences with high and variable inflation in industrial countries in the 1970s and in many emerging markets through the 1980s. Governments in the industrial countries, including the U.S., reacted first by strengthening institutional frameworks to foster monetary stability. For example, some industrialized countries, such as New Zealand, Canada, and the UK adopted explicit inflation-targeting regimes. Others, like the US, Germany, and Japan, have used less formal, but still forceful, means to convey the significant weight they place on low inflation. Still others, such as the Southern European countries of Portugal, Italy, Spain, and Greece, succeeded in lowering inflation to meet the conditions of joining the European Monetary Union.\n\nThe later shift to lower-inflation policies in emerging market economies occurred in part because they could take advantage of low foreign inflation, in part because they could learn from successful policies elsewhere, and in part because of public dissatisfaction with inflation. Globalization of capital markets probably also strengthened the commitment of emerging market policymakers to macroeconomic stability. These countries’ interest in attracting capital inflows coupled with their recognition of the potential macroeconomic damages resulting from capital flight must surely have disciplined the conduct of monetary policy. As Bill pointed out, their approaches differed. Some emerging markets first stabilized inflation by creating currency boards and credibly pegging to foreign countries; here Hong Kong in 1983 and Argentina in 1991 come to mind.  Others stabilized inflation by pegging temporarily before allowing more exchange rate flexibility, as in the case of Israel in the mid-1980s and Brazil in the mid-1990s. More recently, some emerging markets have adopted inflation-targeting frameworks to provide nominal anchors: Korea in 1998, Brazil and Mexico in 1999, and Thailand in 2000 are examples.\n \nSecond, Bill said he was puzzled about why inflation has not been higher in recent years, given what he regards as accommodative monetary policies in many countries, that is, low real interest rates, rapid growth of money and credit, booming asset prices, and policy rates significantly below levels implied by Taylor rules.\n\nI frankly don’t consider this much of a puzzle at all. The stance of monetary policy must be judged not on the basis of money and credit growth but rather on the level of the real policy interest rate compared with its neutral or equilibrium value. That value can vary over time and, in my estimation, it was quite low in the United States and many other industrial countries following the bursting of the tech bubble, the collapse in investment spending, and the 2001 recession. Indeed, the Federal Reserve worried in 2003 about the possibility of deflation and the prospect of hitting the “zero bound,” a situation that research shows is best avoided by cutting rates early and substantially. A decline in the estimated equilibrium real rate coupled with a desire to use policy aggressively to avoid the zero bound, explain why, in the United States, the policy rate may have fallen below levels implied by Taylor rules. As Bill details, many emerging market economies experienced a savings glut, or more accurately, an investment drought, in the aftermath of the financial crises of the late 1990s and the subsequent tech bust.  Such drags on aggregate demand necessitated low real interest rates to offset them, and the boom in housing, which occurred not only in the United States but around the globe, provided an offset to restraint in other components of aggregate demand.\n\nDuring the past few years, strong global growth has diminished slack in labor markets around the world and pushed up energy and commodity prices. From the U.S. standpoint, whatever tailwinds may have resulted from falling non-commodity import prices waned as the dollar declined.  Even so, core inflation in the United States and most other industrial countries has remained reasonably well contained. Bill credits supply-side factors associated with both domestic deregulation and globalization in holding down inflation. I consider it a mistake, however, to downplay the role of monetary policy, in particular its credibility. In the U.S. case, it is the credibility of monetary policy that, in my view, has helped to insure that the inflation shocks resulting from energy, food, materials, and exchange rates do not spill over into inflation expectations and wage setting, and thus have only transitory effects. Credibility accounts for why inflation appears generally to have become less persistent. Households and firms believe that such shocks will not be allowed to feed into further increases in inflation, so inflation expectations have become better anchored. Indeed, much research documents that movements in energy prices have had far smaller effects on core inflation since the mid- 1980s, and the most compelling reason for this shift is the credibility of monetary policy.\n\nLet me conclude by looking forward, offering my personal assessment of where domestic inflation is heading in the U.S. Recent inflation performance has certainly been disappointing and the disappointments stem largely from strong global headwinds. Rising food and energy prices have boosted the total PCE price index by 3.7% over the past 12 months and 5.4 percent during the past three. Excluding food and energy, the core PCE price index is still up 2.2 percent over the past 12 months, an outcome that partly reflects pass-through from the drop in the dollar. Even so, I expect both total and core inflation to moderate over the next few years, edging down to under 2 percent, an outcome that is broadly consistent with my interpretation of the Fed’s price stability mandate. And I see the risks to this outcome as roughly balanced.\n\nMy forecast of moderating inflation assumes that labor compensation will continue to grow, as it has in recent years, at a reasonably modest pace. This in turn assumes that inflation expectations will remain well-anchored, as they have been, and also that workers will not through their bargaining offset the real losses resulting from higher food and energy prices. It importantly assumes that energy and food prices will stabilize near their current levels so that the inflationary impetus from these sources will dissipate over time.  Bill rightly points out that these assumptions cannot be taken for granted. Rising food and energy prices have lowered the purchasing power of the median worker and, as Bill comments, some “pushback” could occur. The expectation that energy prices will stabilize near their current levels is consistent with futures prices, but such expectations have been dashed many times over the past few years.  With respect to inflation expectations, Bill rightly cautions that “the experience of past errors should not be forgotten today when it is once again being suggested that inflation expectations are sticky (now at low levels).” I agree that the Fed certainly cannot afford to take for granted that inflation expectations will remain well-anchored.\n   \nAt the same time, there are downside inflationary pressures relating to the slowdown in the U.S. economy. Bill notes, and I agree, that the U.S. economy is particularly exposed to downside risks from the unwinding of the housing bubble and disruptions in financial markets. There is some slack now in the U.S. labor market and, if these downside economic risks materialize, quite a bit more slack could emerge. Even with a flatter Phillips curve, such a development would place some downward pressure on inflation. It is this unpleasant combination of risks to both inflation and employment that the FOMC must balance as it assesses the appropriate path for monetary policy going forward.\n\nEnd Notes\n\n* The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System or on the FOMC.

        "content": "\n\nProspects for the U.S. Economy in 2008\n\nGood morning, and thank you very much for inviting me to speak to you today. I was very pleased that things worked out for us to get together here at the San Francisco Fed, and I want you to know that we’re delighted to have you. I’d also like to say a word of appreciation for all the support this event has received from the people at Shorenstein. It is yet another example of the company’s engagement in and commitment to San Francisco and to the Bay Area.\n\nToday I’d like to talk about developments in the economy and in monetary policy, two items that have definitely been making the news lately. On January 22, the Federal Open Market Committee cut its main policy rate—the federal funds rate—by three-quarters of a percentage point. Then, on January 30, at the scheduled meeting, the Committee voted to cut the policy rate again, this time by half a percentage point to 3 percent. Taking these actions together with those that began last September, the Committee has cut that rate by a total of 2¼ percentage points.\n\nThe purpose of these actions is to stimulate demand in the face of the combined impact of the severe contraction in housing and the related financial market disruptions. While housing construction has been weak for more than two years, its effects did not spill over to most other sectors until fairly recently. That’s why we used to talk about a “dual economy,” with housing notably weak, but other sectors doing well. However, financial markets became disrupted in the middle of last year, which has not only intensified the housing slump, but also has tightened credit conditions for some households and businesses. The combined impact has led to slowing more broadly through the economy. It is this broader slowdown that has elicited Federal Reserve actions in recent months.\nIn my remarks today, I plan to discuss my views on policy and on the prospects for the nation’s economy this year and beyond.\n\nFinancial markets\n\nI’d like to begin with a discussion of the disruptions in U.S. and global financial markets, because they influence not only the economy’s most likely course but also the risks that could alter that course. In my view, these disruptions are likely to continue for some time. In other words, I think they have laid bare some fundamental issues with the structure of the financial system that will require significant adjustments.\n\nThe financial disruptions are centered in the markets for asset-backed securities. The aim of such instruments is to diversify and spread risk, potentially enhancing economic welfare by broadening access to credit and lowering its cost. These instruments have been around a long time. For example, for many years, when a bank originated a mortgage, instead of holding it on its books, it may have sold the mortgage to one of the government-sponsored agencies, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. The agencies, in turn, would then bundle that mortgage with other similar mortgages into a security. The virtue of this mortgage-backed security is its liquidity—that is, it can be traded in financial markets. Since around 2003, private investment banks and commercial banks have increasingly been involved in securitizing mortgages and other assets as well. This business has grown dramatically, securitizing many types of underlying loans and, importantly, about 75 percent of all subprime mortgages in 2006.\n\nAdvances in financial engineering have led to new and complex forms of asset-backed securities. For example, CDOs, or collateralized debt obligations, package multiple mortgage-backed securities—essentially securitizing several already securitized bundles of long-term debt instruments. Typically, they include tranches—literally, “slices”—of mortgage-backed securities with different exposures to risk based on a prioritization of the payments from the underlying mortgage securities, and are a type of “structured credit.” There are even instruments, known as CDO-squared, that consist of tranches based on holdings of other CDOs, rather than “simple” mortgage-backed securities, and CDO-cubed that, as you might now guess, consist of tranches based on holdings of CDO-squared.\n\nTo deal with the complexity of these instruments, many market participants, including financial institutions and other sophisticated investors, relied to a great extent on credit rating agencies for assessments of the risk. However, last summer, to the surprise of many, the rating agencies announced a set of substantial downgradings of highly rated tranches of a number of subprime mortgage-backed securities in light of rapidly rising delinquencies in some types of those mortgages. These downgrades raised concerns not only about mortgage-backed securities themselves, but also about the quality of rating agencies’ evaluations of risk in other structured credits. As a result, investors grew wary, as they had trouble knowing what risks were embedded in these instruments, how to price the risks, and who would ultimately bear the risks. The consequence is that the markets for many such assets are now highly illiquid and all but closed for new business.\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, it is now apparent that underwriting standards slipped substantially in the United States as house prices soared. For example, permissible combined loan-to-value ratios edged up during 2005 and 2006. And no- or low-documentation loans—so-called “stated income” loans—became more prevalent. Such loans might have performed reasonably well if house prices had continued to rise, but once house prices leveled off and then began to decline, the stage was set for trouble.\n\nThe financial turmoil has spread beyond the mortgage market in part because structured credits have been based on a wide variety of underlying loans, such as business loans, including the loans used to finance the recent wave of leveraged buyouts, or LBOs, commercial real estate, student loans, credit card loans, and subprime mortgages, to name a few.\n\nThe bottom line is that, in recent years, the financial system has gone through a significant restructuring that made evaluating and pricing risk difficult. The reverberations of the resulting financial disruption are still with us. I’d like to describe some of them now.\n\nAs investors have sought to shun risk, there has been a worldwide “flight to safety,” leading to a strong demand to hold U.S. Treasury securities—the safest and most liquid instruments in the world. This demand has contributed to a sharp decline in interest rates on Treasuries. Of course, these rates also have declined because of the Committee’s moves to ease policy.\n\nHowever, the potential stimulatory effects of this drop in risk-free Treasury rates have been offset in many cases by another key feature of the financial turmoil, namely, a sharp rise in interest rate risk spreads, as riskier borrowers have had to pay higher premiums to compensate lenders for a perceived increase in the probability of default or losses in that event. On the corporate side, prime borrowers have actually experienced some net decline in interest rates since the shock first hit—that is, even though risk spreads are higher, they have been more than offset by lower Treasury rates. However, issuers of low-grade corporate bonds with greater credit risk, in contrast, face notably higher interest rates.\n\nThe mortgage market has been the epicenter of the shock, and, not surprisingly, greater aversion to risk has been particularly apparent there, with spreads above Treasuries increasing for mortgages of all types. Although borrowing rates for low-risk conforming mortgages are now lower than they were before the financial shock hit, fixed rates on jumbo mortgages are higher on net. Subprime mortgages remain difficult to get at any rate. Moreover, many markets for securitized assets, especially non-agency mortgage-backed securities, continue to experience severe illiquidity; in other words, the markets are not functioning efficiently, or may not be functioning much at all.\n\nThe turmoil is reverberating in depository institutions as well.1 One problem is an unanticipated buildup of mortgages as well as LBO-related loans on their balance sheets. These loans were in the pipeline for securitization but could not be sold. This problem has hit banks in part because they themselves were involved in creating structured credits that held mortgages and the leveraged loans that they had originated. In addition, they face problems with some structured investment vehicles, or SIVs, that they had sponsored and backstopped to hold and fund portfolios of securitized assets through the issuance of asset-backed commercial paper. When the SIVs were in danger of failing, the banks were concerned about reputational effects and decided to rescue them by taking the underlying assets back onto their own balance sheets. Furthermore, as investors have pulled back from the markets for asset-backed securities, the value of these securities and CDOs has fallen dramatically, so banks and other financial institutions have had to write down their values, which has shrunk their capital and driven their stock prices down. Another problem for bank balance sheets is that credit losses have been edging up.\n\nThe latest reverberation involves monoline financial guarantors. These companies guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest due on various types of securities, including structured credits. The guarantees can increase the credit rating of the covered securities and thus increase the value of those securities on banks’ balance sheets. The problem today is that the guarantors are reporting sizable losses because of the increased riskiness of the securities they are covering. Those losses can affect the guarantors’ capital positions and even their own credit ratings. A rating downgrade of a guarantor reduces the value of its credit enhancements and lowers the price of the covered securities. Holders of those securities such as banks then have to take write-downs to reflect the lower value of the securities.\n\nFortunately, the banking system entered this difficult period in a strong position. Most institutions were extremely well capitalized. However, the combination of unanticipated growth in assets and in write-downs has put increased pressure on banks’ capital positions. Given their concerns about capital adequacy and their increased caution in managing liquidity, it is not surprising that they are tightening credit terms and restricting availability. At first, the focus was mostly on mortgages, but now it has spread to other kinds of loans, including home equity lines of credit, credit cards, and other consumer credit, as well as business loans. The tightening of credit is also a response to a now noticeable deterioration in credit quality, particularly for subprime mortgages; the losses in other parts of the consumer loan portfolio remain at relatively low levels from an historical perspective, but they, too, have edged up.\n\nFinally, equity markets have hardly been immune to recent financial turbulence. Broad U.S. equity indices have been very volatile, and, on the whole, have declined since August, representing a restraint on spending. More recently, some of these declines have occurred as profits have come in below market expectations for some financial firms due to write-downs of the value of mortgage-backed securities.\nMy overall assessment is that the turbulence in financial markets is due to some fundamental problems that are not likely to be resolved quickly. The effects of these problems have now made credit conditions tighter throughout most of the economy’s private sector, and this will restrain spending going forward. The impact hit economic activity mainly in the fourth quarter, and so far, it has been starkly negative. After robust performance in the second and third quarters of last year, growth slowed significantly in the fourth quarter—to a pace of only ½ percent. This brings me to the outlook for the economy.\n\nEconomic outlook\n\nCurrent indicators point to continued anemic growth for at least the first half of this year as well as significant downside risks even to those weak expectations. As I mentioned at the outset, though the prolonged slump in housing construction did not spill over significantly to the rest of the economy during 2006 and much of 2007, when combined with the recent financial market turmoil, it has been central to the emergence of today’s slow-growth environment. And the course of its resolution will be a key factor in the economic outlook.\n\nForward-looking indicators of housing activity strongly suggest that the downward cycle may be with us a while longer. Housing permits and sales are dropping, and inventories of unsold homes are at very high levels. Those inventories could rise even higher as foreclosures continue to mount. I’m not referring only to foreclosures on subprime adjustable-rate mortgages, which, as we all know, have increased sharply over the past couple of years. More recently, we’ve begun to see increases in foreclosures on subprime fixed-rate mortgages and even on prime adjustable-rate mortgages.\nWithin this Federal Reserve District, housing has been harder hit in some areas than in others. For example, builders and homeowners in parts of Arizona, Nevada, and the inland regions of California have seen some of the worst of the downturn, watching prices fall and equity evaporate as homes sit unsold for extended periods.\n\nThe Bay Area has not been totally immune to these developments. By the end of 2007, existing home sales were down about 35 to 40 percent from the previous year, reaching their lowest level in at least two decades. Some cities and towns in the eastern part of this region were more exposed than others to subprime mortgages, and they experienced a sharp increase in mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures last year. Here in San Francisco and other parts of the Bay Area, where house prices routinely exceed half a million dollars, those in the housing market have run into a problem I already mentioned, namely, relatively high rates on jumbo mortgages. Despite the subprime and jumbo mortgage challenges, home prices were largely stable in the Bay Area during the first three quarters of 2007. It remains to be seen, of course, how they will do as further market adjustments occur.\n\nOn the national level, housing construction probably will continue to contract through the end of this year. It is true that the residential construction sector is a fairly small piece of the overall economy and is unlikely to cause significant overall weakness in and of itself. But the fallout from the housing cycle has many dimensions, and in the fourth quarter there were signs of spillovers to other sectors of the economy, most worrisomely, to consumer spending. This sector is a huge part of the economy—about 70 percent—and its growth slowed to a rate that is somewhat below its long-run trend in the face of spillovers from the housing market and rising energy and food prices.\n\nLooking ahead, developments related to housing are likely to continue to put a strain on consumers. For example, house prices have fallen noticeably and the declines have intensified. Moreover, futures markets for house prices indicate further—and even larger—declines in a number of metropolitan areas this year.\n\nWith house prices falling, homeowners’ total wealth is declining, and that could lead to a pullback in spending. At the same time, the fall in house prices may constrain consumer spending by lowering the value of mortgage equity; less equity reduces the quantity of funds available for credit-constrained consumers to borrow through home equity loans or to withdraw through refinancing.\n\nIndeed, it would not be surprising to see even more moderation over the next year or so, as consumers face additional constraints due to the declines in the stock market, the tightening of lending terms at depository institutions, and the lagged effects of previous increases in energy prices. National surveys show that consumer confidence has plummeted. And I have been hearing comments and stories from my business contacts in the retail industry that are also downbeat. The rise in delinquency rates across the spectrum of consumer loans is strongly indicative of the growing strains on households.\n\nFinally, another negative factor for consumption is that labor markets have softened. In recent months, growth in employment from a survey of business establishments slowed sharply, actually falling in January, and many other indicators point in the same direction. Slower job growth will have a negative impact on the disposable income available to households and therefore will provide an additional restraint on consumer spending.\n\nWith the domestic consumer likely to be pretty hobbled, it is tempting to look at consumers beyond our own borders to be a source of strength for economic activity. Foreign real GDP has advanced robustly over the past three years. With the dollar falling well below its level of a year ago, U.S. exports have done very well; partly for this reason, U.S. net exports—exports minus imports—which consistently held growth down from 2000 to 2005, actually gave it a lift over the past couple of years. I expect net exports to remain a source of strength. But some countries—especially in Europe—are experiencing direct negative impacts from the ongoing turmoil in financial markets. Others are likely to suffer indirect impacts from any slowdown in the U.S. A slowdown here could well produce ripple effects lowering growth there through trade linkages, and recently this factor has been reinforced by a worldwide drop in stock prices.\n\nEconomic policies are another important factor in gauging the economic outlook. As I have noted, the FOMC has eased the stance of monetary policy substantially in the past five months. Moreover, Congress has now passed a fiscal stimulus package to help the economy and it could provide notable stimulus in the latter half of this year.\n\nEven with such policy stimulus, the overall economy is still likely to turn in a very sluggish performance this year, expanding by a rate well below potential and creating more slack in labor markets. At 4.9 percent, the unemployment rate is already slightly above my estimate of its sustainable level. Slow growth this year would most likely push unemployment even higher.\n\nTo sum it up, for the next few quarters, I see economic activity as weighed down by the housing slump and the negative factors now impacting consumer spending. It remains particularly vulnerable to the continuing turmoil in financial markets. My comments haven’t even touched on possible slowdowns in business investment in equipment and software and buildings. I see the growth risks as skewed to the downside for the near term. In circumstances like these, we can’t rule out the possibility of getting into an adverse feedback loop—that is, the slowing economy weakens financial markets, which induces greater caution by lenders, households, and firms, and which feeds back to even more weakness in economic activity and more caution. Indeed, an important objective of Fed policy is to mitigate the possibility that such a negative feedback loop could develop and take hold.\n\nNow let me turn to inflation. The recent news has been disappointing. Over the past three months, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, or the core PCE price index—one of the key measures included in the FOMC’s quarterly forecasts—has increased by 2.7 percent, bringing the increase over the past twelve months to 2.2 percent. This rate is somewhat above what I consider to be price stability.\n\nI expect core inflation to moderate over the next few years, edging down to around 1¾ percent under appropriate monetary policy. Such an outcome is broadly consistent with my interpretation of the Fed’s price stability mandate. Moreover, I believe the risks on the upside and downside are roughly balanced. First, it appears that core inflation has been pushed up somewhat by the pass-through of higher energy and food prices and by the drop in the dollar. However, recently, energy prices have turned down in response to concerns that a slowdown in the U.S. will weaken economic growth around the world, and thereby lower the demand for energy.\n\nAnother factor that could restrain inflationary pressures is the slowdown in the U.S. economy. This can be expected to create more slack in labor and goods markets, a development that typically has been associated with reduced inflation in the past.\n\nA key factor for inflation going forward is inflation expectations. These appear to have become well-anchored over the past decade or so as the Fed’s inflation resolve has gained credibility. Very recently, far-dated inflation compensation—a measure derived from various Treasury yields—has risen, but it’s not clear whether this rise is due to higher inflation expectations or to changes in the liquidity of those Treasury instruments or inflation risk. Going forward, we will need to monitor inflation expectations carefully to ensure that they do indeed remain well anchored.\n\nMonetary policy\n\nNow let me turn to monetary policy. The federal funds rate has been cut by 2¼ percentage points since September and now stands at 3 percent. With near-term expected inflation of just above 2 percent, the real—inflation adjusted—funds rate is around 1 percent or slightly lower, which represents an accommodative posture.\nI believe that accommodation is appropriate because the financial shock and the housing cycle have significantly restrained economic growth. While growth seems likely to be sluggish this year, the Fed’s policy actions should help to promote a pickup in growth over time. I consider it most probable that the U.S. economy will experience slow growth, and not outright recession, in coming quarters. At the same time, core consumer inflation seems likely to decline gradually to somewhat below 2 percent over the next couple of years, a level that is consistent with price stability.\n\nHowever, economic prospects are unusually uncertain. And downside risks to economic growth remain. This implies that, going forward, the Committee must carefully monitor and assess the effects of ongoing financial and economic developments on the outlook and be prepared to act in a timely manner to address developments that alter the forecast or the risks to it.\n\nNow, I’d be glad to take your questions.\n\nEndnotes\n\nIn recent months, and particularly toward year-end, strains were evident in the term interbank funding markets; in these markets, banks borrow from and lend to each other, with loans maturing in a number of weeks, months, or even a year. The problem has been that banks that would normally lend their excess funds to other banks that need them became reluctant to do so. This may reflect banks’ recognition of the need to preserve liquidity to meet unexpected credit demands, greater uncertainty about the creditworthiness of counterparties and concerns relating to capital positions, on top of typical, year-end balance sheet considerations. A heightened focus on liquidity is logical when the markets for securitized assets held by banks have become highly illiquid and when the potential exists for some customers—such as struggling mortgage companies and others—to draw on unsecured credit lines. These markets have improved since the end of last year, perhaps in part because of the Fed’s introduction of the Term Auction Facility, which gives banks another route besides the discount window to tap into the Fed’s lending function. (Banks had not used the discount window very much despite their need for liquidity because they were concerned that doing so might erroneously signal to other financial institutions that they were in bad straits. The plan for the TFA, which the Fed created in cooperation with the European Central Bank and the National Bank of Switzerland, was announced on December 12.)\n\n"

And though the year is only seven weeks old, a great deal has already happened in the realm of monetary policy. On January 22, the Federal Open Market Committee cut its main policy rate—the federal funds rate—by three quarters of a percentage point. Then, on January 30, at the scheduled meeting, the Committee voted to cut the policy rate again, this time by half a percentage point to 3 percent. Taking these actions together with those that began last September, the Committee has cut that rate by a total of 2¼ percentage points.\n\nThe purpose of these actions is to stimulate demand in the face of the combined impact of the severe contraction in housing and the related financial market disruptions. While housing construction has been weak for more than two years, its effects did not spill over to most other sectors until fairly recently. That’s why we used to talk about a “dual economy,” with housing notably weak, but other sectors doing well. However, financial markets became disrupted in the middle of last year, which has not only intensified the housing slump, but also has tightened credit conditions for some households and businesses. The combined impact has led to slowing more broadly through the economy. It is this broader slowdown that has elicited Federal Reserve actions in recent months.\n\nIn my remarks today, I plan to discuss my views on policy and on the prospects for the nation’s economy this year and beyond.\n\nFinancial markets\n\nI’d like to begin with a discussion of the disruptions in U.S. and global financial markets, because they influence not only the economy’s most likely course but also the risks that could alter that course. In my view, these disruptions are likely to continue for some time. In other words, I think they have laid bare some fundamental issues with the structure of the financial system that will require significant adjustments.\n\nThe financial disruptions are centered in the markets for asset-backed securities. The aim of such instruments is to diversify and spread risk, potentially enhancing economic welfare by broadening access to credit and lowering its cost. These instruments have been around a long time. For example, for many years, when a bank originated a mortgage, instead of holding it on its books, it may have sold the mortgage to one of the government-sponsored agencies, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. The agencies, in turn, would then bundle that mortgage with other similar mortgages into a security. The virtue of this mortgage-backed security is its liquidity—that is, it can be traded in financial markets. Since around 2003, private investment banks and commercial banks have increasingly been involved in securitizing mortgages and other assets as well. This business has grown dramatically, securitizing many types of underlying loans and, importantly, about 75 percent of all subprime mortgages in 2006.\n\nAdvances in financial engineering have led to new and complex forms of asset-backed securities. For example, CDOs, or collateralized debt obligations, package multiple mortgage-backed securities—essentially securitizing several already securitized bundles of long-term debt instruments. Typically, they include tranches—literally, “slices”—of mortgage-backed securities with different exposures to risk based on a prioritization of the payments from the underlying mortgage securities, and are a type of “structured credit.” There are even instruments, known as CDO2, that consist of tranches based on holdings of other CDOs, rather than “simple” mortgage-backed securities, and CDO3 that, as you might now guess, consist of tranches based on holdings of CDO2.\n\nTo deal with the complexity of these instruments, many market participants, including financial institutions and other sophisticated investors, relied to a great extent on credit rating agencies for assessments of the risk. However, last summer, to the surprise of many, the rating agencies announced a set of substantial downgradings of highly rated tranches of a number of subprime mortgage-backed securities in light of rapidly rising delinquencies in some types of those mortgages. These downgrades raised concerns not only about mortgage-backed securities themselves, but also about the quality of rating agencies’ evaluations of risk in other structured credits. As a result, investors grew wary, as they had trouble knowing what risks were embedded in these instruments, how to price the risks, and who would ultimately bear the risks. The consequence is that the markets for many such assets are now highly illiquid and all but closed for new business.\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, it is now apparent that underwriting standards slipped substantially in the United States as house prices soared. For example, permissible combined loan-to-value ratios edged up during 2005 and 2006. And no- or low-documentation loans—so-called “stated income” loans—became more prevalent. Such loans might have performed reasonably well if house prices had continued to rise, but once house prices leveled off and then began to decline, the stage was set for trouble.\n\nThe financial turmoil has spread beyond the mortgage market in part because structured credits have been based on a wide variety of underlying loans, such as business loans, including the loans used to finance the recent wave of leveraged buyouts, or LBOs, commercial real estate, student loans, credit card loans, and subprime mortgages, to name a few.\n\nThe bottom line is that, in recent years, the financial system has gone through a significant restructuring that made evaluating and pricing risk difficult. The reverberations of the resulting financial disruption are still with us. I’d like to describe some of them now.\n\nAs investors have sought to shun risk, there has been a worldwide “flight to safety,” leading to a strong demand to hold U.S. Treasury securities—the safest and most liquid instruments in the world. This demand has contributed to a sharp decline in interest rates on Treasuries. Of course, these rates also have declined because of the Committee’s moves to ease policy.\n\nHowever, the potential stimulatory effects of this drop in risk-free Treasury rates have been offset in many cases by another key feature of the financial turmoil, namely, a sharp rise in interest rate risk spreads, as riskier borrowers have had to pay higher premiums to compensate lenders for a perceived increase in the probability of default or losses in that event. On the corporate side, prime borrowers have actually experienced some net decline in interest rates since the shock first hit—that is, even though risk spreads are higher, they have been more than offset by lower Treasury rates. However, issuers of low-grade corporate bonds with greater credit risk, in contrast, face notably higher interest rates.\n\nThe mortgage market has been the epicenter of the shock, and, not surprisingly, greater aversion to risk has been particularly apparent there, with spreads above Treasuries increasing for mortgages of all types. Although borrowing rates for low-risk conforming mortgages are now lower than they were before the financial shock hit, fixed rates on jumbo mortgages are higher on net. Subprime mortgages remain difficult to get at any rate. Moreover, many markets for securitized assets, especially non-agency mortgage-backed securities, continue to experience severe illiquidity; in other words, the markets are not functioning efficiently, or may not be functioning much at all.\n\nThe turmoil is reverberating in depository institutions as well.1 One problem is an unanticipated buildup of mortgages as well as LBO-related loans on their balance sheets. These loans were in the pipeline for securitization but could not be sold. This problem has hit banks in part because they themselves were involved in creating structured credits that held mortgages and the leveraged loans that they had originated. In addition, they face problems with some structured investment vehicles, or SIVs, that they had sponsored and backstopped to hold and fund portfolios of securitized assets through the issuance of asset-backed commercial paper. When the SIVs were in danger of failing, the banks were concerned about reputational effects and decided to rescue them by taking the underlying assets back onto their own balance sheets. Furthermore, as investors have pulled back from the markets for asset-backed securities, the value of these securities and CDOs has fallen dramatically, so banks and other financial institutions have had to write down their values, which has shrunk their capital and driven their stock prices down.\n\nAnother problem for bank balance sheets is that credit losses have been edging up.\nThe latest reverberation involves monoline financial guarantors. These companies guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest due on various types of securities, including structured credits. The guarantees can increase the credit rating of the covered securities and thus increase the value of those securities on banks’ balance sheets. The problem today is that the guarantors are reporting sizable losses because of the increased riskiness of the securities they are covering. Those losses can affect the guarantors’ capital positions and even their own credit ratings. A rating downgrade of a guarantor reduces the value of its credit enhancements and lowers the price of the covered securities. Holders of those securities such as banks then have to take write-downs to reflect the lower value of the securities.\n\nFortunately, the banking system entered this difficult period in a strong position. Most institutions were extremely well capitalized. However, the combination of unanticipated growth in assets and in write-downs has put increased pressure on banks’ capital positions. Given their concerns about capital adequacy and their increased caution in managing liquidity, it is not surprising that they are tightening credit terms and restricting availability. At first, the focus was mostly on mortgages, but now it has spread to other kinds of loans, including home equity lines of credit, credit cards, and other consumer credit, as well as business loans. The tightening of credit is also a response to a now noticeable deterioration in credit quality, particularly for subprime mortgages; the losses in other parts of the consumer loan portfolio remain at relatively low levels from an historical perspective, but they, too, have edged up.\n\nFinally, equity markets have hardly been immune to recent financial turbulence. Broad U.S. equity indices have been very volatile, and, on the whole, have declined since August, representing a restraint on spending. More recently, some of these declines have occurred as profits have come in below market expectations for some financial firms due to write-downs of the value of mortgage-backed securities.\n\nMy overall assessment is that the turbulence in financial markets is due to some fundamental problems that are not likely to be resolved quickly. The effects of these problems have now made credit conditions tighter throughout most of the economy’s private sector, and this will restrain spending going forward. The impact hit economic activity mainly in the fourth quarter, and so far, it has been starkly negative. After robust performance in the second and third quarters of last year, growth slowed significantly in the fourth quarter—to a pace of only ½ percent. This brings me to the outlook for the economy.\n\nEconomic outlook\n\nCurrent indicators point to continued anemic growth for at least the first half of this year as well as significant downside risks even to those weak expectations. As I mentioned at the outset, though the prolonged slump in housing construction did not spill over significantly to the rest of the economy during 2006 and much of 2007, when combined with the recent financial market turmoil, it has been central to the emergence of today’s slow-growth environment. And the course of its resolution will be a key factor in the economic outlook.\n\nForward-looking indicators of housing activity strongly suggest that the downward cycle may be with us a while longer. Housing permits and sales are dropping, and inventories of unsold homes are at very high levels. Those inventories could rise even higher as foreclosures continue to mount. I’m not referring only to foreclosures on subprime adjustable-rate mortgages, which, as we all know, have increased sharply over the past couple of years. More recently, we’ve begun to see increases in foreclosures on subprime fixed-rate mortgages and even on prime adjustable-rate mortgages.\n\nWithin this Federal Reserve District, housing has been harder hit in some areas than in others. For example, builders and homeowners in parts of Arizona, Nevada, and the inland regions of California have seen some of the worst of the downturn, watching prices fall and equity evaporate as homes sit unsold for extended periods.\n\nHawaii has been near the opposite end of the spectrum. Indeed, the sales pace for existing homes actually increased during the first nine months of the year compared with the same period in 2006, reflecting healthy economic conditions in the state, and a lower exposure to the subprime mortgage market. Subprime lending accounted for only about a fifth of mortgage originations in Hawaii in 2006, compared to about one-third in parts of Arizona, California, and Nevada. Nevertheless, the foreclosure rate has risen sharply here, although it remains well below rates in the harder-hit states. Following several years of double-digit appreciation rates, prices on existing homes in Hawaii largely flattened out by the end of 2007, but have not shown the declines that are evident in some other parts of the District.\n\nOn the national level, housing construction probably will continue to contract through the end of this year. It is true that the residential construction sector is a fairly small piece of the overall economy and is unlikely to cause significant overall weakness in and of itself. But the fallout from the housing cycle has many dimensions, and in the fourth quarter there were signs of spillovers to other sectors of the economy, most worrisomely, to consumer spending. This sector is a huge part of the economy—about 70 percent—and its growth slowed to a rate that is somewhat below its long-run trend in the face of spillovers from the housing market and rising energy and food prices.\n\nLooking ahead, developments related to housing are likely to continue to put a strain on consumers. For example, house prices have fallen noticeably and the declines have intensified. Moreover, futures markets for house prices indicate further—and even larger—declines in a number of metropolitan areas this year.\n\nWith house prices falling, homeowners’ total wealth is declining, and that could lead to a pullback in spending. At the same time, the fall in house prices may constrain consumer spending by lowering the value of mortgage equity; less equity reduces the quantity of funds available for credit-constrained consumers to borrow through home equity loans or to withdraw through refinancing.\n\nIndeed, it would not be surprising to see even more moderation over the next year or so, as consumers face additional constraints due to the declines in the stock market, the tightening of lending terms at depository institutions, and the lagged effects of previous increases in energy prices. National surveys show that consumer confidence has plummeted. And I have been hearing comments and stories from my business contacts in the retail industry that are also downbeat. The rise in delinquency rates across the spectrum of consumer loans is strongly indicative of the growing strains on households.\n\nFinally, another negative factor for consumption is that labor markets have softened. In recent months, growth in employment from a survey of business establishments slowed sharply, actually falling in January, and many other indicators point in the same direction. Slower job growth will have a negative impact on the disposable income available to households and therefore will provide an additional restraint on consumer spending.\n\nSlower growth in consumer spending has already started to affect the Hawaiian economy. Up to last year, Hawaii enjoyed an extended run of robust growth in the tourism industry, spurred primarily by visitors from the U.S. mainland. This helped Hawaii achieve the lowest unemployment rate in the nation during 2004 through 2006. Last year, tourist visits actually dropped a bit, largely because fewer mainlanders came over. Employment growth in the state has slowed accordingly, and the unemployment rate is up by more than a percentage point from its remarkable low of 2 percent at the end of 2006. Nevertheless, economic conditions remain sound by historical standards, and the state appears well-positioned to weather any further spending reductions by U.S. consumers.\n\nWith the domestic consumer likely to be pretty hobbled, it is tempting to look at consumers beyond our own borders to be a source of strength for economic activity. Foreign real GDP has advanced robustly over the past three years. With the dollar falling well below its level of a year ago, U.S. exports have done very well; partly for this reason, U.S. net exports—exports minus imports—which consistently held growth down from 2000 to 2005, actually gave it a lift over the past couple of years. I expect net exports to remain a source of strength. But some countries—especially in Europe—are experiencing direct negative impacts from the ongoing turmoil in financial markets. Others are likely to suffer indirect impacts from any slowdown in the U.S. A slowdown here could well produce ripple effects lowering growth there through trade linkages, and recently this factor has been reinforced by a worldwide drop in stock prices.\n\nEconomic policies are another important factor in gauging the economic outlook. As I have noted, the FOMC has eased the stance of monetary policy substantially in the past five months. Moreover, there is considerable talk in Congress about passing a fiscal stimulus package to help the economy. If such a bill is passed soon, it could provide notable stimulus in the latter half of this year.\n\nEven with such policy stimulus, the overall economy is still likely to turn in a very sluggish performance this year, expanding by a rate well below potential and creating more slack in labor markets. At 4.9 percent, the unemployment rate is already slightly above my estimate of its sustainable level. Slow growth this year would most likely push unemployment even higher.\n\nTo sum it up, for the next few quarters, I see economic activity as weighed down by the housing slump and the negative factors now impacting consumer spending. It remains particularly vulnerable to the continuing turmoil in financial markets. My comments haven’t even touched on possible slowdowns in business investment in equipment and software and buildings. I see the growth risks as skewed to the downside for the near term. In circumstances like these, we can’t rule out the possibility of getting into an adverse feedback loop—that is, the slowing economy weakens financial markets, which induces greater caution by lenders, households, and firms, and which feeds back to even more weakness in economic activity and more caution. Indeed, an important objective of Fed policy is to mitigate the possibility that such a negative feedback loop could develop and take hold.\n\nNow let me turn to inflation. The recent news has been disappointing. Over the past three months, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, or the core PCE price index—one of the key measures included in the FOMC’s quarterly forecasts—has increased by 2.7 percent, bringing the increase over the past 12 months to 2.2 percent. This rate is somewhat above what I consider to be price stability.\n\nI expect core inflation to moderate over the next few years, edging down to around 1¾ percent under appropriate monetary policy. Such an outcome is broadly consistent with my interpretation of the Fed’s price stability mandate. Moreover, I believe the risks on the upside and downside are roughly balanced. First, it appears that core inflation has been pushed up somewhat by the pass-through of higher energy and food prices and by the drop in the dollar. However, recently, energy prices have turned down in response to concerns that a slowdown in the U.S. will weaken economic growth around the world, and thereby lower the demand for energy.\n\nAnother factor that could restrain inflationary pressures is the slowdown in the U.S. economy. This can be expected to create more slack in labor and goods markets, a development that typically has been associated with reduced inflation in the past.\nA key factor for inflation going forward is inflation expectations. These appear to have become well-anchored over the past decade or so as the Fed’s inflation resolve has gained credibility. Very recently, far-dated inflation compensation—a measure derived from various Treasury yields—has risen, but it’s not clear whether this rise is due to higher inflation expectations or to changes in the liquidity of those Treasury instruments or inflation risk. Going forward, we will need to monitor inflation expectations carefully to ensure that they do indeed remain well anchored.\n\nMonetary policy\n\nNow let me turn to monetary policy. The federal funds rate has been cut by 2¼ percentage points since September and now stands at 3 percent. With near-term expected inflation of just above 2 percent, the real—inflation adjusted—funds rate is around 1 percent or slightly lower, which represents an accommodative posture.\n\nI believe that accommodation is appropriate because the financial shock and the housing cycle have significantly restrained economic growth. While growth seems likely to be sluggish this year, the Fed’s policy actions should help to promote a pickup in growth over time. I consider it most probable that the U.S. economy will experience slow growth, and not outright recession, in coming quarters. At the same time, core consumer inflation seems likely to decline gradually to somewhat below 2 percent over the next couple of years, a level that is consistent with price stability.\n\nHowever, economic prospects are unusually uncertain. And downside risks to economic growth remain. This implies that, going forward, the Committee must carefully monitor and assess the effects of ongoing financial and economic developments on the outlook and be prepared to act in a timely manner to address developments that alter the forecast or the risks to it.\n\nNow, I’d be glad to take your questions.\n\nEndnotes\n\nIn recent months, and particularly toward year-end, strains were evident in the term interbank funding markets; in these markets, banks borrow from and lend to each other, with loans maturing in a number of weeks, months, or even a year.  The problem has been that banks that would normally lend their excess funds to other banks that need them became reluctant to do so.  This may reflect banks’ recognition of the need to preserve liquidity to meet unexpected credit demands, greater uncertainty about the creditworthiness of counterparties and concerns relating to capital positions, on top of typical, year-end balance sheet considerations.   A heightened focus on liquidity is logical when the markets for securitized assets held by banks have become highly illiquid and when the potential exists for some customers—such as struggling mortgage companies and others—to draw on unsecured credit lines.  These markets have improved since the end of last year, perhaps in part because of the Fed’s introduction of the Term Auction Facility (TAF), which gives banks another route besides the discount window to tap into the Fed’s lending function. (Banks had not used the discount window very much despite their need for liquidity because they were concerned that doing so might erroneously signal to other financial institutions that they were in bad straits. The plan for the TAF, which the Fed created in cooperation with the European Central Bank and the National Bank of Switzerland, was announced on December 12.)\n\n"
