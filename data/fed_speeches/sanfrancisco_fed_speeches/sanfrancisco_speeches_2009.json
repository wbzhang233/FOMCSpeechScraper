        "content": "\n\n\n\nThank you. It is a great privilege to be here among such a distinguished group. I want to thank the Institute of Regulation & Risk for inviting me to speak tonight and express my particular gratitude to Ms. Au King-chi of the Hong Kong Government and Mr. Norman Chan of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. I’m especially grateful to our gracious host Mr. Robert Pringle. Given the limited time I have, I will try to lay out some broad themes concerning the implications of the financial crisis for regulatory reform and monetary policy. My comments are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my Federal Reserve colleagues. I look forward to the extended discussion we shall have later tonight when we will be able to delve more deeply into these critical issues.\n\nIn the past, monetary and regulatory policies have generally been viewed as separate domains with distinct objectives. The primary focus of monetary policy has been on attaining the macroeconomic goals of low inflation and a stable economy. In the United States, these goals find their expression in the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. By contrast, regulatory policy has generally pursued significantly different ends: protecting the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions and reducing systemic risk.\n\nOf course, monetary and regulatory policies do not exist in total isolation and the Federal Reserve, an institution with responsibilities in both domains, has long recognized some important linkages. For example, it’s clear that the effectiveness of monetary policy and the performance of the macroeconomy depend greatly on maintaining a stable and healthy financial system. And a sound economy makes the work of regulators much easier because economic downturns put considerable stress on the financial system. In addition, the insights we derive from our supervision of banking organizations are helpful in formulating monetary policy. And the economic analysis that underpins monetary policy improves our understanding of the risks confronting financial institutions. Nonetheless, policymakers have generally viewed monetary and regulatory questions as separate disciplines, and we have designed our strategies and carried out our policies accordingly.2\n\nThe painful events of the past two years have fundamentally challenged this dichotomization of monetary and regulatory policies. It is no longer obvious that setting policies to stabilize the economy on the one hand and to safeguard the financial system on the other can be cleanly separated—either in conception or implementation.3 This experience has important implications for both monetary and regulatory policy. Here I will focus on the conceptual issues, leaving aside vital questions concerning implementation, such as the appropriate division of authority among different regulatory bodies—a subject that is under discussion in the United States.\n\nLet me start by considering our regulatory responsibilities. Government agencies have long practiced micro-prudential supervision and regulation—that is, oversight of individual financial institutions aimed at preserving their safety and soundness.  Indeed, micro-prudential supervision—including on-site examinations, surveillance, guidance, regulations, and enforcement—is the first line of defense against systemic risk. The crisis has taught us valuable lessons on how to strengthen supervision going forward.  For example, we need to develop stronger and more effective capital and liquidity standards, strengthen our oversight of risk management practices, and insure that compensation arrangements do not create incentives that could compromise safety and soundness.4 In the United States, we also gleaned important insights on how to improve our consolidated supervision of bank holding companies through this year’s stress test of the 19 largest banking organizations, as part of the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program.  We intend to make such horizontal institutional reviews involving multidisciplinary teams an important component of our supervision going forward.   Currently, we are conducting a horizontal assessment of internal processes for evaluating capital adequacy at the largest U.S. banking organizations and will shortly undertake a similar horizontal review of incentive compensation practices.\n\nOverall, the crisis has exposed serious deficiencies in our micro-prudential regulatory structure. We clearly need to address gaps, such as inadequate authority or tools to properly supervise the so-called shadow banking system, including major investment banks, nonbank lenders, and vital financial insurance providers such as AIG.\n\nA broad consensus exists that we need to make these changes. But, it is critical to recognize that carrying bigger sticks as micro-prudential supervisors entails tradeoffs between stability and efficiency—that is, between managing systemic risk and cultivating a fertile environment for economic growth. Admittedly, we may well have been operating far off the optimal tradeoff curve in recent years! Still, in designing a new regulatory framework, we must be aware that stronger capital standards that reduce leverage might hamper the flow of funds to businesses and households in ways that could impede investment and consumption. Of course, finding the right balance is an immense challenge.\n\nTo strike that balance between stability and growth, we should examine what other policy weapons should be in our arsenal. Perhaps the most important are in the area of macro-prudential oversight, which we increasingly understand is an essential complement to micro-prudential supervision. Now, what exactly does macro-prudential supervision entail? To me, it means identifying and correcting behaviors and structures in financial markets that create excessive risk before they mushroom into something that threatens the entire financial system. This requires real-time collection and analysis of data from a wide variety of financial institutions and markets, the deployment of tools to mitigate the inherent pro-cyclical tendencies of financial markets, and new resolution powers to deal with the failure of any institution that poses a threat to financial stability.\n\nMacro-prudential supervision takes a very different perspective than its micro-prudential sibling. It’s akin to caring for an entire ecosystem rather than individual trees. It is targeted at spillovers and externalities that contribute to systemic risk even when they don’t directly harm individual institutions. An example is an investment strategy that is highly positively correlated across institutions. Taken in isolation, each institution may appear to be adequately managing liquidity, capital, and exposure to risk. But, when many large institutions invest in the same class of assets, a downturn in that asset class can cause a rush to the exits as everyone tries to sell at the same time. That’s exactly what happened in 2007 and 2008 in the markets for mortgage-related securities, with disastrous effects that we know too well. In the worst case, correlation can feed contagion that spreads across the globe as institutions seek to rapidly deleverage and protect liquidity. This presents a regulatory challenge of the first order: How are we to measure and safeguard against such highly correlated investment strategies? Research is under way now to provide some answers.5 One promising strategy is to implement a system that would require banking organizations to build capital buffers in good times that could be run down under stressful conditions.  Such a system could serve as an automatic stabilizer, mitigating the buildup of leverage in booms and the destabilizing impact of broad-based deleveraging in downturns.\n\nOther practices may also be ripe for macro-prudential supervision. They include pro-cyclical underwriting standards, shortcomings in the provision of liquidity and credit risk protection during crises, and payment and clearing systems.6 For example, markets for over-the-counter derivatives, including credit default swaps, lack the stabilizing mechanisms associated with central exchanges.7\n\nA key issue in macro-prudential supervision concerns the too-big-to-fail problem of systemically important financial institutions. A number of approaches have been suggested to limit the systemic risk from large, interconnected financial institutions.  These include capping the size of these institutions, moving some activities to exchanges or clearing firms, requiring them to hold more capital, and reducing their odds of failure by requiring them to hold debt that automatically converts to equity in a crisis situation.  It is also essential to devise effective means to resolve large, highly interconnected financial institutions in an orderly manner to minimize the damage to the financial system. In the United States, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation uses a well-tested and highly effective procedure for resolving commercial banks and thrifts.  But, for nondepository financial institutions, the standard bankruptcy process is all that’s available. We’ve seen that the mere hint a financial institution is headed for bankruptcy can set off a run, depriving it of vital short-term funding and leaving it incapable of paying creditors. As recent events attest, in the cases of systemically important institutions, the end result can be market turmoil, cascading declines in valuations, and panic.\n\nMacro-prudential supervision has the potential to lower systemic risk and thereby create a more secure financial system that will contribute to macroeconomic goals as well. But, monetary policy may also play a role in managing systemic risk. One notable feature of boom-and-bust cycles has been highly pro-cyclical leverage at primary dealers, such as investment banks. Recent research by Tobias Adrian and Hyun Shin suggests that monetary policy affects these cycles in asset growth.8 Specifically, they find that periods when monetary policy is “tight” relative to the predictions of an estimated Taylor rule are associated with weaker growth in holdings of repurchase agreements by primary dealers.9 By contrast, “easy” monetary policy is associated with rapid increases in financial institution balance sheets that can add to systemic risk.10\n\nThese results suggest that monetary policy could play a role in restraining undesirable swings in leverage and, by extension, reduce systemic risk. In particular, interest rate cuts in a time of market disruption can be effective at stopping a deleveraging cycle from turning into an uncontrolled crash. And higher rates than called for based on purely macroeconomic conditions may help forestall a potentially damaging buildup of leverage and an asset price boom.\n\nThis raises the broader—and very contentious—issue of whether monetary policy should seek to lean against potentially dangerous swings in asset prices. The answer is far from clear, because the use of monetary policy for these ends necessarily compromises the attainment of other macroeconomic goals. Because such use of monetary policy is costly, high priority should be assigned to developing regulatory tools to address systemic risk. Even so, the crisis of the past two years has prompted many of us to reexamine the widely held view that monetary policy should respond to asset prices only to the extent that they influence the anticipated trajectories of inflation and unemployment.  Further research into the connections among monetary policy, the banking and financial sectors, and systemic risk is needed to help answer this question.11\n\nIn summary, the events of the past few years compel us to reexamine many of our long-held ideas and practices in both monetary and regulatory policy. I am gratified that researchers around the world are looking hard at these questions. In addition, I am encouraged by the sense of purpose and cooperation exhibited by my colleagues at central banks, governments, and international organizations in their efforts to develop policies that will help us avoid the kind of crisis we have just experienced. Thank you.\n\n# # #\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1. I would like to thank John Williams and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n2. At times, the connections between monetary policy and regulation have become more apparent. For example, the abolition of Regulation Q in the United States had a direct bearing on how monetary policy affected the economy and the appropriate monetary policy response to shocks (see Mauskopf 1990).\n\n3. See Shirakawa (2009) for further discussion on this point.\n\n4. See, for example, Crockett (2009) and Tarullo (2009) for discussions of these issues.\n\n5. See Caruana (2009) and Adrian and Brunnermeier (2009).\n\n6. See Bernanke (2009) and Dudley (2009) for further discussion of these and related issues of macro-prudential regulation.\n\n7.See Duffie and Zhu (2009) for an analysis of the problems associated with clearing credit default swap contracts.\n\n8. See Adrian and Shin (2008a).\n\n9. Taylor (2007) describes a different channel, but comes to the same conclusion that monetary policy can contribute to undesirable booms and busts.\n\n10.See Adrian and Shin (2008b, 2009). They also find evidence that asset growth is linked to housing construction.\n\n11. Increasingly macroeconomists are incorporating banking and financial frictions in their macroeconomic models.  See, for example, Curdia and Woodford (2009) and Gertler and Karadi (2009).\n\nReferences\n\nAdrian, Tobias, and Markus K.

        "content": "\n\n\n\nThank you very much Sheila. It’s a great pleasure to see you again and to join all of you this morning. I want to express my appreciation to Sheila for her excellent service as a member and as deputy chair of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank’s board of directors from 1999 to 2004. I am very pleased to have the chance to speak to a group of professionals dedicated to advancing the understanding of land economics. As you know, problems in real estate were central to the financial crisis and ongoing developments in this sector bear importantly on the economy’s prospects for recovery.  So my comments will focus on the economic outlook and I will emphasize the role of real estate in shaping it.\n\nThroughout my remarks, I will compare the situation in the nation as a whole with that here in Phoenix. I’m always struck when I visit Phoenix by the beauty of your natural setting and the great vitality of the city that has grown in this magnificent place.  Phoenix demonstrates a spirit of entrepreneurship, a sense of optimism about the future, and an eagerness to build something new. But, as the housing market collapsed and the nation fell into financial crisis and recession, your desert metropolis was set back on its heels. Just as you grew faster than the nation as a whole during the boom years in the middle of the decade, so did you fall harder when the bust came.  I can only imagine what it’s like for those who’ve been blessed with one of the nation’s most vibrant economies to suffer a setback of this magnitude. I’m pleased to say that I think you will find much in my message this morning that is encouraging.\n\nThis is the first talk I’ve given since the economy has officially been reported to be growing again. The economy’s return to growth after a year and a half of recession marks a major turn and it looks like more than a flash in the pan. It seems to me that the economy has entered a sustained period of expansion. We’ve seen meaningful upturns in areas as diverse as housing, consumer spending, industrial production, and foreign trade. And, a number of factors bode well for the future, including a better functioning financial system, low mortgage interest rates, a resurgent stock market, a stabilization of house prices, and stronger growth abroad.\n\nAll the same, I am not going to paint an entirely rosy picture for you. The strength and durability of the expansion is in question. Some of the rebound is due to temporary government programs and a swing in inventory investment that will not provide an ongoing source of growth. Financial conditions have improved markedly in some respects, but many financial institutions are still hobbled with bad loans.  The outlook for consumer spending is in doubt because households remain burdened with debt, and they have taken enormous hits to their wealth from declines in house and stock prices in recent years. And it’s particularly sobering that labor markets continue to deteriorate badly, leaving many millions of our fellow Americans unable to find jobs. Just last week, we found out that the unemployment rate passed 10 percent in October. The 10.2 percent jobless rate is the highest since 1983. Today I will consider this mixed picture in some detail and focus on two subjects of professional interest to many of you—the residential and commercial real estate markets. I want to stress that my comments are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\n\nAs we look at the national economy, it’s important to keep things in perspective.  It’s not fun to ponder a subdued recovery. But a year ago, after the near collapse of the global financial system, there was a real possibility of an outright depression.  Fortunately, we avoided that.  But what we did suffer through was bad enough—the worst downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The recession began at the end of 2007.  Economic output has dropped by just over 3½ percent. Over seven million jobs have been lost in the nonfarm sector of the economy.  And the unemployment rate has soared by over five percentage points. Few, if any, parts of the economy were unscathed. The labor market was devastated, and housing, consumer spending, business investment, exports, and imports all fell off the table.\n\nPhoenix was particularly hard-hit.  In May 2007, the area unemployment rate was an extraordinarily low 2.9 percent.  By September 2009, the rate had roughly tripled to 8.5 percent.  That’s lower than the national rate, but it’s a huge 5.6 percentage point swing.  Construction represented a higher-than-average share of the Arizona economy, and the drag from real estate over the past two years has been especially severe in the state.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the nation’s third-quarter return to growth was a great relief.  Real gross domestic product—which is the economy’s total output of goods and services—increased at a solid annual rate of 3½ percent.  The recession hasn’t officially been declared over, but a wide array of data suggests that the corner has been turned.  In the third quarter, residential investment—which was at the center of the downturn—rose at nearly a 25 percent annual rate, albeit from a very low level.  Home sales, prices, and housing starts are once again climbing.  Meanwhile, manufacturing is also beginning to show signs of strength.  This was helped by a rebound in motor vehicle production, boosted by the government’s temporary cash-for-clunkers program.  Our exports surged as growth abroad picked up.  And, importantly, consumer spending finally is growing.\n\nTo me, the explanation for this turnaround is clear:  Massive and concerted responses by governments and central banks around the world rescued the financial system, brought down interest rates, provided emergency support, and broke the economy’s downward spiral.  On the monetary policy side, the Fed has pushed its traditional interest rate lever—the federal funds rate—close to zero.  And, in order to provide additional stimulus, we put in place an array of unconventional programs to spur the flow of credit to households and businesses.  These measures provided funding to banks and restored liquidity to a range of markets.  We’ve increased the flow of credit for securities backed by small business loans, consumer loans, and other assets.  Our large-scale purchases of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) helped lower mortgage rates and bolstered the housing market.  We’ve also bought longer-term U.S. Treasury debt to help bring private borrowing rates down.\n\nThese initiatives appear to have eased financial conditions.  Clearly, the financial system is not yet back to normal, but it has bounced back notably.  The stock market has soared since its low in the winter.  That rally has helped households recover some of their lost wealth and provided a much-needed psychological boost.  Investors perceive that economic risks are not as dire as they once seemed to be.  Interest rates on corporate bonds—especially for less-than-prime firms—have dropped sharply and issuance has been brisk.  And the markets that financial institutions and corporations rely on for short-term funding are functioning reasonably well again, due in part to Fed intervention.\n\nFederal government policies also have contributed, including the fiscal stimulus program passed by Congress in February.  Tax cuts have raised disposable income and government spending is directly adding to payrolls.  Much of the stimulus money authorized by Congress remains to be spent and will spur growth in coming quarters.  Other government initiatives contributed to the third-quarter expansion as well, including the cash-for-clunkers program and the $8,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers.\n\nThe normal dynamics of the business cycle have also turned more favorable.  Demand for houses, durable goods such as autos, and business equipment is beginning to revive as households and businesses replace or upgrade needed equipment and structures.  A particularly hopeful sign is that inventories of unsold goods, which have been shrinking rapidly, now seem to be in better alignment with sales. Manufacturers had slashed production dramatically in the face of slumping sales.  Recent data suggest that this correction may be near an end, setting the stage for more production.\n\nThe big issue is how strong the upturn will be.  With such enormous reservoirs of slack in the form of high unemployment and idle productive capacity, we need a strong rebound to put unemployed people back to work and get underutilized factories, offices, and stores humming again.  Unfortunately, my own forecast envisions a less-than-robust recovery for several reasons.  As the impetus from government programs and inventories diminishes in the quarters ahead, private final demand will have to fill the breach.  The danger is that demand may grow at too anemic a pace to support vigorous expansion.\n\nFirst, it may take quite a while for financial institutions to heal to the point that normal credit flows are restored.  The credit crunch hasn’t entirely gone away.  In the face of massive loan losses, banks have clamped down on underwriting and credit terms for both businesses and consumers.  Smaller businesses without direct access to capital markets are particularly feeling the pinch.  Lenders have had to run hard just to stay in place: Rising unemployment, business failures, and delinquencies in real estate markets have fed additional credit losses and made it more difficult for financial institutions to get their balance sheets in good order.\n\nSecond, households have been pummeled and prospects for consumer spending are cloudy.  Consumers have surprised us in the past with their free-spending ways and it’s not out of the question that they will do so again.  But I wouldn’t count on them leading a strong recovery.  They face high and rising unemployment, stagnant wages, and heavy debt burdens.  Their nest eggs have shrunk dramatically as house and stock prices have fallen, and their access to credit has been squeezed.\n\nIt may be that we are witnessing the start of a new era for consumers following the harsh financial blows they have endured. 2 We often hear the word “deleveraging” used to describe the push by financial institutions to scale back debt and build equity.  Households too have now begun to pay down debt and rebuild their savings. This phenomenon can be seen not only in the United States, but in most countries that experienced similar housing booms. The United States was hardly the only country where households borrowed heavily just before a severe housing bust set in. And those countries with greater increases in debt relative to income before the crisis experienced greater declines in consumption spending once the crisis began.\n\nIn the United States, the personal saving rate, which had fallen to an incredibly low 1 percent in early 2008, has averaged 4 percent so far this year and may well rise higher. In the current environment, such belt-tightening makes great sense from the standpoint of individual households. In fact, some households may have no other option because their access to credit has been crimped. Over the long run, higher saving is surely a good thing for our economy because it provides capital that can be devoted to modern infrastructure, technology, and other productive investments that enhance our standard of living. All the same, the transition to a higher saving plane could be painful if it reduces the growth rate of consumer spending for an extended period.\n\nWeakness in the labor market is another factor that may keep the recovery sluggish for quite some time. Payroll employment has been plummeting for more than a year and a half, and, even though the pace of the decline has slowed, unemployment now stands at its highest level since 1983. In addition, many workers have seen their hours cut or are experiencing involuntary furloughs. To bolster earnings in the face of weak revenue growth, employers have been aggressive in cutting labor costs and jobs, and my business contacts say they will be reluctant to hire again until they see clear evidence of a sustained recovery. Weak demand for workers is also putting a lid on paychecks.  Wages are barely rising. A well-known measure of overall employment costs rose by only 1¼ percent over the past year, the smallest increase in the history of the series.  High unemployment, weak job growth, and paltry wage increases are a recipe for sluggish consumer spending growth and a tepid recovery.\n\nThe U.S. experienced so-called jobless recoveries following the previous two recessions in 1991 and 2001, when job creation remained weak for several years following the business cycle trough. In both cases, output growth was less robust than in the typical recovery and, unfortunately, things seem to be shaping up similarly this time around.\n\nNow I’d like to take a close look at real estate markets, both residential and commercial. You may be getting weary of my “on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand” message, but I’m afraid I have more of that to offer when it comes to housing. To put it bluntly, the outlook for the residential market is uncertain. And uncertain is much better than the prospects for commercial real estate, which clearly are weak.\n\nLet me begin with housing. We have gone through many boom-and-bust cycles, but none in the past half century have had such far-reaching effects as the wild ride of residential real estate during this decade. House prices soared from 2002 through 2005, moving dramatically out of line with fundamentals. By one measure, house prices on average peaked more than 50 percent above the level that could be supported by underlying rental values. Since the market top three years ago, the nation has experienced roughly a 30 percent collapse in average house prices, depending on the index used. That’s a terrible plunge, but there’s some good news in it for the future: Prices are approaching a range where valuations are more in line with fundamentals.  Such an adjustment is essential for a sustained revival of housing activity.\n\nIndeed, there are indications that the sickening market plunge has ended, with prices beginning to edge up. At the same time, home sale volumes are advancing briskly. The supply of new houses on the market has been brought down from over 12 months to about 7½ months. That’s still well above the four-month supply that was typical in the period right before the bust, but the adjustment seems to have been enough to kick some life back into construction. In the third quarter, real residential investment surged, though from an admittedly low level. For the first time in more than three years, housing construction actually added to GDP growth.\n\nWhat I’ve said about the national housing market can be seen in even sharper relief here in Arizona, and especially in the Phoenix area. The metropolitan area’s residential boom-and-bust cycle was considerably more pronounced than that of the nation as a whole. Gains in house prices were simply spectacular. Fast population and job growth following the 2001 recession explains part of the story. However, the truly exceptional price jumps in 2004 and 2005, just before the collapse, look to be outsized even given the strong demographic and labor trends. Subprime loans represented an especially high proportion of mortgage lending in the region. Not surprisingly, the house price collapse in this area has been especially severe. Price declines are as high as 50 percent or more, about 1½ times that of the nation, bringing values back to 2001 levels.\n\nFortunately, things are beginning to look up in Arizona as they are for the nation.  Existing home sales are up sharply in recent months, although a large share of those are foreclosed properties. In the Phoenix area, home prices are now above their lows.  A widely watched forecasting survey predicts that 2009 will be the trough for housing permits in Phoenix and that 2010 will see significant increases. 3\n\nStill, the Phoenix housing market is nowhere near a return to health. In the face of high and rising unemployment, mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates are still increasing in the area. The share of mortgage loans in foreclosure or 60 days or more past due is nearly three times the national median. And this is by no means largely a subprime problem. Prime borrowers now account for the lion’s share of new foreclosures.\n\nMeanwhile, developers and their creditors have been caught with excess raw land, lots that are partially completed, or completed but still vacant.  Values for finished but vacant lots across the country are reported to be off about 50 percent from their peak, with some hard-hit regions in the West down even more.  Over the past year and a half, developers and their bankers have been working through this inventory and recognizing the associated losses.  As write-offs on these loans flow through community and regional banks, we can expect more failures.\n\nTurning back to the national picture, the bottom line is that the outlook for housing has turned up in response to favorable mortgage rates, lower house prices, and a lower overhang of unsold houses.  And growth in this sector should contribute to the overall economic recovery. These developments represent real gains, but it’s important not to get carried away. Some of the advance reflects temporary government support in the form of tax credits for first-time home buyers, and the impact of loan modification programs and foreclosure moratoriums that reduced the pace of distressed sales.  Moreover, foreclosure notices surged earlier this year and distressed property sales may rise once again in the months ahead.  If so, we could see renewed pressure on house prices.  Of course, continuing high unemployment will also fuel additional foreclosures. And the supply of credit for nonconforming mortgages remains extremely tight.  Financial institutions are reluctant to place them on their books when they are trying to reduce leverage and we have yet to see any revival of the market for private mortgage-backed securities.\n\nWhen we turn to commercial real estate, the prospects are worrisome. Commercial property didn’t turn down until well after housing did. The sector’s problems appear to stem in large part from the effects of the recession and the credit crunch, rather than the type of building boom and lax underwriting standards that tripped up housing. Still, there are some parallels between the two sectors. As in the residential market, commercial real estate values posted enormous price gains, with office values roughly doubling from the end of the 2001 recession to the peak. Since then, values have plunged an estimated 35 to 40 percent and vacancy rates are rising for office, retail, warehouse, and other income-producing properties. In Arizona, office vacancy rates started moving up in the second part of 2006 as job growth decelerated abruptly from an exceptionally fast pace. Vacancies in Phoenix are near 25 percent, about a 13 percentage point rise from the recent low.\n\nAs I indicated, credit market conditions are weighing heavily on this sector. Risk premiums on commercial real estate financing remain elevated, although they’re down a bit from the peak of the financial crisis. Average commercial real estate capitalization rates have seen risk spreads more than double over the past two years to  more than 4 percentage points over 10-year Treasury securities. The market for commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) remains deeply distressed and issuance is meager despite support from the Fed’s Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) and the Treasury’s Public-Private Investment Program (PPIP).  Banks and thrifts, which account for more than half of commercial real estate financing, have significantly raised rates and tightened credit terms. That, combined with higher investor demands for returns and weakening operating income, points to further downward pressure on property values.\n\nCommercial real estate borrowers are increasingly hard-pressed to stay current on their loans. CMBS delinquency rates rose from about half a percent in August 2008 to over 3 percent this July. Weakening loan quality is particularly damaging in Arizona where commercial real estate accounts for a much larger share of the average bank loan portfolio than in the nation. A large volume of commercial real estate loans and securities are coming up for renewal over the next several years. This will prompt lenders and investors to review terms for continued extension of credit. In many instances, banks are asking borrowers to either repay loans, provide more equity, or agree to modified terms and conditions. These adverse trends recently prompted federal regulators to issue guidance on commercial real estate to banks and thrifts, with a focus on sound practices for loan workouts.\n\nNationwide, the commercial real estate downturn has been a drag on economic growth, subtracting about 1 percent at an annual rate over the first three quarters of this year, compared with a roughly neutral effect in 2008. All indications are that commercial real estate will continue weighing down the recovery going forward.\n\nWhen the weakness of the commercial property market is combined with the muted outlook for housing and consumer spending, you can see why I believe that the overall economic recovery is likely to be gradual and remain vulnerable to shocks.  It’s popular to pick a letter of the alphabet to describe the likely course of the economy. The letter I would choose doesn’t exist in our alphabet, but if I were to describe it, it would look something like an “L” with a gradual upward tilt of the base. With such a slow rebound, unemployment could well stay high for several years to come. In other words, our recovery is likely to feel like something well short of good times.\n\nThis brings me to inflation, a topic that has been hotly debated. 4 Some people worry about the long-term inflationary implications of sustained federal budget deficits. Others fear that economic slack and downward wage pressure are pushing inflation below rates that are consistent with price stability. I am in the second camp. Persistent large budget deficits may be harmful once the economy recovers because they are apt to boost interest rates and absorb private savings that would otherwise finance productive investments. But experience teaches us that budget deficits do not cause inflation in advanced economies with independent central banks that pursue appropriate monetary policies. 5 As for the Fed, you can be 100 percent certain that price stability will remain our objective, regardless of the stance of fiscal policy.\n\nI believe that the more significant threat to price stability over the next several years stems from enormous slack in the economy that is pushing inflation lower. Today, inflation is already very low. Over the past 12 months, consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption price index actually fell by one-half percent. After removing the effects of volatile food and energy prices, core prices rose by 1¼ percent.  That’s below the 2 percent rate that I and most of my fellow Fed policymakers on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) consider an appropriate long-term price stability objective. The public’s inflation expectations, which can independently influence inflation, remain well anchored, which is appropriate given the Fed’s record and its commitment to price stability. And with slack likely to persist for years and wages barely rising, it seems probable that core inflation will move even lower over the next few years.\n\nThis landscape presents clear challenges for monetary policy. We face an economy with substantial slack, prospects for only moderate growth, and low and declining inflation.  With the federal funds rate already at zero for all practical purposes, the Fed’s traditional policy tool is as accommodative as it can be. To provide more stimulus, the Fed has used unconventional policy tools, including emergency lending programs to promote liquidity and push longer-term interest rates lower. However, many of these programs are winding down or nearing completion. That is why the FOMC stated that “economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period” following our meeting last week.\n\nAt some point, of course, we will have to tighten policy—and we certainly have the means and the will to do so. We are—and always will be—steadfast in our determination to achieve both of our statutory goals of full employment and price stability. Until that time comes though, we need to provide the monetary accommodation necessary to spur job creation and prevent inflation from falling any further below rates that are consistent with price stability.

It’s fair to say that the last two or three years have provided all of us an education—a far-from-welcome one—of just how complex these subjects are.  We have had to rethink old assumptions and question conventional wisdom in the face of a crisis whose dimensions few of us might have imagined.\n\nI am hugely relieved that our financial system appears to have survived this near-death experience. And, as painful as this recession has been, I believe that we succeeded in avoiding the second Great Depression that seemed to be a real possibility. Much of the recent economic data suggest that the economy has bottomed out and that the worst risks are behind us. The economy seems to be brushing itself off and beginning its climb out of the deep hole it’s been in.\n\nThat’s the good news. But I regret to say that I expect the recovery to be tepid. What’s more, the gradual expansion gathering steam will remain vulnerable to shocks. The financial system has improved but is not yet back to normal. It still holds hazards that could derail a fragile recovery. Even if the economy grows as I expect, things won’t feel very good for some time to come. In particular, the unemployment rate will remain elevated for a few more years, meaning hardship for millions of workers. Moreover, the slack in the economy, demonstrated by high unemployment and low utilization of industrial capacity, threatens to push inflation lower at a time when it is already below the level that, in the view of most members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) best promotes the Fed’s dual mandate for full employment and price stability.  As a result, monetary policy makers will continue to face a difficult task in the years ahead.\n\nDuring the rest of my talk this afternoon, I will try to give a more detailed picture of the financial and economic landscapes. My comments are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\n\nAs I noted, we’ve come a long way since last year when the financial system was teetering on the edge of collapse. To me, it’s plain that the extraordinary and aggressive response of governments and central banks around the world saved the day—heading off the kind of financial meltdown that would have inflicted catastrophic damage on the economy. Some are skeptical about the effectiveness of emergency programs such as TARP, TAF, and TALF.  But, in my view, these programs staved off disaster. And they have been keeping the patient on essential life support as little by little it begins to breathe again on its own.\n\nWhile the worst was avoided, the financial shock that did hit the economy was awful enough. The economy finally fell into recession at the end of 2007 when, on top of an ongoing drag from a contracting housing sector, the ever-dependable American consumer—who had shrugged off one shock after another in years past—finally succumbed to the fallout from the financial crisis.  Since the beginning of the downturn, real GDP has fallen by a bit short of 4 percent and the unemployment rate has jumped by nearly 5 percentage points. Few, if any, parts of the economy have escaped the devastation. In addition to the setbacks in housing and consumer spending, business investment, exports, and imports all fell off the table.\n\nI’m happy to report that the downturn has probably now run its course. This summer likely marked the end of the recession and the economy should expand in the second half of this year. A wide array of data supports this view. However, payrolls are still shrinking at a rapid pace, even though the momentum of job losses has slowed in the past few months. The housing sector finally seems to be improving. Home sales and starts are once again rising from very low levels, and home prices appear to be stabilizing, even rising in recent months according to some national measures.  Meanwhile, manufacturing is also beginning to show signs of life, helped particularly by a rebound in motor vehicle production.  Importantly, consumer spending finally is bottoming out.\n\nA particularly hopeful sign is that inventories, which have been shrinking rapidly, now seem to be in better alignment with sales. That’s occurred because firms slashed production rapidly and dramatically in the face of slumping sales.  Recent data suggest that this correction may be near an end and firms are now poised to step up production to match sales. In fact, I expect the biggest source of expansion in the second half of this year to come from a diminished pace of inventory liquidation by manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers. Such a pattern is typical of business cycles. Inventory investment often is the catalyst for economic recoveries. True, the boost is usually fairly short-lived, but it can be quite important in getting things going. Nowhere is this cycle more evident than in the auto sector. Production cutbacks this year have led to sharp reductions in inventories. Recently, sales of light vehicles have begun to rise, in part due to the government’s cash-for-clunkers program. As a result, auto manufacturing has picked up and, with inventories lean, prospects are good for further production increases.\n\nIn all of these sectors, improved financial conditions have played a vital part in stimulating greater activity. To be sure, the financial system is not yet back to normal and credit is still tight.  But there have been notable improvements. The stock market rally has helped households recover some of their lost wealth and provided a much-needed psychological boost. Investors have regained some of their appetite for risk.  Interest rates on corporate bonds—especially for less-than-prime firms—have dropped sharply and issuance has been brisk. Federal Reserve programs to support the mortgage market have helped push rates down. And other Fed programs have helped jump-start issuance of securities backed by consumer and small business loans. In the short-term wholesale funding markets, measures of stress have also diminished.\n\nThe fiscal stimulus program passed by Congress in February also deserves credit for helping the economy turn the corner.  Its tax cuts have raised disposable income, and government spending is directly adding to payrolls, providing another source of household income.  Much of the stimulus money remains to be spent and will add to growth as the year proceeds.\n\nThe normal dynamics of the business cycle have also turned more favorable. Some economic sectors are growing again simply because they sank so low. The inventory adjustment I just discussed is one factor, although the biggest part of those benefits usually is only felt for a few quarters.  But other business cycle patterns can be longer lasting. Demand for houses, durable goods such as autos, and business equipment is beginning to revive as households and firms replace or upgrade needed equipment and structures.\n\nI’d like to pause for a moment to make a few observations about the Bay Area economy. The recession has been felt keenly here.  Employment is down about 6 percentage points from its peak in late 2007. The unemployment rate has risen by more than 6 percentage points to just over 10 percent from its low point in late 2006, outstripping the national increase.\n\nA harsh slump in information technology, due to plunging business spending on tech equipment and services, has prompted extensive job cuts and been a key factor driving down the area economy. Employment has fallen especially steeply on the hardware side, although IT service providers have cut back as well.\n\nFortunately, IT seems to be on the mend.  Sales of U.S.-made semiconductors are up substantially in recent months, prompting some prominent companies to bump up earnings outlooks for the remainder of the year. My local contacts have noted an uptick in venture capital investment, and they say that companies that received venture funding in the past are doing better at meeting performance benchmarks.  Overall, the area’s IT industry is in much better shape than it was following the dot-com bust of the early 2000s. Clearly, it has struggled during this downturn. But, this time around, it is not recovering from bubble-driven overexpansion, so it is well-positioned to take advantage of an economic upswing.\n\nThe area’s housing market is also showing signs of life. Sales of existing homes have been rising since late last year.  Of course, the pickup has been propelled in part by sales of foreclosed homes and widespread availability of properties at bargain-basement prices. As we all know, Bay Area home prices have been decimated. Estimates of the cumulative decline over the past few years range from about 15 percent to as high as 45 percent. Many local homeowners are under water, and that’s helped feed the foreclosure wave. While it’s too soon to be sure, this pernicious process may finally be coming to an end. Some recent data show price increases and a notable pickup in sales of higher-end properties over the past few months.\n\nReturning to the national economy, the all-important question is how strong the upturn will be. With unemployment at 9.7 percent of the workforce and capacity utilization at its lowest level of the post-World War II period, the economy has an enormous amount of slack. That gives us plenty of room to grow rapidly over the next few years.  Indeed, we need to grow robustly to alleviate the enormous human toll resulting from high unemployment and the waste of so much idle industrial capacity. At first glance, history suggests that a vigorous expansion could very well take place. Following previous deep recessions, the United States typically saw V-shaped recoveries.  For example, the economy grew at an average rate of nearly 6 percent during the two years following the severe recession in 1981-82.\n\nThis time though rapid growth does not seem to be in store. My own forecast envisions a far less robust recovery, one that would look more like the letter U than V.  And I’m not alone. The Blue Chip consensus forecast, reflecting the views of nearly 50 professional forecasters, anticipates by far the weakest recovery of the postwar era over the next year and a half.  A large body of evidence supports this guarded outlook.  It is consistent with experiences around the world following recessions caused by financial crises.2 That seems to be because it takes quite a while for financial systems to heal to the point that normal credit flows are restored. That is what I expect this time.  In the buildup to the recession, financial institutions became highly leveraged, a vulnerability compounded by investments in complex and risky assets funded with short-term debt.  In an attempt to improve credit quality and reduce risk, banks have now tightened business and consumer lending standards. They have been doing so at the same time that rising unemployment and falling house prices have fed additional credit losses.\n\nUnfortunately, more credit losses are in store even as the economy improves and overall financial conditions ease.  Certainly, households remain stressed.  In the face of high and rising unemployment, delinquencies and foreclosures are showing no sign of turning around. The delinquency rate on adjustable-rate mortgages is now up to about 18 percent, and, on fixed-rate loans, it’s about 6 percent.3 Delinquencies on both types of loans have increased sharply over the past year and are still rising. This trend is consistent across other major loan categories, and is affecting high- and low-quality borrowers alike. Even recent-vintage loans are experiencing rising delinquency rates.\n\nWhile it is important for economic recovery that lenders provide credit to worthy households and businesses, they also must maintain enough capital to withstand losses—even if economic conditions turn out to be worse than anticipated. In the face of continuing credit losses, moves by lenders to shrink assets, reduce leverage, and conserve capital are restricting the provision of credit in the economy. For example, the Fed’s Senior Loan Officer Survey on Bank Lending Practices conducted in July showed that, for consumer loans, far more banks are tightening standards than easing them, despite some improvements in this measure in recent months.\n\nNormally, if credit flows were restricted by these types of financial headwinds, the Fed would ease the stance of monetary policy by cutting its federal funds rate target.  But the funds rate is already at zero for all practical purposes, leaving the Fed’s traditional policy tool as accommodative as it can be.  In fact, many versions of the Taylor rule, a well-known policy benchmark based on the state of the economy and inflation, indicate that we should lower the funds rate well below this zero bound—if such a thing were possible. To provide more accommodation, the Fed has used unconventional policy tools. Collectively, these programs, which have provided us a slew of new acronyms, appear to be helping.  But we have little experience with them and the extent of their effectiveness is highly uncertain. So here’s the bottom line: Financial conditions have clearly eased compared to the darkest days of the financial crisis. But the financial system is still far from healthy and tight credit is likely to put a damper on growth for some time to come.\n\nA sputtering financial system is not the only challenge before us. The chances are slim for a robust rebound in consumer spending, which represents around 70 percent of economic activity.  Of course, consumers are getting a boost from the fiscal stimulus package. But this program is temporary. Over the long term, consumers face daunting issues of their own. In fact, it’s easy to draw a comparison between the financial state of households and that of financial institutions. For years prior to the recession, households went on a spending spree.  This occurred during a period that economists call the “Great Moderation,” about two decades when recessions were infrequent and mild, and inflation was low and stable. Credit became ever easier to get and consumers took advantage of this to borrow and buy. Stock and home prices rose year after year, giving households additional wherewithal to keep spending. In this culture of consumption, the personal saving rate fell from around 10 percent in the mid-1980s to 1½ percent or lower in recent years. At the same time, households took on larger proportions of debt.  From 1960 to the mid-1980s, debt represented a manageable 65 percent of disposable income. Since then, it has risen steadily, with a notable acceleration in the last economic expansion. By 2008, it had doubled to about 130 percent of income.\n\nIt may well be that we are witnessing the start of a new era for consumers following the traumatic financial blows they have endured. 4 The destruction of their nest eggs caused by falling house and stock prices is prompting them to rebuild savings. The personal saving rate is finally on the rise, averaging almost 4½ percent so far this year.  While certainly sensible from the standpoint of individual households, this retreat from debt-fueled consumption could reduce the growth rate of consumer spending for years. An increase in saving should ultimately support the economy’s capacity to produce and grow by channeling resources from consumption to investment. And higher investment is the key to greater productivity and faster growth in living standards. But the transition could be painful if subpar growth in consumer spending holds back the pace of economic recovery.\n\nWeakness in the labor market is another factor that may keep the recovery in low gear for a while. As I mentioned, payroll employment has been plummeting for a year and a half.  While the August employment report offered more evidence that the pace of the decline has slowed, unemployment now stands at its highest level since 1983. My business contacts indicate that they will be very reluctant to hire again until they see clear evidence of a sustained recovery, and that suggests we could see another so-called jobless recovery in which employment growth lags the improvement in overall output. What’s more, wage growth has slowed sharply. Over the first half of this year, the employment cost index for private-industry workers has risen by a meager three-quarters of one percent. Unemployment, job insecurity, and low growth in incomes will undoubtedly take a toll on consumption. When the array of problems facing consumers is considered, it is hard to see how we can avoid sluggish spending growth.\n\nPutting the whole puzzle together, the main impetus to growth in the second half of this year will be inventory investment. The boost it provides will be a big help for a while, but we will need to look to other sectors to sustain growth. The fact that the largest sector of the economy—consumer spending—is likely to be lackluster implies a less-than-robust expansion. Even the gradual recovery we expect will be vulnerable to shocks, especially from the financial sector. As I said, financial conditions are better, but not back to normal.  And the likelihood of continuing losses by financial institutions will add new fuel to the credit crunch. In particular, small and medium-size banks could experience damaging losses on commercial real estate loans. Thus far, the largest losses have been on loans for construction and land development. Going forward, however, rising loan losses on other commercial real estate lending is likely because property values are falling, office vacancy rates are rising, and credit remains tight or nonexistent for those many property owners that will need to refinance mortgages over the next few years.  Financial contagion from this sector is one of the most important threats to recovery.\n\nThe slow recovery I expect means that it could still take several years to return to full employment. The same is true for capacity utilization in manufacturing. It will take a long time before these human and capital resources are put to full use.\n\nThis brings me to the complex topic of inflation. In my career, I have never witnessed a situation like the one that exists now, when views about inflation risks have coalesced into two diametrically opposed camps. On the one hand, one group worries about the long-term inflationary implications of a seemingly endless procession of massive federal budget deficits. At the same time, others fear that economic slack and downward wage pressure are pushing inflation below rates that are considered consistent with price stability and even raising the specter of outright deflation. This dichotomy is on display among the participants in the Survey of Professional Forecasters.  The lowest quartile of forecasters focuses on disinflation over the next five years. The top quartile is preoccupied with the possibility of rising inflation five to ten years out.\n\nThe fear of higher long-term inflation reflects, to a large degree, worries about Fed monetary policy. Our array of new programs to spur the economy have pumped up our balance sheet and created a huge quantity of bank reserves in the process. Some worry that we won’t be able to shrink our balance sheet because of political pressures, and in the process we will end up monetizing the government debt. This fear is real, growing, and disruptive. That’s why it’s so important for me to say the following loud and clear: We at the Fed are and will remain fiercely independent from politics. We have the means—and we certainly have the will—to tighten policy when the time is right. In fact, by raising the interest rate that we pay on excess reserves we can tighten monetary policy even before our balance sheet shrinks. And we are, as always, steadfast in our determination to achieve both of our statutory goals of full employment and price stability.\n\nMy personal belief is that the more significant threat to price stability over the next several years stems from the disinflationary forces unleashed by the enormous slack in the economy. The 1980s provides a useful historical comparison. During that period, fears about burgeoning federal deficits and an unsustainable fiscal situation were widespread, as they are today.  Moreover, the Fed was under significant political pressure, and some worried whether it would be able to safeguard its independence.  But those circumstances didn’t ignite a renewed bout of inflation. Unemployment nearly hit 11 percent in 1982 and oil prices were sinking. Core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation—the Fed’s preferred measure—fell about 6 percentage points during the first half of the 1980s.\n\nOf course, that period differed from ours in one critical respect. Then, inflation was coming down from unacceptably high levels. Monetary policy was designed to be tight enough to bring inflation down to price stability, a goal we accomplished and have maintained for two-and-a-half decades. Today, we are starting with very low inflation.  Core PCE price inflation has averaged just under 1½ percent over the past twelve months, which is already below the 2 percent rate that I and most of my FOMC colleagues consider an appropriate long-term price stability objective. With slack likely to persist for years, it seems likely that core inflation will move even lower, departing yet farther from our price stability objective.\n\nFrom a monetary policy point of view, the landscape will continue to present challenges.  We face an economy with substantial slack, prospects for only moderate growth, and low and declining inflation. With our policy rate already as low as it can go, it’s no wonder that the FOMC’s last statement indicated that “economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.” I can assure you that we will be ready, willing, and able to tighten policy when it’s necessary to maintain price stability. But, until that time comes, we need to defend our price stability goal on the low side and promote full employment. Thank you very much.\n\n# # #\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1.

To be sure, the financial system is not yet back to normal and credit is still tight.  But there have been notable improvements. The stock market rally has helped households recover some of their lost wealth and provided a much-needed psychological boost. Investors have regained some of their appetite for risk.  Interest rates on corporate bonds—especially for less-than-prime firms—have dropped sharply and issuance has been brisk. Federal Reserve programs to support the mortgage market have helped push rates down. And other Fed programs have helped jump-start issuance of securities backed by consumer and small business loans. In the short-term wholesale funding markets, measures of stress have also diminished.\n\nThe fiscal stimulus program passed by Congress in February also deserves credit for helping the economy turn the corner.  Its tax cuts have raised disposable income, and government spending is directly adding to payrolls, providing another source of household income.  Much of the stimulus money remains to be spent and will add to growth as the year proceeds.\n\nThe normal dynamics of the business cycle have also turned more favorable. Some economic sectors are growing again simply because they sank so low. The inventory adjustment I just discussed is one factor, although the biggest part of those benefits usually is only felt for a few quarters.  But other business cycle patterns can be longer lasting. Demand for houses, durable goods such as autos, and business equipment is beginning to revive as households and firms replace or upgrade needed equipment and structures.\n\nI’d like to pause for a moment to make a few observations about the Bay Area economy. The recession has been felt keenly here.  Employment is down about 6 percentage points from its peak in late 2007. The unemployment rate has risen by more than 6 percentage points to just over 10 percent from its low point in late 2006, outstripping the national increase.\n\nA harsh slump in information technology, due to plunging business spending on tech equipment and services, has prompted extensive job cuts and been a key factor driving down the area economy. Employment has fallen especially steeply on the hardware side, although IT service providers have cut back as well.\n\nFortunately, IT seems to be on the mend.  Sales of U.S.-made semiconductors are up substantially in recent months, prompting some prominent companies to bump up earnings outlooks for the remainder of the year. My local contacts have noted an uptick in venture capital investment, and they say that companies that received venture funding in the past are doing better at meeting performance benchmarks.  Overall, the area’s IT industry is in much better shape than it was following the dot-com bust of the early 2000s. Clearly, it has struggled during this downturn. But, this time around, it is not recovering from bubble-driven overexpansion, so it is well-positioned to take advantage of an economic upswing.\n\nThe area’s housing market is also showing signs of life. Sales of existing homes have been rising since late last year.  Of course, the pickup has been propelled in part by sales of foreclosed homes and widespread availability of properties at bargain-basement prices. As we all know, Bay Area home prices have been decimated. Estimates of the cumulative decline over the past few years range from about 15 percent to as high as 45 percent. Many local homeowners are under water, and that’s helped feed the foreclosure wave. While it’s too soon to be sure, this pernicious process may finally be coming to an end. Some recent data show price increases and a notable pickup in sales of higher-end properties over the past few months.\n\nReturning to the national economy, the all-important question is how strong the upturn will be. With unemployment at 9.7 percent of the workforce and capacity utilization at its lowest level of the post-World War II period, the economy has an enormous amount of slack. That gives us plenty of room to grow rapidly over the next few years.  Indeed, we need to grow robustly to alleviate the enormous human toll resulting from high unemployment and the waste of so much idle industrial capacity. At first glance, history suggests that a vigorous expansion could very well take place. Following previous deep recessions, the United States typically saw V-shaped recoveries.  For example, the economy grew at an average rate of nearly 6 percent during the two years following the severe recession in 1981-82.\n\nThis time though rapid growth does not seem to be in store. My own forecast envisions a far less robust recovery, one that would look more like the letter U than V.  And I’m not alone. The Blue Chip consensus forecast, reflecting the views of nearly 50 professional forecasters, anticipates by far the weakest recovery of the postwar era over the next year and a half.  A large body of evidence supports this guarded outlook.  It is consistent with experiences around the world following recessions caused by financial crises.2 That seems to be because it takes quite a while for financial systems to heal to the point that normal credit flows are restored. That is what I expect this time.  In the buildup to the recession, financial institutions became highly leveraged, a vulnerability compounded by investments in complex and risky assets funded with short-term debt.  In an attempt to improve credit quality and reduce risk, banks have now tightened business and consumer lending standards. They have been doing so at the same time that rising unemployment and falling house prices have fed additional credit losses.\n\nUnfortunately, more credit losses are in store even as the economy improves and overall financial conditions ease.  Certainly, households remain stressed.  In the face of high and rising unemployment, delinquencies and foreclosures are showing no sign of turning around. The delinquency rate on adjustable-rate mortgages is now up to about 18 percent, and, on fixed-rate loans, it’s about 6 percent.3 Delinquencies on both types of loans have increased sharply over the past year and are still rising. This trend is consistent across other major loan categories, and is affecting high- and low-quality borrowers alike. Even recent-vintage loans are experiencing rising delinquency rates.\n\nWhile it is important for economic recovery that lenders provide credit to worthy households and businesses, they also must maintain enough capital to withstand losses—even if economic conditions turn out to be worse than anticipated. In the face of continuing credit losses, moves by lenders to shrink assets, reduce leverage, and conserve capital are restricting the provision of credit in the economy. For example, the Fed’s Senior Loan Officer Survey on Bank Lending Practices conducted in July showed that, for consumer loans, far more banks are tightening standards than easing them, despite some improvements in this measure in recent months.\n\nNormally, if credit flows were restricted by these types of financial headwinds, the Fed would ease the stance of monetary policy by cutting its federal funds rate target.  But the funds rate is already at zero for all practical purposes, leaving the Fed’s traditional policy tool as accommodative as it can be.  In fact, many versions of the Taylor rule, a well-known policy benchmark based on the state of the economy and inflation, indicate that we should lower the funds rate well below this zero bound—if such a thing were possible. To provide more accommodation, the Fed has used unconventional policy tools. Collectively, these programs, which have provided us a slew of new acronyms, appear to be helping.  But we have little experience with them and the extent of their effectiveness is highly uncertain. So here’s the bottom line: Financial conditions have clearly eased compared to the darkest days of the financial crisis. But the financial system is still far from healthy and tight credit is likely to put a damper on growth for some time to come.\n\nA sputtering financial system is not the only challenge before us. The chances are slim for a robust rebound in consumer spending, which represents around 70 percent of economic activity.  Of course, consumers are getting a boost from the fiscal stimulus package. But this program is temporary. Over the long term, consumers face daunting issues of their own. In fact, it’s easy to draw a comparison between the financial state of households and that of financial institutions. For years prior to the recession, households went on a spending spree.  This occurred during a period that economists call the “Great Moderation,” about two decades when recessions were infrequent and mild, and inflation was low and stable. Credit became ever easier to get and consumers took advantage of this to borrow and buy. Stock and home prices rose year after year, giving households additional wherewithal to keep spending. In this culture of consumption, the personal saving rate fell from around 10 percent in the mid-1980s to 1½ percent or lower in recent years. At the same time, households took on larger proportions of debt.  From 1960 to the mid-1980s, debt represented a manageable 65 percent of disposable income. Since then, it has risen steadily, with a notable acceleration in the last economic expansion. By 2008, it had doubled to about 130 percent of income.\n\nIt may well be that we are witnessing the start of a new era for consumers following the traumatic financial blows they have endured. 4 The destruction of their nest eggs caused by falling house and stock prices is prompting them to rebuild savings. The personal saving rate is finally on the rise, averaging almost 4½ percent so far this year.  While certainly sensible from the standpoint of individual households, this retreat from debt-fueled consumption could reduce the growth rate of consumer spending for years. An increase in saving should ultimately support the economy’s capacity to produce and grow by channeling resources from consumption to investment. And higher investment is the key to greater productivity and faster growth in living standards. But the transition could be painful if subpar growth in consumer spending holds back the pace of economic recovery.\n\nWeakness in the labor market is another factor that may keep the recovery in low gear for a while. As I mentioned, payroll employment has been plummeting for a year and a half.  While the August employment report offered more evidence that the pace of the decline has slowed, unemployment now stands at its highest level since 1983. My business contacts indicate that they will be very reluctant to hire again until they see clear evidence of a sustained recovery, and that suggests we could see another so-called jobless recovery in which employment growth lags the improvement in overall output. What’s more, wage growth has slowed sharply. Over the first half of this year, the employment cost index for private-industry workers has risen by a meager three-quarters of one percent. Unemployment, job insecurity, and low growth in incomes will undoubtedly take a toll on consumption. When the array of problems facing consumers is considered, it is hard to see how we can avoid sluggish spending growth.\n\nPutting the whole puzzle together, the main impetus to growth in the second half of this year will be inventory investment. The boost it provides will be a big help for a while, but we will need to look to other sectors to sustain growth. The fact that the largest sector of the economy—consumer spending—is likely to be lackluster implies a less-than-robust expansion. Even the gradual recovery we expect will be vulnerable to shocks, especially from the financial sector. As I said, financial conditions are better, but not back to normal.  And the likelihood of continuing losses by financial institutions will add new fuel to the credit crunch. In particular, small and medium-size banks could experience damaging losses on commercial real estate loans. Thus far, the largest losses have been on loans for construction and land development. Going forward, however, rising loan losses on other commercial real estate lending is likely because property values are falling, office vacancy rates are rising, and credit remains tight or nonexistent for those many property owners that will need to refinance mortgages over the next few years.  Financial contagion from this sector is one of the most important threats to recovery.\n\nThe slow recovery I expect means that it could still take several years to return to full employment. The same is true for capacity utilization in manufacturing. It will take a long time before these human and capital resources are put to full use.\n\nThis brings me to the complex topic of inflation. In my career, I have never witnessed a situation like the one that exists now, when views about inflation risks have coalesced into two diametrically opposed camps. On the one hand, one group worries about the long-term inflationary implications of a seemingly endless procession of massive federal budget deficits. At the same time, others fear that economic slack and downward wage pressure are pushing inflation below rates that are considered consistent with price stability and even raising the specter of outright deflation. This dichotomy is on display among the participants in the Survey of Professional Forecasters.  The lowest quartile of forecasters focuses on disinflation over the next five years. The top quartile is preoccupied with the possibility of rising inflation five to ten years out.\n\nThe fear of higher long-term inflation reflects, to a large degree, worries about Fed monetary policy. Our array of new programs to spur the economy have pumped up our balance sheet and created a huge quantity of bank reserves in the process. Some worry that we won’t be able to shrink our balance sheet because of political pressures, and in the process we will end up monetizing the government debt. This fear is real, growing, and disruptive. That’s why it’s so important for me to say the following loud and clear: We at the Fed are and will remain fiercely independent from politics. We have the means—and we certainly have the will—to tighten policy when the time is right. In fact, by raising the interest rate that we pay on excess reserves we can tighten monetary policy even before our balance sheet shrinks. And we are, as always, steadfast in our determination to achieve both of our statutory goals of full employment and price stability.\n\nMy personal belief is that the more significant threat to price stability over the next several years stems from the disinflationary forces unleashed by the enormous slack in the economy. The 1980s provides a useful historical comparison. During that period, fears about burgeoning federal deficits and an unsustainable fiscal situation were widespread, as they are today.  Moreover, the Fed was under significant political pressure, and some worried whether it would be able to safeguard its independence.  But those circumstances didn’t ignite a renewed bout of inflation. Unemployment nearly hit 11 percent in 1982 and oil prices were sinking. Core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation—the Fed’s preferred measure—fell about 6 percentage points during the first half of the 1980s.\n\nOf course, that period differed from ours in one critical respect. Then, inflation was coming down from unacceptably high levels. Monetary policy was designed to be tight enough to bring inflation down to price stability, a goal we accomplished and have maintained for two-and-a-half decades. Today, we are starting with very low inflation.  Core PCE price inflation has averaged just under 1½ percent over the past twelve months, which is already below the 2 percent rate that I and most of my FOMC colleagues consider an appropriate long-term price stability objective. With slack likely to persist for years, it seems likely that core inflation will move even lower, departing yet farther from our price stability objective.\n\nFrom a monetary policy point of view, the landscape will continue to present challenges.  We face an economy with substantial slack, prospects for only moderate growth, and low and declining inflation. With our policy rate already as low as it can go, it’s no wonder that the FOMC’s last statement indicated that “economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.” I can assure you that we will be ready, willing, and able to tighten policy when it’s necessary to maintain price stability. But, until that time comes, we need to defend our price stability goal on the low side and promote full employment. Thank you very much.\n\n# # #\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1.

        "content": "\n\n\n\nThank you very much. I’m delighted to be able to talk to an audience of community bankers in such a beautiful setting. The 12th Federal Reserve District stretches from Utah to Hawaii, and from Arizona to Alaska. As I travel around this region, I often think how lucky I am to be able to visit some of the most breathtaking places in the United States. Coeur d’Alene is clearly among them.\n\nI will speak today about the difficult economic landscape lying before us and what that means for community banks. It’s fair to say that you have been caught in a financial and economic crisis that you did not create, one precipitated in part by exotic financial engineering carried out mainly by large financial institutions, not banks like yours. Community banks generally steered clear of the market for credit default swaps and didn’t create structured investment vehicles to keep assets off of balance sheets.  Now though all of us must live with the consequences of the culture of risk that permeated the global financial system. The near collapse of that system and the severe recession that continues today have created an exceptionally stressful environment even for well-run banks. That leaves little choice except to take the proper steps to manage through this storm, a point I will expand on later in my talk.\n\nI’ll start my remarks by giving you my perspective on the current economic landscape and prospects for recovery. I will then offer some thoughts about inflation, a subject I know concerns many of you. And I will finish by reviewing the situation faced by community banks in the Pacific Northwest and the 12th District as a whole. As always, my comments represent my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nEconomic and financial conditions\n\nIt was less than a year ago that the financial system found itself on the very brink of collapse.  As home prices tumbled, loan losses cascaded through our financial system. These losses started in subprime markets but spread broadly across nearly all sectors, exposing weaknesses in market structures and the practices of many financial institutions. When Lehman Brothers failed in September 2008, vital wholesale funding markets seized up, precipitating the most catastrophic liquidity crisis since the 1930s. Only the most aggressive intervention by governments and central banks around the world prevented outright financial meltdown. Some people grumble about programs such as TARP, TAF, TALF, and the rest of the alphabet soup. But it’s important to remember how close we were to something unimaginable. Those initiatives may not have been perfect, but I believe they succeeded in supporting the system until a measure of confidence returned.\n\nFinancial trauma of this magnitude could have nothing but the direst effects on economic activity. As we all know, the financial earthquake of the summer and fall was quickly followed by aftershocks that rocked the broader economy, intensifying a credit crunch, and producing precipitous drops in employment and economic output. The interaction between the economy and the credit crunch—often described as an adverse feedback loop—led to what could become the most severe recession since the Great Depression.\n\nThat’s the backdrop to our current situation. And here the picture turns brighter, as we glimpse the first solid signs since the recession started more than a year and a half ago that economic growth may be poised to resume. Indeed, I expect that to happen sometime this year. Financial conditions have improved markedly in recent months. The stock market has rallied and investor appetite for corporate bonds and other assets has rebounded, restoring access to capital at reasonable rates for many healthy companies, including financial institutions. Measures of stress in the markets for short-term funding have also diminished. At the same time, the housing sector finally seems to be stabilizing. Housing starts have leveled off and, in an encouraging sign, sales are beginning to improve. Meanwhile, house price declines may finally be abating. Consumer spending may also be stabilizing. Payrolls are still shrinking at a dreadful pace, but at least the momentum of job losses has slowed a bit in the past two months.\n\nOregon and Idaho have been hit hard by the recession, with unemployment rising in both states at a faster pace than in the nation as a whole. 2 Both Oregon and Idaho have large proportions of technology manufacturing jobs, which have been vulnerable to the sharp downturn in that sector. And Oregon is highly dependent on international trade, 3 which has experienced a historic contraction. Oregon’s unemployment rate was 12.2 percent in June, the third highest in the nation.\n\nLooking ahead at the national economy, a variety of sources will fuel growth in the months ahead, including expansionary fiscal and monetary policies, and the normal dynamics of the business cycle. The fiscal stimulus program passed by Congress in February provides tax cuts that have raised household income. In addition, government spending is directly adding to payrolls and boosting demand. More stimulus will come on line as the year proceeds. This program wasn’t designed to produce an economic recovery by itself, but rather to cushion our fall. In that sense, it’s doing its job.\n\nMonetary policy too has contributed to recovery. As you know, the Fed is using both traditional and nontraditional tools to boost the economy. We have set our federal funds rate target close to zero and indicated that economic conditions are likely to warrant keeping it there for an “extended period.” We have provided liquidity to previously dysfunctional markets, such as the asset-backed commercial paper market. And we’ve purchased Treasury and agency-related securities for our own portfolio to help push longer-term private borrowing costs lower, thereby stimulating demand.\n\nMeanwhile, the normal dynamics of the business cycle are turning more favorable. Some sectors are poised to rebound simply because they have sunk so low. For example, the auto industry has cut production so far that inventories have begun to shrink, even in the face of historically weak demand. Just slowing the pace of inventory liquidation will bolster economic activity. This story holds for many sectors of the economy where spikes in inventories occurred as cautious consumers cut back on purchases of durable goods, and businesses slashed spending on equipment and software. Looking forward, the demand for houses and durables should also eventually revive as old and broken-down goods need to be replaced. The resulting demand will help the economy recover.\n\nBut that recovery is likely to be painfully slow. History teaches that it often takes a long while to recover from downturns caused by financial crises. 4 Financial institutions and markets won’t heal overnight. And it will take quite some time before households have repaired their tattered finances. Until recently, households were saving less and borrowing more in response to wealth gains in both stocks and housing. This pattern made their balance sheets vulnerable to adverse developments and the crashes in both house and stock prices during the last two years destroyed trillions of dollars of their wealth. Not surprisingly, the personal saving rate has now shot higher and I expect to see subdued consumer spending for some time. 5 The unprecedented global nature of the recession also will act as a drag. 6 Countries recovering from financial crises often receive a boost from foreign demand, but neither the United States nor its trading partners can count on such external stimulus this time.\n\nA gradual recovery means that things won’t feel very good for some time to come. The unemployment rate currently is 9½ percent, and this figure is likely to rise further. Moreover, even after the economy begins to grow, it could still take several years to return to full employment. The same is true for capacity utilization in manufacturing, which has declined so far that it has fallen “off the charts”—now standing at its lowest level in the postwar period.\n\nFinally, even though downside risks to the outlook have diminished, there remains some chance that economic conditions could turn out worse than what I’ve sketched. High on my worry list is the possibility of another shock to the still-fragile financial system.  Commercial real estate is a particular danger zone, but I will hold my discussion of that topic until I turn to banking conditions.\n\nLet me now address another issue that is garnering attention—inflation. This is a subject rife with contradiction. Almost without exception, my business contacts report downward pressure on wages and prices. At the same time, they tell me they worry that the United States is on the threshold of serious inflation. They see large federal budget deficits today and more looming on the horizon. They also note that the Fed has pumped up bank reserves and expanded its balance sheet to fund its financial support programs. They worry that this may amount to financing deficits with money creation. Surely, they say, these things will eventually have to lead to higher inflation.\n\nI’ll begin with budget deficits. The gap in the federal budget for the current and the next fiscal years are projected to exceed $1 trillion, far larger than anything we’ve ever seen before. But a large part of these current deficits are temporary. A portion stems from the impact of the weak economy on the budget.  In a recession, tax collections fall and spending on programs such as unemployment insurance rise automatically. A significant portion is due to the fiscal stimulus that has been put in place over the next few years to address the recession. Antirecessionary fiscal policy, in my view, is entirely appropriate. Since that stimulus is temporary by design, the resulting deficits will shrink as the stimulus phases out. But federal deficits will not disappear completely even when the economy has recovered and the stimulus program has phased out. On the contrary, these ongoing or “structural” deficits are anticipated to stretch indefinitely into the future and to escalate over time in a manner that ultimately is not sustainable. The long-term projected structural budget deficit mainly reflects the impact of an aging population and rapidly rising health-care costs on spending for federal entitlement programs, particularly Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nEconomists have known, worried, and warned the public about the damaging consequences of escalating long-term budget deficits in the United States for decades. It’s high time for our country to tackle the problem head-on. But the main concern with these deficits relates to productivity and living standards, and not high inflation. Large budget deficits do not cause high inflation automatically. In fact, since World War II, large deficits have been associated with high inflation only in developing countries. That’s because developing countries often have central banks that are under the sway of the government, which sometimes induces them to print money to finance government spending. 7 The connection isn’t found in countries such as ours with advanced financial systems and independent central banks. Remember that, in the 1980s, the United States ran large deficits just as inflation was coming down. And Japan has had huge deficits through much of the past two decades, yet its problem is persistent deflation—precisely the opposite of inflation. The United States and most other industrialized countries have central banks with long traditions of independence and deep-seated support for keeping politics out of monetary policy. In those countries, the monetary authorities generally have stuck to their inflation objectives, even when governments ran large budget deficits.\n\nIn advanced countries, the problem isn’t that large deficits cause inflation. Rather it’s that they raise long-term interest rates, thereby crowding out private investment, which holds back advances in productivity and living standards. Right now, private investment spending is extremely weak, so financing for the large federal deficits is readily available. But once private spending recovers, the competition for funds between the government and private sectors could drive interest rates up. A decline in productivity growth is a serious problem—one we should strive to avoid—but it is not the same as inflation.\n\nSo what about the Fed’s unprecedented balance sheet expansion? Our strong steps to avert financial and economic meltdown have caused our assets to more than double, from under $900 billion at the start of the recession to over $2 trillion now. This expansion is largely financed by increases in excess reserves that banks deposit with us.\n\nNow we come to the crux of the issue: Will this expansion of credit and bank reserves create high inflation? My answer is no. And the reason again is because of current economic conditions. Monetary policy fosters inflation when it loosens the stance of policy enough to create excess demand for goods and services.  Right now, we have exactly the opposite—an excess supply of goods and services. We need more demand—not less—to offset slack in labor and product markets. We have seen a noticeable slowdown in wage growth and reports of wage cuts have become increasingly prevalent. Businesses are cutting prices to boost sales. As a result, core inflation—a measure that excludes volatile food and energy prices—has drifted below 2 percent, a level that I and most of my colleagues consider consistent with price stability. With unemployment already substantial and likely to rise further, and industrial capacity utilization at record low levels, downward pressure on wages and prices isn’t likely to go away soon. I expect core inflation to remain below 2 percent for several more years.\n\nOf course, the economy will eventually recover and we will need to withdraw monetary accommodation. If we were to fail to do so, we would indeed have higher inflation. The Fed is keenly aware of this. We have the tools to tighten policy when the time is right and we have the will to use them.  First, many of our emergency programs are already tapering off as market conditions improve. Second, many of the assets that we have accumulated during the crisis—such as Treasury and mortgage-backed agency securities—have ready markets and can be easily sold. Finally, the Fed can push up the federal funds rate and tighten policy by raising the rate of interest paid to banks on the reserves they deposit with us—authority granted by Congress last year. An increase in the interest rate on reserves will induce banks to lend money to us rather than to other banks, thereby pushing up rates in the interbank market and, by extension, other interest rates throughout the economy. This is an important tool because, even if the economy rebounds nicely, the credit crunch might not be fully behind us and some financial markets might still need Fed support. This tool will enable us to tighten credit conditions even if we maintain a large balance sheet for a time.  The experience of central banks in Europe, Japan, and Canada suggests that this approach can be effective. 8\n\nLet me be clear: In our conduct of monetary policy, we are guided by our statutory mandates of maximum employment and price stability. We are committed to doing everything in our power to foster both goals. Our institution was created as a politically independent central bank, and that tradition is deeply embedded in our culture and practice. When the economy does come back, I can assure you that we will act decisively and appropriately to tighten the stance of policy and maintain price stability.\n\nBanking\n\nLet me shift now to a review of banking conditions. As I noted earlier, when the financial crisis intensified last fall, the Fed worked jointly with Treasury and other regulators to stabilize the banking system and restore confidence in financial markets more broadly.\n\nThe Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, injected capital into the banking system at a time when confidence in the system’s soundness was eroding and private funding was unavailable. I believe that it made a positive contribution. One indication of the significance of TARP capital for community banks in the West is that about one in five banks in the 12th Federal Reserve District took advantage of the program. Participating banks augmented their capital by an average of 2 percentage points. I certainly recognize that some bankers don’t like the “strings” attached to TARP and perceive that the goals of the program have shifted over time. But there’s no denying that the program measurably strengthened the capitalization of many community banks, putting them in a stronger position to weather difficult times. The stability of bank funding has also been bolstered by the FDIC’s temporary liquidity guarantee program and the expansion of deposit insurance limits. Another program that should be helpful to banks is the joint Fed-Treasury initiative known as the Term Asset-Backed Securities Lending Facility, or TALF. This initiative is designed to revive critical securitization markets and help boost the issuance of a wide range of securitized loan products. The Fed’s recent expansion of the program to include both legacy and new commercial mortgage-backed securities should enhance the availability of credit for commercial real estate and benefit both large and small banks with significant exposure to this sector by preventing defaults and facilitating the sale of distressed properties.\n\nAll in all, I believe that the aggressive responses of the Fed and other agencies served to ease the funding pressures facing a broad range of banks and to stabilize the financial system. The restoration of confidence in the financial system has benefited all banks.\n\nOf course, the crisis has made it self-evident that we must reform our regulatory framework and improve supervisory practice so that a catastrophe of this magnitude never happens again. As you know, the Obama administration has submitted a comprehensive reform bill to Congress, which is holding hearings over the summer on the proposal. Last week, Chairman Bernanke and Governor Tarullo testified before Congress, laying out the Fed’s views on regulatory restructuring. 9 Let me mention just two key areas where our regulatory framework must be strengthened.\n\nFirst, we need a better way to manage systemic risk. By that I mean improved oversight of the financial system as a whole. Focusing on systemic risk is different than our traditional institution-oriented approach to supervision. It has become painfully clear that when regulators focus exclusively on individual institutions, they can miss broader risks building in the system. In particular, we need to do a better job of assessing how the practices of large institutions may affect their counterparties and the system as a whole. I know that many community bankers consider it unfair that small banks—which did not cause the financial mess—are allowed to fail, while larger banks that took the biggest risks are rescued. That’s an understandable reaction. But we can’t escape the reality that certain institutions, by virtue of their size or their linkages to key markets, pose unique risks to the system and can bring others down with them.  One lesson from the crisis is that it’s dangerous to have large, systemic institutions operating outside the regulatory framework or with inadequate capital and liquidity buffers. It’s essential that we identify these systemic institutions and subject them to a robust framework of consolidated supervision as well as more stringent standards for capital, liquidity, and governance.\n\nProtecting consumers is a second area where our current system failed in many respects. This is not only a matter of fairness for individuals. It’s also a key element in the performance of our economy. Abuses such as inadequate consumer disclosures and unfair and deceptive mortgage lending practices by some institutions contributed to record foreclosure rates that magnified the financial crisis. Given what we’ve learned about the pernicious effects of consumer loan defaults on the banking sector and the economy, it’s critical that we strengthen our regulation and supervision in this area for both bank and nonbank financial players.\n\nNow let me turn to the business environment facing banks. The industry is going through one of the most difficult periods in modern times. First-quarter data show that the 12th District has been hit harder than any other area of the country. Bank profits are down, loan delinquencies are up, and failures are climbing.\n\nIn Oregon and Idaho, community banks are underperforming the nation and have significantly riskier profiles. In terms of return on assets, Oregon was the eighth and Idaho was the eleventh worst performing state in the nation. 10 Moreover, a relatively large fraction of banks in each state lost money in the first quarter—about 40 percent in Oregon and 20 percent in Idaho. Loan quality indicators tell a similar story. Recent net charge-off rates at banks in each state are much higher than the national average.  Recessionary effects normally take some time to work their way through loan portfolios. So, even though I expect economic growth to resume in the second half of this year, banking conditions are likely to remain quite weak for another year or two.\n\nTo date, the community banks under greatest financial stress are those with high real estate concentrations in construction and land development lending. Banks that liberally funded speculative housing and condominium construction, and those that funded land acquisition and development, have been hardest hit. Over 20 District financial institutions have failed since last year. The vast majority of them had high concentrations in residential construction and development lending. In fact, these banks had construction loans that averaged about 40 percent of their loan portfolio, well above the District average of 16 percent.  Unfortunately, some banks that aggressively pursued these loans had weak appraisal and risk-monitoring systems.\n\nThe next area of significant vulnerability for the banking system, particularly for community and regional banks with real estate concentrations, is income-producing office, warehouse, and retail commercial property. Market fundamentals in most western states are deteriorating. Vacancy rates are rising and rent pressures are hurting property cash flows. Office vacancy rates in both Boise and Portland are expected to reach or exceed 20 percent over the next year or two, the highest rates these cities have seen in many years. Retail shopping centers are struggling with falling occupancy rates and pressures to grant rent concessions. Property values are falling sharply across wide areas of the country, including the Pacific Northwest. Some analysts forecast that commercial property values could experience falls similar to housing of 30 to 40 percent.\n\nRegrettably, a number of banks failed to implement risk management steps outlined in the guidance on commercial real estate loan concentrations that was issued by regulators in 2006. Banks need to take proactive steps to address emerging credit problems, obtain new appraisals, and recognize impairment when warranted. But we also encourage banks to work out problem loans with troubled borrowers when this is prudent.\n\nOur biggest concern now is with maturing loans on depreciated commercial properties. In many cases, borrowers seeking to refinance will be expected to provide additional equity and to have underwriting and pricing adjusted to reflect current market conditions. In some cases, borrowers won’t have the resources to refinance loans. TALF and the Treasury’s Public-Private Investment Program can support the commercial real estate market. But the economic forces hammering commercial property are unlikely to reverse anytime soon.\n\nAnother area I’d like to touch on is liquidity. For most banks, funding has stabilized since last fall but remains quite fragile. We’ve seen rapid growth in the use of noncore funding channels, such as brokered deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances.  Brokered deposits constitute an average of less than 4 percent of deposits nationally.  But in Idaho, that concentration is more than double. And, in Oregon, it’s more than three times higher. 11 Although many banks have managed their liquidity positions effectively, one lesson of the current period is that funding options can evaporate when a bank is facing declining asset quality, diminished earnings capacity, and falling capital. And that holds for brokered deposits, correspondent lines, and FHLB advances.\n\nI know this sounds woeful, but my advice is to hope for the best and plan for the worst. That means anticipating a range of bad and worst-case scenarios that reflect local economic conditions and a bank’s particular risk profile. It can be helpful to perform stress tests based on these scenarios to assess potential effects on earnings and capital, and to develop appropriate contingency plans. The commercial real estate guidance that I mentioned earlier emphasizes the importance of stress tests. The testing that the largest 19 banks recently conducted offers examples of techniques that community banks can adopt, such as two-year portfolio loss estimates and methods of estimating revenue. Appropriately designed stress tests can help bank managements and boards make decisions about loan-loss provisioning, capital planning, and strategic initiatives.\n\nIt also makes sense to perform liquidity risk analyses that assess potential funding pressures. These analyses should include forward-looking metrics such as cash-flow projections, and should examine a range of possibilities, such as reduced correspondent borrowing lines, higher FHLB haircuts, and loss of access to brokered deposits. Banks would be well advised to have in place well-tested backup plans before any potential funding crisis, including procedures for using the Fed’s discount window.\n\nOn the subject of capital, regulatory minimums are just that—minimums. They’re not guarantees that a bank will have enough capital to weather a future storm. The Fed and other regulators are placing much more emphasis on forward-looking capital analyses that consider a range of difficult economic scenarios and include earnings and loss estimates, and assessments of an institution’s ability to raise private capital. Capital retention is an integral part of this equation, and that implies a rigorous review of dividend policy. I encourage bank managements to consult with their primary regulators about dividends in the context of capital planning discussions.\n\nAlthough my message is that you should plan for the worst and exercise caution, I want to stress that it is also critical that you continue to make loans to creditworthy borrowers. The profits that quality loans generate will serve you well as you safeguard capital. They are the core earning assets that will power bank profitability as we head out of this recession. And, of course, the credit provided by prudent, well-functioning depository institutions will play an important role in supporting the broader economic recovery that now seems to be on the horizon. Thank you very much.\n\n# # #\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1. I would like to thank Teresa Curran, John Judd, Maureen O’Byrne, and Sam Zuckerman for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n2.

        "content": "Watch Video\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you very much. I’m very glad to be here before this thoughtful and engaged audience to talk about the economy and the Federal Reserve’s response. The Fed has faced extraordinary challenges over the past two years and these challenges continue as this very painful recession grinds on. I don’t have to tell you how difficult these times have been for the American people. You are reminded of it every time you look at your retirement portfolio or hear about rising foreclosures and plunging home values. Your businesses may be squeezed as customers retreat and credit remains scarce. You may have seen colleagues get pink slips or you yourselves may be struggling to find a job.  I’m happy to offer some good news: We’ve seen encouraging signs lately that the economy is poised to turn the corner. But as California’s 11.5 percent unemployment rate attests, we still find ourselves slogging through the starkest economic landscape most of us have known in our lifetimes.\n\nFor economic policymakers, this crisis has been like a hundred-year flood—a disaster of the highest order which has put us on a continuous emergency footing. That is especially true at the Federal Reserve—the institution where I serve as one of 12 regional bank presidents—which is charged with promoting maximum employment and controlling inflation. Later in my talk, I’ll describe how we’ve responded to what not so long ago seemed perilously close to financial and economic meltdown. For now, all I’ll say is that, in the face of unprecedented challenges, we’ve developed a number of creative programs far beyond the confines of our usual focus on interest rates to make sure that everything that reasonably could be done to get the economy turned around is being done.\n\nI want to start by discussing where the economy has been and where I see it going over the next few years. As always, my comments represent my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System. To understand where we’re headed, it’s useful to review how we got to the present situation.  I think it’s helpful to divide the recent turmoil, like a play, into three acts. I hope the curtain is now rising on the final act, one defined by economic recovery.\n\nThe first act began early in the new century, amid a frenzied housing boom and a mortgage market where loans were available to just about everyone on unbelievably generous terms.  Interest rates were unusually low, partly because of a huge supply of foreign savings that flooded the U.S. market and partly because the Fed promoted very low interest rates after the tech bubble burst to prevent deflation. 2 With money so cheap, investors borrowed to the hilt and took ever-greater risks in search of higher returns.\n\nIt may be that investors—and regulators too—got overly complacent. Many had come to believe that the new and mind-bendingly complex forms of financial engineering that had swept Wall Street virtually guaranteed the safety of banks and investment firms. A new era had dawned: financial innovation and sophisticated risk management had changed the rules. What’s more, the business cycle had been tamed. For two decades, recessions had been rare and mild.\n\nThis whole process fed on itself. In the housing market, loan standards became increasingly lax. Investors had an insatiable appetite for securities created from home loans, buying them by the truckload from the institutions that made the loans, even though they offered returns just a shade higher than ultra-safe U.S. Treasury securities.  These risky practices spread far beyond the subprime mortgage market where they were most visible, reaching into all kinds of credit products around the world.\n\nThis brings us to the second act of the play. House prices leaped higher every year, thanks to this frothy financial market. But they couldn’t go up forever. Once they started to fall in 2006, loan delinquencies surged and the sophisticated financial engineering collapsed. The financial system spread those losses like a runaway infection. Banks and investment firms around the world saw the value of their housing-related investments plummet, in some cases threatening their solvency. The financial engineering was so unfathomable that it was nearly impossible to identify which institutions were safe and which were in jeopardy. That prompted financial firms to hunker down and avoid lending money to anybody.\n\nThis all came to a head last fall. The weakest links in the financial chain were unable to borrow the money they needed to meet day-to-day obligations—a classic liquidity crisis. And when the venerable Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers collapsed, the system broke down entirely. The financial markets that banks and businesses rely on to fund daily operations froze up. The value of investments held by financial institutions plunged as everyone tried to sell whatever they could to raise cash. Even the most solid institutions feared for their lives.\n\nSuch a breakdown of the financial system had the direst implications for the broader economy, threatening to choke off credit to households and Main Street businesses. For Congress, the Fed, the Treasury Department, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, it was a signal to take emergency steps to keep credit flowing to the economy. Congress approved the TARP program and it was quickly used to provide capital to banks. And the Fed created never-before-seen programs to stabilize money market mutual funds and the short-term commercial paper market. In addition, the Fed and Treasury jointly intervened to support important institutions whose collapse was judged to threaten the entire financial system.\n\nI am not going to go into detail about the alphabet soup of Fed programs created during this period. But I want to stress that these policies—in some cases improvised in very short order—did succeed in averting a full-blown meltdown. The panic of 2008 subsided.  Increasingly, banks and corporations have been able to raise funds on reasonable terms. Confidence in the financial system is slowly returning.\n\nStill, our brush with financial collapse came at great cost. As financial institutions struggled to survive, they cut back on lending. And private securitization markets seized up entirely. These are markets in which a variety of types of loans, including auto, student, credit card, Small Business Administration, jumbo mortgage, and commercial real estate loans, are packaged as securities and sold to investors. The resulting massive credit crunch caused the economy to nosedive in the final quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. Job losses reached more than 700,000 per month and the unemployment rate skyrocketed to levels not seen since the early 1980s, reaching 9.4 percent in May. Some 6 million jobs vaporized during the recession. Each of these was once held by a real human being, who likely depended on that paycheck to pay the mortgage, buy the groceries, and put gas in the car. The loss of these jobs is an immense tragedy. We should never forget that this awful recession is a flesh-and-blood thing that robs our families, neighbors, and friends of their livelihood.\n\nEarlier I described some of the emergency measures the Fed has taken to prop up the financial system. Now I’d like to talk about the policies we’ve adopted to fight the recession directly. Our policymaking body is called the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC. It consists of the presidents of the Fed’s regional banks, like me, plus the governors of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, including Chairman Ben Bernanke. Traditionally, our main monetary policy tool is the federal funds rate, which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans. We control this rate by pumping cash into the banking system or withdrawing it. This is a powerful tool because the interest banks pay to borrow determines what they charge for loans and ultimately works its way through to the rates businesses and households pay for credit.  This December, we cut the federal funds rate essentially to zero—an extraordinary step on its own—and we’ve said repeatedly that low rates would likely be warranted “for an extended period.” As a result, many other interest rates in the economy are at very low levels. Other major central banks have taken similar steps.\n\nStill, given the depth of the crisis we’ve faced, a near-zero federal funds rate hasn’t been enough to turn the economy around. So we’ve developed a variety of alternative ways to stimulate the economy. For example, we’ve become a major buyer of securities issued by the giant mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a move that has helped push conforming mortgage interest rates to near-record low levels—a support to the housing sector, which is under tremendous duress. In addition, the FOMC launched a program to purchase large quantities of longer-term Treasury debt, to help bring down corporate bond and other rates that are linked to Treasury yields.  In total, the FOMC has committed up to $1.75 trillion—that is, trillion with a “T”—for these asset purchases by the end of this year.\n\nThe Fed and other government bodies have also worked hard to put our banking sector on a more secure footing. The recent stress tests of the 19 largest U.S. banks provided a thorough evaluation of their financial health and capital needs. Since these tests, many banks have raised capital or issued debt without FDIC guarantees—a very encouraging sign.\n\nIn addition, the Fed and Treasury Department jointly developed the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, program to help revive vital securitization markets. Securitization is one of the great financial innovations of the last generation, greatly expanding the market for these loans and reducing their cost compared with the days when banks and other front-line lenders had to keep such credits in their own portfolios. There’s no question that securitization of certain types of loans like subprime mortgages contributed to the crisis. But we must not throw out the baby with the bath water.  Securitization markets will continue to play a major role in our financial system. As I mentioned, in the midst of the financial storm late last year, these markets froze up entirely, with the exception of the market for mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. That made it tough, if not impossible, for ordinary people to borrow to buy a car, pay college tuition, or finance a business. Restoring securitization markets to health is one of the key challenges we face. Our TALF program got off to a slow start, but is now clearly helping to bring rates down and increase the issuance of a wide range of securitized loan products.\n\nWe now come to the present—the third act—in which the economy hopefully recovers.  Right now, we’re like a patient in intensive care whose condition has stabilized and whose fever is just starting to come down. We’re just completing the sixth quarter of recession, but the pace of decline has slowed markedly. The news during the past few months has been encouraging. Even though house prices are continuing to fall in most markets, housing sales and new construction appear to have stabilized. Consumers have recovered some spirit and their spending has also stabilized, thanks in part to government stimulus programs. Payrolls are still shrinking at an awful pace, but the momentum of job losses has slowed considerably in the past two months.\n\nFinancial markets are in much better shape today than we ever would have dreamed six months ago. Investors have gone from disregarding risk, to being paralyzed by it, to once again being willing to take on a reasonable bit. The stock market has rallied and investor appetite for corporate bonds and other assets has rebounded, restoring access to capital for healthy companies. Even so, I am concerned that mortgage rates, which have risen of late, could place a drag on a still very sick housing market, potentially driving home prices still lower and pushing more borrowers into foreclosure. The recent run-up in oil prices may also reflect greater confidence in the global outlook. But it too is troublesome because it impedes recovery by forcing consumers and businesses to pay more for gas and energy, thereby reducing their ability to buy other goods and services.\n\nStill, I expect the recession will end sometime later this year. That would make it the longest and probably deepest downturn since the Great Depression. Growth will come from a variety of sources. One is federal government spending resulting from the stimulus program passed by Congress earlier this year. This package provides tax cuts that leave more cash in consumers’ pockets, as well as direct government spending increases that add to payrolls and boost economic output. But it will take more than fiscal policy to really get the economy moving forward.\n\nFortunately, some sectors are poised to rebound. For example, the auto industry has cut back production so far that inventories have begun to shrink—even in the face of historically weak demand for motor vehicles. As the economy stabilizes, just slowing the pace of this inventory shrinkage will boost gross domestic product, or GDP, which is the nation’s total output of goods and services. This story holds through broad sectors of the economy, where cautious consumers and businesses have cut back on purchases of durable goods, such as computers and appliances. Eventually, old and broken-down goods will need to be replaced, and the resulting demand will add to economic growth.\n\nThe housing sector too will eventually rise from the ashes. Home construction has fallen dramatically over the past few years as the nation works off the massive overbuilding of the boom years. But, once this adjustment is complete, housing construction will need to increase significantly just to keep pace with the growth in the number of households.  Finally, the vicious cycle of tight credit and a weak economy can turn into a virtuous cycle. Once the economy starts growing and jobs and income are increasing, fewer borrowers will default and lenders will be willing to increase the supply of credit.\n\nI don’t like taking the wind out of the sails of our economic expansion, but a few cautionary points should be considered. I expect the pace of the recovery will be frustratingly slow. It’s often the case that growth in the first year after a recession is very rapid. That’s what happened as we came out of a very deep downturn in the early 1980s. Although I sincerely wish we would repeat that performance, I don’t think we will. In past deep recessions, the Fed was able to step on the accelerator by cutting the federal funds rate sharply, causing the economy to shoot ahead. This time, we already have our foot planted firmly on the floor. We can’t take the federal funds rate any lower than zero.  I believe that the Fed’s novel programs are stimulating the flow of credit, but they simply aren’t as powerful levers as large rate cuts, so this time monetary policy alone can’t power a rapid recovery.\n\nHistory also teaches us that it often takes a long time to recover from downturns caused by financial crises. 3 In particular, financial institutions and markets won’t heal overnight.  Our major banks have made excellent progress in establishing the capital buffers needed to continue lending even through a downturn that is more serious than we anticipate. But they are still nursing their wounds and credit will remain tight for some time to come.\n\nI also think that a massive shift in consumer behavior is under way—one that will produce great benefits in the long run but slow our recovery in the short term. 4 American households entered this recession stretched to the limit with mortgage and other debt. The personal saving rate fell from around 8 percent of disposable income two decades ago to almost zero.  Households financed their lifestyles by drawing on increasing stock market and housing wealth, and taking on higher levels of debt. But falling house and stock prices have destroyed trillions of dollars in wealth, cutting off those ready sources of cash. What’s more, the stark realities of this recession have scared many households straight, convincing them that they need to save larger fractions of their incomes. In the long run, higher saving promises to channel resources from consumption to investment, making capital more readily available to retool industry and fix our infrastructure. But, in the here and now, such a rediscovery of thrift means fewer sales at the mall, and fewer jobs on assembly lines and store counters.\n\nA fourth factor that could slow recovery is the unprecedented global nature of the recession. 5 Neither we nor our trading partners can count on a boost from strong foreign demand.  Finally, developments in the labor market suggest it could take several years to return to full employment. During this recession, an unusually high proportion of layoffs have been permanent as opposed to temporary, meaning workers won’t get called back when conditions improve.  Also, we’ve seen an unprecedented level of involuntary part-time work, such as state workers on furlough a few days per month. Those workers are likely to return to full-time status before new workers are hired. To summarize, I expect that we will turn the growth corner sometime later this year, but I am not optimistic that the economy will spring back to normal anytime soon. What’s more, I expect the unemployment rate to remain painfully high for several more years.\n\nThat’s a dreary prediction, but there is also some risk that things could turn out worse.  High on my worry list is the possibility of another shock to the still-fragile financial system. Commercial real estate is a particular danger zone.  Property prices are falling and vacancy rates are rising in many parts of the country.  Given the weak economy, prices could fall more rapidly and developers could face tough times rolling over their loans.  Many banks are heavily exposed to commercial real estate loans.  An increase in defaults could add to their financial stress, prompting them to tighten credit.  The Fed and Treasury are providing loans to investors in securitized commercial mortgages, which should be a big help. But a risk remains of a severe shakeout in this sector.\n\nLet me now turn to an issue that has lately garnered a great deal of attention—inflation.  Just a short time ago, most economists were casting a wary eye on the risk of deflation—that is that prices might drop, perhaps falling into a downward spiral that would squeeze the life out of the economy. Now, though, all I hear about is the danger of an outbreak of high inflation.\n\nI’ll put my cards on the table right away. I think the predominant risk is that inflation will be too low, not too high, over the next several years. I take 2 percent as a reasonable benchmark for the rate of inflation that is most compatible with the Fed’s dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. This is also the figure that a majority of FOMC members cited as their long-run forecast for inflation, according to the minutes of the committee’s April meeting.\n\nFirst of all, this very weak economy is, if anything, putting downward pressure on wages and prices. We have already seen a noticeable slowdown in wage growth and reports of wage cuts have become increasingly prevalent—a sign of the sacrifices that some workers are making to keep their employers afloat and preserve their jobs.  Businesses are also cutting prices and profit margins to boost sales. Core inflation—a measure that excludes volatile food and energy prices—has drifted down below 2 percent.  With unemployment already substantial and likely to rise further, the downward pressure on wages and prices should continue and could intensify.  For these reasons, I expect core inflation will dip to about 1 percent over the next year and remain below 2 percent for several years.\n\nIf the economy fails to recover soon, it is conceivable that this very low inflation could turn into outright deflation. Worse still, if deflation were to intensify, we could find ourselves in a devastating spiral in which prices fall at an ever-faster pace and economic activity sinks more and more.  But I don’t view this as likely. The vigorous policy actions of the Fed and other central banks, combined with sizable fiscal stimulus here and abroad, have sent a clear message that deflation won’t be tolerated. Based on measures of inflation expectations, the public appears confident that the Fed will adopt policies that will maintain a low, positive rate of inflation.  Evidently, the credibility that the Fed and other central banks have built over the past few decades in bringing inflation down has spilled over into a belief that we won’t allow inflation to get too low either. This does not mean that a short episode of deflation couldn’t occur, but it makes a prolonged and devastating deflationary spiral less likely.\n\nNone of what I just said will satisfy those who worry about inflation. Indeed, if you listen to popular business news channels, you might hear a drumbeat of concern that the Fed could let inflation get too high. Those who hold this view point to the rise in Treasury yields and commodity prices this year as signs that runaway inflation is on the horizon.  They muster three arguments. The first is that the Fed has pumped up the money supply and expanded its balance sheet to fund its financial rescue programs, potentially igniting inflation. The second is that the Fed runs the risk of repeating the errors of the 1970s by focusing on mistaken views of economic slack rather than rising prices. The third is that large fiscal budget deficits will create higher inflation. I take all of these concerns very seriously and will address each in turn.\n\nFirst, I’ll talk about the Fed’s balance sheet. As I discussed earlier, the Fed has taken a number of strong steps to avert a financial and economic meltdown, and to support the flow of credit. These policies have caused the assets on the Fed’s balance sheet to more than double, from under $900 billion at the start of the recession to over $2 trillion now.  This expansion is largely financed by increases in bank reserves, that is, surplus cash that banks deposit with us. Some worry that the Fed’s balance sheet expansion is pumping money into the economy and will be inflationary. But, as I will explain in a moment, we have the tools needed to tighten policy and head off future inflation. There is also some concern that the Fed could be trapped by conflicting goals if, at some point, a growing economy requires a higher federal funds rate, before credit markets are fully healed. Finally, some worry that the Fed may lack the political will to tighten policy when the time comes.\n\nI will be the first to say that it is always difficult to get monetary policy just right. But the Fed’s analytical prowess is top-notch and our forecasting record is second to none. The FOMC is committed to price stability and has a solid track record in achieving it. With respect to our tool kit, we certainly have the means to unwind the stimulus when the time is right.  Many of the special programs we developed to provide emergency credit to the financial system are already tapering off as market conditions improve.  Many of the assets that we have accumulated during the crisis, such as Treasury and mortgage-backed agency securities, have ready markets. And the Fed can push up the federal funds rate by raising the rate of interest that we pay to banks on the reserve balances they have on deposit with us—authority that was granted to us by Congress last year.  An increase in the interest rate on reserves will induce banks to lend money to us rather than to other banks and borrowers, thereby pushing up the federal funds rate and other rates charged to private borrowers throughout the economy. The ability to pay interest on reserves is an important tool because, as I mentioned, it’s conceivable that, even if the economy rebounds nicely, the credit crunch might not be fully behind us and some financial markets might still need Fed support. This tool will enable us to tighten credit conditions even though our balance sheet wouldn’t shrink.\n\nLet me turn to the second concern, that we could have a rerun of the stagflation of the 1970s.  Some economists have argued that the Fed misjudged how low the unemployment rate could go without igniting inflation and, as a result, lowered the federal funds rate too far for too long, an overly accommodative stance that contributed to runaway prices. 6 This is an issue we have studied in great depth, looking at a wide range of data sources and using a variety of techniques to estimate slack in labor and product markets. Not surprisingly, these estimates vary.  But they all plainly show that labor and product markets are currently operating well below the levels that would trigger inflation.  We must beware of overconfidence that we have too precise a handle on these questions.  But, to me, the evidence is clear that the economy has substantial slack and we are far from the kinds of unemployment rates that would make inflation a danger.\n\nThe third concern is that big federal budget deficits might eventually be inflationary. In my years of teaching at Berkeley, I regularly lectured on the relationship between fiscal deficits and inflation.  A glance at history shows that many countries with massive structural deficits and without an independent central bank turned to the printing press to pay off their debts. That’s a recipe for high inflation and, in some cases, hyperinflation.\n\nBut I don’t believe the United States faces that threat.  Looking back in history, runaway fiscal deficits have often been accompanied by high inflation. 7 But, since World War II, such a relationship has only held in developing countries. 8 In countries with advanced financial systems and histories of low inflation, no such connection is found.\n\nSo where exactly do the dangers with fiscal deficits lie? To answer that question, it’s important to distinguish between cyclical deficits and long-run or structural deficits.  The recent sharp rise in the federal deficit in large part stems from the government’s appropriate response to a severe recession and financial crisis. These near-term cyclical deficits vastly overstate the problem of ongoing structural deficits.  But the United States does have a large structural budget deficit, and it will remain when the economy finally recovers.  To a great extent, the structural budget gap reflects demographic shifts resulting in an aging population coupled with a chronic escalation in health-care costs.  The issue of rising entitlement and health-care spending is not new. In fact, I spent many of my waking hours grappling with these problems a decade ago when I chaired the Council of Economic Advisers in the Clinton administration.\n\nIt is essential that we come to grips with structural budget deficits, but not because such deficits will cause inflation. It’s because large, sustained structural deficits vacuum up savings that could be put to more productive uses. Once the economy is back on track, these deficits will make capital more expensive for private borrowers, crowding out the investments that are essential to boost productivity and fuel growth in real wages and living standards.\n\nConsider the case of the large deficits in the United States in the 1980s. We did not see a run-up in inflation then. On the contrary, the deficits soared just as inflation was coming down. Those deficits did, however, contribute to higher interest rates, which made education and investment more expensive. Japan provides another example.  Japan has run very large fiscal deficits through much of the past two decades, yet its problem is persistent deflation—precisely the opposite of inflation.\n\nFinally, there’s the matter of whether the Fed’s resolve is firm enough to tighten policy when the time comes to do so. Let me be unequivocal. The Fed is committed to doing everything in its power to foster recovery while maintaining price stability. When it’s necessary to withdraw the extraordinary stimulus we have put in place, we won’t hesitate. The Fed was created as a politically independent central bank, and that tradition is deeply embedded in our culture and practice. We have worked closely with the Treasury and other agencies during this crisis, and it was appropriate to do so. But, in our conduct of monetary policy, we are guided solely by our statutory mandates of maximum employment and price stability. In March, the Treasury Department and the Fed signed an accord reaffirming our independence in setting monetary policy.\n\nIn sum, although I take these concerns about inflation seriously, I do not believe that there is a real threat of high inflation in the current situation. Monetary policy fosters inflation when it loosens financial conditions enough to create excess demand for goods and services.  What could be clearer than the fact that right now we need more demand—not less—to offset the slack in labor and product markets?\n\nIf anything, I’m more concerned that we will be tempted to tighten policy too soon, thereby aborting recovery. That’s just what happened in 1936 when, following two years of robust recovery, the Fed tightened policy because it was worried about large quantities of excess reserves in the banking system. The result?  In 1937, the economy plunged back into a deep recession. 9 Japan too learned that hard lesson in the 1990s, when both monetary and fiscal policies were tightened in the mistaken belief that the economy was rebounding.\n\nThese episodes teach us a valuable lesson that we should heed in the present situation.  Let this not be another 1937, but a time when policymakers have the wisdom and patience to nurse the economy back to health. And, when the economy does come back, let it be built on a foundation of sound private investment and sustainable public policies.  Only then can we be confident that we can escape destructive boom-and-bust cycles and build a more permanent prosperity. Thank you very much.\n\n# # #\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1.

        "content": "Watch Video\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you very much. I’m very glad to be here before this thoughtful and engaged audience to talk about the economy and the Federal Reserve’s response. The Fed has faced extraordinary challenges over the past two years and these challenges continue as this very painful recession grinds on. I don’t have to tell you how difficult these times have been for the American people. You are reminded of it every time you look at your retirement portfolio or hear about rising foreclosures and plunging home values. Your businesses may be squeezed as customers retreat and credit remains scarce. You may have seen colleagues get pink slips or you yourselves may be struggling to find a job.  I’m happy to offer some good news: We’ve seen encouraging signs lately that the economy is poised to turn the corner. But as California’s 11.5 percent unemployment rate attests, we still find ourselves slogging through the starkest economic landscape most of us have known in our lifetimes.\n\nFor economic policymakers, this crisis has been like a hundred-year flood—a disaster of the highest order which has put us on a continuous emergency footing. That is especially true at the Federal Reserve—the institution where I serve as one of 12 regional bank presidents—which is charged with promoting maximum employment and controlling inflation. Later in my talk, I’ll describe how we’ve responded to what not so long ago seemed perilously close to financial and economic meltdown. For now, all I’ll say is that, in the face of unprecedented challenges, we’ve developed a number of creative programs far beyond the confines of our usual focus on interest rates to make sure that everything that reasonably could be done to get the economy turned around is being done.\n\nI want to start by discussing where the economy has been and where I see it going over the next few years. As always, my comments represent my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System. To understand where we’re headed, it’s useful to review how we got to the present situation.  I think it’s helpful to divide the recent turmoil, like a play, into three acts. I hope the curtain is now rising on the final act, one defined by economic recovery.\n\nThe first act began early in the new century, amid a frenzied housing boom and a mortgage market where loans were available to just about everyone on unbelievably generous terms.  Interest rates were unusually low, partly because of a huge supply of foreign savings that flooded the U.S. market and partly because the Fed promoted very low interest rates after the tech bubble burst to prevent deflation. 2 With money so cheap, investors borrowed to the hilt and took ever-greater risks in search of higher returns.\n\nIt may be that investors—and regulators too—got overly complacent. Many had come to believe that the new and mind-bendingly complex forms of financial engineering that had swept Wall Street virtually guaranteed the safety of banks and investment firms. A new era had dawned: financial innovation and sophisticated risk management had changed the rules. What’s more, the business cycle had been tamed. For two decades, recessions had been rare and mild.\n\nThis whole process fed on itself. In the housing market, loan standards became increasingly lax. Investors had an insatiable appetite for securities created from home loans, buying them by the truckload from the institutions that made the loans, even though they offered returns just a shade higher than ultra-safe U.S. Treasury securities.  These risky practices spread far beyond the subprime mortgage market where they were most visible, reaching into all kinds of credit products around the world.\n\nThis brings us to the second act of the play. House prices leaped higher every year, thanks to this frothy financial market. But they couldn’t go up forever. Once they started to fall in 2006, loan delinquencies surged and the sophisticated financial engineering collapsed. The financial system spread those losses like a runaway infection. Banks and investment firms around the world saw the value of their housing-related investments plummet, in some cases threatening their solvency. The financial engineering was so unfathomable that it was nearly impossible to identify which institutions were safe and which were in jeopardy. That prompted financial firms to hunker down and avoid lending money to anybody.\n\nThis all came to a head last fall. The weakest links in the financial chain were unable to borrow the money they needed to meet day-to-day obligations—a classic liquidity crisis. And when the venerable Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers collapsed, the system broke down entirely. The financial markets that banks and businesses rely on to fund daily operations froze up. The value of investments held by financial institutions plunged as everyone tried to sell whatever they could to raise cash. Even the most solid institutions feared for their lives.\n\nSuch a breakdown of the financial system had the direst implications for the broader economy, threatening to choke off credit to households and Main Street businesses. For Congress, the Fed, the Treasury Department, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, it was a signal to take emergency steps to keep credit flowing to the economy. Congress approved the TARP program and it was quickly used to provide capital to banks. And the Fed created never-before-seen programs to stabilize money market mutual funds and the short-term commercial paper market. In addition, the Fed and Treasury jointly intervened to support important institutions whose collapse was judged to threaten the entire financial system.\n\nI am not going to go into detail about the alphabet soup of Fed programs created during this period. But I want to stress that these policies—in some cases improvised in very short order—did succeed in averting a full-blown meltdown. The panic of 2008 subsided.  Increasingly, banks and corporations have been able to raise funds on reasonable terms. Confidence in the financial system is slowly returning.\n\nStill, our brush with financial collapse came at great cost. As financial institutions struggled to survive, they cut back on lending. And private securitization markets seized up entirely. These are markets in which a variety of types of loans, including auto, student, credit card, Small Business Administration, jumbo mortgage, and commercial real estate loans, are packaged as securities and sold to investors. The resulting massive credit crunch caused the economy to nosedive in the final quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. Job losses reached more than 700,000 per month and the unemployment rate skyrocketed to levels not seen since the early 1980s, reaching 9.4 percent in May. Some 6 million jobs vaporized during the recession. Each of these was once held by a real human being, who likely depended on that paycheck to pay the mortgage, buy the groceries, and put gas in the car. The loss of these jobs is an immense tragedy. We should never forget that this awful recession is a flesh-and-blood thing that robs our families, neighbors, and friends of their livelihood.\n\nEarlier I described some of the emergency measures the Fed has taken to prop up the financial system. Now I’d like to talk about the policies we’ve adopted to fight the recession directly. Our policymaking body is called the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC. It consists of the presidents of the Fed’s regional banks, like me, plus the governors of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, including Chairman Ben Bernanke. Traditionally, our main monetary policy tool is the federal funds rate, which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans. We control this rate by pumping cash into the banking system or withdrawing it. This is a powerful tool because the interest banks pay to borrow determines what they charge for loans and ultimately works its way through to the rates businesses and households pay for credit.  This December, we cut the federal funds rate essentially to zero—an extraordinary step on its own—and we’ve said repeatedly that low rates would likely be warranted “for an extended period.” As a result, many other interest rates in the economy are at very low levels. Other major central banks have taken similar steps.\n\nStill, given the depth of the crisis we’ve faced, a near-zero federal funds rate hasn’t been enough to turn the economy around. So we’ve developed a variety of alternative ways to stimulate the economy. For example, we’ve become a major buyer of securities issued by the giant mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a move that has helped push conforming mortgage interest rates to near-record low levels—a support to the housing sector, which is under tremendous duress. In addition, the FOMC launched a program to purchase large quantities of longer-term Treasury debt, to help bring down corporate bond and other rates that are linked to Treasury yields.  In total, the FOMC has committed up to $1.75 trillion—that is, trillion with a “T”—for these asset purchases by the end of this year.\n\nThe Fed and other government bodies have also worked hard to put our banking sector on a more secure footing. The recent stress tests of the 19 largest U.S. banks provided a thorough evaluation of their financial health and capital needs. Since these tests, many banks have raised capital or issued debt without FDIC guarantees—a very encouraging sign.\n\nIn addition, the Fed and Treasury Department jointly developed the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, program to help revive vital securitization markets. Securitization is one of the great financial innovations of the last generation, greatly expanding the market for these loans and reducing their cost compared with the days when banks and other front-line lenders had to keep such credits in their own portfolios. There’s no question that securitization of certain types of loans like subprime mortgages contributed to the crisis. But we must not throw out the baby with the bath water.  Securitization markets will continue to play a major role in our financial system. As I mentioned, in the midst of the financial storm late last year, these markets froze up entirely, with the exception of the market for mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. That made it tough, if not impossible, for ordinary people to borrow to buy a car, pay college tuition, or finance a business. Restoring securitization markets to health is one of the key challenges we face. Our TALF program got off to a slow start, but is now clearly helping to bring rates down and increase the issuance of a wide range of securitized loan products.\n\nWe now come to the present—the third act—in which the economy hopefully recovers.  Right now, we’re like a patient in intensive care whose condition has stabilized and whose fever is just starting to come down. We’re just completing the sixth quarter of recession, but the pace of decline has slowed markedly. The news during the past few months has been encouraging. Even though house prices are continuing to fall in most markets, housing sales and new construction appear to have stabilized. Consumers have recovered some spirit and their spending has also stabilized, thanks in part to government stimulus programs. Payrolls are still shrinking at an awful pace, but the momentum of job losses has slowed considerably in the past two months.\n\nFinancial markets are in much better shape today than we ever would have dreamed six months ago. Investors have gone from disregarding risk, to being paralyzed by it, to once again being willing to take on a reasonable bit. The stock market has rallied and investor appetite for corporate bonds and other assets has rebounded, restoring access to capital for healthy companies. Even so, I am concerned that mortgage rates, which have risen of late, could place a drag on a still very sick housing market, potentially driving home prices still lower and pushing more borrowers into foreclosure. The recent run-up in oil prices may also reflect greater confidence in the global outlook. But it too is troublesome because it impedes recovery by forcing consumers and businesses to pay more for gas and energy, thereby reducing their ability to buy other goods and services.\n\nStill, I expect the recession will end sometime later this year. That would make it the longest and probably deepest downturn since the Great Depression. Growth will come from a variety of sources. One is federal government spending resulting from the stimulus program passed by Congress earlier this year. This package provides tax cuts that leave more cash in consumers’ pockets, as well as direct government spending increases that add to payrolls and boost economic output. But it will take more than fiscal policy to really get the economy moving forward.\n\nFortunately, some sectors are poised to rebound. For example, the auto industry has cut back production so far that inventories have begun to shrink—even in the face of historically weak demand for motor vehicles. As the economy stabilizes, just slowing the pace of this inventory shrinkage will boost gross domestic product, or GDP, which is the nation’s total output of goods and services. This story holds through broad sectors of the economy, where cautious consumers and businesses have cut back on purchases of durable goods, such as computers and appliances. Eventually, old and broken-down goods will need to be replaced, and the resulting demand will add to economic growth.\n\nThe housing sector too will eventually rise from the ashes. Home construction has fallen dramatically over the past few years as the nation works off the massive overbuilding of the boom years. But, once this adjustment is complete, housing construction will need to increase significantly just to keep pace with the growth in the number of households.  Finally, the vicious cycle of tight credit and a weak economy can turn into a virtuous cycle. Once the economy starts growing and jobs and income are increasing, fewer borrowers will default and lenders will be willing to increase the supply of credit.\n\nI don’t like taking the wind out of the sails of our economic expansion, but a few cautionary points should be considered. I expect the pace of the recovery will be frustratingly slow. It’s often the case that growth in the first year after a recession is very rapid. That’s what happened as we came out of a very deep downturn in the early 1980s. Although I sincerely wish we would repeat that performance, I don’t think we will. In past deep recessions, the Fed was able to step on the accelerator by cutting the federal funds rate sharply, causing the economy to shoot ahead. This time, we already have our foot planted firmly on the floor. We can’t take the federal funds rate any lower than zero.  I believe that the Fed’s novel programs are stimulating the flow of credit, but they simply aren’t as powerful levers as large rate cuts, so this time monetary policy alone can’t power a rapid recovery.\n\nHistory also teaches us that it often takes a long time to recover from downturns caused by financial crises. 3 In particular, financial institutions and markets won’t heal overnight.  Our major banks have made excellent progress in establishing the capital buffers needed to continue lending even through a downturn that is more serious than we anticipate. But they are still nursing their wounds and credit will remain tight for some time to come.\n\nI also think that a massive shift in consumer behavior is under way—one that will produce great benefits in the long run but slow our recovery in the short term. 4 American households entered this recession stretched to the limit with mortgage and other debt. The personal saving rate fell from around 8 percent of disposable income two decades ago to almost zero.  Households financed their lifestyles by drawing on increasing stock market and housing wealth, and taking on higher levels of debt. But falling house and stock prices have destroyed trillions of dollars in wealth, cutting off those ready sources of cash. What’s more, the stark realities of this recession have scared many households straight, convincing them that they need to save larger fractions of their incomes. In the long run, higher saving promises to channel resources from consumption to investment, making capital more readily available to retool industry and fix our infrastructure. But, in the here and now, such a rediscovery of thrift means fewer sales at the mall, and fewer jobs on assembly lines and store counters.\n\nA fourth factor that could slow recovery is the unprecedented global nature of the recession. 5 Neither we nor our trading partners can count on a boost from strong foreign demand.  Finally, developments in the labor market suggest it could take several years to return to full employment. During this recession, an unusually high proportion of layoffs have been permanent as opposed to temporary, meaning workers won’t get called back when conditions improve.  Also, we’ve seen an unprecedented level of involuntary part-time work, such as state workers on furlough a few days per month. Those workers are likely to return to full-time status before new workers are hired. To summarize, I expect that we will turn the growth corner sometime later this year, but I am not optimistic that the economy will spring back to normal anytime soon. What’s more, I expect the unemployment rate to remain painfully high for several more years.\n\nThat’s a dreary prediction, but there is also some risk that things could turn out worse.  High on my worry list is the possibility of another shock to the still-fragile financial system. Commercial real estate is a particular danger zone.  Property prices are falling and vacancy rates are rising in many parts of the country.  Given the weak economy, prices could fall more rapidly and developers could face tough times rolling over their loans.  Many banks are heavily exposed to commercial real estate loans.  An increase in defaults could add to their financial stress, prompting them to tighten credit.  The Fed and Treasury are providing loans to investors in securitized commercial mortgages, which should be a big help. But a risk remains of a severe shakeout in this sector.\n\nLet me now turn to an issue that has lately garnered a great deal of attention—inflation.  Just a short time ago, most economists were casting a wary eye on the risk of deflation—that is that prices might drop, perhaps falling into a downward spiral that would squeeze the life out of the economy. Now, though, all I hear about is the danger of an outbreak of high inflation.\n\nI’ll put my cards on the table right away. I think the predominant risk is that inflation will be too low, not too high, over the next several years. I take 2 percent as a reasonable benchmark for the rate of inflation that is most compatible with the Fed’s dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. This is also the figure that a majority of FOMC members cited as their long-run forecast for inflation, according to the minutes of the committee’s April meeting.\n\nFirst of all, this very weak economy is, if anything, putting downward pressure on wages and prices. We have already seen a noticeable slowdown in wage growth and reports of wage cuts have become increasingly prevalent—a sign of the sacrifices that some workers are making to keep their employers afloat and preserve their jobs.  Businesses are also cutting prices and profit margins to boost sales. Core inflation—a measure that excludes volatile food and energy prices—has drifted down below 2 percent.  With unemployment already substantial and likely to rise further, the downward pressure on wages and prices should continue and could intensify.  For these reasons, I expect core inflation will dip to about 1 percent over the next year and remain below 2 percent for several years.\n\nIf the economy fails to recover soon, it is conceivable that this very low inflation could turn into outright deflation. Worse still, if deflation were to intensify, we could find ourselves in a devastating spiral in which prices fall at an ever-faster pace and economic activity sinks more and more.  But I don’t view this as likely. The vigorous policy actions of the Fed and other central banks, combined with sizable fiscal stimulus here and abroad, have sent a clear message that deflation won’t be tolerated. Based on measures of inflation expectations, the public appears confident that the Fed will adopt policies that will maintain a low, positive rate of inflation.  Evidently, the credibility that the Fed and other central banks have built over the past few decades in bringing inflation down has spilled over into a belief that we won’t allow inflation to get too low either. This does not mean that a short episode of deflation couldn’t occur, but it makes a prolonged and devastating deflationary spiral less likely.\n\nNone of what I just said will satisfy those who worry about inflation. Indeed, if you listen to popular business news channels, you might hear a drumbeat of concern that the Fed could let inflation get too high. Those who hold this view point to the rise in Treasury yields and commodity prices this year as signs that runaway inflation is on the horizon.  They muster three arguments. The first is that the Fed has pumped up the money supply and expanded its balance sheet to fund its financial rescue programs, potentially igniting inflation. The second is that the Fed runs the risk of repeating the errors of the 1970s by focusing on mistaken views of economic slack rather than rising prices. The third is that large fiscal budget deficits will create higher inflation. I take all of these concerns very seriously and will address each in turn.\n\nFirst, I’ll talk about the Fed’s balance sheet. As I discussed earlier, the Fed has taken a number of strong steps to avert a financial and economic meltdown, and to support the flow of credit. These policies have caused the assets on the Fed’s balance sheet to more than double, from under $900 billion at the start of the recession to over $2 trillion now.  This expansion is largely financed by increases in bank reserves, that is, surplus cash that banks deposit with us. Some worry that the Fed’s balance sheet expansion is pumping money into the economy and will be inflationary. But, as I will explain in a moment, we have the tools needed to tighten policy and head off future inflation. There is also some concern that the Fed could be trapped by conflicting goals if, at some point, a growing economy requires a higher federal funds rate, before credit markets are fully healed. Finally, some worry that the Fed may lack the political will to tighten policy when the time comes.\n\nI will be the first to say that it is always difficult to get monetary policy just right. But the Fed’s analytical prowess is top-notch and our forecasting record is second to none. The FOMC is committed to price stability and has a solid track record in achieving it. With respect to our tool kit, we certainly have the means to unwind the stimulus when the time is right.  Many of the special programs we developed to provide emergency credit to the financial system are already tapering off as market conditions improve.  Many of the assets that we have accumulated during the crisis, such as Treasury and mortgage-backed agency securities, have ready markets. And the Fed can push up the federal funds rate by raising the rate of interest that we pay to banks on the reserve balances they have on deposit with us—authority that was granted to us by Congress last year.  An increase in the interest rate on reserves will induce banks to lend money to us rather than to other banks and borrowers, thereby pushing up the federal funds rate and other rates charged to private borrowers throughout the economy. The ability to pay interest on reserves is an important tool because, as I mentioned, it’s conceivable that, even if the economy rebounds nicely, the credit crunch might not be fully behind us and some financial markets might still need Fed support. This tool will enable us to tighten credit conditions even though our balance sheet wouldn’t shrink.\n\nLet me turn to the second concern, that we could have a rerun of the stagflation of the 1970s.  Some economists have argued that the Fed misjudged how low the unemployment rate could go without igniting inflation and, as a result, lowered the federal funds rate too far for too long, an overly accommodative stance that contributed to runaway prices. 6 This is an issue we have studied in great depth, looking at a wide range of data sources and using a variety of techniques to estimate slack in labor and product markets. Not surprisingly, these estimates vary.  But they all plainly show that labor and product markets are currently operating well below the levels that would trigger inflation.  We must beware of overconfidence that we have too precise a handle on these questions.  But, to me, the evidence is clear that the economy has substantial slack and we are far from the kinds of unemployment rates that would make inflation a danger.\n\nThe third concern is that big federal budget deficits might eventually be inflationary. In my years of teaching at Berkeley, I regularly lectured on the relationship between fiscal deficits and inflation.  A glance at history shows that many countries with massive structural deficits and without an independent central bank turned to the printing press to pay off their debts. That’s a recipe for high inflation and, in some cases, hyperinflation.\n\nBut I don’t believe the United States faces that threat.  Looking back in history, runaway fiscal deficits have often been accompanied by high inflation. 7 But, since World War II, such a relationship has only held in developing countries. 8 In countries with advanced financial systems and histories of low inflation, no such connection is found.\n\nSo where exactly do the dangers with fiscal deficits lie? To answer that question, it’s important to distinguish between cyclical deficits and long-run or structural deficits.  The recent sharp rise in the federal deficit in large part stems from the government’s appropriate response to a severe recession and financial crisis. These near-term cyclical deficits vastly overstate the problem of ongoing structural deficits.  But the United States does have a large structural budget deficit, and it will remain when the economy finally recovers.  To a great extent, the structural budget gap reflects demographic shifts resulting in an aging population coupled with a chronic escalation in health-care costs.  The issue of rising entitlement and health-care spending is not new. In fact, I spent many of my waking hours grappling with these problems a decade ago when I chaired the Council of Economic Advisers in the Clinton administration.\n\nIt is essential that we come to grips with structural budget deficits, but not because such deficits will cause inflation. It’s because large, sustained structural deficits vacuum up savings that could be put to more productive uses. Once the economy is back on track, these deficits will make capital more expensive for private borrowers, crowding out the investments that are essential to boost productivity and fuel growth in real wages and living standards.\n\nConsider the case of the large deficits in the United States in the 1980s. We did not see a run-up in inflation then. On the contrary, the deficits soared just as inflation was coming down. Those deficits did, however, contribute to higher interest rates, which made education and investment more expensive. Japan provides another example.  Japan has run very large fiscal deficits through much of the past two decades, yet its problem is persistent deflation—precisely the opposite of inflation.\n\nFinally, there’s the matter of whether the Fed’s resolve is firm enough to tighten policy when the time comes to do so. Let me be unequivocal. The Fed is committed to doing everything in its power to foster recovery while maintaining price stability. When it’s necessary to withdraw the extraordinary stimulus we have put in place, we won’t hesitate. The Fed was created as a politically independent central bank, and that tradition is deeply embedded in our culture and practice. We have worked closely with the Treasury and other agencies during this crisis, and it was appropriate to do so. But, in our conduct of monetary policy, we are guided solely by our statutory mandates of maximum employment and price stability. In March, the Treasury Department and the Fed signed an accord reaffirming our independence in setting monetary policy.\n\nIn sum, although I take these concerns about inflation seriously, I do not believe that there is a real threat of high inflation in the current situation. Monetary policy fosters inflation when it loosens financial conditions enough to create excess demand for goods and services.  What could be clearer than the fact that right now we need more demand—not less—to offset the slack in labor and product markets?\n\nIf anything, I’m more concerned that we will be tempted to tighten policy too soon, thereby aborting recovery. That’s just what happened in 1936 when, following two years of robust recovery, the Fed tightened policy because it was worried about large quantities of excess reserves in the banking system. The result?  In 1937, the economy plunged back into a deep recession. 9 Japan too learned that hard lesson in the 1990s, when both monetary and fiscal policies were tightened in the mistaken belief that the economy was rebounding.\n\nThese episodes teach us a valuable lesson that we should heed in the present situation.  Let this not be another 1937, but a time when policymakers have the wisdom and patience to nurse the economy back to health. And, when the economy does come back, let it be built on a foundation of sound private investment and sustainable public policies.  Only then can we be confident that we can escape destructive boom-and-bust cycles and build a more permanent prosperity. Thank you very much.\n\n# # #\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1.

        "content": "\n\nI’m delighted to have this opportunity to help wrap up what has been a fascinating and timely macro-finance research conference. Cataclysmic events, like the current economic and financial crisis, often fundamentally alter the focus—and even the paradigm—for economic research and for monetary policymaking. The Keynesian paradigm, with its activist policy prescriptions, grew out of the pain and suffering of the Great Depression, which dealt a blow to the classical view that markets readily equilibrate. The Great Inflation of the 1970s, in turn, exposed inadequacies in the substance and methodology of Keynesian macroeconometric modeling, and helped usher in the real business cycle research program with its prescription that monetary policy should leave the economy to its own devices and focus mainly on keeping inflation low and stable. Just a decade later, the Great Disinflation of the early 1980s reminded us that monetary policy has real consequences, and a New Keynesian synthesis focused policy on both full employment and price stability, as approximately described by a Taylor rule. During the relatively stable Great Moderation, the quintessence of that synthesis—namely, the DSGE model with nominal rigidities—ascended to the position of reigning macroeconomic orthodoxy. But few things are permanent in our world. The current financial crisis raises questions about the relevance and usefulness of this paradigm too. I’d like to focus today on three of these questions.\n\nThe monetary policy transmission mechanism\n\nThe first has to do with the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. In most models used for monetary policy analysis today, “optimal” policies can be designed for pursuing full employment, and low and stable inflation. While these models allow for various real and nominal rigidities, they treat financial markets as frictionless and efficient. As a consequence, monetary policy affects the economy through a single tool—a short-term interest rate—that transmits itself across credit, equity, derivatives, and foreign exchange markets through arbitrage.\n\nBut, the hand we have been dealt today doesn’t look anything like the textbook ideal that I just described. Instead, we are experiencing pervasive financial market failures with devastating macroeconomic effects. The normal monetary transmission mechanism has been hobbled by dysfunctional money and credit markets. Risk spreads have ballooned on supposedly safe assets like agency debt and mortgage-backed securities (MBS). What does optimal monetary policy look like in this situation? How do we gauge the effectiveness of policy actions, and how can we implement and communicate systematic policy responses under these conditions?\n\nThis question of how to conduct monetary policy when financial markets aren’t working well is illustrated by our large-scale asset purchase program. With the funds rate pinned near zero and spreads on mortgages over Treasuries very elevated, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) embarked on a program of purchases of agency-insured MBS, agency debt, and longer-term Treasury debt totaling $1.75 trillion. This program’s goal is to bring down private borrowing rates and thereby stimulate the economy. In the ideal world of frictionless financial markets, such actions would be ineffective because private investors would simply readjust their portfolios to accommodate changes in the Fed’s portfolio. But, in a world where financial markets are impaired, such balance sheet policies may influence asset prices and the economy.\n\nA market test of these policies came on March 18 when the FOMC’s announcement of an expansion of these purchases was met with an immediate and sharp decline in interest rates on both Treasury securities and agency-backed MBS. Rates on corporate bonds and mortgages came down as well. Similar effects on interest rates were felt in the United Kingdom after the Bank of England announced a program to buy long-term government debt there. Despite these initial successes, there is still a lot we don’t know about the magnitude and duration of the effects of these policies. Our standard monetary policy models do not incorporate financial frictions that lead to asset purchases having real effects. We lack both the data and theory to provide strong guidance on these policies. Truly, we are sailing in uncharted waters, marking our maps with every bit of information along the way.\n\nAsset price bubbles and monetary policy\n\nMy second point concerns asset prices. The role of the house price bubble in precipitating the current financial crisis places new urgency on a long-standing question: Should central banks attempt to deflate asset price bubbles before they grow large enough to cause big problems? Until recently, most central bankers would have said monetary policy should respond to an asset price only to the extent that it will affect the future path of output and inflation. In essence, if you believe that financial markets work well most of the time, then you would be highly reluctant to target asset prices, let alone pop asset price bubbles. But, as I have discussed, we have vivid proof that markets sometimes don’t work, and that the unwinding of a bubble can dramatically harm economic performance and threaten financial stability.\n\nFour main issues define this debate, and the current crisis bears on each of them.1 First, some question whether bubbles even exist. They argue that asset prices reflect the collective wisdom of traders in organized markets who best understand the fundamental factors underlying asset prices. It seems to me that this argument is difficult to defend in light of the poor decisions and widespread dysfunction we have seen in many markets during the current turmoil.\n\nSecond, it’s an open question whether policymakers can identify bubbles in time to act effectively given that our models of underlying fundamentals are imprecise. For example, fundamental values of housing often are estimated by comparing the ratio of house prices to rents with a long-run average.2 This is a rather crude method, and some experts doubted that a bubble existed even when this ratio reached record highs in 2006. That said, by 2005 I think most people understood that—at a minimum—there was a substantial risk that houses were overvalued, although few anticipated that house prices would fall as sharply as they have.3\n\nThird, even if we can identify bubbles as they happen, using monetary policy to address them will reduce our ability to attain other goals, so it makes sense for monetary policy to intervene only if the fallout is likely to be quite severe and difficult to deal with after the fact. For example, fluctuations in equity prices generally affect wealth and consumer demand quite gradually. A central bank may prefer to adjust short-term interest rates after the bubble bursts to counter the depressing effects on demand. The tech stock bubble seems to fit this mold. Still, some bursting bubbles are more virulent than others. It may be that credit booms, such as the one that spurred recent house price and bond price increases, hold more dangerous systemic risks than other asset bubbles. By their nature, credit booms are especially prone to generating powerful adverse feedback loops between financial markets and real economic activity.4 If all asset bubbles are not created equal, policymakers could decide to intervene in those cases that seem especially dangerous.\n\nFourth, if a dangerous asset price bubble is detected and action to rein it in is warranted, is conventional monetary policy the best tool to use? Going forward, I am hopeful that capital standards and other tools of macroprudential supervision will be deployed to modulate destructive boom-bust cycles, thereby easing the burden on monetary policy.5 However, I now think that, in certain circumstances, the answer as to whether monetary policy should play a role may be a qualified yes. In the current episode, higher short-term interest rates probably would have restrained the demand for housing by raising mortgage interest rates, and this might have slowed the pace of house price increases. In addition, tighter monetary policy may be associated with reduced leverage and slower credit growth, especially in securitized markets.6 Thus, monetary policy that leans against bubble expansion may also enhance financial stability by slowing credit booms and lowering overall leverage.\n\nCertainly there are pitfalls to trying to deflate bubbles. At the same time, policymakers often must act on the basis of incomplete knowledge, and it is now patently obvious that not dealing with some bubbles can have grave consequences. I would not advocate making it a regular practice to lean against asset price bubbles. But, in my view, recent painful experience strengthens the case for using such policies, especially when a credit boom is the driving factor.\n\nThe inflation objective and the zero bound\n\nFinally, I will turn to the question of the appropriate long-run inflation objective—that is, the rate that best promotes the dual goals of maximum sustainable employment and price stability. This is a topic that the FOMC has discussed on numerous occasions during my tenure as a governor and as president of the San Francisco Fed. In the past, I had spoken in favor of a 1½ percent rate of PCE price inflation. In my view, though, recent events provide reason to reexamine this critical subject.\n\nThe choice of an appropriate inflation objective depends on an evaluation of the costs and benefits of very low inflation. The financial crisis and global recession have not qualitatively changed these costs and benefits, but they may affect their quantitative evaluation, which in turn might influence how policymakers view their inflation objectives. The benefits of low and stable inflation are abundantly clear to this audience and have not changed in any material way because of the recession. On the cost side, the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates is a critical concern. Japan’s experience with deflation starting in the 1990s generated a large body of research on monetary policy strategy that takes account of the zero lower bound.7 Researchers emphasize the benefits of aggressively cutting rates when the prospect of reaching the zero bound emerges, and of using clear communication about the central bank’s future policy intentions and its long-run inflation goals. The FOMC took this research to heart during the deflation scare of the early 2000s and the current crisis.\n\nOne conclusion of the research is that, even if monetary policy acts appropriately, an inflation objective of 1 percent or lower entails some costs in terms of stabilizing output, but the impact on average macroeconomic performance at higher inflation objectives is minimal.8 However, I have not found the experience of the past several years at all reassuring on this point. We have had two deflation scares and a severe global recession in a span of seven years, with several major central banks now confronting the zero bound. Of course, this may simply reflect very bad luck that is unlikely to be repeated. But, a number of considerations make me hesitant to endorse this view. Indeed, concern about the ability of the Fed to support employment following large negative shocks may explain why most FOMC members now judge a PCE inflation rate of 2 percent to be most consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate.\n\nCalculations of the effects of the zero bound depend crucially on assumptions regarding the magnitude of disturbances that hit the economy, the level of the natural rate of interest, and the behavior of the rest of the global economy. Recent experience raises the possibility that the Great Moderation is behind us, so we must be prepared for substantial shocks. Thus, an analysis of the zero bound needs to incorporate greater volatility than experienced over the past quarter century. With respect to the equilibrium real interest rate, the global savings glut that helped restrain real interest rates may persist or even intensify after the recession is over, leaving us with only a small cushion against reaching the zero bound. And, the theory that the global economy was decoupled did not hold up in the current recession. This has weakened the transmission of monetary policy by short-circuiting the exchange rate channel in any one country. When all other countries are in recession and cutting rates, it is harder to stabilize the economy and avoid deflation.\n\nFinally, the Fed’s experience with nontraditional monetary policy tools cuts two ways in analyzing the effectiveness of monetary policy near the zero bound. On the one hand, the apparent success of the Fed’s longer-term asset purchases and broader credit easing programs in lowering borrowing costs and stimulating spending suggests that the zero bound problem may not be as costly as previously thought. On the other hand, the deployment of these new policy tools comes with its own set of risks and costs. In particular, we do not yet have good estimates of the quantitative impact of such interventions. In addition, the use of nonstandard monetary policy instruments necessarily brings with it the uncertainty and risks of unintended consequences. For example, some observers worry that the ballooning of the Fed’s balance sheet may raise inflation because the Fed may face political and technical challenges when it tries to unwind these policies—especially if the recession ends before the need for support of the financial markets fades.9 While I have not found these arguments convincing so far, the recent rise in Treasury rates, if it is reflective of such concerns, is disconcerting.\n\nClearly, the events and monetary policy dilemmas of the past two years have laid before us an urgent and compelling research agenda. We simply must understand better—and ultimately develop reliable models of—the extraordinary financial and macro linkages that produced the current crisis. In addition, we need to more fully evaluate the costs and benefits of nonstandard monetary policy actions. I’ll close with an encouraging note. As the papers at this conference attest, researchers in the academic and policy worlds are rising to the occasion. These are vitally important tasks and I’m glad to see so many of my colleagues rolling up their sleeves.\n\n# # #\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1. Glenn D.

        "content": "\n\n\n\nIt is a great pleasure to speak to this audience of distinguished Australian business economists. While you are having your breakfast, we here in San Francisco are more than half way through our business day, although that day is yesterday for you. My topic is the U.S. economy—where we stand, where we’re going, and what the Federal Reserve and the federal government are doing to restore growth. A few years ago, there was much talk of “decoupling,” meaning that what happened in the United States didn’t matter so much to the rest of the world. Now—after we’ve seen the bursting of housing and credit bubbles in the United States trigger the deepest worldwide recession since the Great Depression—we know that theory was wrong. The state of the U.S. economy matters very much in Singapore, Santiago and, of course, in Sydney.\n\nI think the most useful thing I can do today is to give you my views on the current economic situation and then examine some key issues that will shape the course of the economy as we try to dig out from a very deep hole. The story I’m going to tell involves many crosscurrents and uncertainties. This murky picture may actually be good news. I’ve spent the last year or so being so downbeat that I could actually see the faces in my audiences sink as I spoke. The fact that I can now talk about crosscurrents may mean that the economy is reaching an inflection point. It’s too soon for me to be convinced of that, and I see a lot of downside risk, but at least there is some basis for optimism. That said, I expect the recovery, whenever it does begin, to be quite gradual compared with those following previous deep recessions. As always, my comments represent my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe recession is now in its sixth quarter and it’s shaping up as the most severe downturn since the Great Depression. Last week we found out that real GDP contracted at an annual rate of slightly more than 6 percent in the first quarter, according to the Commerce Department’s advance estimate. That is about the same pace of decline registered in the final quarter of last year. These are the largest consecutive declines in real GDP since 1958. The recession is also very broad-based. Housing, business fixed investment, exports, and imports are all falling at eye-popping rates—down more than 30 percent each. The one sector that held up surprisingly well in the first quarter is the largest—consumer spending—which rose by a respectable 2¼ percent.\n\nWhether this is a harbinger of good things to come is uncertain, in part because, after adjusting for inflation, consumption slowed over the months of the quarter and declined absolutely in March. Still, it does offer a glimmer of hope. In addition, business inventories fell by a very large amount in the first quarter. That too is a positive signal. When spending contracted last year, inventories ballooned relative to sales and firms have been struggling to bring them into better alignment. The first-quarter data suggest that the necessary inventory correction may be quite far along. Recent data also offer some hints of stabilization in the housing sector. Home construction contracted sharply in the first quarter as a whole, but we saw signs of improvement late in the period. In the past couple of months, home sales and housing starts have leveled off. Meanwhile, depending on the index, home prices have either increased slightly or fallen at a slower pace.\n\nWhile output is at least showing potential for improvement going forward, recent news from the labor market is still very weak. The unemployment rate has risen by 1.7 percentage points over the past four months and, as bad as that is, I think it actually understates the true magnitude of the labor market deterioration. For one thing, the incidence of permanent, as opposed to temporary, layoffs is unusually high compared with past downturns. In addition, involuntary part-time work has increased during this recession far more than we would expect relative to the rise in unemployment. My business contacts tell me, and the data confirm, that the use of furloughs is now widespread. The result is that nationally, we have seen a surge in part-time work for economic reasons occurring broadly across occupations. The underemployment rate, a broad measure that adds individuals working part time for economic reasons to the unemployed, now stands at 14¼ percent. This is a whopping 6½ percentage points higher than at the start of the recession, nearly twice the increase in the standard unemployment rate.\n\nLooking forward, my personal forecast for output growth is similar to the Blue Chip consensus. I believe the most likely scenario is that real GDP will advance at a low, but positive, rate in the second half of this year followed by trend-like growth in 2010. A forecast that the economy will soon switch from contraction to expansion strikes some people as optimistic. But, it takes less than you might think for real GDP growth rates to turn positive. Positive growth becomes likely if some of the economy’s weak sectors stop dragging down GDP going forward. Residential construction in particular has been declining for several years, subtracting about 1 percentage point from real GDP growth. This spending can sink only so far, and, as I said, we’ve seen some tentative signs of stabilization recently. If housing starts level out, the sector would no longer weigh down the economy and faster growth would ensue. Similarly, as I noted earlier, inventory liquidation has been unusually severe in recent months, especially in motor vehicles. A reduction in the pace of liquidation also would raise the GDP growth rate. Finally, if consumers become more confident—and there is evidence from surveys that they have recently—pent-up demand actually could boost spending on autos, durable goods, and even housing, providing some real “juice” to economic growth.\n\nOf course, monetary and fiscal policy are also sharply focused on promoting economic recovery. On the monetary side, the Federal Reserve has pushed its traditional policy lever—the federal funds rate—close to zero. And we haven’t stopped there. We have put in place an array of unconventional approaches to spur the flow of credit to households and businesses. These include measures to improve liquidity and financial market functioning, and facilities to support the issuance of asset-backed securities. Moreover, we are undertaking large-scale purchases of Treasury and agency-related debt. These initiatives appear to be lowering longer-term interest rates and easing financial conditions more generally. Mortgage and other private borrowing rates have fallen, and, as those who’ve been bold enough to open their 401(k) statements again will attest, stock prices have risen: they’re up around 35 percent from the lows reached in March. We’ve also seen improvements in key measures of financial market functioning, such as spreads of Libor over the expected federal funds rate. On the fiscal side, the stimulus package passed by Congress in February will provide an important economic shot in the arm. While the program does not appear large enough to solve the economy’s problems on its own, the support it will provide to aggregate demand is significant and helpful. We will likely begin seeing its effects on the economy this quarter.\n\nSo, to summarize, I am hopeful that the recession will end in the second half of this year due to aggressive monetary and fiscal policies, and the operation of typical business cycle mechanisms, such as inventory dynamics. Unfortunately, this combination of ingredients is not a recipe for a resounding rebound. My forecast that output growth will turn positive in 2009 and proceed near trend in 2010 implies that the unemployment rate will rise from 8½ percent now to around 9½ percent by the end of this year, and remain at about that level through 2010. An implication is that inflation is likely to decline below the 2 percent pace that I and most of my colleagues consider most consistent with our congressional mandate to strive for full employment and price stability. Substantial slack in labor and product markets combined with lower commodity prices is already restraining overall price increases for goods and services. If, as seems likely, this downward pressure continues, core consumer inflation is apt to fall from about 2 percent last year to around 1½ percent this year, and go even lower in 2010. I’ll have more to say about inflation later.\n\nThe forecast I just described implies that I am not in the ranks of those who believe that “V” is the letter that will best describe the economy’s trajectory going forward. Those who anticipate a V-shaped recovery argue that growth in the first year after a business-cycle trough has typically been very rapid in previous U.S. downturns, including the deep recession that occurred in 1981 and 82. My own forecast, in contrast, implies a far less robust recovery. In my view, the explanation for the V-shaped pattern typical of past recessions relates to monetary policy. Most deep recessions in the postwar era happened after the Fed tightened policy to fight inflation. Once the inflation scare passed, the central bank was able to cut its policy rate sharply, and the economy snapped back. But, of course, the current recession is far different, having been triggered by a historic housing bust, and a banking and financial crisis. Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff have compared recessions around the world and shown that it takes a long time to recover from downturns caused by financial crises.2 And that is what I expect this time as well.\n\nI can point to a number of specific factors in this recession that are likely to weaken recovery. First, despite signs that consumer spending is stabilizing, the chance of strong and sustained consumption growth appears low. For years prior to the recession, households went on a spending spree of major proportions. This occurred during what has come to be called the “great moderation,” a period of about two decades when recessions were infrequent and mild, and inflation was low and stable. This may have lulled households into a false sense of security. The personal saving rate fell from around 8 percent two decades ago to almost zero in recent years as households financed their lifestyles by drawing on increasing stock market and housing wealth, and taking on higher levels of debt.\n\nNow, the era of such low saving may be over. Falling house and stock prices have vaporized trillions of dollars in household wealth. The destruction of their nest eggs is prompting households to rebuild savings. The deleveraging of household balance sheets could restrain spending for years. Indeed, the personal saving rate is finally on the rise, averaging more than 4 percent so far this year. It wouldn’t surprise me if this effect persists, as the shock of the financial crisis convinces many households that they need to save higher fractions of their incomes for the long term. Of course, ultimately this would be good for economic growth, channeling resources from consumption to investment. That said, the transition could be painful if subpar consumption growth restrains the pace of economic recovery.\n\nMeanwhile, the story for banks and other financial firms is eerily similar. In the buildup to the recession, financial institutions, like consumers, became highly leveraged. Their vulnerability was compounded because they often invested in complex and risky assets that were funded with short-term debt. Since the crisis hit, in an attempt to increase the soundness of their individual balance sheets, banks have tightened lending standards, trying to improve credit quality at the same time that rising unemployment and falling house prices have led to more credit losses. The attempts by banks to cut back the volume of their assets to reduce leverage and conserve capital, combined with a breakdown in the flow of lending through securitization, has constricted the provision of credit in the economy. One important purpose of the stress tests, now nearing completion by banking regulators, is to ensure that our largest banking organizations establish capital buffers that are large enough for them to withstand losses, while continuing to provide credit to households and businesses, even if the recession turns out to be significantly worse than currently anticipated. Such lending is critical to recovery.\n\nThe challenges facing monetary policy makers are another factor that makes a strong recovery uncertain. With the federal funds rate essentially at zero, the Fed’s traditional policy tool has reached its maximum degree of accommodation. Many versions of the Taylor rule, a well-known policy benchmark, indicate that we ought to lower the funds rate well below this zero bound, if such a thing were possible. As I noted, the Fed has turned to unconventional policy tools. Through a variety of programs, the Fed has augmented the flow of credit to the economy, provided a reliable source of liquidity to the financial system, and helped prevent the failure of systemically important depository and nondepository institutions. Most of the action recently has involved boosting credit flows through large-scale asset purchases. To support the housing sector, the Fed announced last November that it would start buying agency-insured mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and agency debt. In March, this program was expanded substantially. In addition, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) launched a new program to purchase large quantities of longer-term Treasury debt. These asset purchases have the potential to stimulate aggregate demand through a number of channels, most obviously by reducing yields on securities included in the program. Indeed, when the FOMC announced in March that the Fed would expand these purchases, interest rates declined on both Treasury securities and agency-backed MBS. Still, even though these programs appear to be having a useful effect, we have little experience with them and the magnitude of their impact is uncertain. In other words, it is difficult to tell if unconventional monetary policies will be as effective in promoting recovery as easing the funds rate has been in the past.\n\nFinally, the global nature of the recession is likely to hold back the pace of our recovery. We haven’t seen anything like this global downturn since the Great Depression. Virtually all advanced economies and many emerging economies are in recession. Financial systems around the globe are under stress, housing markets in some countries have collapsed, and trade has shriveled. The International Monetary Fund recently forecast that the global economy would recover very gradually. This makes sense. As I said, recessions caused by financial crises are generally followed by more measured upswings. In addition, when recessions occur in many regions simultaneously, recoveries are slower than when downturns are confined to just a few countries.3 Now we have a double whammy—a highly synchronized global recession and a financial crisis. That’s a daunting combination.\n\nFor all of these reasons—the need for balance sheet repair by households and financial firms, uncertainties about unconventional monetary policy tools, and the global nature of the recession—I expect the U.S. recovery to be frustratingly tepid once it does get started. It likely will take several more years to bring unemployment back to its long-run equilibrium value.\n\nAs we think about the course of the economy, we must also be wary of developments that could derail recovery. I see the economy as vulnerable to a number of downside risks, including the possibility of another disruptive financial event—another “shoe” dropping, if you will. Commercial real estate is an area that seems vulnerable. Nonresidential construction declined sharply in the first quarter as business activity slowed; new buildings came on line; vacancy rates on office, industrial, and retail space rose; and property values fell. For developers, financing is extremely hard to get. The market for commercial MBS has all but dried up and banks are tightening lending standards. Many developers will have trouble rolling over debt when it comes due. Banks—especially community banks—are major lenders to this sector and are vulnerable to losses.\n\nWe must also keep an eye on developing nations, which face stark challenges as markets for their products shrink and capital inflows dry up. Emerging market defaults could trigger further financial turmoil. The downturn in eastern Europe poses especially significant financial risks to western European banks, whose exposure amounts to an estimated $1.5 trillion. With confidence in the global financial system already fragile, these problems easily could spill over to the United States.\n\nAnother risk I’d like to discuss is inflation—or perhaps I should say deflation. This is an extraordinary time when you can hear a warning about inflation from one quarter and a dire prediction of deflation from another quarter. I hear from both sides, though more often from those worried about inflation. Concerns about an inflationary surge focus on the expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet, which has increased from under $900 billion in mid-2007 to over $2 trillion now, largely financed by increases in bank reserves. The inflation worriers may be focused on these excess reserves as a potential source of inflation down the road. Their fears are compounded because federal budget deficits are ballooning. While I understand that the combination of Fed expansion and big federal budget deficits might seem scary, I don’t see a surge in inflation as very likely. Expansionary monetary policy creates inflation by loosening financial conditions enough to create excess demand for goods and services. That’s obviously not the problem we face now. In spite of the Fed’s best efforts to enhance the flow of credit, financial conditions, while somewhat improved, overall remain abnormally tight. In our current recession, we need more demand—not less—to offset the slack in labor and product markets.\n\nThat said, in theory there’s one way inflation could rise before the economy recovers from the recession: inflation expectations might increase because of fears that the Fed will not shift gears quickly enough when the recession and credit crunch are over. Some people have argued that the Fed might find it politically difficult to stop lending to the private sector borrowers it has supported during the crisis.4 I don’t find this argument persuasive and I don’t see evidence that the broad public finds it convincing either. The Fed has accumulated considerable anti-inflation credibility over the past 25 years or so.5 This credibility was evident a few years ago when prices for energy, food, and other commodities soared to historically high levels. While the direct effects of those price increases showed up in headline consumer inflation, very little was passed through to core inflation. Right now, there’s little evidence that inflation expectations have deteriorated. Market indicators and survey measures of longer-run expectations have been quite stable.\n\nOf course, the inflation worriers are correct in an important respect: The Federal Reserve will need to remove monetary accommodation once the credit crunch eases, private spending revives, and the economy picks up steam. If the Fed were to fail to tighten the stance of monetary policy quickly enough, we would see higher inflation. But I want to assure you that the Fed is well aware of this danger and is readying the tools even now. Most importantly, the Fed is committed to maintaining price stability and, when the time to remove accommodation comes, we have a number of tools in our kit bag that could be quite effective.\n\nThe simplest approach—the one that we have used traditionally—would be to shrink our balance sheet by selling the Treasuries, agency debt, and agency MBS we accumulated during the crisis. Many of the special liquidity and credit facilities we have developed will be phased out as financial markets recover. But it is conceivable that, even with the economy rebounding nicely, the credit crunch might not be fully behind us and some financial markets might still need Fed support. In this case, we could increase the interest rate we pay on bank reserves. This would induce banks to remove funds from the federal funds market and lend them to us, thereby increasing the federal funds rate and longer-term interest rates that are more relevant to private borrowers. Importantly, this approach provides us with the flexibility to tighten monetary policy in response to an improving macroeconomic picture without shrinking the size of our balance sheet or our support to financial markets. It is the main method employed by many central banks to influence financial conditions. An alternative approach that could accomplish the same goal, and perhaps do it better, would be something completely new for the Federal Reserve—that’s to issue interest-bearing debt broadly to private investors. Let’s call this debt Fed bills. Congress would have to authorize this, but it too is a tool available to many central banks. The sale of Fed bills would reduce the reserves of the banking system, as in a typical contractionary open-market operation. As with interest on reserves, we could accomplish a tightening of policy while maintaining our support of credit markets. But Fed bills would have an advantage over interest on reserves. The loans to the Fed would come from investors throughout the economy, not just from banks. At a time when we need banks to lend to the private sector to fight a credit crunch, this is a decided plus.\n\nAs you can tell, I’m quite skeptical about the risk of higher inflation. My thoughts about the possibility of deflation are more complex. At first blush, there is cause for concern. We are starting from a situation where core inflation is already a bit below 2 percent. The economy has a great deal of slack and unemployment is likely to rise further, which would put more downward pressure on wage growth and inflation. Indeed, we have already seen evidence that wages are rising less rapidly and there have been some outright wage cuts. Furthermore, as I noted, with the funds rate at the zero bound, monetary policy has been forced to ease its stance through unconventional instruments that are hardly tried and true. If deflation were to occur with the funds rate near zero, the effects could be severe. In the textbook case, with no way of lowering the nominal funds rate, real interest rates would rise as prices fell. That could drive the economy into a spiral of larger and larger price decreases, with economic activity sinking more and more.\n\nThe risk of such a deflationary spiral depends crucially on the nature of inflation expectations.6 If expectations are unanchored, meaning that people have variable expectations depending on the recent behavior of inflation, then the lower inflation that’s characteristic of recessions can convince them that inflation will go still lower in the future. If a recession is severe and long enough, this process eventually will cause prices to fall, and then create a downward spiral. But I don’t think this is a likely scenario in the United States. I believe that inflation expectations are well anchored, in the sense that people expect inflation to be consistent with the Feds’ goals and policies. Based on measures of inflation expectations, people appear to think we will take policy actions that will maintain a positive rate of inflation. This expectation acts as a buttress holding inflation up. This does not mean that a short episode of deflation couldn’t occur, but it does help to avoid a prolonged deflationary spiral.\n\nTo reinforce our commitment to price stability, the FOMC recently began releasing long-run inflation forecasts based on the assumption of appropriate monetary policy. These figures, which indicate where FOMC members would like inflation to settle in the longer run, show, as I mentioned, a consensus of 2 percent for consumer inflation.7 Such words, backed by appropriate actions, help keep inflation expectations well anchored and reduce the chances of a deflationary spiral. So, for me the bottom line is this: I see little basis to worry that we will develop an inflation problem. There is more of a reason to think that we could experience some deflation, but the chances of a severe bout of that ailment seem remote.\n\nYou may have gotten a case of whiplash hearing me say that, although conditions are poor, some hopeful signs are visible, but significant risks remain. Your necks may not have felt any better when I said that I hear worries about inflation and deflation at the same time. However, that’s the situation we find ourselves in now. The good news is that, for the first time in a while, there is some good news to savor. But, when it comes to assessing the future of the economy, the dominant theme is uncertainty. The one thing that is sure is that policymakers around the globe are working hard to restore economic growth. As for the Federal Reserve, it remains fully committed to doing everything in its power to foster recovery while maintaining price stability.\n\n# # #\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1.

I spent almost 25 rewarding years of my professional life as a faculty member here. And I will always think of the Haas and broader Berkeley communities with great fondness. Now, of course, I am with the Federal Reserve, and that’s another institution that means a great deal to me because it’s a place where many of the ideas and issues that were central to both my teaching and research here at Haas are translated into real-world policy. The decisions we make at the Fed have taken on added significance with the nation and most of the world going through a deep and worrisome recession, one that has caused millions of people to lose their jobs or homes, and threatened or destroyed businesses large and small.\n\nI think the most useful thing I can do tonight is to give you my views on the current economic situation and then examine some key issues that will shape the course of the economy as we try to dig out from a very deep hole. The story I’m going to tell involves many crosscurrents and uncertainties. This murky picture may actually be good news. I’ve spent the last year or so being so downbeat that I could actually see the faces in my audiences sink as I spoke. The fact that I can now talk about crosscurrents may mean that the economy is reaching an inflection point. It’s too soon for me to be convinced of that, and I see a lot of downside risk, but at least there is some basis for optimism. That said, I expect the recovery, whenever it does begin, to be quite gradual compared with those following previous deep recessions. As always, my comments represent my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe recession is now in its sixth quarter and it’s shaping up as the most severe downturn since the Great Depression. Last week we found out that real GDP contracted at an annual rate of slightly more than 6 percent in the first quarter, according to the Commerce Department’s advance estimate. That is about the same pace of decline registered in the final quarter of last year. These are the largest consecutive declines in real GDP since 1958. The recession is also very broad-based. Housing, business fixed investment, exports, and imports are all falling at eye-popping rates—down more than 30 percent each. The one sector that held up surprisingly well in the first quarter is the largest—consumer spending—which rose by a respectable 2¼ percent.\n\nWhether this is a harbinger of good things to come is uncertain, in part because, after adjusting for inflation, consumption slowed over the months of the quarter and declined absolutely in March. Still, it does offer a glimmer of hope. In addition, business inventories fell by a very large amount in the first quarter. That too is a positive signal. When spending contracted last year, inventories ballooned relative to sales and firms have been struggling to bring them into better alignment. The first-quarter data suggest that the necessary inventory correction may be quite far along. Recent data also offer some hints of stabilization in the housing sector. Home construction contracted sharply in the first quarter as a whole, but we saw signs of improvement late in the period. In the past couple of months, home sales and housing starts have leveled off. Meanwhile, depending on the index, home prices have either increased slightly or fallen at a slower pace.\n\nWhile output is at least showing potential for improvement going forward, recent news from the labor market is still very weak. The unemployment rate has risen by 1.7 percentage points over the past four months and, as bad as that is, I think it actually understates the true magnitude of the labor market deterioration. For one thing, the incidence of permanent, as opposed to temporary, layoffs is unusually high compared with past downturns. In addition, involuntary part-time work has increased during this recession far more than we would expect relative to the rise in unemployment. My business contacts tell me, and the data confirm, that the use of furloughs is now widespread. I know that they are under consideration here at Berkeley as a way to address the budget crunch. The result is that nationally, we have seen a surge in part-time work for economic reasons occurring broadly across occupations. The underemployment rate, a broad measure that adds individuals working part time for economic reasons to the unemployed, now stands at 14¼ percent. This is a whopping 6½ percentage points higher than at the start of the recession, nearly twice the increase in the standard unemployment rate.\n\nLooking forward, my personal forecast for output growth is similar to the Blue Chip consensus. I believe the most likely scenario is that real GDP will advance at a low, but positive, rate in the second half of this year followed by trend-like growth in 2010. A forecast that the economy will soon switch from contraction to expansion strikes some people as optimistic. But, it takes less than you might think for real GDP growth rates to turn positive. Positive growth becomes likely if some of the economy’s weak sectors stop dragging down GDP going forward. Residential construction in particular has been declining for several years, subtracting about 1 percentage point from real GDP growth. This spending can sink only so far, and, as I said, we’ve seen some tentative signs of stabilization recently. If housing starts level out, the sector would no longer weigh down the economy and faster growth would ensue. Similarly, as I noted earlier, inventory liquidation has been unusually severe in recent months, especially in motor vehicles. A reduction in the pace of liquidation also would raise the GDP growth rate. Finally, if consumers become more confident—and there is evidence from surveys that they have recently—pent-up demand actually could boost spending on autos, durable goods, and even housing, providing some real “juice” to economic growth.\n\nOf course, monetary and fiscal policy are also sharply focused on promoting economic recovery. On the monetary side, the Federal Reserve has pushed its traditional policy lever—the federal funds rate—close to zero. And we haven’t stopped there. We have put in place an array of unconventional approaches to spur the flow of credit to households and businesses. These include measures to improve liquidity and financial market functioning, and facilities to support the issuance of asset-backed securities. Moreover, we are undertaking large-scale purchases of Treasury and agency-related debt. These initiatives appear to be lowering longer-term interest rates and easing financial conditions more generally. Mortgage and other private borrowing rates have fallen, and, as those who’ve been bold enough to open their 401(k) statements again will attest, stock prices have risen: they’re up around 35 percent from the lows reached in March. We’ve also seen improvements in key measures of financial market functioning, such as spreads of Libor over the expected federal funds rate. On the fiscal side, the stimulus package passed by Congress in February will provide an important economic shot in the arm. While the program does not appear large enough to solve the economy’s problems on its own, the support it will provide to aggregate demand is significant and helpful. We will likely begin seeing its effects on the economy this quarter.\n\nSo, to summarize, I am hopeful that the recession will end in the second half of this year due to aggressive monetary and fiscal policies, and the operation of typical business cycle mechanisms, such as inventory dynamics. Unfortunately, this combination of ingredients is not a recipe for a resounding rebound. My forecast that output growth will turn positive in 2009 and proceed near trend in 2010 implies that the unemployment rate will rise from 8½ percent now to around 9½ percent by the end of this year, and remain at about that level through 2010. An implication is that inflation is likely to decline below the 2 percent pace that I and most of my colleagues consider most consistent with our congressional mandate to strive for full employment and price stability. Substantial slack in labor and product markets combined with lower commodity prices is already restraining overall price increases for goods and services. If, as seems likely, this downward pressure continues, core consumer inflation is apt to fall from about 2 percent last year to around 1½ percent this year, and go even lower in 2010. I’ll have more to say about inflation later.\n\nThe forecast I just described implies that I am not in the ranks of those who believe that “V” is the letter that will best describe the economy’s trajectory going forward. Those who anticipate a V-shaped recovery argue that growth in the first year after a business-cycle trough has typically been very rapid in previous U.S. downturns, including the deep recession that occurred in 1981 and 82. My own forecast, in contrast, implies a far less robust recovery. In my view, the explanation for the V-shaped pattern typical of past recessions relates to monetary policy. Most deep recessions in the postwar era happened after the Fed tightened policy to fight inflation. Once the inflation scare passed, the central bank was able to cut its policy rate sharply, and the economy snapped back. But, of course, the current recession is far different, having been triggered by a historic housing bust, and a banking and financial crisis. Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff have compared recessions around the world and shown that it takes a long time to recover from downturns caused by financial crises.2 And that is what I expect this time as well.\n\nI can point to a number of specific factors in this recession that are likely to weaken recovery. First, despite signs that consumer spending is stabilizing, the chance of strong and sustained consumption growth appears low. For years prior to the recession, households went on a spending spree of major proportions. This occurred during what has come to be called the “great moderation,” a period of about two decades when recessions were infrequent and mild, and inflation was low and stable. This may have lulled households into a false sense of security. The personal saving rate fell from around 8 percent two decades ago to almost zero in recent years as households financed their lifestyles by drawing on increasing stock market and housing wealth, and taking on higher levels of debt.\n\nNow, the era of such low saving may be over. Falling house and stock prices have vaporized trillions of dollars in household wealth. The destruction of their nest eggs is prompting households to rebuild savings. The deleveraging of household balance sheets could restrain spending for years. Indeed, the personal saving rate is finally on the rise, averaging more than 4 percent so far this year. It wouldn’t surprise me if this effect persists, as the shock of the financial crisis convinces many households that they need to save higher fractions of their incomes for the long term. Of course, ultimately this would be good for economic growth, channeling resources from consumption to investment. That said, the transition could be painful if subpar consumption growth restrains the pace of economic recovery.\n\nMeanwhile, the story for banks and other financial firms is eerily similar. In the buildup to the recession, financial institutions, like consumers, became highly leveraged. Their vulnerability was compounded because they often invested in complex and risky assets that were funded with short-term debt. Since the crisis hit, in an attempt to increase the soundness of their individual balance sheets, banks have tightened lending standards, trying to improve credit quality at the same time that rising unemployment and falling house prices have led to more credit losses. The attempts by banks to cut back the volume of their assets to reduce leverage and conserve capital, combined with a breakdown in the flow of lending through securitization, has constricted the provision of credit in the economy. One important purpose of the stress tests, now nearing completion by banking regulators, is to ensure that our largest banking organizations establish capital buffers that are large enough for them to withstand losses, while continuing to provide credit to households and businesses, even if the recession turns out to be significantly worse than currently anticipated. Such lending is critical to recovery.\n\nThe challenges facing monetary policy makers are another factor that makes a strong recovery uncertain. With the federal funds rate essentially at zero, the Fed’s traditional policy tool has reached its maximum degree of accommodation. Many versions of the Taylor rule, a well-known policy benchmark, indicate that we ought to lower the funds rate well below this zero bound, if such a thing were possible. As I noted, the Fed has turned to unconventional policy tools. Through a variety of programs, the Fed has augmented the flow of credit to the economy, provided a reliable source of liquidity to the financial system, and helped prevent the failure of systemically important depository and nondepository institutions. Most of the action recently has involved boosting credit flows through large-scale asset purchases. To support the housing sector, the Fed announced last November that it would start buying agency-insured mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and agency debt. In March, this program was expanded substantially. In addition, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) launched a new program to purchase large quantities of longer-term Treasury debt. These asset purchases have the potential to stimulate aggregate demand through a number of channels, most obviously by reducing yields on securities included in the program. Indeed, when the FOMC announced in March that the Fed would expand these purchases, interest rates declined on both Treasury securities and agency-backed MBS. Still, even though these programs appear to be having a useful effect, we have little experience with them and the magnitude of their impact is uncertain. In other words, it is difficult to tell if unconventional monetary policies will be as effective in promoting recovery as easing the funds rate has been in the past.\n\nFinally, the global nature of the recession is likely to hold back the pace of our recovery. We haven’t seen anything like this global downturn since the Great Depression. Virtually all advanced economies and many emerging economies are in recession. Financial systems around the globe are under stress, housing markets in some countries have collapsed, and trade has shriveled. The International Monetary Fund recently forecast that the global economy would recover very gradually. This makes sense. As I said, recessions caused by financial crises are generally followed by more measured upswings. In addition, when recessions occur in many regions simultaneously, recoveries are slower than when downturns are confined to just a few countries.3 Now we have a double whammy—a highly synchronized global recession and a financial crisis. That’s a daunting combination.\n\nFor all of these reasons—the need for balance sheet repair by households and financial firms, uncertainties about unconventional monetary policy tools, and the global nature of the recession—I expect the U.S. recovery to be frustratingly tepid once it does get started. It likely will take several more years to bring unemployment back to its long-run equilibrium value.\n\nAs we think about the course of the economy, we must also be wary of developments that could derail recovery.

With confidence in the global financial system already fragile, these problems easily could spill over to the United States.\n\nAnother risk I’d like to discuss is inflation—or perhaps I should say deflation. This is an extraordinary time when you can hear a warning about inflation from one quarter and a dire prediction of deflation from another quarter. I hear from both sides, though more often from those worried about inflation.

Furthermore, as I noted, with the funds rate at the zero bound, monetary policy has been forced to ease its stance through unconventional instruments that are hardly tried and true. If deflation were to occur with the funds rate near zero, the effects could be severe. In the textbook case, with no way of lowering the nominal funds rate, real interest rates would rise as prices fell. That could drive the economy into a spiral of larger and larger price decreases, with economic activity sinking more and more.\n\nThe risk of such a deflationary spiral depends crucially on the nature of inflation expectations.6 If expectations are unanchored, meaning that people have variable expectations depending on the recent behavior of inflation, then the lower inflation that’s characteristic of recessions can convince them that inflation will go still lower in the future. If a recession is severe and long enough, this process eventually will cause prices to fall, and then create a downward spiral. But I don’t think this is a likely scenario in the United States. I believe that inflation expectations are well anchored, in the sense that people expect inflation to be consistent with the Feds’ goals and policies. Based on measures of inflation expectations, people appear to think we will take policy actions that will maintain a positive rate of inflation. This expectation acts as a buttress holding inflation up. This does not mean that a short episode of deflation couldn’t occur, but it does help to avoid a prolonged deflationary spiral.\n\nTo reinforce our commitment to price stability, the FOMC recently began releasing long-run inflation forecasts based on the assumption of appropriate monetary policy. These figures, which indicate where FOMC members would like inflation to settle in the longer run, show, as I mentioned, a consensus of 2 percent for consumer inflation.7 Such words, backed by appropriate actions, help keep inflation expectations well anchored and reduce the chances of a deflationary spiral. So, for me the bottom line is this: I see little basis to worry that we will develop an inflation problem. There is more of a reason to think that we could experience some deflation, but the chances of a severe bout of that ailment seem remote.\nYou may have gotten a case of whiplash hearing me say that, although conditions are poor, some hopeful signs are visible, but significant risks remain. Your necks may not have felt any better when I said that I hear worries about inflation and deflation at the same time. However, that’s the situation we find ourselves in now. The good news is that, for the first time in a while, there is some good news to savor. But, when it comes to assessing the future of the economy, the dominant theme is uncertainty. The one thing that is sure is that policymakers around the globe are working hard to restore economic growth. As for the Federal Reserve, it remains fully committed to doing everything in its power to foster recovery while maintaining price stability.\n\n# # #\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1.

        "content": "\n\nWatch Video\n\nI’m delighted to be with you at the Haas School and be hosted by my friend Rich Lyons. As you know, this is a homecoming for me. I spent almost 25 rewarding years of my professional life as a faculty member here. And I will always think of the Haas and broader Berkeley communities with great fondness. Now, of course, I am with the Federal Reserve, and that’s another institution that means a great deal to me because it’s a place where many of the ideas and issues that were central to both my teaching and research here at Haas are translated into real-world policy. The decisions we make at the Fed have taken on added significance with the nation and most of the world going through a deep and worrisome recession, one that has caused millions of people to lose their jobs or homes, and threatened or destroyed businesses large and small.\n\nI think the most useful thing I can do tonight is to give you my views on the current economic situation and then examine some key issues that will shape the course of the economy as we try to dig out from a very deep hole. The story I’m going to tell involves many crosscurrents and uncertainties. This murky picture may actually be good news. I’ve spent the last year or so being so downbeat that I could actually see the faces in my audiences sink as I spoke. The fact that I can now talk about crosscurrents may mean that the economy is reaching an inflection point. It’s too soon for me to be convinced of that, and I see a lot of downside risk, but at least there is some basis for optimism. That said, I expect the recovery, whenever it does begin, to be quite gradual compared with those following previous deep recessions. As always, my comments represent my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe recession is now in its sixth quarter and it’s shaping up as the most severe downturn since the Great Depression. Last week we found out that real GDP contracted at an annual rate of slightly more than 6 percent in the first quarter, according to the Commerce Department’s advance estimate. That is about the same pace of decline registered in the final quarter of last year. These are the largest consecutive declines in real GDP since 1958. The recession is also very broad-based. Housing, business fixed investment, exports, and imports are all falling at eye-popping rates—down more than 30 percent each. The one sector that held up surprisingly well in the first quarter is the largest—consumer spending—which rose by a respectable 2¼ percent.\n\nWhether this is a harbinger of good things to come is uncertain, in part because, after adjusting for inflation, consumption slowed over the months of the quarter and declined absolutely in March. Still, it does offer a glimmer of hope. In addition, business inventories fell by a very large amount in the first quarter. That too is a positive signal. When spending contracted last year, inventories ballooned relative to sales and firms have been struggling to bring them into better alignment. The first-quarter data suggest that the necessary inventory correction may be quite far along. Recent data also offer some hints of stabilization in the housing sector. Home construction contracted sharply in the first quarter as a whole, but we saw signs of improvement late in the period. In the past couple of months, home sales and housing starts have leveled off. Meanwhile, depending on the index, home prices have either increased slightly or fallen at a slower pace.\n\nWhile output is at least showing potential for improvement going forward, recent news from the labor market is still very weak. The unemployment rate has risen by 1.7 percentage points over the past four months and, as bad as that is, I think it actually understates the true magnitude of the labor market deterioration. For one thing, the incidence of permanent, as opposed to temporary, layoffs is unusually high compared with past downturns. In addition, involuntary part-time work has increased during this recession far more than we would expect relative to the rise in unemployment. My business contacts tell me, and the data confirm, that the use of furloughs is now widespread. I know that they are under consideration here at Berkeley as a way to address the budget crunch. The result is that nationally, we have seen a surge in part-time work for economic reasons occurring broadly across occupations. The underemployment rate, a broad measure that adds individuals working part time for economic reasons to the unemployed, now stands at 14¼ percent. This is a whopping 6½ percentage points higher than at the start of the recession, nearly twice the increase in the standard unemployment rate.\n\nLooking forward, my personal forecast for output growth is similar to the Blue Chip consensus. I believe the most likely scenario is that real GDP will advance at a low, but positive, rate in the second half of this year followed by trend-like growth in 2010. A forecast that the economy will soon switch from contraction to expansion strikes some people as optimistic. But, it takes less than you might think for real GDP growth rates to turn positive. Positive growth becomes likely if some of the economy’s weak sectors stop dragging down GDP going forward. Residential construction in particular has been declining for several years, subtracting about 1 percentage point from real GDP growth. This spending can sink only so far, and, as I said, we’ve seen some tentative signs of stabilization recently. If housing starts level out, the sector would no longer weigh down the economy and faster growth would ensue. Similarly, as I noted earlier, inventory liquidation has been unusually severe in recent months, especially in motor vehicles. A reduction in the pace of liquidation also would raise the GDP growth rate. Finally, if consumers become more confident—and there is evidence from surveys that they have recently—pent-up demand actually could boost spending on autos, durable goods, and even housing, providing some real “juice” to economic growth.\n\nOf course, monetary and fiscal policy are also sharply focused on promoting economic recovery. On the monetary side, the Federal Reserve has pushed its traditional policy lever—the federal funds rate—close to zero. And we haven’t stopped there. We have put in place an array of unconventional approaches to spur the flow of credit to households and businesses. These include measures to improve liquidity and financial market functioning, and facilities to support the issuance of asset-backed securities. Moreover, we are undertaking large-scale purchases of Treasury and agency-related debt. These initiatives appear to be lowering longer-term interest rates and easing financial conditions more generally. Mortgage and other private borrowing rates have fallen, and, as those who’ve been bold enough to open their 401(k) statements again will attest, stock prices have risen: they’re up around 35 percent from the lows reached in March. We’ve also seen improvements in key measures of financial market functioning, such as spreads of Libor over the expected federal funds rate. On the fiscal side, the stimulus package passed by Congress in February will provide an important economic shot in the arm. While the program does not appear large enough to solve the economy’s problems on its own, the support it will provide to aggregate demand is significant and helpful. We will likely begin seeing its effects on the economy this quarter.\n\nSo, to summarize, I am hopeful that the recession will end in the second half of this year due to aggressive monetary and fiscal policies, and the operation of typical business cycle mechanisms, such as inventory dynamics. Unfortunately, this combination of ingredients is not a recipe for a resounding rebound. My forecast that output growth will turn positive in 2009 and proceed near trend in 2010 implies that the unemployment rate will rise from 8½ percent now to around 9½ percent by the end of this year, and remain at about that level through 2010. An implication is that inflation is likely to decline below the 2 percent pace that I and most of my colleagues consider most consistent with our congressional mandate to strive for full employment and price stability. Substantial slack in labor and product markets combined with lower commodity prices is already restraining overall price increases for goods and services. If, as seems likely, this downward pressure continues, core consumer inflation is apt to fall from about 2 percent last year to around 1½ percent this year, and go even lower in 2010. I’ll have more to say about inflation later.\n\nThe forecast I just described implies that I am not in the ranks of those who believe that “V” is the letter that will best describe the economy’s trajectory going forward. Those who anticipate a V-shaped recovery argue that growth in the first year after a business-cycle trough has typically been very rapid in previous U.S. downturns, including the deep recession that occurred in 1981 and 82. My own forecast, in contrast, implies a far less robust recovery. In my view, the explanation for the V-shaped pattern typical of past recessions relates to monetary policy. Most deep recessions in the postwar era happened after the Fed tightened policy to fight inflation. Once the inflation scare passed, the central bank was able to cut its policy rate sharply, and the economy snapped back. But, of course, the current recession is far different, having been triggered by a historic housing bust, and a banking and financial crisis. Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff have compared recessions around the world and shown that it takes a long time to recover from downturns caused by financial crises.2 And that is what I expect this time as well.\n\nI can point to a number of specific factors in this recession that are likely to weaken recovery. First, despite signs that consumer spending is stabilizing, the chance of strong and sustained consumption growth appears low. For years prior to the recession, households went on a spending spree of major proportions. This occurred during what has come to be called the “great moderation,” a period of about two decades when recessions were infrequent and mild, and inflation was low and stable. This may have lulled households into a false sense of security. The personal saving rate fell from around 8 percent two decades ago to almost zero in recent years as households financed their lifestyles by drawing on increasing stock market and housing wealth, and taking on higher levels of debt.\n\nNow, the era of such low saving may be over. Falling house and stock prices have vaporized trillions of dollars in household wealth. The destruction of their nest eggs is prompting households to rebuild savings. The deleveraging of household balance sheets could restrain spending for years. Indeed, the personal saving rate is finally on the rise, averaging more than 4 percent so far this year. It wouldn’t surprise me if this effect persists, as the shock of the financial crisis convinces many households that they need to save higher fractions of their incomes for the long term. Of course, ultimately this would be good for economic growth, channeling resources from consumption to investment. That said, the transition could be painful if subpar consumption growth restrains the pace of economic recovery.\n\nMeanwhile, the story for banks and other financial firms is eerily similar. In the buildup to the recession, financial institutions, like consumers, became highly leveraged. Their vulnerability was compounded because they often invested in complex and risky assets that were funded with short-term debt. Since the crisis hit, in an attempt to increase the soundness of their individual balance sheets, banks have tightened lending standards, trying to improve credit quality at the same time that rising unemployment and falling house prices have led to more credit losses. The attempts by banks to cut back the volume of their assets to reduce leverage and conserve capital, combined with a breakdown in the flow of lending through securitization, has constricted the provision of credit in the economy. One important purpose of the stress tests, now nearing completion by banking regulators, is to ensure that our largest banking organizations establish capital buffers that are large enough for them to withstand losses, while continuing to provide credit to households and businesses, even if the recession turns out to be significantly worse than currently anticipated. Such lending is critical to recovery.\n\nThe challenges facing monetary policy makers are another factor that makes a strong recovery uncertain. With the federal funds rate essentially at zero, the Fed’s traditional policy tool has reached its maximum degree of accommodation. Many versions of the Taylor rule, a well-known policy benchmark, indicate that we ought to lower the funds rate well below this zero bound, if such a thing were possible. As I noted, the Fed has turned to unconventional policy tools. Through a variety of programs, the Fed has augmented the flow of credit to the economy, provided a reliable source of liquidity to the financial system, and helped prevent the failure of systemically important depository and nondepository institutions. Most of the action recently has involved boosting credit flows through large-scale asset purchases. To support the housing sector, the Fed announced last November that it would start buying agency-insured mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and agency debt. In March, this program was expanded substantially. In addition, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) launched a new program to purchase large quantities of longer-term Treasury debt. These asset purchases have the potential to stimulate aggregate demand through a number of channels, most obviously by reducing yields on securities included in the program. Indeed, when the FOMC announced in March that the Fed would expand these purchases, interest rates declined on both Treasury securities and agency-backed MBS. Still, even though these programs appear to be having a useful effect, we have little experience with them and the magnitude of their impact is uncertain. In other words, it is difficult to tell if unconventional monetary policies will be as effective in promoting recovery as easing the funds rate has been in the past.\n\nFinally, the global nature of the recession is likely to hold back the pace of our recovery. We haven’t seen anything like this global downturn since the Great Depression. Virtually all advanced economies and many emerging economies are in recession. Financial systems around the globe are under stress, housing markets in some countries have collapsed, and trade has shriveled. The International Monetary Fund recently forecast that the global economy would recover very gradually. This makes sense. As I said, recessions caused by financial crises are generally followed by more measured upswings. In addition, when recessions occur in many regions simultaneously, recoveries are slower than when downturns are confined to just a few countries.3 Now we have a double whammy—a highly synchronized global recession and a financial crisis. That’s a daunting combination.\n\nFor all of these reasons—the need for balance sheet repair by households and financial firms, uncertainties about unconventional monetary policy tools, and the global nature of the recession—I expect the U.S. recovery to be frustratingly tepid once it does get started. It likely will take several more years to bring unemployment back to its long-run equilibrium value.\n\nAs we think about the course of the economy, we must also be wary of developments that could derail recovery. I see the economy as vulnerable to a number of downside risks, including the possibility of another disruptive financial event—another “shoe” dropping, if you will. Commercial real estate is an area that seems vulnerable. Nonresidential construction declined sharply in the first quarter as business activity slowed; new buildings came on line; vacancy rates on office, industrial, and retail space rose; and property values fell. For developers, financing is extremely hard to get. The market for commercial MBS has all but dried up and banks are tightening lending standards. Many developers will have trouble rolling over debt when it comes due. Banks—especially community banks—are major lenders to this sector and are vulnerable to losses.\n\nWe must also keep an eye on developing nations, which face stark challenges as markets for their products shrink and capital inflows dry up. Emerging market defaults could trigger further financial turmoil. The downturn in eastern Europe poses especially significant financial risks to western European banks, whose exposure amounts to an estimated $1.5 trillion. With confidence in the global financial system already fragile, these problems easily could spill over to the United States.\n\nAnother risk I’d like to discuss is inflation—or perhaps I should say deflation. This is an extraordinary time when you can hear a warning about inflation from one quarter and a dire prediction of deflation from another quarter. I hear from both sides, though more often from those worried about inflation. Concerns about an inflationary surge focus on the expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet, which has increased from under $900 billion in mid-2007 to over $2 trillion now, largely financed by increases in bank reserves. The inflation worriers may be focused on these excess reserves as a potential source of inflation down the road. Their fears are compounded because federal budget deficits are ballooning. While I understand that the combination of Fed expansion and big federal budget deficits might seem scary, I don’t see a surge in inflation as very likely. Expansionary monetary policy creates inflation by loosening financial conditions enough to create excess demand for goods and services. That’s obviously not the problem we face now. In spite of the Fed’s best efforts to enhance the flow of credit, financial conditions, while somewhat improved, overall remain abnormally tight. In our current recession, we need more demand—not less—to offset the slack in labor and product markets.\n\nThat said, in theory there’s one way inflation could rise before the economy recovers from the recession: inflation expectations might increase because of fears that the Fed will not shift gears quickly enough when the recession and credit crunch are over. Some people have argued that the Fed might find it politically difficult to stop lending to the private sector borrowers it has supported during the crisis.4 I don’t find this argument persuasive and I don’t see evidence that the broad public finds it convincing either. The Fed has accumulated considerable anti-inflation credibility over the past 25 years or so.5 This credibility was evident a few years ago when prices for energy, food, and other commodities soared to historically high levels. While the direct effects of those price increases showed up in headline consumer inflation, very little was passed through to core inflation. Right now, there’s little evidence that inflation expectations have deteriorated. Market indicators and survey measures of longer-run expectations have been quite stable.\n\nOf course, the inflation worriers are correct in an important respect: The Federal Reserve will need to remove monetary accommodation once the credit crunch eases, private spending revives, and the economy picks up steam. If the Fed were to fail to tighten the stance of monetary policy quickly enough, we would see higher inflation. But I want to assure you that the Fed is well aware of this danger and is readying the tools even now. Most importantly, the Fed is committed to maintaining price stability and, when the time to remove accommodation comes, we have a number of tools in our kit bag that could be quite effective.\n\nThe simplest approach—the one that we have used traditionally—would be to shrink our balance sheet by selling the Treasuries, agency debt, and agency MBS we accumulated during the crisis. Many of the special liquidity and credit facilities we have developed will be phased out as financial markets recover. But it is conceivable that, even with the economy rebounding nicely, the credit crunch might not be fully behind us and some financial markets might still need Fed support. In this case, we could increase the interest rate we pay on bank reserves. This would induce banks to remove funds from the federal funds market and lend them to us, thereby increasing the federal funds rate and longer-term interest rates that are more relevant to private borrowers. Importantly, this approach provides us with the flexibility to tighten monetary policy in response to an improving macroeconomic picture without shrinking the size of our balance sheet or our support to financial markets. It is the main method employed by many central banks to influence financial conditions. An alternative approach that could accomplish the same goal, and perhaps do it better, would be something completely new for the Federal Reserve—that’s to issue interest-bearing debt broadly to private investors. Let’s call this debt Fed bills. Congress would have to authorize this, but it too is a tool available to many central banks. The sale of Fed bills would reduce the reserves of the banking system, as in a typical contractionary open-market operation. As with interest on reserves, we could accomplish a tightening of policy while maintaining our support of credit markets. But Fed bills would have an advantage over interest on reserves. The loans to the Fed would come from investors throughout the economy, not just from banks. At a time when we need banks to lend to the private sector to fight a credit crunch, this is a decided plus.\n\nAs you can tell, I’m quite skeptical about the risk of higher inflation. My thoughts about the possibility of deflation are more complex. At first blush, there is cause for concern. We are starting from a situation where core inflation is already a bit below 2 percent. The economy has a great deal of slack and unemployment is likely to rise further, which would put more downward pressure on wage growth and inflation. Indeed, we have already seen evidence that wages are rising less rapidly and there have been some outright wage cuts. Furthermore, as I noted, with the funds rate at the zero bound, monetary policy has been forced to ease its stance through unconventional instruments that are hardly tried and true. If deflation were to occur with the funds rate near zero, the effects could be severe. In the textbook case, with no way of lowering the nominal funds rate, real interest rates would rise as prices fell. That could drive the economy into a spiral of larger and larger price decreases, with economic activity sinking more and more.\n\nThe risk of such a deflationary spiral depends crucially on the nature of inflation expectations.6 If expectations are unanchored, meaning that people have variable expectations depending on the recent behavior of inflation, then the lower inflation that’s characteristic of recessions can convince them that inflation will go still lower in the future. If a recession is severe and long enough, this process eventually will cause prices to fall, and then create a downward spiral. But I don’t think this is a likely scenario in the United States. I believe that inflation expectations are well anchored, in the sense that people expect inflation to be consistent with the Feds’ goals and policies. Based on measures of inflation expectations, people appear to think we will take policy actions that will maintain a positive rate of inflation. This expectation acts as a buttress holding inflation up. This does not mean that a short episode of deflation couldn’t occur, but it does help to avoid a prolonged deflationary spiral.\n\nTo reinforce our commitment to price stability, the FOMC recently began releasing long-run inflation forecasts based on the assumption of appropriate monetary policy. These figures, which indicate where FOMC members would like inflation to settle in the longer run, show, as I mentioned, a consensus of 2 percent for consumer inflation.7 Such words, backed by appropriate actions, help keep inflation expectations well anchored and reduce the chances of a deflationary spiral. So, for me the bottom line is this: I see little basis to worry that we will develop an inflation problem. There is more of a reason to think that we could experience some deflation, but the chances of a severe bout of that ailment seem remote.\nYou may have gotten a case of whiplash hearing me say that, although conditions are poor, some hopeful signs are visible, but significant risks remain.

        "content": "\n\nIt’s a great pleasure to speak to this distinguished group at a conference named for Hyman P. Minsky. My last talk here took place 13 years ago when I served on the Fed’s Board of Governors. My topic then was “The ‘New’ Science of Credit Risk Management at Financial Institutions.” It described innovations that I expected to improve the measurement and management of risk. My talk today is titled “A Minsky Meltdown: Lessons for Central Bankers.” I won’t dwell on the irony of that. Suffice it to say that, with the financial world in turmoil, Minsky’s work has become required reading. It is getting the recognition it richly deserves. The dramatic events of the past year and a half are a classic case of the kind of systemic breakdown that he—and relatively few others—envisioned.\n\nCentral to Minsky’s view of how financial meltdowns occur, of course, are “asset price bubbles.” This evening I will revisit the ongoing debate over whether central banks should act to counter such bubbles and discuss “lessons learned.” This issue seems especially compelling now that it’s evident that episodes of exuberance, like the ones that led to our bond and house price bubbles, can be time bombs that cause catastrophic damage to the economy when they explode. Indeed, in view of the financial mess we’re living through, I found it fascinating to read Minsky again and reexamine my own views about central bank responses to speculative financial booms. My thoughts on this have changed somewhat, as I will explain. 2\n\nAs always, my comments are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nMinsky and the current crisis\n\nOne of the critical features of Minsky’s world view is that borrowers, lenders, and regulators are lulled into complacency as asset prices rise. 3 It was not so long ago—though it seems like a lifetime—that many of us were trying to figure out why investors were demanding so little compensation for risk. For example, long-term interest rates were well below what appeared consistent with the expected future path of short-term rates. This phenomenon, which ended abruptly in mid-2007, was famously characterized by then-Chairman Greenspan as a “conundrum.” 4 Credit spreads too were razor thin. But for Minsky, this behavior of interest rates and loan pricing might not have been so puzzling. He might have pointed out that such a sense of safety on the part of investors is characteristic of financial booms. The incaution that reigned by the middle of this decade had been fed by roughly twenty years of the so-called “great moderation,” when most industrialized economies experienced steady growth and low and stable inflation. Moreover, the world economy had shaken off the effects of the bursting of an earlier asset price bubble—the technology stock boom—with comparatively little damage.\n\nChairman Bernanke has argued that other factors besides complacency were responsible for low interest rates in this period. 5 A glut of foreign saving mainly generated in developing countries such as China and India fueled demand for dollar-denominated assets. This ample supply of foreign savings combined with a low U.S. personal saving rate, large U.S. government deficits, and high productivity gains to produce a huge current account deficit. As a result, vast quantities of funds began “sloshing around” in our economy seeking investment projects.\n\nFed monetary policy may also have contributed to the U.S. credit boom and the associated house price bubble by maintaining a highly accommodative stance from 2002 to 2004. 6 This accommodative stance was motivated by what Greenspan called “risk management policy,” in which, to reduce the possibility of deflation, the funds rate was held below the level that would otherwise have been chosen to promote a return to full employment. 7 In effect, the Fed took a calculated risk. It took out some insurance to lower the chances of a potentially devastating deflationary episode. The cost of that insurance was an increased possibility of overheating the economy. These policy actions arguably played some role in our house price bubble. But they clearly were not the only factor, since such bubbles appeared in many countries that did not have highly accommodative monetary policies.\n\nAs Minsky’s financial instability hypothesis suggests, when optimism is high and ample funds are available for investment, investors tend to migrate from the safe hedge end of the Minsky spectrum to the risky speculative and Ponzi end. Indeed, in the current episode, investors tried to raise returns by increasing leverage and sacrificing liquidity through short-term—sometimes overnight—debt financing. Simultaneously, new and fancy methods of financial engineering allowed widespread and complex securitization of many types of assets, most famously in subprime lending. In addition, exotic derivatives, such as credit default swaps, were thought to dilute risk by spreading it widely. These new financial products provided the basis for an illusion of low risk, a misconception that was amplified by the inaccurate analyses of the rating agencies. This created a new wrinkle that even Minsky may not have imagined. Some of the investors who put money into highly risky assets were blithely unaware of how far out on a limb they had gone. Many of those who thought they were in the hedge category were shocked to discover that, in fact, they were speculative or Ponzi units.\n\nAt the same time, securitization added distance between borrowers and lenders. As a result, underwriting standards were significantly relaxed. Much of this financing was done in the “shadow banking system,” consisting of entities that acted a lot like banks—albeit very highly leveraged and illiquid banks—but were outside the bank regulatory net. Although these developments reached an extreme state in the U.S. subprime mortgage market, risky practices were employed broadly in the U.S. financial system. And this activity extended far beyond our borders as players throughout the global financial system eagerly participated. As banks and their large, nonbank competitors became involved in ever more complicated securitizations, they began to employ sophisticated “new tools” to measure and manage the credit risks flowing from these transactions. But those tools—which I described in my speech 13 years ago—proved insufficient for the task.\n\nThis cult of risky behavior was not limited to financial institutions. U.S. households enthusiastically leveraged themselves to the hilt. The personal saving rate, which had been falling for over a decade, hovered only slightly above zero from mid-2005 to mid-2007. A good deal of this leverage came in the form of mortgage debt. The vast use of exotic mortgages—such as subprime, interest-only, low-doc and no-doc, and option-ARMs—offers an example of Minsky’s Ponzi finance, in which a loan can only be refinanced if the price of the underlying asset increases. In fact, many subprime loans were explicitly designed to be good for the borrower only if they could be refinanced at a lower rate, a benefit limited to those who established a pattern of regular payments and built reasonable equity in their homes.\n\nIn retrospect, it’s not surprising that these developments led to unsustainable increases in bond prices and house prices. Once those prices started to go down, we were quickly in the midst of a Minsky meltdown. The financial engineering that was thought to hedge risks probably would have worked beautifully if individual investors had faced shocks that were uncorrelated with those of their counterparties. But declines in bond and house prices hit everyone in the same way, inflicting actual and expected credit losses broadly across the financial system. Moreover, the complexity of securitized credit instruments meant that it was difficult to identify who the actual loan holders might be. Meanwhile, asset write-downs reduced equity cushions of financial firms and increased their leverage just when growing risks made those firms seek less leverage, not more. When they tried to sell assets into illiquid markets, prices fell further, generating yet more selling pressure in a loss spiral that kept intensifying. We experienced a “perfect storm” in financial markets: runs on highly vulnerable and systemically important financial institutions; dysfunction in most securitized credit markets; a reduction in interbank lending; higher interest rates for all but the safest borrowers, matched by near-zero yields on Treasury bills; lower equity values; and a restricted supply of credit from financial institutions.\n\nOnce this massive credit crunch hit, it didn’t take long before we were in a recession. The recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit losses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse feedback loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on durable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash. And, financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this dynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms—and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state—nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole.\n\nThe U.S. economy just entered the sixth quarter of recession. Economic activity and employment are contracting sharply, with weakness evident in every major sector aside from the federal government. Financial markets and institutions remain highly stressed, notwithstanding a few welcome signs of stability due mainly to Federal Reserve and federal government credit policies. The negative dynamics between the real and financial sides of the economy have created severe downside risks. While we’ve seen some tentative signs of improvement in the economic data very recently, it’s still impossible to know how deep the contraction will ultimately be.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the Minsky meltdown is global in nature, reflecting the ever-increasing interconnectedness of financial markets and institutions around the world. The recession is the first during the postwar period to see simultaneous contractions in output in Europe, Japan, and North America. Economic growth in these areas has weakened sharply as the financial pain has spread and the U.S. recession has spilled over to our trading partners. Forecasts for growth in Europe and Japan in 2009 are now even weaker than for the United States. What’s more, many developing nations face stark challenges as markets for their products have dried up and capital inflows have abruptly halted, making debt refinancing—if necessary—difficult, if not impossible. The global nature of the downturn raises the odds that the recession will be prolonged, since neither we nor our trade partners can look to a boost from foreign demand.\n\nBubbles and monetary policy\n\nThe severity of these financial and economic problems creates a very strong case for government and central bank action. I’m encouraged that we are seeing an almost unprecedented outpouring of innovative fiscal and monetary policies aimed at resolving the crisis. Of course, fiscal stimulus played a central role in Minsky’s policy prescriptions for combating economic cycles. Minsky also emphasized the importance of lender-of-last-resort interventions by the Federal Reserve, and this is a tool we have relied on heavily. I believe that Minsky would also approve of the Fed’s current “credit easing” policies. Since the intensification of the financial crisis last fall, the Fed has expanded its balance sheet from around $850 billion to just over $2 trillion and has announced programs that are likely to take it yet higher. In effect, the government is easing the financial fallout resulting from virulent deleveraging throughout the private sector by increasing its own leverage in a partial and temporary offset. 8\n\nHowever, as I said at the beginning of my talk, this evening I want to address another question that has been the subject of much debate for many years: Should central banks attempt to deflate asset price bubbles before they get big enough to cause big problems? Until recently, most central bankers would have said no. They would have argued that policy should focus solely on inflation, employment, and output goals—even in the midst of an apparent asset-price bubble. 9 That was the view that prevailed during the tech stock bubble and I myself have supported this approach in the past. However, now that we face the tangible and tragic consequences of the bursting of the house price bubble, I think it is time to take another look.\n\nLet me briefly review the arguments for and against policies aimed at counteracting bubbles. The conventional wisdom generally followed by the Fed and central banks in most inflation-targeting countries is that monetary policy should respond to an asset price only to the extent that it will affect the future path of output and inflation, which are the proper concerns of monetary policy. 10 For example, a surging stock market can be expected to lead to stronger demand for goods and services by raising the wealth of households and reducing the cost of capital for businesses. As a result, higher stock prices mean that the stance of monetary policy needs to be tighter, but only enough to offset the macroeconomic consequences on aggregate demand created by a larger stock of wealth. In other words, policy would not respond to the stock market boom itself, but only to the consequences of the boom on the macroeconomy.\n\nHowever, other observers argue that monetary authorities must consider responding directly to an asset price bubble when one is detected. This is because—as we are witnessing—bursting bubbles can seriously harm economic performance, and monetary policy is hard-pressed to respond effectively after the fact. Therefore, central banks may prefer to try to eliminate, or at least reduce the size of, this threat directly. Under this approach, policymakers would push interest rates higher than would be indicated under conventional policy. The result, of course, would be that output and employment would be reduced in the near-term, which is the price of mitigating the risk of serious financial and economic turmoil later on.\n\nWhat are the issues that separate the anti-bubble monetary policy activists from the skeptics? First, some of those who oppose such policy question whether bubbles even exist. They maintain that asset prices reflect the collective information and wisdom of traders in organized markets. Trying to deflate an apparent bubble would go against precisely those “experts” who best understand the fundamental factors underlying asset prices. It seems to me though that this argument is particularly difficult to defend in light of the poor decisions and widespread dysfunction we have seen in many markets during the current turmoil.\n\nSecond, even if bubbles do occur, it’s an open question whether policymakers can identify them in time to act effectively. Bubbles are not easy to detect because estimates of the underlying fundamentals are imprecise. For example, in the case of house prices, it is common to estimate fundamental values by looking at the ratio of house prices to rents, which can be thought of as equivalent to a dividend-price ratio for the stock market. 11 If this ratio rises significantly above its fundamental, or long-run, value, the possibility of a bubble should be considered. Indeed, from 2002 to early 2006, this ratio zoomed to about 90 percent above its long-run value, far outstripping any previous level. Nonetheless, even when house prices were soaring, some experts doubted that a bubble existed. That said, by 2005 I think most people understood that—at a minimum—there was a substantial risk that houses had become overvalued. Even at that point though, many thought the correction in house prices would be slow, not the rapid adjustment that did occur. 12\n\nNow, even if we accept that we can identify bubbles as they happen, another question arises: Is the threat so serious that a monetary response is imperative? It would make sense for monetary policy makers to intervene only if the fallout were likely to be quite severe and difficult to deal with after the fact. We know that the effects of booms and busts in asset prices sometimes show themselves with significant lags. In those cases, conventional policy approaches can be effective. For example, fluctuations in equity prices generally affect wealth and consumer demand quite gradually. A central bank may prefer to adjust short-term interest rates after the bubble bursts to counter the depressing effects on demand. The tech stock bubble seems to fit this mold. The price-dividend ratio for these stocks reached dizzying heights and many observers were convinced that a crash was inevitable. But monetary policy makers did not try to stop the relentless climb of tech stock prices, although they raised interest rates toward the end of the period to dampen emerging inflationary pressures. Instead, it was only after tech stocks collapsed that policy eased to offset the negative wealth effect and, as unemployment rose, to help return the economy to full employment. The recession at the beginning of the decade was fairly mild and did not involve pervasive financial market disruptions.\n\nStill, just like infections, some bursting asset price bubbles are more virulent than others. The current recession is a case in point. As house prices have plunged, the turmoil has been transmitted to the economy much more quickly and violently than interest rate policy has been able to offset.\n\nYou’ll recognize right away that the assets at risk in the tech stock bubble were equities, while the volatile assets in the current crisis involve debt instruments held widely by global financial institutions. It may be that credit booms, such as the one that spurred house price and bond price increases, hold more dangerous systemic risks than other asset bubbles. By their nature, credit booms are especially prone to generating powerful adverse feedback loops between financial markets and real economic activity. It follows then, that if all asset bubbles are not created equal, policymakers could decide to intervene only in those cases that seem especially dangerous.\n\nThat brings up a fourth point: even if a dangerous asset price bubble is detected and action to rein it in is warranted, conventional monetary policy may not be the best approach. It’s true that moderate increases in the policy interest rate might constrain the bubble and reduce the risk of severe macroeconomic dislocation. In the current episode, higher short-term interest rates probably would have restrained the demand for housing by raising mortgage interest rates, and this might have slowed the pace of house price increases. In addition, as Hyun Song Shin and his coauthors have noted in important work related to Minsky’s, tighter monetary policy may be associated with reduced leverage and slower credit growth, especially in securitized markets.13 Thus, monetary policy that leans against bubble expansion may also enhance financial stability by slowing credit booms and lowering overall leverage.\n\nNonetheless, these linkages remain controversial and bubbles may not be predictably susceptible to interest rate policy actions. And there’s a question of collateral damage. Even if higher interest rates take some air out of a bubble, such a strategy may have an unacceptably depressing effect on the economy as a whole. There is also the harm that can result from “type 2 errors,” when policymakers respond to asset price developments that, with the benefit of hindsight, turn out not to have been bubbles at all. For both of these reasons, central bankers may be better off avoiding monetary strategies and instead relying on more targeted and lower-cost alternative approaches to manage bubbles, such as financial regulatory and supervisory tools. I will turn to that topic in just a minute.\n\nIn summary, when it comes to using monetary policy to deflate asset bubbles, we must acknowledge the difficulty of identifying bubbles, and uncertainties in the relationship between monetary policy and financial stability. At the same time though, policymakers often must act on the basis of incomplete knowledge. What has become patently obvious is that not dealing with certain kinds of bubbles before they get big can have grave consequences. This lends more weight to arguments in favor of attempting to mitigate bubbles, especially when a credit boom is the driving factor. I would not advocate making it a regular practice to use monetary policy to lean against asset price bubbles. However recent experience has made me more open to action. I can now imagine circumstances that would justify leaning against a bubble with tighter monetary policy. Clearly further research may help clarify these issues. 14\n\nAnother important tool for financial stability\n\nRegardless of one’s views on using monetary policy to reduce bubbles, it seems plain that supervisory and regulatory policies could help prevent the kinds of problems we now face. Indeed, this was one of Minsky’s major prescriptions for mitigating financial instability. I am heartened that there is now widespread agreement among policymakers and in Congress on the need to overhaul our supervisory and regulatory system, and broad agreement on the basic elements of reform. 15\n\nMany of the proposals under discussion are intended to strengthen micro-prudential supervision. Micro-prudential supervision aims to insure that individual financial institutions, including any firm with access to the safety net, but particularly those that are systemically important, are well managed and avoid excessive risk. The current system of supervision is characterized by uneven and fragmented supervision, and it’s riddled with gaps that enhance the opportunity for regulatory arbitrage. Such arbitrage was a central component in the excessive risk-taking that led to our current problems. It is now widely agreed that such gaps and overlaps must be eliminated, and systemically important institutions—whether banks, insurance firms, investment firms, or hedge funds—should be subject to consolidated supervision by a single agency. Systemic institutions would be defined by key characteristics, such as size, leverage, reliance on short-term funding, importance as sources of credit or liquidity, and interconnectedness in the financial system—not by the kinds of charters they have. Another critical shortcoming of the current system is that it lacks any legal process to enable supervisors of financial conglomerates and nonbanks to wind down the activities of failed firms in an orderly fashion. The need for a resolution framework that would permit such wind-downs of systemically important firms is also widely accepted.\n\nThe current crisis has afforded plentiful opportunities for supervisors to reflect on the effectiveness of our current system of micro-prudential supervision. The “lessons learned” will undoubtedly enhance its conduct going forward. 16 But, regardless of how well micro-prudential supervision is executed, on its own it will never be adequate to safeguard the economy from the destructive boom and bust cycles that Minsky considered endemic in capitalistic systems. Analogous to Keynes’ paradox of thrift, the assumption that safe institutions automatically result in a safe system reflects a fallacy of composition. Thus, macro-prudential supervision—to protect the system as a whole—is needed to mitigate financial crises.\n\nThe roles of micro- and macro-prudential supervision are fundamentally different. In principle, many individual institutions could be managing risk reasonably well, while the system as a whole remained vulnerable due to interconnections among financial institutions that could lead to contagious cycles of loss and illiquidity. For example, it is prudent for institutions to sell risky assets and pay off debt when a decline in asset prices depletes capital. But the simultaneous behavior of many institutions to protect themselves in this way only intensifies the decline in prices. Moreover, when many institutions try to de-lever simultaneously, market liquidity can instantly evaporate. Systemic risk is endogenous to the working of the financial system.\n\nCapital requirements could serve as a key tool of macro-prudential supervision. Most proposals for regulatory reform would impose higher capital requirements on systemically important institutions and also design them to vary in a procyclical manner. In other words, capital requirements would rise in economic upswings, so that institutions would build strength in good times, and they would fall in recessions. This pattern would counteract the natural tendency of leverage to amplify business cycle swings—serving as a kind of “automatic stabilizer” for the financial system. Financial stability might also be enhanced by reforming the accounting rules governing loan loss reserves. A more forward-looking system for reserving against such losses could make regulatory capital less sensitive to economic fluctuations. 17 In addition, most proposals for financial reform emphasize the need for stronger liquidity standards. The funding of long-term assets with short-term, often overnight liabilities, is a source of systemic vulnerability. One interesting recent proposal would disincent overreliance on short-term funding by relating an institution’s capital charges to the degree of maturity mismatch between its assets and liabilities. 18 There has been considerable discussion recently of the need for a new macro-prudential or “financial stability” supervisor—whether the Fed or some other agency—with responsibility to monitor, assess, and mitigate systemic risks in the financial system as a whole.\n\nAt this stage, the proposed reforms involve broad principles. The translation of those principles into a detailed supervisory program will be challenging, to say the least. But I am hopeful that the lessons we have learned will help us build a more effective system to head off financial crises. If we are successful, then we will have gone a long way toward preventing another Minsky meltdown.\n\n# # #\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1.

        "content": "\n\n\n\nGood afternoon and thank you for inviting me. I’m delighted to speak before a group of such distinguished forecasters. As a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, I too must regularly predict the course of the economy and lately that has become a particularly hazardous occupation. We are struggling to assess the effects of conditions we haven’t seen before, including a near-collapse of the financial system, and to predict the impacts of policies that haven’t been tried before, including an array of new Fed initiatives designed to improve conditions in private credit markets.\n\nI share the guarded optimism of most professional forecasters that the economy may begin to grow again within the next several quarters. But I must admit that I see considerable downside risk, and my confidence in this outlook is greatly diminished by the nearly unprecedented set of circumstances we face, circumstances that severely challenge our ability to use historical economic relationships to anticipate future developments. We face an extraordinarily uncertain future, and our main hope for economic recovery lies in the sorts of innovative and aggressive economic policy responses that are being carried out by Federal Reserve and federal government policymakers. We must use all available tools to fight off the significant forces for contraction now hitting the economy.\n\nLast week, the FOMC took some rather dramatic steps to ease the stance of monetary policy. We decided to expand our program to purchase agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and agency debt by up to $850 billion, and initiated a program to purchase up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities. These actions again demonstrate the Federal Reserve’s commitment to do whatever it takes to get the economy moving forward. I’ll have more to say about Fed policy at the end of my talk.\n\nThe economic situation\n\nWith that, let me begin with my best effort at an appraisal of the current economic situation. As always, my comments represent my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nYou are well aware of how downbeat most of the economic news has been, despite some scattered positive signals. We are in the fifth quarter of recession and economic activity and employment are contracting sharply, with weakness evident in every major sector aside from the federal government. At the same time, financial markets remain highly stressed and the adverse feedback loop between the economy and the financial sector shows little sign of slackening. These negative dynamics create severe downside economic risks. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy: consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on durable goods, to build their savings; businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash; and financial institutions are shrinking their assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Such precautions may be smart for individuals and firms, but they intensify economic distress for the economy as a whole.\n\nHousing construction and prices remain at the center of the storm and rising unemployment and the reduced availability of mortgage credit weigh on demand. Unfortunately, even though housing starts have fallen precipitously, we have yet to see any clear sign that the contraction in home building is near its end. The recent news that housing starts and permits had jumped in February provides a ray of hope, but it’s too soon to know if this is noise or a signal that the contraction will soon end. The ongoing decline in house prices poses significant downside risk to future consumer spending and the health of the financial system. This correction in house prices, especially in combination with rising unemployment, has fueled mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures and the associated losses are seriously weakening banks and the financial system more broadly. Of course, foreclosures also harm the affected communities.\n\nMortgage rates are a potent influence on housing demand, and it is encouraging that the rates on conforming mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have declined. The evidence suggests that the Fed’s decision to purchase mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by these agencies played a role in bringing rates down, and the further rate declines following last week’s FOMC announcement of expanded purchases is a hopeful sign that conforming mortgage rates may decline even more. The rates charged to borrowers seeking nonconforming jumbos have come down too, although not nearly as much as those on conforming loans. However, mortgages are still all but unavailable to borrowers with less-than-stellar credit histories and those who can’t make large down payments.\n\nThe burdens afflicting consumers are both serious and numerous, so it is hardly surprising that consumer confidence is at a 30-year low and consumer spending has been weak. Following an outright contraction in the second half of last year, spending has shown signs of stabilizing recently. In addition to soaring unemployment, household balance sheets have imploded. The combined impact on household wealth of falling house prices and plummeting equity prices has been staggering. Household wealth fell by $5 trillion last quarter alone, and by $13 trillion—or nearly 25 percent—since the peak in mid-2007. Unfortunately, households were not well positioned for such a hit to their wealth, since many had leveraged to the hilt. The combination of the loss in wealth and the overhang of household debt portends years of subdued spending as households go through an extended process of deleveraging. Households are likely to recognize the benefits of stronger balance sheets for precautionary purposes and for meeting longer-term goals, such as down-payment requirements and retirement. Downward pressure on household leverage will come not just from households themselves but also from lenders, as they demand more collateral for loans—collateral that has been devastated by the collapse of housing and other wealth. The one partially offsetting positive for consumer spending is the sharp decline in energy prices since the middle of last year. The bottom line though is that the private saving rate is finally moving up from an exceptionally low level. It is difficult, but critical to the forecast, to judge just how far that rebound will ultimately go.\n\nSharp cutbacks in investment spending have reinforced the economic drag resulting from the retrenchment in consumer spending. Outlays for equipment and software and structures declined sharply in the fourth quarter of 2008 and firms liquidated inventories at a sizeable pace. The contraction in all of these spending categories appears to have intensified this quarter. This weakness in business investment spending reflects shrinking sales, uncomfortably high inventory-sales ratios, a higher cost of capital, and dysfunctional credit markets. Our business contacts also emphasize that pervasive uncertainty about the length and severity of the current downturn is causing them to defer commitments and more generally hunker down. They have become exceptionally cautious in undertaking commitments to capital spending projects, even when those projects are expected to be profitable in the long term. And they are hoarding liquidity to meet unexpected revenue shortfalls or financing needs.\n\nThe budgetary problems facing my home state of California have been well publicized and are exceptionally severe, but state and local governments across the nation face similar problems. Their budgets have been thrown into crisis by the financial and economic turmoil. Reductions in tax collections due to falling income and the downturns in the housing and stock markets have been coupled with tighter credit conditions, making it harder to issue bonds. Many states are cutting spending, drawing down rainy day funds, and, to a lesser extent, raising taxes in response. Fortunately, the recently enacted fiscal stimulus package included a substantial dose of funding for state and local projects, and this should provide meaningful relief. It is especially encouraging that this aid is going disproportionately to states with severe budgetary pressures, which are more likely to put the funds to immediate use.\n\nMore broadly, with the passage of the fiscal stimulus package, the federal government is likely to boost its contribution to real GDP this year and next. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that real GDP will be lifted by between 1 and 3½ percent by the end of next year, and that translates into a reduction in the unemployment rate of between ½ and 1¼ percentage points. While a program of this size is not sufficient on its own to solve the economy’s problems, the stimulus is welcome, and likely to start hitting the economy as soon as next quarter.\n\nThe final factor affecting the outlook for growth is net exports, but significant impetus from this source seems unlikely in coming quarters. Indeed, a truly sobering feature of the current recession is its global nature. This recession is the first during the postwar period to see a simultaneous contraction in output in Europe, Japan, and North America. Economic growth in these areas has weakened sharply as the financial meltdown has spread and the U.S. recession has spilled over to our trading partners. Forecasts for growth in Europe and Japan in 2009 are now even weaker than for the United States. Many developing nations face stark challenges as markets for their products have dried up and capital inflows have abruptly halted, making debt refinancing—if necessary—difficult, if not impossible. Emerging market defaults would trigger further financial turmoil. The downturn in eastern Europe poses especially significant financial risks to western European banks, whose exposure amounts to an estimated $1.5 trillion. Bank loans in Austria exceed 80 percent of GDP, while the exposure of banks in Sweden and Belgium exceed 30 percent of GDP.\n\nFinally, let me to turn to inflation. With the global recession putting downward pressure on commodity prices and slack in both labor and product markets swelling, we’ve seen an outright decline in consumer prices over the past six months. I anticipate that unemployment will continue to increase before peaking in 2010, and, as a consequence, I expect inflation to be extremely subdued for quite some time. It seems likely, in fact, that headline consumer inflation will be barely positive for 2009 as a whole and core inflation could remain below 1 percent for the next several years. Such rates are notably below the 2 percent pace that most FOMC members consider appropriate to best promote the Committee’s dual mandate for full employment and price stability.\n\nSo let me put all of these observations together into an overall view of future economic growth. With the caveat that my forecast is subject to exceptional uncertainty in the present environment, my best guess is similar to that of most forecasters, who expect to see moderately positive real GDP growth rates beginning later this year or early in 2010, followed by a gradual recovery.2\n\nHowever, I am well aware that my views are strikingly more optimistic than those I hear from the vast majority of my business contacts. They tend to see conditions as dire and getting worse. In fact, many of them can’t believe I would even suggest what they see as such a patently rosy scenario! So why is it that so many of us who prepare forecasts seem to be more optimistic than many others? I think there are several reasons. First, as forecasters, we distinguish between growth rates and levels. It’s true that the Blue Chip consensus shows moderate positive growthrates in output in the second half of this year. But even so, the level of the unemployment rate would still rise throughout 2009 and into 2010. So, in this sense, the worst of the recession is not expected to occur until next year. And, even by the end of 2011, I would expect the unemployment rate to be above its full-employment level. So I wouldn’t call this a particularly rosy scenario.\n\nSecond, it takes less than many people think for real GDP growth rates to turn positive. Just the elimination of drags on growth can do it. For example, residential construction has been declining for several years, subtracting about 1 percentage point from real GDP growth. Even if this spending were only to stabilize at today’s very low levels—not a robust performance at all—a 1 percentage point subtraction from growth would convert into a zero, boosting overall growth by 1 percentage point. A decline in the pace of inventory liquidation is another factor that could contribute to a pickup in growth. Inventory liquidation over the last few months has been unusually severe, especially in motor vehicles—a typical recession pattern. All it would take is a reduction in the pace of liquidation—not outright inventory building—to raise the GDP growth rate. In addition, pent-up demand for autos, durable goods, or even housing could emerge and boost demand for these items once their stocks have declined to low enough levels.\n\nThird, policies are in place that could jump-start the economy, including the fiscal stimulus package, the Administration’s housing program, and a growing list of Federal Reserve and Treasury credit programs that aim to improve financial market function and the flow of credit. These programs offer the prospect that financial distress may gradually give way to more normal functioning over the course of the year.\n\nFinally, at some point, negative feedback loops can turn positive. For example, if federal government and Federal Reserve policies were to jump-start the economy, credit losses of financial institutions could diminish and lenders might increase the supply of credit available to finance spending. More credit, and better consumer and business confidence, could further boost the economy and employment, which would feed back positively on credit conditions. In other words, the negative feedback loop that is currently in play could be replaced by self-reinforcing positive dynamics.\n\nHeightened uncertainty\n\nWhile there are good reasons to think the economy could begin to recover fairly soon, I’m far from confident and thus don’t want to press the case too strongly. Indeed, in all humility, most of us have failed to anticipate the depth of this downturn and have had to mark down our forecasts repeatedly. For example, the Blue Chip consensus for real GDP growth in 2009 has shown negative revisions in 12 of the past 13 months. Even Chairman Bernanke recently compared his forecasting record to that of the losing Washington Nationals baseball team. The imponderables in forecasting are always large—and it’s always tempting to think that we face more than the usual amount of uncertainty. But, for a host of reasons, this sentiment is actually true right now!\n\nFirst, the shocks hitting the economy from housing and the financial markets have pushed it well outside of the normal range of experience that allows for analysis based on history. For example, research suggests that, in normal times, factors such as consumer and business confidence do not warrant special attention in developing an outlook because they essentially summarize information, like income and equity prices, that are already taken into account. In contrast, in these exceptional circumstances, psychological factors such as consumer and business confidence may exert a large and independent influence.\n\nSecond, our models take for granted that financial markets are working normally and are linked together through arbitrage, so that financial conditions can be captured with a few variables such as equity prices, the exchange rate, and a short- and long-term interest rate. That assumption is obviously invalid now, so the historical relationships in our models linking the financial and the real sides of the economy may provide a less accurate characterization of the transmission mechanism. As a consequence, they now may be less reliable forecasting guides.\n\nFinally, the Federal Reserve and the federal government are deploying policy tools that are unconventional, to say the least, and few, if any, models are prepared to tell us what macro effects they might have. For example, it’s very difficult to gauge the quantitative impact of such policy actions as equity injections into banks, programs to prevent home foreclosures, purchases of mortgage-backed securities and longer-term Treasuries, and facilities to boost issuance in dysfunctional markets for asset-backed securities.\n\nEconomic policies\n\nFor me, this extreme uncertainty about the future creates a very strong case for bold policy actions on a broad front—by both the monetary and fiscal authorities—to stimulate economic activity and prevent inflation from falling any further. I am heartened by the aggressive and innovative actions that policymakers are taking.\n\nTo address this crisis, the federal government has taken a number of steps to get the economy moving again. In addition to the nearly $800 billion fiscal stimulus plan that was enacted into law recently, the administration has initiated a number of other programs. One helps homeowners restructure or refinance their mortgages to avoid possible foreclosure. In addition, a multifaceted Financial Stability Plan (FSP), involving the Treasury, the Fed, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and other financial agencies, provides additional capital to commercial banks and a mechanism for taking so-called toxic financial assets off private sector balance sheets. With regard to these assets, the Treasury earlier this week announced more details of its Public-Private Investment Program (PPIP), which facilitates the purchase of existing, or legacy loans, and legacy securities. The goal of the PPIP is to facilitate price discovery and market liquidity.\n\nThe Fed has also acted vigorously to turn the economy around. In particular, the FOMC cut its federal funds rate target by roughly 5 full percentage points, establishing a target range of 0 to ¼ percent since its December 2008 meeting. Although, for all practical purposes, this interest rate cannot be pushed any lower, the Fed also has stated that an exceptionally low level of the funds rate would likely be warranted “for an extended period” due to weak economic conditions. By offering guidance about the likely course of future short-term interest rates, conditioned on the Committee’s economic forecast, the Committee hopes to influence longer-term interest rates and asset prices, which in turn affect the spending decisions of households and firms.\n\nBeyond interest-rate policy, the Fed is using other tools to improve the functioning of financial markets and to lower longer-term interest rates. A variety of new unconventional programs rely on the Fed’s balance sheet. These programs serve three basic purposes. First, they provide a reliable source of liquidity to financial institutions so that they are better able to extend credit. Second, in cooperation with the Treasury, they have helped to prevent the failure of several systemically important financial institutions. Third, again in concert with the Treasury, they work to augment the flow of credit to the economy.\n\nI would like to focus most of my attention on the third category, since that currently is taking center stage. To open the flow of credit to the private sector, the Fed has taken several approaches. First, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) provides a liquidity backstop to U.S. issuers of highly rated three-month unsecured and asset-backed commercial paper. This facility holds a substantial volume of this paper, and borrowing rates in these markets have fallen noticeably.\n\nSecond, the Fed has developed the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) program jointly with the Treasury to help restore functioning in other impaired markets that provide credit to households and businesses. The TALF supports the issuance of securities collateralized by auto, student, credit card, and Small Business Administration loans—sectors where the issuance of new securities has slowed to a trickle. This approach may be expanded to include additional asset classes, such as commercial and residential mortgages. Purchases of newly issued securities under this program began this month, but are still fairly small in scale. In addition, the TALF will be expanded to include legacy securities as part of the PPIP.\n\nTo support the housing sector, the Fed announced last November that it would begin to purchase agency-insured mortgage-backed securities and agency debt. And, of course, last week this program was expanded substantially. In addition, the FOMC took the very significant step of launching a new program to purchase large quantities of longer-term Treasury debt. Purchases of such longer-term assets have the potential to stimulate aggregate demand through a number of channels, most obviously by reducing the yields on those securities included in the program. Indeed, last week’s announcement resulted in an immediate and sharp decline in interest rates on both Treasury securities and agency-backed MBS. Similar effects on interest rates were felt in the United Kingdom after the Bank of England announced a program to buy long-term government debt there.\n\nThere are good reasons to expect that the Fed’s longer-term asset purchases will also spill over broadly to other credit markets because many types of long-term debt are substitutes for Treasuries and agency MBS in private portfolios. Not surprisingly, corporate borrowing rates also declined last Wednesday in tandem with the rates on Treasuries and agency MBS. Lower interest rates should raise the demand for consumer durables, housing, and business investment. Moreover, lower rates should boost asset valuations, such as equity and house prices, providing additional impetus to consumer spending through wealth effects. A reduction in mortgage rates, at the same time that the Administration has loosened loan-to-value requirements to refinance conforming mortgages, may spur many households to refinance in the coming months, which would raise their disposable income and support more spending. But while it’s easy to enumerate the relevant channels, the sizes of the impacts through them are highly uncertain. We are using new policy tools and we simply don’t have the experience needed to pin down the magnitude of the impacts. In light of these uncertainties, I fully support our diversified approach of using a variety to strategies and programs to spur the provision of credit in a wide range of markets.\n\nHowever, the wisdom of this diversified program is the subject of considerable debate. Critics of the current Fed strategy argue that monetary policy should address only overall credit conditions and should avoid influencing the allocation of credit across particular markets. The joint Treasury-Fed TALF initiative—and even the Fed’s purchases of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities—are controversial because arguably they do affect credit allocation.\n\nA second concern is that close policy coordination between the legislative and executive branches of government may compromise the independence of the Fed, and its credibility and commitment to fulfill its dual mandate of price stability and full employment. For example, at some point, monetary policy goals might require a less accommodative stance of policy, even though credit markets might not be fully healed. The Fed might then face political pressure to keep supplying credit to certain markets.3\n\nAnother concern that I hear expressed with increasing frequency is that the huge expansion of Fed lending will trigger a surge in inflation. The worry seems to be that the Fed has financed its credit programs by increasing the excess reserves of commercial banks, and these reserves could eventually fuel an inflationary surge. The Fed is therefore seen as needing a well-defined exit strategy from its current highly accommodative policy stance.\n\nI understand these concerns, but I don’t believe they warrant a retreat from our current broad approach. In fact, I believe that the seriousness of our current economic problems argues for using all available tools, including the purchase of Treasuries, agency debt, and agency-backed securities, along with lending programs—some joint with Treasury—to support a range of private credit markets. The Fed’s role in these joint programs is to lend against satisfactory collateral while avoiding credit risk. The programs are necessitated by today’s extreme or, in the words of the Federal Reserve Act, “unusual and exigent” circumstances, and are designed to improve private credit conditions broadly, rather than to benefit narrowly defined sectors and classes of borrowers.\n\nThe principle that a central bank, charged with controlling inflation, should be independent from the government is unassailable. It may also be true that it’s easier for the central bank to guard its independence from political pressure when it mainly holds government securities. I believe that we should return to such a balance sheet structure once the financial markets and the economy are back to normal. However, as I said, I also am convinced that, in the current crisis, we must employ all available tools, and that includes bolstering private credit markets. In fact, actions to increase the supply of credit can be expected to have especially large effects in reducing interest rates in dysfunctional private markets, like the ones targeted by the Fed’s commercial paper program and the TALF. I therefore support the joint statement issued by the Treasury and the Fed earlier this week that, “As long as unusual and exigent circumstances persist, the Federal Reserve will continue to use all its tools working closely and cooperatively with the Treasury and other agencies … to foster stabilization and repair of the financial system.”\n\nWith regard to inflation, I think fears that inflation will jump once the economy begins to recover are overdone for several reasons. First, and most important, the Fed is fully committed to maintaining price stability within its dual mandate. The recent Treasury-Fed joint statement codifies the key principle that actions resulting in an expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet “must not constrain the exercise of monetary policy as needed to foster maximum sustainable employment and price stability.” As the economy recovers, the Fed will eventually have to reduce the quantity of excess reserves. To some extent, this will occur naturally as markets heal and some programs consequently shrink. It can also be accomplished, in part, through outright asset sales. And finally, several exit strategies may be available that would allow the Fed to tighten monetary policy even as it maintains a large balance sheet to support credit markets. Indeed, the joint Treasury-Fed statement indicated that legislation will be sought to provide such tools. One possibility is that Congress could give the Fed the authority to issue interest-bearing debt in addition to currency and bank reserves. Issuing such debt would reduce the volume of reserves in the financial system and push up the funds rate without shrinking the total size of our balance sheet.\n\nSecond, for some time to come, disinflation, and even deflation, will represent greater risks than inflation. With economic activity weakening, economic slack is likely to be substantial for several more years. We need to be sure that we avoid the kind of deflation that Japan experienced during its lost decade. While I don’t think such an outcome is likely, it should be on our list of concerns.\n\nIn sum, we face serious challenges as we try to right the economy, and the resumption of growth that we expect by the end of 2009 is far from assured. The best hope for recovery lies in a diversified array of effective fiscal and monetary policy programs. I am heartened by the fact that the federal government and the central bank have both reacted with creativity and vigor in carrying out their responsibilities. And I’m convinced that this is no time to relax our efforts. Thank you very much.\n\n# # #\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1.

        "content": "\n\nIt’s a pleasure to discuss this thoughtful and comprehensive report on the macroeconomic implications of oil price movements.2 Even though we are no longer faced with sky-high oil prices, the issues discussed here remain important and policy relevant. It is hard to believe that oil prices will not go up again sometime in the future, so it is vital that we learn from the last episode, both about how the economy is likely to be affected and how monetary policy should respond.\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, most of my discussion relates to the latter topic, namely the Fed’s policy response to the swings in oil prices over the last seven years. But I would like to start by commenting on the paper’s discussion of the relationship between the market price of oil and the value of oil in the ground. Thinking of this relationship in terms of Tobin’s q is an elegant and insightful contribution. As the authors point out, oil in the ground is like any other irreproducible asset, which should be described by Hotelling’s theory that the price of such an asset minus marginal cost increases at a rate equal to the prevailing interest rate. But oil above the ground has distinct characteristics. And a number of factors can cause its price to depart—for some time—from the value implied by Hotelling’s model. Thus, q—the ratio of the market price of oil to its value in the ground—can and does deviate from unity. The authors provide an important and informative example of such a departure, which uses data on mergers and acquisitions to calculate the value of the oil in the ground and compare it to the market price of oil over the last few years. This exercise, together with one based on the stock prices of large oil companies, suggests that the market price of oil was temporarily high in 2007, and that the jump in the first part of 2008 represented a further departure from the long-term value. I will return to this topic later.\n\nLet me now turn to the paper’s discussion of oil prices and monetary policy, a topic that has sparked much debate among academic economists and policymakers during my two stints as a Fed policymaker. The authors have accurately summarized the main issues involved in the debate that took place during 2002–2008, both inside and outside the Fed. As is well known, an oil price shock typically poses a dilemma for policymakers: Higher oil prices depress output and raise inflation. While the reduction in output provides a reason for policy to ease, the uptick in inflation pushes policy in the opposite direction. It is rarely obvious which element deserves greater weight in policy decisions, and that leads to debate about the appropriate response. The oil shocks of the past several years were no exception.\n\nI agree with the authors’ assessment that the Fed focused primarily on core rather than headline inflation to gauge the extent of underlying inflationary pressures during this period. This strategy, as the authors note, can be justified on theoretical grounds. Since core inflation rose only slightly, the Fed’s main inflation gauge did not signal a need to tighten policy dramatically. But as energy costs soared, the economy did experience an uncomfortable increase in headline inflation. The authors argue that the Fed should have paid more attention to the acceleration in headline inflation and raised interest rates by more than it did from 2004 to 2006.\n\nTheir argument is buttressed by two exercises, one of which examines some data on expected inflation while the other is based on model simulations. I will comment on each of these, in turn. Using a small vector autoregression model—where the price of oil is assumed to be exogenous—the authors show that changes in the price of oil help predict (or, more specifically, Granger cause) the Michigan survey’s measure of expected inflation and also one of two expectations measures based on Treasury yields. This result suggests to the authors that the Fed may have lost, or been on the verge of losing, at least some of its inflation-fighting credibility. Such a loss of credibility would obviously be problematic. For one thing, it would increase the amount by which the Fed would have to increase rates to offset any given inflationary shock.3\n\nIt’s not clear to me, however, that the Fed’s credibility was actually under such serious threat. Even taking the results at face value, the increase in expected inflation was small. Figure 5.3 in the paper reveals, in particular, that for three of their four measures, expected inflation in 2008 was only about one-tenth of a percentage point higher than what it would have been in the absence of any increase in the price of oil over this period.\n\nBut I think there are good reasons not to take these results at face value. Consider, first, the authors’ choice of survey measures. They argue that an increase in readings from the Michigan survey—following years of stability—reflects increasing inflation expectations. But they discount the stability of inflation expectations in the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF), arguing that it indicates “…forecast inertia rather than a super-credible central bank.” I find the authors’ preference for consumer surveys over those of professional forecasters surprising since it is usually argued that households pay less attention to the latest data than do the professionals who are paid to make these forecasts. Moreover, households probably update their forecasts of inflation less frequently than professionals. It’s also worth pointing out that the lack of responsiveness of professional forecasts to relative price shocks appears to be a recent phenomenon, likely due, in my view, to increased Fed credibility and not some newly acquired inertia on the part of the forecasters. Research by my staff shows that while the SPF forecasts were sensitive to headline inflation data in the past, these forecasts have responded in recent years to core rather than headline inflation data.4 This finding suggests that professional forecasters no longer expect relative price changes to have a persistent effect on inflation.\n\nI would also take issue with the authors’ assumption that oil prices are exogenous. For one thing, this assumption is at odds with the paper’s extended discussion about how the price of oil is determined by economic developments in the U.S. and other countries. Moreover, the assumption is probably not innocuous: previous research has shown that treating oil as endogenous in such models can greatly reduce the estimated effects of oil shocks.5\n\nLast, and certainly not least, I would question the authors’ conclusion that inflation expectations have become unanchored based on their finding that oil prices help predict the Michigan survey measures of expected inflation. This finding does imply that a jump in the price of oil causes expected inflation to increase for a time. But it does not prove that the increase is permanent rather than transitory. A permanent response of expected inflation to a change in oil prices requires either that the expectations process be nonstationary or that oil prices be expected to continue rising forever. In other words, the authors’ finding of a link between oil prices and survey measures of expected inflation is perfectly consistent with a temporary impact of oil price shocks on both inflation and inflation expectations. Importantly, these are precisely the responses that are consistent with well-anchored expectations—except, of course, if consumers believe that the Fed would absorb the hit of an oil shock entirely in the form of reduced output.\n\nLet me turn now to the second exercise in the paper, which involves simulating a new Keynesian model to examine the effects of oil shocks. As the authors point out, their specification reproduces a standard feature of such models, which is that it is better for monetary policy to target core inflation than headline inflation. But the authors then proceed to conduct an unusual simulation. To mimic the pattern of oil price increases from 2002 to 2008, they subject the model to a sequence of 26 quarterly shocks in which the average increase in the price of oil is about 7½ percent. While they present results for several different parameter combinations, the typical outcome entails a core inflation rate that is about 2 to 4 percentage points higher than the assumed inflation target of around 1¾ percent. The authors argue that such a sequence of oil price and inflation increases could cause inflation expectations to become unanchored. The implication is that the Fed should have tightened policy more than it did to keep expectations from being cast adrift.\n\nA key element of their simulation is the assumption of a long period of increasing oil prices. Was it reasonable to expect such an outcome on a priori grounds? We can use the authors’ elegant framework to answer this question. The first factor that is relevant in forecasting oil prices in that framework is the price of oil in the ground, as determined by the Hotelling model. However, the authors do not argue that this price changed substantially over the last five years or so. The second relevant factor is the behavior of q. In the authors’ framework, q should be expected to converge toward unity in the medium to long term. Thus, the theory of the oil market presented in the paper suggests that forecasters during the 2002–2008 period should have expected oil prices to gradually revert to more “normal” levels over time, once q exceeded one. Of course, the model does not pin down precisely what might happen to the market price of oil for the next four, six or even eight quarters. Oil prices are notoriously hard to predict at these (and indeed at all) horizons, and there is plenty of room to argue about the role played by fundamentals, special factors, speculation, etc. But throughout most of this period, futures prices were predicting, even as oil prices rose, that oil prices would not rise further—and certainly not for six years running. And these were the most important real-time indicators of market expectations available to the Fed. Of course, futures-market forecasts proved wrong, ex post. But it seems to me now, as it did at the time, that there were neither strong empirical nor theoretical reasons to forecast that oil prices would continue rising for six years.\n\nSince the improbable did in fact come to pass and the Fed tightened less than the authors consider optimal, it seems entirely appropriate to consider the costs of the Fed’s policy judgment. The authors note that the onset of the recession makes it all but impossible to get an unambiguous answer, and I agree. But I still think we can form some judgments based on the behavior of inflation during the more-than-five-year period, ending in mid-2008, during which oil prices kept moving higher. In 2001—the year before oil prices began to rise—core PCE price inflation was 1.9 percent. It averaged 2.2 percent over 2005–2007 and registered 2.2 percent during the first half of 2008. So, core inflation did rise somewhat. We can debate just how much of that increase should be attributed to oil shocks, rising capacity utilization levels, and the wearing-off of the unusual sequence of productivity shocks of the late 1990s, which had helped to push inflation to an unusually low level for a time. The important point, though, is that the actual increase in core inflation fell far short of the increase predicted by the model simulations presented in the paper.\n\nDuring the period of rising oil prices and high headline inflation, policymakers paid close attention to the behavior of wages for possible signs that higher inflationary expectations might be spilling over into wage bargains. Reassuringly, there was little evidence of any increase in the rate of wage growth, a linkage that I consider necessary for a sustained increase in the inflation rate. For instance, after increasing at a 4.3 percent pace in 2001—the year before oil prices began their sustained increase—the Employment Cost Index rose by an average of a little over 3.2 percent per year over 2005–2007 and at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the first half of 2008. Other compensation measures also reveal relatively steady wage growth during this period.6 So, data on wages, like those on core inflation, reveal little evidence of any impact resulting from the long sequence of large oil price shocks.\n\nThe authors attribute the lack of any sizable run-up in core inflation to other shocks that may have hit the economy at the same time. But it is important to emphasize that a significant body of recent research instead suggests that the measured effect of oil price shocks has diminished over the last several decades. Over a decade ago, Hooker (1996) showed that the effect of oil price shocks had diminished since the early 1980s and subsequent research has verified this finding. In fact, this influential research has shifted the academic debate concerning oil shocks, with some authors now questioning whether such shocks were ever actually as important as was believed in the 1970s (Barsky and Kilian, 2004, Bernanke, Gertler, Watson, 1997) and others investigating what structural changes in the economy may have diminished the impact of such shocks (Blanchard and Gali, 2007).\n\nIt seems to me that a change in the conduct of monetary policy following the experience of the 1970s has probably caused inflation expectations to become better anchored, explaining why recent oil shocks have inflicted relatively little damage on the economy. This hypothesis could at least partly explain why the huge run-up in energy prices through the middle of last year was not accompanied by rising wage demands. That in turn enabled the Fed to follow an easier monetary policy that gave greater weight to the output effect of rising oil prices than would have otherwise been possible.\n\nSince mid-2008, oil prices have, of course, plummeted. But the extraordinary weakness in the economy means that the usual trade-offs associated with such supply shocks are absent right now. Any boost to spending from falling oil prices will be more than welcome in the current circumstances. And with inflation now below desirable levels, a decline in inflationary expectations that could push core inflation down over time would be most unwelcome. I argued earlier that the Fed’s inflation credibility helped over a number of years to keep inflationary expectations anchored in the face of rising oil prices and high headline inflation. My hope is that inflationary expectations will remain similarly well-anchored now, serving to stabilize core inflation. The FOMC’s recently released longer-run inflation projections should be useful in this regard, helping to reinforce inflation expectations of around 2 percent.\n\nTo conclude, let me emphasize that I enjoyed reading the paper and found the discussion of recent developments quite informative. But, the arguments in this paper did not persuade me to change my opinion of recent Fed policy. As I noted, during the period of rising oil prices, there was little evidence that policy was inappropriate: labor compensation growth remained well contained and inflation persistence appeared to be low, most likely because of increased Fed credibility. The Fed must always be vigilant in guarding its inflation credibility. But I did not think then, and I do not think now with the benefit of hindsight, that expectations became or were close to becoming unanchored at any point. Nor do I think that the Fed should have taken out substantial insurance against the possible consequences of a highly unlikely sequence of shocks, especially when a growing body of research suggested that the impact of oil shocks had declined substantially since the 1970s.\n\n# # #\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1.

        "content": "\n\n\n\nGood afternoon and thank you for asking me to speak at your assembly. I’m glad to appear before bank directors because—as you know all too well—your industry is at the center of the turbulence now swirling around our economy. I look forward to your insights and questions.\n\nI don’t need to tell you that our financial system has, in many important areas, broken down, and this has precipitated a very serious credit crunch. Banks have played a role in the credit crunch by tightening their terms and standards for lending. Tighter credit terms are a natural response by banks to the losses they have suffered and the deterioration in the economic climate. But diminished access to credit for households and businesses is intensifying the economic contraction and, in turn, exacerbating financial distress. These negative dynamics are creating the perception of intense uncertainty about the future, prompting a loss in confidence that has left households and firms extremely wary about spending. In this environment, government policies to restore confidence, create jobs by boosting the demand for goods and services, and improve the functioning of our financial system, represent our main hope of avoiding a very severe economic contraction. Fortunately, many innovative and bold policy steps have already been implemented, or are being considered, by the Federal Reserve and the federal government, and this provides me with a measure of optimism that we may avoid the significant downside risks that we face.\n\nToday, I will give you my perspective on financial and economic conditions, and discuss the implications for community banks. As always, my comments represent my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nEconomic conditions\n\nLet me turn to the current economic situation. Unfortunately, there is not much good news to report. Over a year into the recession, the U.S. economy is contracting sharply, and that weakness is evident in every sector.\n\nLet’s begin with the largest sector—consumer spending, which represents about 70 percent of gross domestic product. It fell sharply in the third and fourth quarters of last year. As a consequence, retailers experienced a dreadful holiday season and many are now shuttering stores and even declaring bankruptcy. Such retrenchment in consumer spending is understandable, given the truly tough conditions that households face. This morning’s dismal employment data show that nonfarm jobs have declined for 13 months in a row. Since peaking in December 2007, some 3.6 million jobs have been lost. The unemployment rate now stands at 7.6 percent, up from just under 5 percent a year ago. With respect to wealth, the combined impact of falling equity and house prices has been staggering. Household wealth has declined by an estimated $10 trillion. Nor can households easily borrow to fund spending—consumer credit is both costlier and harder to get. Not surprisingly, consumer confidence is at a 30-year low. The recent plunge in vehicle sales, in spite of lower gas prices and huge price incentives, reflects this lack of confidence, as well as the difficulty of getting auto loans. These negative factors far outweigh the boost to consumer spending from the sharp decline in energy prices since the middle of last year.\n\nHouseholds are hunkering down. The personal saving rate has jumped from around zero early last year to about 3½ percent recently, as people have tried to rebuild lost wealth and some cushion to weather adversities, including possible job loss. While more personal saving strengthens household balance sheets and makes sense for individual families, in current circumstances it is magnifying the depth of the economic contraction.\n\nThe steep decline in residential investment that began three years ago was the leading edge of our current economic and financial problems. Unfortunately, there is no end in sight. Housing starts have plummeted over the past year, falling by nearly one-half. It’s hard to see when starts will bottom out, since inventories of unsold new and existing homes remain at high levels relative to sales. Indeed, the possibility of ongoing contraction in this sector is intensified by the economic downturn, the loss in jobs, and the reduced availability of mortgage credit. With the demise of the market for private-label mortgage-backed securities, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are now the main sources of funding for conventional conforming mortgages. Virtually the only piece of good news for housing is that interest rates on these mortgages have come down recently in response to a new Federal Reserve program to purchase agency debt and agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities. However, the spreads above Treasury rates charged to borrowers seeking nonconforming jumbos have risen sharply, and mortgages are all but unavailable to borrowers with imperfect credit histories or those who can’t make large down payments.\n\nEven beyond its negative implications for the pace of home construction, the ongoing decline in house prices is a concern because it poses downside risks to future consumer spending and the health of the financial system. House prices in some of the largest metropolitan areas are down by as much as 35 to 40 percent from their 2006 peak. Unfortunately, futures contracts for house prices suggest that further declines are likely this year and next. The correction in house prices has contributed to delinquencies and foreclosures on subprime and other mortgages. With an estimated 15 to 20 percent of homeowners underwater on their mortgages, it is likely that foreclosures will continue at a rapid pace throughout this year. The associated losses are seriously weakening banks and the financial system more broadly. And, of course, foreclosures are extremely painful for homeowners and create negative spillovers for neighbors and afflicted communities.\n\nBusiness capital investment is also dropping sharply, as firms face weak demand for their products, a higher cost of capital, restricted credit, and a high level of uncertainty about the future. With regard to credit, many companies, especially those with lower credit ratings, must now pay extraordinarily high rates in the bond market. Bank lines of credit are more difficult to negotiate, trade credit is being restricted, and many firms have become cautious in managing liquidity and in committing to capital spending projects. Some companies are drawing down existing credit lines to have cash on hand in case these lines are capped by their banks. It is not surprising that many of my business contacts report cancelling or delaying capital investment plans and paring back on their workforces in order to avoid being locked into commitments that might prove burdensome.\n\nNonresidential construction declined modestly at the end of last year but, surprisingly enough, has not yet shown the steep declines that have been expected for some time. However, such declines are almost surely imminent. With business activity slowing and new buildings coming on line, vacancy rates on office, industrial, and retail space are all on the rise. For developers, financing is indeed extremely hard to get. The market for commercial mortgage-backed securities has all but dried up. Banks and other traditional lenders have also become less willing to extend funding. It’s no wonder that my contacts are talking about substantial cutbacks on new projects and planned capital improvements on existing buildings. I know that this sector is of special interest to many community banks, and I will have more to say about this later in my presentation.\n\nThe budgets of many state and local governments have been thrown into crisis by the financial and economic mess. The downturns in housing, the stock market, and incomes have bitten into tax collections at the same time that financial market turmoil has made it harder to issue bonds. The aggregate budget deficit for the 50 states as a whole is growing. In response, many states are cutting spending. Of course, the Obama administration’s plans for fiscal stimulus include a large dose of funding for state and local projects, and this should provide considerable support to this sector.\n\nUnfortunately, the economic downturn is hardly confined to the United States. Economic growth in the rest of the world—including Europe and Japan—has weakened sharply for a number of reasons, including spillovers from the U.S. recession and the financial meltdown that now has spread globally. For these reasons, the world economy appears to have entered recession in late 2008, and it seems likely that this contraction may last for some time, especially in some important industrial countries. Moreover, the dollar has appreciated over the past year, especially against the euro and the British pound, making U.S. exports more expensive. It is apparent that we cannot count on strong foreign demand for our exports to offset weakness in domestic demand. Indeed, real exports fell sharply in the final quarter of last year after years of strong growth.\n\nNow, let me to turn to inflation. Not so long ago soaring commodity prices were pushing inflation to unacceptably high rates. However, things have changed dramatically, as weaker economic activity around the world has reduced the demand for commodities, pushing their prices, and inflationary pressures, down substantially. At the same time, rising unemployment and unused industrial capacity are also putting downward pressure on inflation. Thus, in the final quarter of last year, our main measure of consumer inflation—the personal consumption expenditures price index—fell at a 5½-percent rate; and when excluding food and energy prices, this measure rose at only a ½-percent rate, the slowest pace since early 1961. With slack in labor and product markets likely to build significantly over the next couple of years, it seems likely that inflation will remain, for some time, below levels that are consistent with price stability.\n\nAs I have indicated, the economy is in the midst of a downward spiral, and that calls for strong policy responses. Economic weakness and a shortage of credit are inducing increasingly cautious households and businesses to spend less to strengthen their balance sheets and “weather the storm.” These spending cuts serve to spread the pain, triggering additional job losses that damage spending and intensifying the distress that weakens the financial system. The case for policy actions—by both the monetary and fiscal authorities—to arrest this cycle and reverse the downward spiral is exceptionally strong. There’s no question that the spiral presents extraordinary challenges for policymakers—challenges that, in my view, are the most significant and complex since the Great Depression. However, I am encouraged that bold actions are being taken both here and abroad.\n\nTo address the crisis, the Federal Reserve has taken a panoply of strong actions. In particular, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has cut its federal funds rate target by roughly 5 full percentage points, establishing a target range of 0 to ¼ percent at its December meeting. Although, for all practical purposes, this interest rate cannot be pushed any lower, the Fed also announced after both its December and January meetings that an exceptionally low level of the federal funds rate would likely be warranted for some time due to weak economic conditions. By offering guidance about the likely course of future short-term interest rates, conditional on the Committee’s economic forecast, the Committee hopes to influence longer-term interest rates and asset prices, which in turn affect the spending decisions of households and firms.\n\nBeyond interest-rate policy, the Fed is using other tools to improve the functioning of financial markets and to lower longer-term interest rates in support of private spending. A variety of new nonconventional programs rely on the Fed’s balance sheet. These programs serve two basic purposes. First, they provide a reliable source of liquidity to financial institutions and markets so that they are more willing to extend credit. Second, these programs directly augment the flow of credit to the private sector.\n\nTo fulfill our role in providing liquidity, we have crossed traditional boundaries by extending the maturity of loans, the range of acceptable collateral, and the range of eligible borrowing institutions. As one example, we introduced a new auction system—called the Term Auction Facility (TAF)—to distribute discount window loans more effectively. We also have greatly expanded the size of the auctions and the maturity of the allowable loans to address a persistent shortage of term funding in the money markets. In addition, we established a discount window facility for primary dealers and new facilities to provide liquidity to money market mutual funds and the commercial paper market. We have also supported the provision of dollar liquidity beyond our own shores through a vast expansion of our network of swap lines with foreign central banks. Interest rates in a number of key money markets have come down in recent months, and in my judgment, the suite of facilities that the Fed has created to improve money market conditions is working.\n\nTo directly improve the flow of credit to the private sector, the Fed announced several new programs in November. In support of the housing sector, the Fed created a $600 billion program to purchase agency debt and agency-insured mortgage-backed securities. Yields on mortgage-backed securities and 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell substantially right after the program was announced, and these rates fell again when the first purchases were made in January. The Fed has developed another very promising program jointly with the Treasury to help restore functioning in other impaired financial markets, called the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF). It will support the issuance of securities collateralized by auto, student, credit card, and SBA, or Small Business Administration loans—sectors where the issuance of new securities has slowed to a trickle. This approach has the potential to be expanded substantially, with higher lending volumes and additional asset classes, such as commercial mortgage-backed securities.\n\nNow I’d like to say a few words about the role of fiscal policy in the current crisis. Fiscal policy must play two distinct roles. First, it is needed to help restore the financial system to better health. Much has been done already in this arena through the TARP, which has provided capital to the banking system to stabilize it and encourage more lending, as well as funding for the TALF program with the Federal Reserve, and guarantees against losses for several systemically important financial institutions including Citigroup, Bank of America and AIG. Further actions are still needed, however, to get credit flowing. The Administration is expected to soon propose a comprehensive program to help banks address the bad assets on their balance sheets and assist homeowners in avoiding preventable foreclosures. A lesson from past experience with banking crises around the globe is that the removal of bad assets from bank balance sheets, along with the injection of new capital, is needed to restore health to the banking system. As long as hard-to-value, troubled assets clog their balance sheets, banks find it difficult to attract private capital and to focus on new lending.\n\nThe second role for fiscal policy is to provide stimulus to the economy through higher spending and tax cuts. In ordinary circumstances, there are good reasons why monetary, rather than fiscal, policy should be used to stabilize the economy. An important argument against using fiscal policy to fight recessions is that it often takes a long time to implement due to the complexity of executive and legislative decision-making processes and the lags involved in spending the money that Congress appropriates. The result is that fiscal stimulus sometimes kicks in only after the need has passed. However, the current situation is extraordinary, making the case for fiscal action very strong.\n\nOf course, a fiscal stimulus package, involving a combination of tax cuts and spending increases, is a top priority for the new Obama administration and is now moving through Congress. There is—and there should be—vigorous debate about the form it should take and about the likely effectiveness of particular fiscal strategies. However, it is critical that decisions on these matters be made on a timely basis so that the economy’s downward spiral is not allowed to deepen.\n\nPolicy actions by the Fed and federal government that have already been taken, and that seem to be in train, offer the prospect that we may be able to avoid dire outcomes for the economy. My best guess is that we may see economic activity begin to grow late this year as housing construction stabilizes and the financial sector begins to heal. But substantial downside risks remain.\n\nBanking conditions\n\nYou are all well aware that current circumstances create formidable problems for banking organizations. For some time now, institutions have been taking losses on their holdings of residential mortgages and securities, and on their residential construction and development loans. In addition, losses have been incurred because of exposure to other financial institutions and off-balance-sheet vehicles that were damaged by those same housing-related assets. Moreover, as the recession has deepened, we have seen rising credit problems in traditional commercial and consumer loan portfolios. As a result, many banks are taking large provisions for expected losses. Judging from the data so far, it appears likely that the commercial banking industry will incur a significant loss in the fourth quarter, and that the results for 2008 as a whole will be the weakest since at least the banking crisis of the early 1990s.\n\nTraditionally, the crest of bank credit losses has extended for some time beyond the end of recessions. This is not surprising, given that the unemployment rate typically peaks well after business cycle troughs. As a result, and given the outlook for the economy, I would expect to see more deterioration in corporate, commercial real estate, and consumer portfolios over the course of this year and into next year. How well any individual bank fares during this especially difficult credit cycle will depend on the quality of its past and present underwriting; ongoing risk management practices; and the profitability of its core lending, deposit-taking, and fee-generating operations.\n\nMany community banks have significant commercial real estate concentrations, and these loans are a particular concern in the current environment. At present, the performance of such loans has deteriorated only mildly. But, as I suggested earlier, we can’t count on that situation to continue, since the downturn in commercial real estate construction is just getting started and is likely to be quite challenging.\n\nOne saving grace is that many commercial real estate loans currently do not have the same characteristics that infected the residential real estate boom or the commercial real estate cycles in the early 1980s and 1990s. In recent years, underwriting standards on commercial real estate loans generally have been fairly conservative. By and large, lenders have focused on making loans supported by significant cash flow and have required relatively conservative loan-to-value ratios. The equity cushions on many of these loans, coupled with low interest rates, should give borrowers quite a bit of “breathing room.” Still, as commercial real estate loans and related securities are refinanced amid rising vacancies, falling collateral values, and an economic recession, we can expect higher delinquencies, defaults, and losses.\n\nThis situation represents an obvious challenge to risk-management practices, putting a premium on active monitoring and stress-testing. These stress tests can provide bank management with advance warnings of the potential effects of higher-than-expected vacancies and falling collateral values on their borrowers’ ability to perform and on the bank’s potential losses. This analysis in turn can be used to evaluate the full effect of a commercial real estate concentration on the bank’s earnings and capital, and lead to better decision-making throughout the cycle.\n\nLarge real estate losses could put pressure on capital levels and should therefore prompt banks to review their dividend policies. In this highly volatile period, when future, but currently unidentified, losses are highly likely and capital markets are still not functioning well, capital maintenance is critical.\n\nIn addition, banks must be attentive to liquidity. Over the past year, we have seen that large and small banks alike can be extremely vulnerable to losses in confidence, and that past choices in funding a bank’s operations may severely constrain efforts to take corrective action. Even multiple sources of liquidity can dry up at the same time, undermining the effectiveness of contingency plans for maintaining access to funding. Many community banks have relied significantly on Federal Home Loan Bank advances and brokered deposits. While these sources of funds can be managed, they do pose risks. For example, the amount of a bank’s borrowing capacity can quickly decline when Home Loan Bank collateral margin requirements tighten. Similarly, institutions whose capital ratios fall from the well-capitalized category to the adequately capitalized category may not be permitted to acquire or roll over brokered deposits, resulting in liquidity strains.\n\nAs I have indicated, the work of public officials to stabilize the financial system and improve the flow of credit should help banks meet challenges in these tougher economic times. The measures taken by the Fed, Treasury, and the FDIC have buttressed public confidence, provided new sources of liquidity, and helped cushion banks from losses. All of these special measures reflect a recognition that banking organizations play a unique and essential role in the U.S. economy.\n\nIt’s also important to acknowledge that banking organizations find themselves under intense scrutiny and are subject to conflicting pressures. At a time of nearly unparalleled challenges for financial institutions, you find yourselves called on simultaneously to preserve capital, avoid excessive risk, and step up your lending. Policymakers are mindful how difficult it can be to balance those mandates. In November, the Fed, the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift Supervision issued a joint statement to help banks and thrifts navigate these waters. The statement noted that “at this critical time, it is imperative that all banking organizations and their regulators work together to ensure that the needs of creditworthy borrowers are met.” The statement also noted that “prudent bank lending practices” should be carried out “consistent with safety and soundness principles and existing supervisory standards.”\n\nThe policy objective has been to equip banking organizations to serve the needs of creditworthy borrowers by augmenting their capital, providing FDIC guarantees of debt, enhanced deposit insurance, and better access to liquidity. In the current circumstances, banks, like households and firms, may be tempted to hunker down. My hope is that, while avoiding imprudent practices that would put your institutions at risk, you will also resist extreme risk aversion, since it would undermine efforts to get the economy going again.\n\nIn sum, 2009 is shaping up to be, by many measures, the most challenging economic environment of the postwar period. At the same time though, the vigorous application of monetary and fiscal policy offer the prospect of improvement. I am hopeful that the steps policymakers are taking will stabilize the financial system and provide the broader economy with a foundation for renewed growth.\n\n# # #\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1.

        "content": "\n\nWatch Video\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for inviting me to speak to you today. I am very pleased that one of my first speeches of the year is to the Financial Women’s Association.  Those of you who work in the financial sector are keenly aware of the problems we now face in the financial markets and the economy, and I very much welcome your questions and insights.\n\nAs you all know, sound, well-functioning financial markets and institutions are essential to a sound, well-functioning economy. They provide the credit that firms require to finance inventory, hire workers, and invest in new capital equipment and that households need to buy houses and cars and to send their kids to college.\n\nToday, financial markets have, in many cases, broken down and the ramifications for the economy have been severe due to the essential interconnections between the two: Financial distress precipitated a credit crunch, sending the economy into recession. And weakness in the economy has intensified financial distress, further diminishing access to credit. These ongoing, negative dynamics create severe downside economic risks, and the perception of intense uncertainty about the future has prompted a loss in confidence, leaving households and firms wary about spending. For example, consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on durable goods, to save more, and businesses are cancelling capital investment plans and laying off workers to preserve cash. Such actions are sensible on an individual basis, but they intensify economic distress for the economy as a whole.\n\nI consider it imperative for policymakers to act boldly to restore confidence and improve the functioning of financial markets in order to get the economy back on its feet.  The Federal Reserve has already implemented aggressive, creative, and substantial policies, and more can be done. In addition, there is now a consensus that the economy needs strong fiscal action, and prospects are good that a federal stimulus program will be forthcoming. Finally, I am heartened that policymakers around the world are responding forcefully and cooperatively to address the financial and economic crisis as it has spread throughout the global economy. My goal today is to give you my perspective on the financial and economic turmoil and to discuss and explain the policy responses and their rationales. As always, my comments represent my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nEconomic conditions\n\nI will begin with a review of current economic conditions. Unfortunately, there is not much good news to report. Recent data indicate that, over a year into the current recession, the U.S. economy is still contracting sharply. For example, the latest Blue Chip consensus estimates that output declined at an annual rate of over 5 percent last quarter and is likely to continue contracting, at a pace exceeding 3 percent, in the current quarter.\n\nEconomic weakness is evident in every sector of the economy. After declining slightly in the third quarter, real personal consumption expenditures appear to have fallen more sharply in the fourth. Such retrenchment in consumer spending is understandable, given the truly tough conditions that households face, but especially troubling because this sector represents over 70 percent of GDP. With respect to jobs, employment has declined for twelve months in a row, and the unemployment rate now stands at 7¼ percent up from 5 percent just a year ago.  With respect to wealth, the combined impact of falling equity and house prices has been staggering. Household wealth has declined by an estimated $10 trillion. With respect to consumer credit, it is both costlier and harder to get. Not surprisingly, consumer confidence is at a 30-year low and the personal saving rate is on the rise, as people try to rebuild their wealth and provide a cushion against the possibility of job loss. The recent plunge in vehicle sales, in spite of lower gas prices and huge price incentives, reflects this lack of confidence as well as the difficulties people are having in getting auto loans.\n\nBusiness spending is also feeling the crunch, as firms face weak demand for their products, a higher cost of capital, and restricted credit.  In particular, many companies, especially those with lower credit ratings, are experiencing difficulty borrowing in the commercial paper market, an important source of short-term funding. Bank lines of credit reportedly are more difficult to negotiate, trade credit is being restricted, and many firms have become cautious in managing liquidity and in committing to capital spending projects. Some companies are drawing down existing credit lines to have cash on hand in case these lines are capped by their bank. This caution has spread to venture capital spending as well, where activity has dropped significantly; in consequence, information technology and biotech companies in Silicon Valley and elsewhere are scaling back on business expansion plans.\n\nNonresidential construction, surprisingly enough, has continued to show some growth up to this point, but this is not likely to last much longer. I’m hearing talk about substantial cutbacks on new projects and planned capital improvements on existing buildings for two all-too-familiar reasons—demand is falling as the economy weakens and financing is hard to get. In particular, the market for commercial mortgage-backed securities, a mainstay for financing large projects, has all but dried up. Banks and other traditional lenders have also become less willing to extend funding.\n\nAlthough residential investment accounts for under 5 percent of overall economic activity, the decline in this sector over the past three years has been big enough to create a major drag on growth. Housing starts have plummeted, falling to nearly one-half of their year-ago level, and it is hard to see when they will bottom out, since inventories of unsold new and existing homes remain at high levels relative to sales.  Indeed, the possibility of ongoing contraction in this sector is intensified by the economic downturn, the loss in jobs, and the reduced availability of mortgage credit. At this point, the market for private-label mortgage-backed securities is essentially closed for business, leaving the government agencies, especially Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as the main source of funding or backing for conventional conforming mortgages. One piece of good news is that interest rates on conforming mortgages have come down recently in response to a new Federal Reserve program to purchase agency debt and significant quantities of agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities.\n\nThe ongoing decline in house prices is a source of particular concern not only because of its impact on consumer spending, but also because it contributes importantly to delinquencies and foreclosures on subprime and other mortgages. Foreclosures are extremely painful for homeowners and create negative spillovers for neighbors and afflicted communities. As you may know, some of the earliest and sharpest price declines nationwide occurred in parts of California and other western states, such as Arizona and Nevada. Foreclosure rates in these states are well above their historic highs dating back at least to the late 1970s, and home prices in the largest metro areas are down by as much as 35 to 40 percent from their 2006 peak. Unfortunately, futures contracts for house prices suggest that further declines are likely this year and next.\n\nMany state and local governments have been dragged into the financial mess. The downturns in the housing markets and the economy have bitten into tax collections at the same time that the financial market turmoil has made it harder to issue bonds. These problems are particularly acute in California. Despite a successful bond issuance in October, ongoing erosion in revenues has raised the possibility that the state will run out of money in February. The latest projection is for a deficit of about $40 billion that will accumulate over the current and next fiscal year. This is a huge shortfall relative to annual revenue of $100 billion, and the actions needed to overcome it are only likely to add to the recession in the state.\n\nMoving from the local to the global, the situation is not much brighter. The strong foreign demand for our exports that gave a major boost to the U.S. economy through the third quarter of last year is not likely to continue. Economic growth in the rest of the world, particularly in Europe and Japan, has weakened sharply for a number of reasons, including spillovers from the U.S. recession and from the financial meltdown that now has spread globally. In addition, the dollar has appreciated against the euro and British pound over the past year, offsetting a portion of the depreciation that was supporting U.S. exports. For these reasons, it now looks likely that the data will show worldwide recession in late 2008 and early 2009, with a more severe and long-lasting contraction in many industrial countries. \n \nTo conclude my review of current conditions, let me to turn to inflation. Not so long ago we were worried about rising inflation in the wake of soaring commodity prices. Those days are gone. Weaker economic activity around the world has reduced the demand for commodities, pushing their prices, and inflationary pressures, down substantially. At the same time, rising unemployment and unused industrial capacity are also putting downward pressure on inflation. In fact, with slack in labor and product markets likely to build significantly over the next couple of years, it seems likely that inflation will move, for a time, below levels that are consistent with price stability.\n\nConventional Federal Reserve policies\n\nBy now, I hope my remarks have made it clear that the interaction between the financial shock and the recession, as well as the associated crisis in confidence, present extraordinary challenges for policymakers—challenges that certainly are the most significant and complex since the deep recession in 1980-82, and perhaps since the Great Depression.  An important lesson from both theory and history is that such circumstances call for prompt and aggressive policy action.  I believe we have heeded that lesson, responding vigorously.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has cut its federal funds rate target by roughly 5 full percentage points, lowering it essentially to its “zero bound,” by establishing a target range of 0 to ¼ percent at its meeting last December.\n\nFederal Reserve communications policy\n\nObviously, with the funds rate at the zero bound, the Committee cannot push it any lower to stimulate the economy.  But that does not mean that the Committee is out of options.  An extensive body of literature suggests that communications can play a helpful role in addressing the zero-bound constraint. In particular, by offering guidance about the likely course of future short-term interest rates, conditional on the Committee’s economic forecast, the Fed may be able to influence longer-term rates and asset prices.  The Fed employed such an approach between 2003 and 2005, and has taken an important step along the same path in its December announcement by stating that “exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate” are likely to be warranted “for some time” due to “weak economic conditions.”\n\nCommunication also can be important in the Fed’s efforts to anchor long-term inflation expectations. As I mentioned at the outset, the odds are high that over the next few years, inflation will decline below desirable levels.  It is especially important in such circumstances for the Fed to emphasize its commitment to returning inflation over time to the higher levels that are most appropriate to the attainment of its longer-term objectives. A decline in inflationary expectations when economic conditions are weak is pernicious, especially so when the federal funds rate has reached the zero bound, because any downdrift in inflation expectations leads to an updrift in real interest rates and a tightening of financial conditions.\n\nOver the past few years, the FOMC has taken important incremental steps toward making its longer-term inflation goals more explicit.  For example, we are now publishing FOMC members’ inflation forecasts for the next three years under the assumption of “appropriate monetary policy,” and the publication of such forecasts has helped shape public understanding concerning the range of inflation outcomes that FOMC members regard as desirable in the longer term.  Looking forward, there could be scope for the Committee to improve the clarity of these communications.  I am optimistic that, by clearly communicating the Fed’s commitment to low and stable inflation and by backing that commitment up with determined policy actions should the need arise, any deflationary pressures caused by the weak economy can be contained.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s balance sheet policies\n\nBeyond interest rate policy, the Fed has other tools at its disposal to improve the functioning of financial markets and to lower longer-term interest rates to support private spending.  Indeed, the Fed has done a lot already through “nonconventional” programs that use its balance sheet.  These programs serve two main purposes: first, to provide a reliable source of liquidity to financial institutions and markets and second, to augment the flow of credit to the private sector.\n\nThe provision of liquidity is important to prevent “runs” that create systemic risks to the economy as a whole.  The Federal Reserve has long fulfilled this “lender of last resort” function for commercial banks, which have been protected both with access to the Fed’s discount window and deposit insurance.  In the current crisis, however, systemic risk has been a concern for some financial institutions outside the commercial banking sector.   I am referring particularly to institutions comprising the so-called “shadow banking sector.”  This sector includes investment banks that commonly finance their securities portfolios through very short-term repurchase agreements with money market mutual funds and Structured Investment Vehicles (SIVs) and conduits—entities that issue short-term asset-backed commercial paper to fund holdings of higher-yielding asset-backed securities.  Entities like these subject the economy to systemic risk, because, like banks, they are subject to runs.  Indeed, any institution, however sound, that borrows very short to hold a portfolio of longer-term, illiquid assets may be unable to satisfy the demands of their lenders for repayment when they flee en masse.  \n \nThe Fed’s balance sheet programs are also intended to augment the flow of credit to households and firms, thereby offsetting, at least in part, the reduced flow of credit from financial institutions and markets.  One reason that the availability of credit has diminished is because the markets for most asset-backed securities, with the exception of agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities, are highly impaired so that issuance has diminished to a trickle.  A second cause of the credit crunch is that financial institutions, especially those in the shadow banking sector are scaling back their balance sheets.  These institutions suffer from a shortage of capital—or, to put it another way, are too highly leveraged.  Unfortunately, the commercial banking sector is unable to pick up all of the slack, in spite of the recent capital injections they have received, because banks are afflicted with losses from write-downs of impaired assets and mounting credit losses, particularly on real estate loans.\n \nI’d like to next sketch out some of the programs that the Fed has already put in place to provide liquidity and increase the flow of credit and address some frequently asked questions about the Fed’s unconventional policies:  Are they working?  What is the scope for expanding these policies?  How does the Fed’s approach compare to the quantitative easing policy implemented by the Bank of Japan between 2001 and 2006?\n\nTo fulfill our role in providing liquidity to financial institutions and markets, we have crossed traditional boundaries by extending the maturity of the loans, the range of acceptable collateral, and the range of eligible borrowing institutions.  We introduced a new auction system—called the Term Auction Facility (TAF)—to distribute discount window loans more effectively, and then greatly expanded the size and term of the auctions to address a persistent shortage of term funding in the money markets.  We have also supported the provision of dollar liquidity beyond our own shores through a vast expansion of our network of swap lines with foreign central banks.\n\nWe realized early on that stabilizing the financial system would require lending not only to institutions in the traditional banking sector but also to those in the shadow banking sector.  Doing so required invoking section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, which authorizes lending to nonbanks only in “unusual and exigent circumstances.”  For example, it was used to facilitate the acquisition of Bear Stearns and to stabilize AIG and Citigroup—three systemically important financial firms.  This authority was also used to establish a discount window facility for primary dealers—the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF)—and a new facility to enhance the ability of primary dealers to finance their securities inventories through the market for repurchase agreements—the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF).\n\nThe collapse of Lehman and the near-collapse of AIG this past fall triggered severe disruptions in short-term money markets, as investors in prime money market mutual funds fled to the safety of the shortest-term Treasury securities to the point that the three-month T-bill rate hovered near zero. These disruptions also triggered dysfunction in the commercial paper market, a large and important source of short-term financing for both financial and nonfinancial corporations.  In response, the Fed set up new facilities to provide liquidity to money market funds and the commercial paper market.\n\nIn my judgment, the suite of facilities that the Fed has created to improve money market conditions is working.  Conditions are still abnormal, but money market functioning has improved markedly relative to the dark days of last September and October.  For example, term Libor rates have declined along with the spreads of these rates over the federal funds rate.  Since term Libor rates are a benchmark for many adjustable-rate loans, including mortgages, the benefits of these reductions are rippling throughout the private sector.  For highly rated commercial paper eligible for the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF), spreads have also narrowed substantially.\n\nTo improve the flow of credit to the private sector, the Federal Reserve announced several new programs in November.  In this arena there remains considerable scope for further action.  In particular, in support of the housing sector, the Fed announced and commenced a $600 billion program to purchase agency debt and agency-insured mortgage-backed securities.  Yields on mortgage-backed securities and 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell substantially right after the program was announced, and these rates fell again when the first purchases were made earlier this month.  Moreover, there has been an upsurge in refinancing activity in recent weeks.  The FOMC could also expand its purchases of longer-term Treasury debt, which might lower government borrowing rates and spill over into private borrowing rates more broadly.\n\nThe Fed has developed another very promising program to help restore functioning in other impaired financial markets.  It is called the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), and it will support the issuance of securities collateralized by auto, student, credit card, and SBA, or Small Business Administration loans—sectors where the issuance of new securities has slowed to a trickle.  The high borrowing spreads on such securities, even when the underlying loans are government-guaranteed—as in the case of SBA and many student loans—suggest not only heightened credit risk but also an impairment of market liquidity which the facilities can address.  By improving the functioning of markets for securitized assets, the Fed has the potential to boost private-sector credit flows in support of the economy. This new facility is a joint Fed-Treasury initiative; cooperation with the Treasury is necessary because the program entails some risk of loss and, under the Federal Reserve Act, all Fed lending must be appropriately secured.\n\nThe approach employed by the TALF has the potential to be expanded substantially, with higher lending volumes and additional asset classes, such as commercial and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities.  As I noted, these markets have all but dried up since the credit crisis began, and the shortage of credit in these critical sectors has made private borrowing costs exceptionally high. \n \nThe use of the Fed’s balance sheet to stimulate the economy might seem quite a lot like the “quantitative easing” policy pursued by the Bank of Japan in the early 2000s, when it was at the zero bound.  However, to my mind, the differences outweigh the similarities.  The main similarity is that the Fed, like the Bank of Japan, has increased the total quantity of bank reserves well above the minimum level required to push overnight interbank lending rates—in our case, the federal funds rate—to the vicinity of the zero bound.  The creation of such a large volume of reserves, in the Fed’s case, results from the enormous expansion in discount window lending, foreign exchange swaps, and asset purchases through our various liquidity facilities.  In the Bank of Japan’s case, the expansion in reserves resulted from the deliberate adoption of an explicit numerical target for them.  The concept underlying the Bank of Japan’s intervention was that banks might be encouraged to lend by replacing their holdings of short-term government securities with excess cash.  However, near the zero bound, short-term government securities and cash are almost perfect substitutes, so exchanging one for the other should have little effect on banks’ desire to lend.  And the Japanese experience suggests that simply expanding bank reserves—even by a very large amount—had little effect on bank lending or on the economy more broadly.\n\nThe consequence of all of the Fed’s balance sheet initiatives is that our balance sheet has ballooned from about $900 billion at the beginning of 2008 to more than $2 trillion currently—and is rising.  However, the impact of the totality of Fed programs should not be judged by the overall size of the Fed’s balance sheet.  Instead, that size will be the result of decisions concerning the appropriate scale of each particular program and the extent to which the various programs and facilities are actually used by market participants. The take-up rates on these programs and facilities are likely to fluctuate over time as market conditions change.  For example, early in a new Fed lending program, its impact on economic activity might rise with the associated expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet. Later on, if the program helps to improve the functioning of the private market, success could be associated with the contraction of the Fed’s balance sheet as the Fed exits from the market, leaving the determination of credit flows to private participants.  Furthermore, the mere availability of backup liquidity through a facility may improve market functioning, even if the volume of borrowing is low.\n\nFiscal policy\n\nI’d like to conclude by stepping a bit outside the scope of monetary policy to say a few words about the role of fiscal policy in the current crisis.  In ordinary circumstances, there are good reasons why monetary, rather than fiscal, policy should be used for stabilization purposes. But we are in extraordinary circumstances, and the case for substantial fiscal stimulus over the next few years is very strong.  First, as I have indicated, with the economy contracting significantly, it is time to “pull out all the stops”—that is, to deploy both monetary and fiscal policy—to avoid a deep and lingering recession.  Second, the case for fiscal stimulus is strengthened by the fact that monetary policy has already moved its short-term interest rate essentially to zero.\n \nIn fact, a substantial fiscal stimulus package is now under consideration by the incoming Obama administration and the Congress, and there will be—and should be—vigorous debate about the form it should take and about the likely effectiveness of particular fiscal strategies.  While engaging in that debate is not my job today, I would note that fiscal policy can play two logically distinct roles in the present crisis.  The first is to support aggregate demand. Of course, we don’t know the full details of the bill that will be passed, but the proposed legislation would provide for considerable stimulus—a combination of tax cuts and spending increases perhaps totaling nearly $800 billion.\n\nThe second role, which is important in the current crisis, is to address the maladies that now afflict the financial sector.  Indeed, fiscal resources have already been deployed to bolster the capital of the banking system, to stabilize systemically important institutions, and to support programs designed to assist homeowners and mitigate foreclosure.  Fiscal policy can play a further supportive role in unclogging credit market flows.  I have already mentioned one example: the TALF, which is a joint program between the Fed and the Treasury that uses funds from the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) and is designed to improve the flow of credit to households and businesses.\n\nThe resolution of financial sector difficulties, and the stimulus to aggregate demand in our economy, are essential for a return to sustained growth, and I am heartened that the Fed and other policymakers in the U.S. and around the world are taking bold steps.\n\n# # #\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1.

        "content": "\n\nWatch Video\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for inviting me to speak to you today. I am very pleased that one of my first speeches of the year is to the Financial Women’s Association.  Those of you who work in the financial sector are keenly aware of the problems we now face in the financial markets and the economy, and I very much welcome your questions and insights.\n\nAs you all know, sound, well-functioning financial markets and institutions are essential to a sound, well-functioning economy. They provide the credit that firms require to finance inventory, hire workers, and invest in new capital equipment and that households need to buy houses and cars and to send their kids to college.\n\nToday, financial markets have, in many cases, broken down and the ramifications for the economy have been severe due to the essential interconnections between the two: Financial distress precipitated a credit crunch, sending the economy into recession. And weakness in the economy has intensified financial distress, further diminishing access to credit. These ongoing, negative dynamics create severe downside economic risks, and the perception of intense uncertainty about the future has prompted a loss in confidence, leaving households and firms wary about spending. For example, consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on durable goods, to save more, and businesses are cancelling capital investment plans and laying off workers to preserve cash. Such actions are sensible on an individual basis, but they intensify economic distress for the economy as a whole.\n\nI consider it imperative for policymakers to act boldly to restore confidence and improve the functioning of financial markets in order to get the economy back on its feet.  The Federal Reserve has already implemented aggressive, creative, and substantial policies, and more can be done. In addition, there is now a consensus that the economy needs strong fiscal action, and prospects are good that a federal stimulus program will be forthcoming. Finally, I am heartened that policymakers around the world are responding forcefully and cooperatively to address the financial and economic crisis as it has spread throughout the global economy. My goal today is to give you my perspective on the financial and economic turmoil and to discuss and explain the policy responses and their rationales. As always, my comments represent my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nEconomic conditions\n\nI will begin with a review of current economic conditions. Unfortunately, there is not much good news to report. Recent data indicate that, over a year into the current recession, the U.S. economy is still contracting sharply. For example, the latest Blue Chip consensus estimates that output declined at an annual rate of over 5 percent last quarter and is likely to continue contracting, at a pace exceeding 3 percent, in the current quarter.\n\nEconomic weakness is evident in every sector of the economy. After declining slightly in the third quarter, real personal consumption expenditures appear to have fallen more sharply in the fourth. Such retrenchment in consumer spending is understandable, given the truly tough conditions that households face, but especially troubling because this sector represents over 70 percent of GDP. With respect to jobs, employment has declined for twelve months in a row, and the unemployment rate now stands at 7¼ percent up from 5 percent just a year ago.  With respect to wealth, the combined impact of falling equity and house prices has been staggering. Household wealth has declined by an estimated $10 trillion. With respect to consumer credit, it is both costlier and harder to get. Not surprisingly, consumer confidence is at a 30-year low and the personal saving rate is on the rise, as people try to rebuild their wealth and provide a cushion against the possibility of job loss. The recent plunge in vehicle sales, in spite of lower gas prices and huge price incentives, reflects this lack of confidence as well as the difficulties people are having in getting auto loans.\n\nBusiness spending is also feeling the crunch, as firms face weak demand for their products, a higher cost of capital, and restricted credit.  In particular, many companies, especially those with lower credit ratings, are experiencing difficulty borrowing in the commercial paper market, an important source of short-term funding. Bank lines of credit reportedly are more difficult to negotiate, trade credit is being restricted, and many firms have become cautious in managing liquidity and in committing to capital spending projects. Some companies are drawing down existing credit lines to have cash on hand in case these lines are capped by their bank. This caution has spread to venture capital spending as well, where activity has dropped significantly; in consequence, information technology and biotech companies in Silicon Valley and elsewhere are scaling back on business expansion plans.\n\nNonresidential construction, surprisingly enough, has continued to show some growth up to this point, but this is not likely to last much longer. I’m hearing talk about substantial cutbacks on new projects and planned capital improvements on existing buildings for two all-too-familiar reasons—demand is falling as the economy weakens and financing is hard to get. In particular, the market for commercial mortgage-backed securities, a mainstay for financing large projects, has all but dried up. Banks and other traditional lenders have also become less willing to extend funding.\n\nAlthough residential investment accounts for under 5 percent of overall economic activity, the decline in this sector over the past three years has been big enough to create a major drag on growth. Housing starts have plummeted, falling to nearly one-half of their year-ago level, and it is hard to see when they will bottom out, since inventories of unsold new and existing homes remain at high levels relative to sales.  Indeed, the possibility of ongoing contraction in this sector is intensified by the economic downturn, the loss in jobs, and the reduced availability of mortgage credit. At this point, the market for private-label mortgage-backed securities is essentially closed for business, leaving the government agencies, especially Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as the main source of funding or backing for conventional conforming mortgages. One piece of good news is that interest rates on conforming mortgages have come down recently in response to a new Federal Reserve program to purchase agency debt and significant quantities of agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities.\n\nThe ongoing decline in house prices is a source of particular concern not only because of its impact on consumer spending, but also because it contributes importantly to delinquencies and foreclosures on subprime and other mortgages. Foreclosures are extremely painful for homeowners and create negative spillovers for neighbors and afflicted communities. As you may know, some of the earliest and sharpest price declines nationwide occurred in parts of California and other western states, such as Arizona and Nevada. Foreclosure rates in these states are well above their historic highs dating back at least to the late 1970s, and home prices in the largest metro areas are down by as much as 35 to 40 percent from their 2006 peak. Unfortunately, futures contracts for house prices suggest that further declines are likely this year and next.\n\nMany state and local governments have been dragged into the financial mess. The downturns in the housing markets and the economy have bitten into tax collections at the same time that the financial market turmoil has made it harder to issue bonds. These problems are particularly acute in California. Despite a successful bond issuance in October, ongoing erosion in revenues has raised the possibility that the state will run out of money in February. The latest projection is for a deficit of about $40 billion that will accumulate over the current and next fiscal year. This is a huge shortfall relative to annual revenue of $100 billion, and the actions needed to overcome it are only likely to add to the recession in the state.\n\nMoving from the local to the global, the situation is not much brighter. The strong foreign demand for our exports that gave a major boost to the U.S. economy through the third quarter of last year is not likely to continue. Economic growth in the rest of the world, particularly in Europe and Japan, has weakened sharply for a number of reasons, including spillovers from the U.S. recession and from the financial meltdown that now has spread globally. In addition, the dollar has appreciated against the euro and British pound over the past year, offsetting a portion of the depreciation that was supporting U.S. exports. For these reasons, it now looks likely that the data will show worldwide recession in late 2008 and early 2009, with a more severe and long-lasting contraction in many industrial countries. \n \nTo conclude my review of current conditions, let me to turn to inflation. Not so long ago we were worried about rising inflation in the wake of soaring commodity prices. Those days are gone. Weaker economic activity around the world has reduced the demand for commodities, pushing their prices, and inflationary pressures, down substantially. At the same time, rising unemployment and unused industrial capacity are also putting downward pressure on inflation. In fact, with slack in labor and product markets likely to build significantly over the next couple of years, it seems likely that inflation will move, for a time, below levels that are consistent with price stability.\n\nConventional Federal Reserve policies\n\nBy now, I hope my remarks have made it clear that the interaction between the financial shock and the recession, as well as the associated crisis in confidence, present extraordinary challenges for policymakers—challenges that certainly are the most significant and complex since the deep recession in 1980-82, and perhaps since the Great Depression.  An important lesson from both theory and history is that such circumstances call for prompt and aggressive policy action.  I believe we have heeded that lesson, responding vigorously.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has cut its federal funds rate target by roughly 5 full percentage points, lowering it essentially to its “zero bound,” by establishing a target range of 0 to ¼ percent at its meeting last December.\n\nFederal Reserve communications policy\n\nObviously, with the funds rate at the zero bound, the Committee cannot push it any lower to stimulate the economy.  But that does not mean that the Committee is out of options.  An extensive body of literature suggests that communications can play a helpful role in addressing the zero-bound constraint. In particular, by offering guidance about the likely course of future short-term interest rates, conditional on the Committee’s economic forecast, the Fed may be able to influence longer-term rates and asset prices.  The Fed employed such an approach between 2003 and 2005, and has taken an important step along the same path in its December announcement by stating that “exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate” are likely to be warranted “for some time” due to “weak economic conditions.”\n\nCommunication also can be important in the Fed’s efforts to anchor long-term inflation expectations. As I mentioned at the outset, the odds are high that over the next few years, inflation will decline below desirable levels.  It is especially important in such circumstances for the Fed to emphasize its commitment to returning inflation over time to the higher levels that are most appropriate to the attainment of its longer-term objectives. A decline in inflationary expectations when economic conditions are weak is pernicious, especially so when the federal funds rate has reached the zero bound, because any downdrift in inflation expectations leads to an updrift in real interest rates and a tightening of financial conditions.\n\nOver the past few years, the FOMC has taken important incremental steps toward making its longer-term inflation goals more explicit.  For example, we are now publishing FOMC members’ inflation forecasts for the next three years under the assumption of “appropriate monetary policy,” and the publication of such forecasts has helped shape public understanding concerning the range of inflation outcomes that FOMC members regard as desirable in the longer term.  Looking forward, there could be scope for the Committee to improve the clarity of these communications.  I am optimistic that, by clearly communicating the Fed’s commitment to low and stable inflation and by backing that commitment up with determined policy actions should the need arise, any deflationary pressures caused by the weak economy can be contained.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s balance sheet policies\n\nBeyond interest rate policy, the Fed has other tools at its disposal to improve the functioning of financial markets and to lower longer-term interest rates to support private spending.  Indeed, the Fed has done a lot already through “nonconventional” programs that use its balance sheet.  These programs serve two main purposes: first, to provide a reliable source of liquidity to financial institutions and markets and second, to augment the flow of credit to the private sector.\n\nThe provision of liquidity is important to prevent “runs” that create systemic risks to the economy as a whole.  The Federal Reserve has long fulfilled this “lender of last resort” function for commercial banks, which have been protected both with access to the Fed’s discount window and deposit insurance.  In the current crisis, however, systemic risk has been a concern for some financial institutions outside the commercial banking sector.   I am referring particularly to institutions comprising the so-called “shadow banking sector.”  This sector includes investment banks that commonly finance their securities portfolios through very short-term repurchase agreements with money market mutual funds and Structured Investment Vehicles (SIVs) and conduits—entities that issue short-term asset-backed commercial paper to fund holdings of higher-yielding asset-backed securities.  Entities like these subject the economy to systemic risk, because, like banks, they are subject to runs.  Indeed, any institution, however sound, that borrows very short to hold a portfolio of longer-term, illiquid assets may be unable to satisfy the demands of their lenders for repayment when they flee en masse.  \n \nThe Fed’s balance sheet programs are also intended to augment the flow of credit to households and firms, thereby offsetting, at least in part, the reduced flow of credit from financial institutions and markets.  One reason that the availability of credit has diminished is because the markets for most asset-backed securities, with the exception of agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities, are highly impaired so that issuance has diminished to a trickle.

Unfortunately, the commercial banking sector is unable to pick up all of the slack, in spite of the recent capital injections they have received, because banks are afflicted with losses from write-downs of impaired assets and mounting credit losses, particularly on real estate loans.\n \nI’d like to next sketch out some of the programs that the Fed has already put in place to provide liquidity and increase the flow of credit and address some frequently asked questions about the Fed’s unconventional policies:  Are they working?  What is the scope for expanding these policies?

However, the impact of the totality of Fed programs should not be judged by the overall size of the Fed’s balance sheet.

Of course, we don’t know the full details of the bill that will be passed, but the proposed legislation would provide for considerable stimulus—a combination of tax cuts and spending increases perhaps totaling nearly $800 billion.\n\nThe second role, which is important in the current crisis, is to address the maladies that now afflict the financial sector.  Indeed, fiscal resources have already been deployed to bolster the capital of the banking system, to stabilize systemically important institutions, and to support programs designed to assist homeowners and mitigate foreclosure.  Fiscal policy can play a further supportive role in unclogging credit market flows.  I have already mentioned one example: the TALF, which is a joint program between the Fed and the Treasury that uses funds from the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) and is designed to improve the flow of credit to households and businesses.\n\nThe resolution of financial sector difficulties, and the stimulus to aggregate demand in our economy, are essential for a return to sustained growth, and I am heartened that the Fed and other policymakers in the U.S. and around the world are taking bold steps.\n\n# # #\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1.

        "content": "\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nToday the Federal Reserve faces some of the greatest challenges in its history as it strives to restore economic growth, job creation, and financial stability and to preserve price stability. To achieve these policy objectives, the Federal Reserve is committed to using every tool at its disposal.\n\nThe challenges are all too well known. Almost eighteen months since the onset of the now-global financial crisis, the functioning of financial markets remains greatly impaired, and diminished credit flows are impeding the ability of households and firms to borrow and spend. As a consequence, the U.S. economy is undergoing a sharp contraction, with almost two million jobs lost thus far and unemployment poised to rise further in the year ahead. And the adverse feedback loop goes on, as these deteriorating economic conditions, in turn, are intensifying financial sector distress. Regarding price stability, pressures from soaring commodity prices at the onset of the crisis have ebbed dramatically, and inflation is subsiding. Indeed, with growing economic slack, inflation may well decline, for a time, below levels that best promote the dual goals of full employment and price stability.\n\nAn important lesson of theory and history is that circumstances like these call for prompt and aggressive action. And the Federal Reserve has responded vigorously. Since September 2007, the FOMC has cut the federal funds rate target roughly 500 basis points. In December, the Committee took the historic final step of lowering the federal funds rate essentially to its “zero bound,” establishing a target range of 0 to ¼ percent and communicating its expectation that weak economic conditions would likely warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time. This move exhausts the Fed’s ability to provide stimulus through “conventional” monetary policy actions. But it by no means exhausts the Fed’s options to stimulate the economy through other measures. The Committee’s focus going forward will be on “non-conventional” programs that use its balance sheet to improve the functioning of financial markets, an arena where considerable scope for action remains. In my remarks today, I will describe the balance sheet measures that the Fed has already put in place, addressing some frequently asked questions: Have the programs worked? What is the scope for expanding these policies going forward? How does the Fed’s approach compare to the quantitative easing policy implemented by the Bank of Japan between 2001 and 2006? I will also discuss the potential role that enhanced Fed communications might play in helping to achieve both short- and long-run objectives.\n\nTo preview my answers, I will argue that the suite of programs that the Fed has already announced or put in place are an appropriate and creative response to alleviate strains from the ongoing credit crunch. The evidence suggests to me that they have improved liquidity in the money markets and lowered the cost of private credit. Going forward, asset purchases and lending programs could be expanded and extended to additional sectors impacted by the credit crunch. As for the comparison to Japan’s experience, to my mind, the differences outweigh the similarities. Roughly speaking, the Fed is focused on the potential for targeted programs on the “asset side” of its balance sheet to improve credit flows in specific impaired markets, whereas the Bank of Japan was primarily focused on the potential for an expansion of the total quantity of its liabilities—the excess reserves of the banking system—to spur additional bank lending.\n\nThe Fed’s Balance Sheet Policies\n\nSince the onset of the crisis, the Fed has massively expanded the provision of liquidity to financial institutions, thereby easing the broader credit crunch. Serving as lender of last resort is a time-honored function for central banks and is critical in mitigating systemic risk. But in doing so during the current crisis, the Fed has crossed traditional boundaries by extending the maturity of the loans, the range of acceptable collateral, and the range of eligible borrowing institutions. At the onset of the crisis, the Fed encouraged banks to use the discount window. The apparent stigma associated with use of the window, however, discouraged banks from borrowing. To address this problem, the Fed introduced and has substantially expanded a new auction system (the Term Auction Facility or TAF) to distribute discount window loans. Auctions of longer-term (up to 84-day) loans at regular intervals were added to address a persistent shortage of term funding in the money markets, as evidenced, for example, by exceptionally high spreads of term versus overnight Libor loans. To further ease severe liquidity pressures at quarter- and year-end, the Fed introduced a system of forward auctions on TAF loans. In addition, the Fed supported the provision of dollar liquidity beyond our own shores through a vast expansion of its network of swap lines with foreign central banks, raising the size of borrowing lines with existing swap partners and adding additional central banks to the network.\n\nA unique feature of the current financial crisis is that it has engulfed not only the banking system but also an enormous sector comprising the so-called “shadow banking system,” which includes an array of non-bank financial institutions. It was apparent early on that confining the provision of liquidity to depository institutions alone would be insufficient to meet the liquidity needs of the broader financial markets. In response, the Fed invoked, for the first time since the Great Depression, its authority under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act to lend in “unusual and exigent circumstances” to “individuals, partnerships, or corporations” that are “unable to secure adequate credit accommodations from other banking institutions.” Discount window lending under this authority was used to facilitate the acquisition of Bear Stearns and to stabilize AIG and Citigroup—three systemically important financial firms. It has also been invoked to establish a discount window facility for primary dealers (the Primary Dealer Credit Facility or PDCF) and a new facility to enhance the ability of primary dealers to finance their securities inventories through the repo market. This Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF), through an auction mechanism, lends out Treasury securities from the Fed’s own holdings to primary dealers in exchange for investment grade securities. The facility, in effect, offers collateral to dealers for use in repos that is more desirable in the market than most asset-backed securities.\n\nThe Fed’s use of its balance sheet to support the functioning of credit markets expanded dramatically following such events as the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the near-collapse of AIG. Those events triggered severe disruptions in short-term money markets as investors in prime money market funds fled to the safety of the shortest Treasury securities. These disruptions also triggered dysfunction in the commercial paper market, a large and important source of short-term financing for both financial and nonfinancial corporations. Two new facilities (the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF) and Money Market Investor Funding Facility (MMIFF) were introduced to provide backup liquidity to money market mutual funds to help them cope with redemptions that could otherwise cause them to “break the buck.” The AMLF provides nonrecourse discount window loans to banks to enable them to purchase asset-backed commercial paper from money market mutual funds, and the MMIFF provides loans to a private-sector vehicle established to purchase a broad range of assets from these funds.\n\nIn order to restore functioning to the commercial paper market, the Fed has also committed to providing loans to a new Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) that was set up to purchase commercial paper from highly rated (A1P1) issuers. Importantly, the ultimate purpose of all of these facilities is to enhance the provision of credit to a broad range of private borrowers by restoring the liquidity and functioning of short-term money markets.\n\nIn my judgment, the suite of facilities that the Fed has created to improve money market conditions is working to satisfy the financial system’s greatly increased demand for safe assets and liquidity. Conditions are still abnormal, but money market functioning has clearly improved relative to the dark days of last September and October. For example, term Libor rates have declined along with the spreads of these rates over the federal funds rate. Since term Libor rates are a benchmark for many adjustable-rate loans, including mortgages, the benefits of these reductions are rippling throughout the private sector. For highly rated commercial paper, eligible for the CPFF, spreads have also narrowed substantially. In contrast, the borrowing spreads for less highly rated paper (A2P2) remain extremely elevated.\n\nMoving beyond the money markets, interventions have only just begun, and considerable scope remains for targeted asset purchases and discount window lending programs to improve the flow of credit and reduce its cost in sectors that have been severely impacted by the financial crisis. In November, the Fed announced and commenced a $600 billion program to purchase agency debt and agency-insured mortgage-backed securities. A successful initiative in this area could provide significant support to the housing sector. Scope remains for larger interventions, and in December the FOMC reiterated its readiness to expand upon these purchases “as conditions warrant.” Even at this early stage, the program appears to be having an impact. For example, yields on mortgage-backed securities and 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell substantially immediately after the program was announced. The decline in mortgage rates, which also has been affected by a decline in Treasury yields, has prompted an upsurge in refinancing activity in recent weeks. The FOMC could also expand its purchases of longer-term Treasury debt—an initiative that could lower government borrowing rates and spill over into private borrowing rates more broadly. In its December statement, the FOMC noted that it is evaluating the potential benefits of such purchases.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Act confines the System’s outright asset purchases to securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. agencies. Even so, the Fed has the potential to use its balance sheet to restore functioning in other impaired financial markets. The recently announced Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) provides a model for doing so. This new Fed facility is designed to spur lending to meet the credit needs of households and small businesses. The facility will support the issuance of securities collateralized by auto, student, credit card, and Small Business Administration (SBA) loans—sectors where the issuance of new securities has slowed to a trickle. The high borrowing spreads on such securities, even when the underlying loans are government-guaranteed—as in the case of SBA and many student loans—suggest not only heightened credit risk but also an impairment of market liquidity which the facilities can address. The inability of financial institutions to securitize such loans, and of potential investors in such securities to borrow against them on reasonable terms, reflects an important breakdown in credit markets. By improving the functioning of markets for securitized assets, the Fed has the potential to boost private-sector credit flows in support of the economy. Under the TALF, which is a joint Federal Reserve-Treasury initiative, the Fed has agreed to provide nonrecourse loans to holders of eligible highly rated asset-backed securities. Cooperation with the Treasury is necessary because the program entails some risk of loss and, under the Federal Reserve Act, all Fed lending must be appropriately secured. The Treasury has committed $20 billion of TARP funds to protect the Fed against losses on the Fed’s lending commitment of up to $200 billion.\n\nThe approach employed by the TALF can be expanded substantially, with higher lending volumes and additional asset classes covered by the program. Indeed, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury have announced that the facility could be expanded over time to include commercial and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities. Securitization activity in these markets has all but dried up since the credit crisis began, and the shortage of credit in these critical sectors has made private borrowing costs exceptionally high. Along these lines, the FOMC stated that it “will continue to consider ways of using its balance sheet to further support credit markets and economic activity.”\nIt is worth noting that, as the nation’s central bank, the Fed can issue as much currency and bank reserves as required to finance these asset purchases and restore functioning to these markets. Indeed, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has already ballooned from about $900 billion at the beginning of 2008 to more than $2.2 trillion currently—and is rising.\n\nThe Fed’s current “balance sheet approach” to monetary policy creates an entirely new set of policy issues and challenges. For example, the Fed normally eschews interventions that directly affect the allocation of credit, and to a considerable extent, the new facilities rely on financial markets to channel funds to individual borrowers. However, the new facilities do influence credit allocation because they must be targeted at particular sectors of the credit market. In effect, the Fed must judge where to intervene, deciding where market dysfunction is greatest and where adverse consequences for the overall economy are particularly severe. Furthermore, many of the interventions are novel, so no straightforward methods are available to quantify their effectiveness. There are also no clear guidelines for the Fed to gauge the appropriate size of its interventions and few precedents for the Fed to use in communicating its policy stance to the public beyond announcing new programs and describing their terms in detail. Although the purpose of most programs is to lower borrowing costs, the Fed must be careful to avoid the risks that could result from targeting some predetermined yield or spread. Finally, the Fed must ensure that it has an exit strategy to wind down the facilities in a timely and effective way when they are no longer needed. These challenges notwithstanding, I believe that the approaches I have described have considerable potential to contribute to a strong economic recovery.\n\nQuantitative Easing?\n\nOn the surface, it may seem appropriate to equate the Fed’s use of its balance sheet to stimulate the economy with the quantitative easing policy pursued earlier by the Bank of Japan. But as I noted at the outset, the differences outweigh the similarities in my opinion. The main similarity is that the Fed, like the Bank of Japan, has increased the quantity of excess reserves in the banking system well above the minimum level required to push overnight interbank lending rates to the vicinity of zero. The creation of such a large volume of excess reserves, in the Fed’s case, results from the enormous expansion in the Fed’s discount window lending, foreign exchange swaps, and asset purchases. In the Bank of Japan’s case, the expansion in excess reserves resulted from the deliberate adoption of an explicit numerical target for them. The theory underlying the Bank of Japan’s intervention was that banks might be encouraged to lend by replacing their holdings of short-term government securities with excess cash. The problem with this idea is that, near the zero bound, short-term government securities and cash are almost perfect substitutes—both are essentially riskless assets that yield a zero or near-zero rate of return; thus, exchanging one for the other should have little effect on banks’ desire to lend. Indeed, the Japanese experience during their quantitative easing program in the early 2000s suggests that simply expanding excess bank reserves—even by a very large amount—had little effect on bank lending or on the economy more broadly. The policy may have lowered longer-term borrowing rates, however, by symbolizing and highlighting the Bank of Japan’s commitment to fighting deflation by holding its short-term interest rate at zero for an extended time—until deflationary pressures had been convincingly dissipated.\n\nIn contrast, the overall size of assets on the Fed’s balance sheet will be the result of decisions concerning the appropriate scale of each particular program and the extent to which the various programs and facilities are actually used by market participants. The take-up rates on these programs and facilities are likely to fluctuate over time as market conditions change. For example, early in a new Fed lending program, its impact on economic activity might rise with the associated expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet. Later on, if the program helps to improve the functioning of the private market, success could be associated with the contraction of the Fed’s balance sheet as the Fed exits from the market, leaving the determination of credit flows to private participants. Furthermore, the mere availability of backup liquidity through a facility may improve market functioning, even if the volume of borrowing is low. Thus, the impact of the totality of Fed programs should not be judged by the overall size of the Fed’s balance sheet. Rather, it will be necessary to evaluate the success of each individual program in improving market function and facilitating the flow of credit.\n\nFederal Reserve Communications\n\nAn extensive literature and some recent experience suggest that central bank communications may also play a helpful role in addressing the constraints relating to the zero-bound. For example, David Reifschneider and John Williams (2000) and Gauti Eggertsson and Michael Woodford (2003) showed that the constraints imposed by the zero lower bound are not very restrictive if the Fed can credibly commit to keeping the funds rate low for an extended period of time. The idea is that the FOMC can work around the zero lower bound on the overnight interest rate by lowering interest rate expectations in the future, thus pushing down longer-term interest rates to stimulate private spending. The Fed employed such an approach between 2003 and 2005, and has taken an important step along the same path in its December announcement by stating that “exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate” are likely to be warranted “for some time” due to “weak economic conditions.” I believe that such statements can play a useful role in more clearly indicating to markets the Committee’s own expectations concerning the federal funds rate path, conditional on the Committee’s economic forecast.\n\nCommunication also can be important in the Fed’s efforts to anchor long-term inflation expectations. As I mentioned at the outset, the odds are high that over the next few years, inflation will decline below desirable levels. It is especially important in such circumstances for the Fed to emphasize its commitment to returning inflation over time to the higher levels that are most appropriate to the attainment of its longer-term objectives. A decline in inflationary expectations when economic conditions are weak is pernicious, especially so when the federal funds rate has reached the zero bound, because any downdrift in inflation expectations leads to an updrift in real interest rates and a tightening of financial conditions.\n\nWork by Refet Gürkaynak, Eric Swanson, and coauthors (2005, 2006) suggests that committing a central bank to a long-run inflation objective helps anchor longer-run inflation expectations in that country. Over the past few years, the FOMC has in fact taken important incremental steps toward making its longer-term inflation goals more explicit. For example, we are now publishing FOMC members’ inflation forecasts for the next three years under the assumption of “appropriate monetary policy,” and the publication of such forecasts has helped shape public understanding concerning the range of inflation outcomes that FOMC members regard as desirable in the longer term. Looking forward, there could be scope for the Committee to improve the clarity of these communications. I am optimistic that, by clearly communicating the Fed’s commitment to low and stable inflation and by backing that commitment up with determined policy actions should the need arise, any deflationary pressures caused by the weak economy can be contained.\n\n# # #\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1.

        "content": "\n\n\n\nI’m delighted to have the opportunity to comment on the papers of my distinguished colleagues, Martin Feldstein, John Taylor, and Alan Auerbach at a session devoted to a topic of such critical policy importance. With the U.S. economy in a year-old recession, marked by a particularly sharp contraction in recent months, and ensnared in ongoing financial market distress, fiscal policy intervention is certainly needed. It is important that it be informed by the kind of cogent thinking and analysis that these papers embody.\n\nI agree with Marty that the current downturn is likely to be far longer and deeper than the “garden-variety” recession in which GDP bounces back quickly. As Marty points out, a defining characteristic of this downturn is its cause. Typically, recessions occur when monetary policy is tightened to subdue the inflationary pressures that emerge during a boom. This time, the cause was the eruption of a severe financial crisis. Cross-country evidence suggests that, following such an event, GDP remains subdued for an extended period.2 And consistent with this evidence, many forecasters expect this to be one of the longest and deepest recessions since the Great Depression. Indeed, the crisis is ongoing. Risk-aversion in financial markets remains exceptionally high; deleveraging is widespread; the markets for most private asset-backed securities are dysfunctional; financial institutions, both large and small, have failed; and the economic downturn is causing delinquencies to rise, threatening further financial distress; households and businesses face an ongoing credit crunch; and housing and financial wealth has plunged. Marty points out, and I agree, that the likely impact on consumer spending of the decline in wealth thus far—one of a number of factors weighing on this sector—is, on its own, quite substantial. And house prices are continuing to slide.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has responded aggressively since the onset of the crisis with both interest rate reductions and a variety of new, specialized liquidity facilities to improve the functioning of impaired financial markets. At the FOMC’s last meeting in December, the Committee reduced its target for the federal funds rate to a range of 0 to ¼ percent, effectively hitting the “zero bound” for the first time since the Great Depression. With nominal interest rates now essentially zero, we have reached the limits of what conventional monetary policy, working through short-term interest rates, can do to stimulate the economy. A special concern in the current circumstances is that a decline in inflationary expectations could cause real interest rates to rise. The potential for real interest rates to rise as inflation declines creates a significant downside risk because, with an extended period of abnormally high unemployment in the forecast, it is increasingly likely that inflation will fall to undesirably low levels. This is an additional consideration that, to my mind, militates in favor of strong policy responses.\n\nI certainly agree with John Taylor that the zero bound doesn’t mean that monetary policy has run out of options. At another session this afternoon, I will discuss in detail a range of non-conventional measures, using the Fed’s “balance sheet,” that will be a prime focus for monetary policy going forward. The Fed has already announced or undertaken, and can expand, programs designed to improve the functioning of credit markets. These programs complement the actions of the Treasury, the FDIC, and the Fed to inject capital into the banking system, to stabilize systemically important financial institutions, to expand deposit insurance, and to temporarily guarantee the senior debt of banking organizations. A clear lesson of history is that a sine qua non for sustained economic recovery following a financial crisis is a thoroughgoing repair of the financial system. The necessary steps are occurring now, but restoration of the financial system to full health will be a long, drawn-out process.\n\nLess clear, and here I part ways with John, are the lessons from Japan’s recent experience with “quantitative easing.” In his paper for this session, John asserts that the BOJ’s quantitative easing strategy worked well, while fiscal policy was ineffective. My interpretation of the evidence is exactly the opposite. The BOJ targeted an extraordinarily high level of excess reserves in the banking system, in the hope that a flood of such reserves might stimulate additional bank lending. The BOJ’s quantitative easing policy probably had some beneficial effect, but mainly because it symbolized the BOJ’s commitment to combat deflation by keeping interest rates at zero for an extended time. The expectation of an extended period of zero short-term interest rates was probably instrumental in lowering longer-term nominal rates. But the expansion of excess reserves to extraordinary levels appears, on its own, to have had very little impact on financial conditions. The Fed’s “balance sheet” strategy has a different motivation. We are focused on pursuing carefully tailored programs to remedy specific financial market dysfunctions. For example, our suite of programs is designed to enhance liquidity in financial markets, to improve the availability of term funding in the money market, to restore the functioning of the commercial paper market, and to stimulate the issuance of new asset-backed securities to support lending to consumers and small businesses.\n\nI am sanguine that the Fed’s new programs will be helpful in restoring credit flows. But many of the new approaches are experimental, and there is a great deal of uncertainty concerning their likely effects. Even with vigorous Fed action to restore credit flows, an extended period of economic weakness is likely. This explains why, in the statement following its December meeting, the FOMC noted that it anticipates that an exceptionally low level of the federal funds rate will be appropriate for some time.\n\nFor all of these reasons, I support Marty’s conclusion that there is an exceptionally strong case for substantial fiscal stimulus over the next few years. In ordinary circumstances, there are good reasons why monetary, rather than fiscal policy, should be used for stabilization purposes. But these are exceptional circumstances, and fiscal policy can help get the economy going.\n\nGiven that a substantial fiscal stimulus package is now under consideration, it is important for economists to debate the form it should take and raise questions about the likely effectiveness of particular fiscal strategies. With respect to optimal fiscal design, I have heard more alliterative mantras during the past year than at any time in my professional career! A year ago, the mantra was “Timely, targeted, and temporary.” More recently, I’ve heard “Speedy, substantial, and sustained.”3 In recent testimony, John argued for fiscal policies that are “Permanent, pervasive, and predictable.” 4 And the award for the longest, most detailed, and least alliterative list goes to the International Monetary Fund whose staff this week recommended a package that is “large, lasting, diversified, contingent, collective, and sustainable.”5\n\nConceptually, I would note that fiscal policy can play two logically distinct roles in the present crisis. The first, which is the main topic of the papers in this session and my subsequent comments, is to support aggregate demand. I will discuss some issues that should be considered in formulating a stimulus package for this purpose. The second, which is crucially important in the current crisis, is to address the maladies that now afflict the financial sector. Indeed, fiscal resources have already been deployed to bolster the capital of the banking system, to stabilize systemically important institutions, and to support programs designed to assist homeowners and mitigate foreclosure. Fiscal policy can play a further supportive role in unclogging credit market flows. For example, the new Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) is a joint program between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury, using TARP funds, and is designed to improve the flow of credit to households and businesses. The Fed cannot conduct such programs on its own, since taxpayer funds are at risk. As I noted earlier, the resolution of financial sector difficulties is essential for a return to sustained growth following a financial crisis. This conclusion is endorsed by the IMF in its recent position paper.6\n\nLet me now turn to some design issues that relate to the use of fiscal policy for stabilization purposes. First, as both John and Alan highlight, automatic stabilizers have an important role to play, and this role could be expanded. These stabilizers have the desirable property of being predictable and automatic—agents know they’re coming, and they inevitably provide a boost just when it’s needed. Using aggregate CBO data on the cyclical contribution to the budget deficit, John argues that these stabilizers are as effective as ever; it is hard, though, to square this finding with Alan’s analysis showing that the automatic stabilizers have become smaller over time, as marginal tax rates have declined.\n\nIn the current context, however, I don’t think that existing automatic stabilizers—of whatever size—are likely to provide a sufficient boost to aggregate demand. Moreover, both John and Alan make the important point that the predictable fiscal policy response to changing economic conditions does not rely solely on automatic stabilizers. Alan highlights the specific examples of countercyclical fiscal policy in the 2000s, as well as the predictable component over a long period of time in discretionary investment incentives. John notes, but does not emphasize, that the structural component of the budget deficit—reflecting specific, discretionary changes in legislation—has been highly responsive over the past decade or longer to changes in the output gap.\n\nHence, private agents rationally expect that in times of economic weakness, fiscal policy will respond and that expectation itself serves as a kind of automatic stabilizer in its own right, reassuring households and businesses that the government will do everything in its power to prevent a long period of intense economic distress. Agents have almost surely, at least implicitly, built some such expectation about discretionary fiscal policy into their current behavior, even if they are highly uncertain about the details of the response. Perhaps it would be desirable in the longer run to make the policy rule more explicit and predictable—and, as Alan emphasizes, to devote more analysis to understanding the effects of different policy rules. But I don’t think now is the time to change the implicit, if imprecise, rules and disappoint agents’ expectations about the discretionary fiscal response to the present crisis.\n\nA second design principle that must be kept in mind, given the huge, long-term budget challenges facing the country, is that current responses need to be consistent with long-term fiscal discipline. Conceptually, the choices about the long-term size of government—with revenues that are consistent with the desired level of spending—and the choices about the optimal short-run stimulus are quite separate. But long-run expectations about fiscal sustainability do matter, even in the short run. If agents don’t believe that tax cuts and/or spending increases are temporary, and are concerned that policy responses threaten the sustainability of the long-run run budget picture, then long-term real interest rates are likely to rise in response, undercutting, conceivably even overwhelming, the short-term stimulus. In the 1990s, the term “Rubinomics” came to summarize this possibility (in reverse): that “contractionary” measures to improve long-run fiscal balance could provide net, short-term stimulus through this channel.\n\nIn the present context, this logic creates potential tradeoffs between short-run and long-run considerations. In particular, the permanent income hypothesis implies that permanent tax cuts affect spending in the short run by more than temporary tax cuts; but if these tax cuts are not consistent with long-run spending realities, then they are inconsistent with fiscal sustainability and are not credible. For this reason, I am a bit skeptical about Marty’s suggestion that we implement broad-based, permanent tax cuts. Especially given future obligations for social security and Medicare, voters and legislators might resist the sizeable reductions in other spending that would be required to keep taxes permanently lower than current legislation implies.\n\nOf course, a concern for fiscal discipline is one reason why temporary tax rebates seemed desirable to many observers last year. The rebates were explicitly targeted at lower-income individuals who were more likely to be credit constrained and thus responsive to temporary as well as permanent changes in income. Some micro evidence suggests that the rebates were effective in boosting spending.7 On the basis of aggregate data, however, both Marty and John agree that the tax rebates were a bust—they failed to have enough of an impact on consumer spending to make a dent in the aggregate spending data. There are difficult econometric issues here—for example, credit constraints on households were tightening around the same time the checks were arriving, which could have obscured the true effects. Nevertheless, the rebate checks at best delayed the most severe period of the current recession, and at worst were ineffective.\n\nHow about investment incentives? In contrast to temporary tax rebates, economic theory implies that temporary investment incentives should be even more effective in stimulating aggregate demand than permanent incentives. Hence, they should work well in terms of providing large short-term bang for the buck with little damage to long-run fiscal balance. Unfortunately, Alan’s work suggests that, while this logic might hold, it isn’t the whole story. Investment incentives are clearly countercyclical—when the economy slows, investment incentives rise and firms contemplating capital investment know this. So the anticipation effects could cause undesirable fluctuations in investment and economic activity.\n\nIn theory, as Marty suggests, temporary increases in government spending—or, perhaps, changes in the timing of government spending—fit the bill well. Such spending has the advantage of hitting aggregate demand directly. There is uncertainty in the academic literature about the multiplier, although I think that the multiplier is likely to be larger than usual now because private spending is less likely than usual to be crowded out. Of course, it is unclear how quickly temporary spending programs can be ramped up and, as Marty suggests, there could be bottlenecks of various sorts.\nTogether, these considerations reinforce the IMF’s recent suggestion that a diversified package of policies should be deployed. That is, within the class of fiscally sustainable policies, there is considerable uncertainty about the effects of any individual policy. So we should try a lot of things, including, as Marty suggests, government spending.\n\nOf course, there are many things the government could spend money on and this brings me to a third design principle: Policy should aim to promote spending on goods and services with higher rather than lower social value. After all, the goal of policy is to raise welfare. And spending money on projects that aren’t viewed as having much social value—such as digging holes and filling them in again—adds a lot less to social welfare than available alternatives, even if such low-value activities can succeed in increasing aggregate demand. Tax cuts do have the advantage of giving individuals the choice about how to spend their money. But, as I’ve already noted, it is unclear whether fiscally sustainable tax cuts will have sufficient stimulative effect.\n\nIn this context, as Marty’s argument implies, there are clear macroeconomic gains from direct government spending. In cost-benefit terms, the aggregate demand externalities increase the benefits of government spending relative to the costs. Hence, programs that already look worthwhile ought to be implemented; and some programs that might not otherwise pass a cost-benefit test could also be justified given the considerable slack in the economy. There are real dangers, however, in pushing this logic too far and Japan’s experience, to my mind, illustrates them. John suggested that discretionary fiscal policy made no meaningful contribution to Japan’s recovery. I disagree with that characterization. Japan’s decision to raise its consumption tax and cut public spending in 1997 aborted an incipient recovery then in progress; and the fiscal stimulus put in place in 1998 and 1999 appears to have prompted a rebound. Most studies find that fiscal measures did have a positive stimulative effect, although estimates of the fiscal multipliers vary.8 Even so, I have the impression that John’s view is widely held in Japan. I suspect that fiscal policy was both unpopular, and widely viewed as ineffective, in Japan because so much of it involved spending on “bridges to nowhere”—public works projects of dubious social value. Such spending appears to have undermined popular support for fiscal stimulus.\n\nIf ever, in my professional career, there was a time for active, discretionary fiscal stimulus, it is now. Although our economy is resilient and has bounced back quickly from downturns in the past, the financial and economic firestorm we face today poses a serious risk of an extended period of stagnation—a very grim outcome. Such stagnation would intensify financial market strains, exacerbating the problems that triggered the downturn. It’s worth pulling out all the stops to ensure those outcomes don’t occur.\n\n# # #\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1.
