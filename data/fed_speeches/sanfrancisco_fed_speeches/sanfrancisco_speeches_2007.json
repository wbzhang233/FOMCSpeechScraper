        "content": "Good afternoon, and thanks very much to everyone at the Seattle Community Development Roundtable and the Board of Trustees of the Seattle Chamber of Commerce for inviting me to join you. Seattle is home to one of the four branches of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and I was glad to be able to combine a board meeting at the Branch with my talk to you today. As I’m sure you know, there are some nice connections between the Roundtable and our Seattle Branch —Mic Dinsmore is currently the Chairman of the Branch Board of Directors, and Mark Gould is our Senior Vice President in charge of Information and Technology Services as well as the Branch Manager here.\n\nIn my remarks today, I plan to give you my views on the prospects for the nation’s economy and discuss some of the implications I see for the conduct of monetary policy. Afterward, I hope there will be ample time for your questions and comments because I view these events as an opportunity for two-way communication—in other words, not only do you get to hear what’s on my mind, but I get to hear what’s on yours.\n\nCommunication\n\nIndeed, communication between the Fed and the public has been a special focus for me for the last year and a half. I was part of the FOMC subcommittee—along with Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn and Minneapolis Fed President Gary Stern—that led the discussions on the FOMC’s communications strategy. One outcome was the initiative that Chairman Bernanke announced last month.2 This effort aims to make elements of the conduct of monetary policy clearer to the public by providing more extensive information about the Committee’s forecasts and goals for the U.S. economy. This new information was first released recently as part of the minutes to the October FOMC meeting. So, I’d like to start by discussing some of the reasons for this initiative and its main features. Then I’ll couch my discussion of the economy and monetary policy in those terms.   As always, these remarks reflect my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLet me begin by placing this development in context. It is neither the beginning point nor is it likely to be the endpoint of efforts to improve the Fed’s communication with the public about its goals and its approach to reaching those goals. Some notable earlier efforts include releasing a statement explaining policy decisions after each meeting of the FOMC and, most recently, releasing the minutes of each meeting earlier, so that they are available to the public not after the subsequent meeting, but before it.\n\nWhy this emphasis on communication? There are several reasons. The first is one that is fundamental to our democratic principles: the Federal Reserve’s accountability to the public. By making both our goals and our strategies to reach those goals clearer, the public is in a better position to keep an eye on us and to judge how well we are doing our job. Second, greater clarity about the Fed’s goals and strategies actually helps in achieving them.  For example, financial sector participants should have a better understanding of how the Committee is likely to react to economic developments, and, as a result, asset prices and interest rates should tend to move in ways that further the Fed’s objectives. Furthermore, the public’s expectations of inflation may be better anchored, and this not only helps the Fed control inflation but also gives it more flexibility in stabilizing the business cycle, the other element in our dual mandate; that is, with well-anchored inflation expectations, the Fed can respond quickly to disturbances that threaten growth without engendering public fears of rising inflation.\n\nAs I indicated, the communication initiative involves providing more information on the economic forecasts of all of the FOMC participants.  Forecasts play a role because the effects of monetary policy actions are not felt in the economy immediately, but only after some time has passed. These lags between actions and outcomes provide a rationale for monetary policy strategies that are forward-looking —anticipating future developments in the economy and how policy actions will influence them.\n\nI’ll describe the main elements of the enhanced FOMC projections briefly. The projections are now released four times a year, rather than twice a year, as they were in the past. They summarize the point estimates of the outcomes for real GDP, the unemployment rate, core inflation, and headline inflation that each participant considers most likely over the forecast horizon. The forecast horizon now extends to three years, rather than to just two years, thus giving a better sense of the Committee’s medium-term outlook. The forecasts are made under the assumption—and this is a key point—ofappropriate monetary policy. Given this assumption, the three-year-ahead forecasts for inflation rates provide better insight into levels that are considered by the participants to be consistent with the Committee’s mandate to achieve price stability. By the same token, the third-year forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate provide more of an indication of the Committee’s estimates of the maximum sustainable rate of growth for economic activity and level of employment.  In the long run, neither of these is directly influenced by monetary policy. In the short run, however, monetary policy does affect the actual growth rates of economic activity and employment.  Therefore, business cycle developments play a key role in determining our plan for policy over the medium term.\n\nIn keeping with past practice, the Committee will continue to report the central tendency and full range of the independent forecasts deemed most likely by each of the FOMC participants. Such independence and diversity of views are longstanding strengths of the Committee’s decisionmaking.  Because there is often considerable uncertainty and risk associated with gauging appropriate monetary policy, having the independent views of all participants reduces the chance of missing an important consideration in any decision.  One new feature is a description—or narrative—that summarizes the key factors that influence the forecasts. It puts the projection numbers into context, and, in particular, in the context of the basic economic “story” underlying the views of the participants. The narrative also highlights factors responsible for changes in participants’ views since the previous forecast.  In addition, it portrays not only the central tendency of the participants’ views, but also gives the flavor of the diversity of views on the Committee.\n\nAnother new feature relates to the characterization of risks. Forecasts are subject to considerable error, given the inherent uncertainty about both the underlying economic relationships that drive observed outcomes and the prevalence of unanticipated shocks affecting economic developments. Policy must take such uncertainty into account, particularly when some possible outcomes could entail unusually high costs. The new projections attempt to characterize qualitatively both whether the degree of forecast uncertainty is greater or less than usual and also whether the risks around the economic scenario deemed “most likely” are symmetric or skewed to the upside or downside.\n\nIt is important to recognize that providing more information on our forecasts does not represent a new way to do policy. Rather, it helps clarify what the Committee is focused on. It also makes more explicit that the Committee is looking forward, does have a plan to pursue its dual mandate, and is attentive to situations where the risks to its forecast may be unusually large or asymmetric.\n\nThe forecasts give the public at least some basis for judging whether incoming data are consistent with the Committee’s expectations or else are surprising, potentially leading over time to an updating of forecasts and policy assumptions. If the projections, for example, already incorporate expectations for, say, a “rough patch” ahead for output or inflation, incoming data confirming that “rough patch” would not typically alter the plan for policy. Rather, a change in the policy plan would be appropriate when the forecast shifts due to unanticipated developments in the financial or real economies. Furthermore, a change in the policy plan may also be warranted when the forecast itself is unchanged, but when the risks around it have changed. I will return to these important themes in my discussion of policy.\n\nFinancial markets\n\nNow let me turn to my own forecasts—both the one I held at the October meeting and the one I am working on for our meeting next week. At present, the ongoing turmoil in financial markets plays a crucial role in that outlook, influencing not only the economy’s “most likely” path but also the risks around those projections. The turmoil began, of course, in mid-July, as global financial markets became highly volatile, increasingly illiquid, and notably more risk averse.  These developments led the Fed to take actions on several fronts—as bank regulator and supervisor, as provider of liquidity to mitigate financial instability, and as monetary policymaker. In terms of monetary policy, the Committee twice lowered its main policy instrument, the federal funds rate, by a total of three-quarters of a percentage point to help forestall some of the restraining effects on economic activity of this financial shock.\n\nWhen the shock first hit, I expected the reverberations to subside gradually, especially in view of the easing in the stance of policy, so that by now there would have been a noticeable improvement in financial conditions. Indeed, though the reverberations have ebbed at times over the last four and a half months, since the October meeting market conditions have deteriorated again, and indications of heightened risk-aversion continue to abound both here and abroad.\n\nFor example, there continues to be a strong demand to hold U.S. Treasury securities—which are the safest and most liquid in the world—leading to Treasury yields that are much lower than they were before the shock hit in mid-July. Of course, one reason for the decline in Treasury yields is that the Fed has cut the federal funds rate and the market expects substantial additional cuts in the future, reflecting the view that policy will ease further to offset the contractionary effects on economic activity of the financial turmoil. But another important reason is that there has been a worldwide “flight to safety.” Stated differently, the spreads of most risky assets above Treasuries have risen.\n\nLikewise, the cost of insuring investors against default on securities they hold, through derivatives known as credit default swaps, has jumped again in recent weeks and is far higher than normal. Indeed, the higher costs are particularly evident for instruments related to mortgages, with lower-rated instruments seeing especially big increases. To some extent, this development may reflect heightened anxiety among market participants about downside risks to economic activity, particularly housing. At the same time, greater uncertainty about the future is reflected in implied expected price volatility as derived from options contracts on a range of assets, from equities to foreign exchange.\n\nWhile risk spreads have generally risen, it is also important to pay attention to the actual interest rates on loans that support the spending of American households and firms. On the corporate side, prime borrowers have, in fact, experienced some net decline in rates since the shock first hit—that is, even though risk spreads are higher, they have been more than offset by lower Treasury rates. Issuers of low-grade corporate bonds with greater credit risk, in contrast, face notably higher interest rates and these rates have jumped in recent weeks.\n\nThe mortgage market has been the epicenter of the financial shock, and, not surprisingly, greater aversion to risk has been particularly apparent there, with spreads above Treasuries increasing for mortgages of all types. Although borrowing rates for low-risk conforming mortgages have decreased, other mortgage rates have risen, even for some borrowers with high credit ratings. In particular, fixed rates on jumbo mortgages are up on net since mid-July. Subprime mortgages remain difficult to get at any rate.\n\nMoreover, many markets for securitized assets, especially private-label mortgage-backed securities, continue to experience outright illiquidity; in other words, the markets are not functioning efficiently, or may not be functioning much at all. This illiquidity remains an enormous problem not only for companies that specialize in originating mortgages and then bundling them to sell as securities, but also for financial institutions holding such securities and for sponsors, including banks, of structured investment vehicles—these are entities that relied heavily on asset-backed commercial paper to fund portfolios of securitized assets.\n\nDepository institutions are increasingly facing challenges. For example, there continue to be strains in the term interbank funding markets; in these markets, banks borrow from and lend to each other, with loans maturing in a number of weeks, months, or even a year. The problem is that banks that would normally lend their excess funds to other banks that need them are reluctant to do so. This may reflect banks’ recognition of the need to preserve liquidity to meet unexpected credit demands, greater uncertainty about the creditworthiness of counterparties, or concerns relating to capital positions. A heightened focus on liquidity is logical when the markets for securitized assets held by banks have become highly illiquid and when the potential exists for some customers—such as struggling mortgage companies and others—to draw on unsecured credit lines. Pressures on banks’ capital cushions are arising in part because loans they intended to push off their balance sheets by securitizing them have become “stuck” on their balance sheets.  In addition, banks may end up moving assets held off-balance sheet back onto their own books, raising regulatory capital requirements.  Furthermore, many institutions face required write-downs of the value of mortgage-backed assets on their balance sheets. To the surprise of many, these write-downs and capital strains have even hit Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, the huge government-sponsored enterprises that some observers and legislators hoped could provide support to the mortgage markets by taking more mortgages on to their own books.\n\nGiven some banks’ increasing concerns that their capital ratios will become binding and their increased caution in managing liquidity, it is not surprising to see some evidence suggesting that they are tightening credit terms and restricting availability at least to some extent. As yet, however, we do not appear to be at the point of an all-out credit crunch as we were in the early 1990s, when so-called “headwinds” significantly restrained spending and economic activity. Increased concern on the part of lenders about downside risks to the economy that would harm credit quality has the potential to cause a further tightening of credit conditions to households and firms. This is clearly an area that bears close monitoring.\n\nTo assess how financial conditions relevant to aggregate demand have changed since the shock first hit, we must consider not only credit markets but also the markets for equity and foreign exchange. These markets have hardly been immune to recent financial turbulence. Broad equity indices have been very volatile, and, on the whole, they have declined noticeably since mid-July, representing a restraint on spending. More recently, some of these declines have occurred as profits have come in below market expectations for some financial firms, due to write-downs of the value of mortgage securities.\n\nAs for the dollar, it has been depreciating since early 2002, and has continued to do so since the financial turmoil began. This development will help to improve our gaping trade deficit and thereby offset some of the otherwise contractionary effects of the tighter credit conditions and lower equity values even though a weaker dollar diminishes the well-being of consumers by lowering their purchasing power.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nWith these developments in mind, let me review the economic situation. By the time of the October meeting, the data indicated that the economy had turned in a very strong performance in the second and third quarters.  However, the fourth quarter is sizing up to show only very meager growth. The current weakness probably reflects some payback for the strength earlier this year—in other words, just some quarter-to-quarter volatility due to business inventories and exports. But it may also reflect some impact of the financial turmoil on economic activity.  If so, a more prolonged period of sluggishness in demand seems more likely. The timing of the slowdown certainly matches well with the financial turmoil explanation. Of course, much of the data that drove the third quarter strength cover the earlier part of that quarter, just the very beginnings of the turmoil in July and August, and therefore probably do not reflect its effects very much. However, the data for the end of the quarter—that is, for September—did come in on the soft side, and the data for the beginning of the fourth quarter in October have shown even more of a slowdown.\n\nI’d like to go into this “story” in more detail. First, the on-going strains in mortgage finance markets seem to have intensified an already steep downturn in housing. Indeed, forward-looking indicators of conditions in housing markets are pointing lower. Housing permits and sales are dropping, and inventories of unsold homes are at very high levels. Moreover, rising foreclosures will likely add to the supply of houses on the market. It’s well known that foreclosures on subprime adjustable rate mortgages have increased sharply over the past couple of years. More recently, we’ve begun to see increases in foreclosures on subprime fixed-rate mortgages and even on prime ARMs. The bottom line is that housing construction will likely be quite weak well into next year before beginning to turn around.\n\nTurning to house prices, many measures at the national level have fallen moderately, and the declines appear to be intensifying. Indeed, the ratio of house prices to rents, which is a kind of price-dividend ratio for housing, remains quite high by historical standards, suggesting that further price declines may be needed to bring housing markets into balance. This perspective is reinforced by futures markets for house prices, which indicate further—and even larger—declines in a number of metropolitan areas this year. \nThis weakness in house construction and prices is one of the factors that has led me to include a “rough patch” in my forecast for some time. More recently, however, the prospects for housing have actually worsened somewhat, as financial strains have intensified and housing demand appears to have fallen further.\n\nMoreover, we face a risk that the problems in the housing market could spill over to personal consumption expenditures in a bigger way than has thus far been evident in the data. This is a significant risk since personal consumption accounts for about 70 percent of real GDP. These spillovers could occur through several channels.  For example, with house prices falling, homeowners’ total wealth declines, and that could lead to a pullback in spending. At the same time, the fall in house prices may constrain consumer spending by changing the value of mortgage equity; less equity, for example, reduces the quantity of funds available for credit-constrained consumers to borrow through home equity loans or to withdraw through refinancing. Furthermore, in the new environment of higher rates and tighter terms on mortgages, we may see other negative impacts on consumer spending. The reduced availability of high loan-to-value ratio and piggyback loans may drive some would-be homeowners to pull back on consumption in order to save for a sizable down payment. In addition, credit-constrained consumers with adjustable-rate mortgages seem likely to curtail spending, as interest rates reset at higher levels and they find themselves with less disposable income.\n\nConsumption spending was moderately above trend in the third quarter, and though I had built in some slowing for it in my October forecast, there are signs suggesting even more moderation over the next year or so. For example, although consumers will continue to receive support from gains in employment and personal income, they will also confront constraints because of the declines in the stock market and house prices, the tightening of lending terms at depository institutions, and higher energy prices.\n\nMoreover, there are significant downside risks to this projection. Recent data on personal consumption expenditures and retail sales are not that encouraging. They have begun to show a significant deceleration—more than was expected—and consumer confidence has plummeted. Reinforcing these concerns, I have begun to hear a pattern of negative comments and stories from my business contacts, including members of our Head Office and Branch Boards of Directors. It is far too early to tell if we are in for a sustained period of sluggish growth in consumption spending, but recent developments do raise this possibility as a serious risk to the forecast.\n\nLike consumer spending, foreign economic activity has been a source of strength for economic activity. Foreign real GDP—weighted by U.S. export shares—advanced at rates of 3¾ to 4 percent from 2004 through 2006 and by over 4 percent in the first two quarters of this year. With the trade-weighted dollar falling for some time, U.S. exports have done very well—real exports increased by an average of nearly 8 percent during 2004 through 2006. Partly for this reason, U.S. net exports, which consistently held growth down from 2000 to 2005, actually gave it a lift during 2006. I anticipate ongoing strength in net exports, but perhaps somewhat less than in recent years, since foreign activity may be somewhat weaker going forward. Some countries are experiencing direct negative impacts from the ongoing turmoil in financial markets. Others are likely to suffer indirect impacts from any slowdown in the U.S. For example, most Asian economies are now enjoying exceptionally buoyant conditions. But the U.S. and Asian economies are not decoupled, and a slowdown here is likely to produce ripple effects lowering growth there through trade linkages.\n\nI don’t want to give the impression that all of the available recent data have been weak or overemphasize the downside risks. There are some significant areas of strength. In particular, labor markets have been fairly robust in recent months. As I mentioned before, the growth of jobs is an important element in generating the expansion of personal income needed to support consumption spending, which is a key factor for the overall health of the economy.  In addition, business investment in equipment and software also has been fairly strong, although here too, recent data suggest some deceleration. Despite the hike in borrowing costs for higher-risk corporate borrowers and the illiquidity in markets for collateralized loan obligations, it appears that financing for capital spending for most firms remains readily available on terms that have been little affected by the recent financial turmoil.\n\nTo sum up the story on the outlook for real GDP growth, my own view is that, under appropriate monetary policy, the economy is still likely to achieve a relatively smooth adjustment path, with real GDP growth gradually returning to its roughly 2½ percent trend over the next year or so, and the unemployment rate rising only very gradually to just above its 4¾ percent sustainable level. However, for the next few quarters, there are signs that growth may come in somewhat lower than I had previously thought likely. For example, some of the risks that I worried about in my earlier forecast have materialized—the turmoil in financial markets has not subsided as much as I had hoped, and some data on personal consumption have come in weaker than expected. I continue to see the growth risks as skewed to the downside in part because increased perceptions of downside economic risk may induce greater caution by lenders, households, and firms.\n\nTurning to inflation, signs of improvement in underlying inflationary pressures are evident in recent data. Over the past twelve months, the price index for the measure of consumer inflation on which the FOMC bases its forecasts—personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, or the core PCE price index—has increased by 1.9 percent. Just several months ago, the twelve-month change was quite a bit higher, at nearly 2½ percent.\n\nIt seems most likely that core PCE price inflation will edge down to around 1¾ percent over the next few years under appropriate policy and the gap between total and core PCE inflation will diminish substantially. Such an outcome is broadly consistent with my interpretation of the Fed’s price stability mandate. This view is predicated on continued well-anchored inflation expectations. It also assumes the emergence of a slight amount of slack in the labor market, as well as the ebbing of the upward effects of movements in energy and commodity prices. However, we do still face some inflation risks, mainly due to faster increases in unit labor costs, the depreciation of the dollar, and the continuing upside surprises in energy prices. Moreover, labor markets have continued to surprise on the strong side. All of these factors will need to be watched carefully going forward.\n\nMonetary policy\n\nNow I’d like to turn to monetary policy. In September, the Committee reduced the federal funds rate target by 50 basis points, and in late October lowered the target by another 25 basis points. These actions reflected the Committee’s concern that the financial shock had the potential to intensify the housing correction and thereby to restrain economic growth more generally. The steps were meant to help forestall some of the potential fallout to the economy from the disruptions in financial markets and to promote moderate growth over time.\n\nIn line with the forecast-based policy I’ve described, the Committee’s decisions reflected a forward-looking and preemptive approach. In particular, I supported putting a substantial easing in place so as not to fall “behind the curve.” Given the long lags between policy actions and their impact on the economy, and the possibility that economic downturns can be difficult to reverse once they take hold, an approach that was more gradual and reactive than this would have created unnecessary economic risks.\n\nSince the October FOMC meeting, financial conditions have deteriorated, and we have seen some unexpected softening in the economic data. These developments necessitate some rethinking of my growth forecast, and have highlighted the downside skew in the risks to that forecast. On the inflation front, I continue to expect core consumer prices to rise at a pace that is broadly consistent with price stability, although there are some notable upside risks that bear careful watching and consideration. Additional data bearing on the outlook will become available before the FOMC’s meeting next week, and this information must also be factored into an assessment of the economy’s prospects.\n\nI hope these remarks provide an indication of the issues that will be on my mind as I assess the appropriate approach to policy that will foster full employment while maintaining the success we have achieved on our price stability objective.\n\nNow I’d be pleased to take any questions or hear any of your thoughts on these important issues.\n\nEndnotes\n\n1.

        "content": "I would like to add my voice to the chorus in thanking President Fisher and the Dallas Fed for hosting this conference honoring John Taylor.1 It is a particular pleasure to have been invited to join this distinguished panel and to have this opportunity to discuss some of John Taylor’s many important contributions to economics and monetary policy. In looking back at his work, I am struck by how thoroughly his research has affected the way policymakers and economists analyze the economy and approach monetary policy. His influence and, indeed, his name is heard whenever people talk about monetary policy, whether it’s the Taylor Curve, the Taylor Principle, or, of course, the Taylor Rule. I’m told that an unwary indexer once even credited him with the Taylor expansion that we all learned in our calculus classes—something that surely made Brook Taylor spin in his grave.\n\nI’ll focus my comments today on the aspects of John Taylor’s research that have shaped the discussion of monetary policy issues at the Federal Reserve and at central banks around the world. In so doing, I admit to giving short shrift to John’s many other contributions, but I have only so much time! I have divided John’s contributions to monetary policy into three branches: analyzing nominal rigidities, modeling the global economy, and developing principles of monetary policy.\n\nTo start with, it’s useful to go back to the debates raging in macroeconomic theory in the 1970s when John began his research. Recall that at that time, and through the 1980s, many models incorporating rational expectations had the feature that predictable monetary policy actions would have no effect on the real economy. This result led many economists to criticize the Fed’s dual mandate of price stability and maximum growth on the grounds that efforts at macroeconomic stabilization using monetary policy were at best ineffective and potentially destabilizing if “surprise” inflations were used to boost the economy. Accordingly, the policy recommendation was that central banks should focus exclusively on maintaining price stability and abandon all efforts at taming the business cycle.\n\nMuch of this literature assumed that prices and wages were completely flexible, adjusting day by day to changing economic conditions. John Taylor and several others challenged this assumption and the corresponding conclusion that rational expectations implied monetary policy irrelevance and the need to ignore output stabilization. His paper with Ned Phelps (1977) showed that even under rational expectations, if prices or wages are sticky, systematic monetary policy had real effects and could be used to stabilize fluctuations in real output.2\n\nIn a later paper (Taylor 1979), John showed that central banks face a tradeoff in terms of the magnitude of fluctuations in inflation and output. This result became enshrined in what is now commonly known as the Taylor curve, which plots out the frontier of the feasible set of outcomes in terms of the variances of inflation and the output gap. Importantly, the Taylor Curve is entirely consistent with the Fed’s dual mandate—the twin goals of stabilizing inflation and output—in the face of a short-run tradeoff in achieving them. Nowadays, discussions of monetary policy strategy are often boiled down to “picking a point on the Taylor Curve.”\n\nJohn’s research showed that nominal rigidities were not merely a theoretical possibility, but were a feature of the actual economy. He developed and estimated his now-famous model of staggered nominal wage setting (Taylor 1980). This paper made two important breakthroughs. First, his model was an early example of what is now commonly referred to as a “New Keynesian Phillips curve,” in which prices depend on both expectations of future prices as well as past prices. Second, he provided strong empirical evidence of nominal wage rigidities in the United States, supporting the case for a stabilization role for monetary policy even in models with deep micro foundations and rational expectations.\n\nMoreover, the insight into the key role played by rigidities in wage setting continues to influence the development of macro models and our understanding of the effects of monetary policy on the economy. Although many simple macro models used in teaching and research assume sticky prices and abstract from sticky wages, in larger models used in central banks, such as the FRB/US model used at the Board Governors, wage rigidities play a central role. In addition, recent research using micro-founded DSGE models as well as the papers at this conference have confirmed that wage rigidities are important empirically and have also improved our understanding of the role of sticky wages as a source of the tradeoff policymakers face and of the welfare costs of business cycles.3\n\nThe second branch of John’s research that has had a lasting influence on our policy discussions is his work on developing empirical macroeconometric models with rational expectations. This work also led him to collaborate with Ray Fair in the early 1980s to develop a method to simulate nonlinear large-scale rational expectations models that is still used at central banks 25 years later (Fair and Taylor 1983). During the 1980s, he single-handedly developed an estimated model of the G7 economies that incorporated rational expectations, forward-looking behavior by households and firms, sticky prices and wages, and international linkages in a large-scale macroeconometric model (Taylor 1993a). This project demonstrated conclusively that it was possible to construct, estimate, and simulate such a model for real-world policy analysis. At the time, he was a one of just a few academics working on such large-scale models. If it were not for John’s success at keeping the flame alive during that period, I fear that the ongoing development of new generations of macro models that incorporate better micro foundations and explicit treatment of expectations at the Board of Governors and other central banks would never have occurred.\n\nFinally, let me turn to what I think of as the most important of John Taylor’s contributions to policymaking: the development of a set of principles of good monetary policy. Perhaps not surprisingly, these principles are each exemplified by the Taylor Rule.\n\nThe first principle is that policy should be systematic and predictable. Remember that his famous paper was titled “Discretion versus Policy Rules in Practice” (Taylor, 1993b). This principle permeates the analysis and discussions at the Fed today. The Board staff regularly reports the policy prescriptions from estimated monetary policy rules, and the model simulations that are used to illustrate risks assume policy will respond according to an estimated policy rule. Of course, extraordinary or novel circumstances can arise where policy needs to deviate from its standard approach, but that should be the exception, not—so to speak—the rule.\n\nI should mention at this point how influential John’s call for systematic policy has been at the Fed. When I became a Governor back in 1994, I was privy to little analysis that used monetary policy rules. At the time, I argued that the FOMC should, at a minimum, routinely monitor the recommendations of Taylor-type policy rules as a check on its judgmental decisions. In particular, I felt that the internal use of such Taylor-type rules might prove helpful in preventing the FOMC from overreacting to shocks—falling into the so-called “thermostat trap.” Nowadays, I am pleased to say, such analysis is routinely provided and discussed.\n\nThe second principle is the so-called “Taylor Principle,” namely, that the nominal interest rate must rise or fall by more than one-for-one with a corresponding movement in the inflation rate.4 In a variety of models where spending depends on real interest rates, the Taylor principle is a necessary condition to avoid potentially catastrophic outcomes. In forward-looking models it is needed to assure a unique rational expectations equilibrium; in backward-looking models, it is needed to avoid explosive behavior. This principle seems obvious now, but Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (2000), among others, have argued that the Federal Reserve did not satisfy it during the 1970s, contributing to the poor economic performance during this period. Although there is an ongoing debate about how the Fed went wrong in the 1970s, we all agree that we need to satisfy the Taylor principle today.\n\nThe third principle, and one that is embedded in the Taylor rule, is that policy should “lean against the wind” in response to deviations from the desired levels of inflation and output. In response to a demand shock that lowers output and inflation, the funds rate is cut, restoring output and inflation back to their desired levels. In response to a supply shock that lowers output but raises inflation, the Taylor Rule implicitly embeds the tradeoffs of the objectives in the dual mandate by producing a path for policy that ultimately restores inflation to its long-run values but does so only gradually, avoiding sharp swings in output. Of course, the specification of the monetary policy rule that best achieves the central bank’s goals is the subject of ongoing research, but the basic principle is widely accepted.\n\nFinally, the fourth principle is that any monetary policy rule should be robust to uncertainty.5 Indeed, the specification of the original Taylor Rule was not chosen to be optimal in any one particular model, but was based on its “good” performance in monetary-policy-rule evaluation exercises using a variety of macroeconomic models.6This approach places greatest weight on getting the “basics” right; that is, it emphasizes policy prescriptions in which we have the most confidence. This approach is purposefully modest in that it does not attempt to take advantage of all the potential benefits of the optimal policy in a given model. In fact, subsequent research has shown that the cost of insuring against model misspecification is relatively small because fully optimal rules yield typically only small stabilization benefits over simple rules like the Taylor Rule.7\n\nUnlike the other principles which are uncontroversial, this last principle is still the subject of research and debate. But, based on my experience, John’s position on the benefits of robustness seems the right one to me. As a policymaker who relies on models and forecasts myself, I recognize the great degree of uncertainty about all aspects of our models and our limited ability to predict the future. Indeed, one of the strengths of the FOMC is that it brings together 19 different views of how the economy behaves and 19 different forecasts of the future. It would be a mistake to ignore these differences and rely too much on one particular model to guide our decisionmaking.\n\nThis conference has brought together leading economists from around the globe who continue the research programs that John Taylor began over the past 30 or so years. As I noted above, a key contribution has been to bring rational expectations into models used for monetary policy analysis. This research has had big payoffs in terms of improving our understanding of the economy and monetary policy.\n\nBut, looking ahead, to me the biggest challenge for macroeconomists and monetary policymakers in creating more realistic models will be how to incorporate some forms of deviations from perfect rationality and knowledge in macro models used for policy analysis. This may take the form of near-rational behavior as in behavioral economics or bounded rationality as in models of learning. I should note that one of John’s earliest papers was concerned with the behavior of the economy while people learned (Taylor 1975). The asset price movements over the past decade amply illustrate that the economy does not always behave the way our standard models predict. More generally, small deviations from full rationality in consumer or firm behavior can have large consequences on the behavior of the macro economy. This is a big challenge, but I am confident the payoffs will be large.\n\nEndnotes\n\n1. I am deeply grateful to John Williams for outstanding assistance in the preparation of these remarks.\n\n2.

        "content": "Good afternoon. I’m honored by the invitation to speak to you today, and I’m especially pleased to have the chance to visit Los Angeles, where, as you may know, our Reserve Bank has a major branch. This is such an important metropolitan area, both for the District and for the nation, that I particularly welcome the opportunity to exchange views with you about local and national economic conditions, and I’m looking forward to a lively question-and-answer session following my remarks.\n\nI would like to focus on recent developments in financial markets. I will discuss their impact on the prospects for the U.S. economy, and offer my perspective on the policy actions that the Fed has taken to address them, including steps to improve liquidity in financial markets and also the decision of the Federal Open Market Committee, several weeks ago, to ease the stance of monetary policy by reducing the federal funds rate by 50 basis points. Before I continue, I want to emphasize that these remarks reflect my own personal views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nLet me begin with the financial markets and review some of the recent developments I consider to be relevant in evaluating the prospects for the economy going forward. Beginning in mid-July, global financial markets became highly volatile and increasingly averse to risk. In the U.S., perhaps the most dramatic illustration of the ensuing flight to safety was the decline in the three-month Treasury bill rate, which dipped by almost 2 percentage points between mid-July and August 20th.\n\nDramatically wider yield spreads on credit default swaps, which provide insurance against default on the underlying securities, are further evidence of increased risk aversion in financial markets. Indeed, wider spreads became evident for a host of underlying instruments, from mortgages to corporate bonds, with lower-rated instruments seeing especially big increases in spreads. At the same time, options-based implied volatilities on a range of assets, from equities to foreign exchange, increased markedly, reflecting heightened uncertainty about the future. Treasury bill rates partially rebounded from their lows in August, and credit default spreads abated somewhat, but risk aversion remains notably high. This same turbulence has hit markets abroad, where risk spreads and implied volatilities are up, and there has been a significant flight to safety.\n\nBorrowing costs facing households and firms directly influence their spending decisions and aggregate demand and, for this reason, they are of particular relevance to monetary policy. On the corporate side, prime borrowers have experienced little net change in their borrowing costs because higher spreads have been offset by lower Treasury rates, which, have been influenced both by the flight to safety and, of course, by actual and expected Fed action to cut the funds rate. Issuers of low-grade corporate bonds with greater credit risk, in contrast, face moderately higher borrowing costs.\n\nThe mortgage market has been the epicenter of the financial shock, and, not surprisingly, greater aversion to risk has been particularly apparent there, with spreads above Treasuries increasing for mortgages of all types. Although borrowing rates for low-risk conforming mortgages have actually decreased, other mortgage rates have risen, including those available to some borrowers with high credit ratings. In particular, rates on jumbo mortgages, both fixed- and adjustable-rate, have risen since mid-July.\n\nSubprime mortgages—which have been a major trouble spot—have become difficult to get at any rate. And that reflects another sign of the increased caution of market participants, specifically, more restricted credit terms and availability. In the mortgage market, lenders have tightened credit standards, making nonprime and jumbo mortgages available to fewer borrowers. For example, mortgage lenders report raising FICO scores and lowering allowable loan-to-value ratios in many mortgage loan programs, and many subprime programs have been shut down altogether.\n\nMoreover, some markets have been experiencing illiquidity; in other words, the markets themselves are not functioning efficiently, or may not be functioning much at all. I am referring particularly to the markets for securitized assets, such as mortgage-backed securities, and that for asset-backed commercial paper. This illiquidity has become an enormous problem for companies that specialize in originating mortgages and then bundling them to sell as securities. The markets for selling these securities have all but dried up, except for the lowest-risk, “conforming” agency mortgages that can be sold to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. The asset-backed commercial paper market is where many firms, including financial institutions, get short-term funding. With liquidity problems in the markets in which many mortgage companies both sell assets and borrow, these firms have faced serious challenges, and a few have gone out of business.\n\nDepository institutions also have faced some illiquidity, specifically in term interbank funding markets—those for maturities in the one- to six-month range—as banks sought to conserve their liquidity. A concern that has added to the illiquidity of these markets is that mortgages and other assets that are normally securitized may come back onto banks’ balance sheets and that customers may draw on unsecured credit lines. Although liquidity in these markets has improved since mid-September, they remain impaired.\n\nMany of the liquidity problems afflicting banks and other financial market participants are gradually being resolved, but it’s not clear that all markets will return to “business as usual,” as defined by conditions in the first half of this year, even after that occurs. For one thing, many of the structured credit products that became so widely used may prove to be too complex to be viable going forward, and this would more or less permanently reduce the quantity of credit available to some risky borrowers. Moreover, as I mentioned, if financial intermediation that was routinely conducted via asset securitization and off-balance sheet financing vehicles ultimately migrates back onto the books of the banks, borrowing spreads and lending terms are likely to remain tighter given current limitations on bank capital and the higher costs of conducting intermediation through the banking sector. Most importantly, the recent widening of spreads appears to reflect a return to more realistic pricing of risk throughout the economy. This development may be positive for the long run, but it will be contractionary in the short run.\n\nTo assess how financial conditions relevant to aggregate demand have changed, we must consider not only credit markets but also the markets for equity and foreign exchange. These markets have hardly been immune to recent financial turbulence, but the changes since mid-July are, on balance, less dramatic. Broad equity indices have been very volatile, but, on the whole, they are little changed since mid-July. As for the dollar, it has declined on a trade-weighted basis, but only moderately.\n\nThe Fed has three main responsibilities that pertain to these developments: promoting financial stability to help financial markets function in an orderly way, supervising and regulating banks and bank holding companies to ensure the safety and soundness of the banking system, and conducting monetary policy to achieve its congressionally mandated goals of price stability and maximum sustainable output and employment.\n\nWith regard to its responsibilities for financial market stability, the Fed took a number of steps to help restore liquidity in the financial markets. One step in the second week of August involved a sizable injection of reserves to prevent the federal funds rate from rising above its 5¼ percent target in the face of huge demands for short-term, liquid funds. In addition, on August 17 the Fed announced a cut in the discount rate of 50 basis points, which narrowed the spread with the target federal funds rate. The announcement also indicated that term loans would be made available for periods up to 30 days, renewable by the borrower. Furthermore, the Fed made clear that asset-backed commercial paper, which had become highly illiquid, is acceptable as collateral for discount window borrowing. These efforts to encourage the use of the discount window were designed to promote the restoration of orderly conditions in financial markets by providing depositories with greater assurance about the cost and availability of funding. While helpful, these actions have not, however, served as a panacea.\n\nIn its role as a supervisor and regulator of banks, the Fed has long focused on insuring that banks hold adequate capital and that they carefully monitor and manage risks. As a consequence, the strong capital positions of banks should be helpful to them in weathering the financial turmoil. The Fed is carefully monitoring the impact of recent financial developments on the banking system and on core institutions involved in the payments system. Importantly, the Fed’s supervisory role has facilitated the collection of timely and reliable information on developments in banking and capital markets, and the insights gained through this process have been critical in shaping the Fed’s response in recent weeks.\n\nFor the conduct of monetary policy, the main question is how financial developments and other economic factors are likely to affect the outlook for the U.S. economy and the risks to that outlook. The reason this is the main question is that monetary policy’s unswerving focus should be on pursuing the Fed’s congressionally mandated goals of price stability and full employment.\n\nThis brings me to the issue of “moral hazard,” a topic that has been much discussed since the recent financial turbulence began. A concern that is frequently expressed is that an easing of the stance of monetary policy could end up shielding investors who misjudged fundamentals or incorrectly assessed risks from losses and thereby lead them to take inappropriate risks in the future because they think the Fed will act to cushion the consequences of their decisions. I have two responses to this concern. First, the Fed’s policy response will not prevent a repricing of risk from occurring and investors who misjudged risks will surely suffer losses even if monetary policy is successful in keeping the economy on track. Second, I don’t believe that the Fed should stand aside as a financial shock threatens to derail the economy, because that would run the risk of many innocent people being hurt by the loss of jobs and economic well-being. So I believe that, in conducting monetary policy, the Fed should retain a clear focus on how financial market developments are likely to affect employment, output, and inflation and not be concerned with who wins and who loses in financial markets.\n\nWith those principles in mind, let me briefly review recent economic developments. The U.S. economy turned in a fairly good performance in the first half of the year. Growth in the first quarter was weak, but it picked up to a robust pace in the second quarter. Overall, it appears that the economy turned in a reasonably good performance in the third quarter as well. Output growth appears to have been pretty solid even though growth in payroll employment in the private sector slowed noticeably in August and September to only 52,000 jobs on average from an average of 111,000 jobs over the prior six months. Recent data on personal consumption expenditures have been robust. Manufacturing output and orders for core capital goods have been upbeat, and business investment in equipment and software promises to be a bright spot. Despite the hike in borrowing costs for higher-risk corporate borrowers and the illiquidity in markets for collateralized loan obligations, it appears that financing for capital spending for most firms remains readily available on terms that have been little affected by the recent financial turmoil.\n\nThat said, most of these data are too early to reflect the effects of the financial turmoil, and those effects are more likely to show up in data for the current quarter. Indeed, the financial shock seems likely to intensify an already steep downturn in housing. As I noted, mortgage interest rates have risen and these increases seem likely to exert some negative impact on this sector. More important, in my view, are the potential effects stemming from disruptions to the availability of credit and the tightening of mortgage lending standards that are occurring. The illiquidity in many segments of the market for mortgage-backed securities seems likely to limit credit flows and therefore to have at least some negative effect on real residential construction, depending on how long the disruptions persist. A key point is that, even as liquidity in mortgage-backed securities markets improves, the risk spreads incorporated in mortgage rates will likely remain higher on a long-term basis than they have been in recent years, and this could prolong the adjustment in the housing sector.\n\nIndeed, forward-looking indicators of conditions in housing markets were pointing lower even before the financial market turmoil began. Housing permits and sales were trending down. Inventories of unsold new homes remained at very high levels, and they will need to be worked off before construction can begin to rebound. Finally, most measures of house prices at the national level fell moderately. Notably, despite these declines, the ratio of house prices to rents—a kind of price-dividend ratio for housing—remains quite high by historical standards, suggesting that further price declines may be needed to bring housing markets into balance. This perspective is reinforced by futures markets for house prices, which expect further declines in a number of metropolitan areas this year. The downturn in house prices would likely be intensified by a simultaneous decline in employment, should that occur, since significant job loss would weaken demand for housing and raise foreclosures.\n\nHere in California, the rise and fall of house prices has been much like the nation’s, only more so. In 2004 and 2005, many homeowners gleefully watched the meter tick up and up and up on their house values. But since then, things have changed dramatically. The pace of home sales has slowed substantially, and virtually every metropolitan area in California has seen much larger downward swings in the pace of house price appreciation than the nation. In fact, the majority of them have recorded outright declines in average house prices over the past year. As I’m sure you know, these developments have hit close to home here in Southern California, where the once hot housing markets have cooled considerably.\n\nCalifornia also has played a significant role in the problems with subprime mortgages that have swept the nation. This state used to have one of the lowest subprime delinquency rates in the U.S., but more recently it has seen them increase dramatically, so that now California ranks about in the middle of the states on this scale. Moreover, within the state, the various regions exemplify a wide range of experiences with problem loans. By one measure of delinquencies on all types of mortgages, three metro areas—the Inland Empire and Merced and Stockton in the Central Valley—are in the top ten in the entire U.S. In contrast, here in the Los Angeles-Long Beach area, delinquency rates are running at about the middle of the pack among metro areas for the country.\n\nNow let me return to the national economy. Beyond the housing sector’s direct impact on GDP growth, a significant issue is its impact on personal consumption expenditures, which have been the main engine of growth in recent years. Indeed, data on consumption spending in the last few months have continued to show strength. The nature and extent of the linkages between housing and consumer spending, however, are a topic of debate among economists. Some believe that these linkages run mainly through total wealth, of which housing wealth is a part. Others argue that house prices affect consumer spending by changing the value of mortgage equity. Less equity, for example, reduces the quantity of funds available for credit-constrained consumers to borrow through home equity loans or to withdraw through refinancing. The key point is that, according to both theories, a drop in house prices is likely to restrain consumer spending to some extent, and this view is backed up by empirical research on the U.S. economy.\n\nIndeed, in the new environment of higher rates and tighter terms on mortgages, we may see other negative impacts on consumer spending. The reduced availability of high loan-to-value ratio and piggyback loans may drive some would-be homeowners to pull back on consumption in order to save for a sizable down payment. In addition, credit-constrained consumers with adjustable-rate mortgages seem likely to curtail spending, as interest rates reset at higher levels and they find themselves with less disposable income.\n\nAnother engine of growth that could be a little weaker going forward due to the ongoing turmoil is foreign economic activity. Foreign real GDP—weighted by U.S. export shares—advanced at robust rates of 3¾ to 4 percent in 2004 and through the first quarter of this year. This growth was widespread, affecting nearly every continent. With the trade-weighted dollar falling over this same period, U.S. exports have been strong—real exports increased by an average of nearly 8 percent during 2004 through 2006. Partly for this reason, U.S. net exports, which consistently held growth down from 2000 to 2005, actually gave it a lift during 2006. Before the recent global financial turmoil, I had assumed a modest deceleration in world economic activity, which meant that net exports were likely to “turn neutral”—neither retarding nor stimulating growth in the year or so ahead. At this point, it’s still very difficult to gauge the likelihood of this “neutral” scenario, but it does seem safe to say that these developments add some downside risks to it.\n\nTo sum up the story on the outlook for aggregate demand, I see downward pressure based on recent data indicating further weakening in the housing sector and the tightening of financial markets. As I have indicated, a big issue is whether developments in the relatively small housing sector will spread to the large consumption sector, perhaps through declines in house prices. Should the decline in house prices occur in the context of rising unemployment, the risks could be significant.\n\nTurning to inflation, signs of improvement in underlying inflationary pressures are evident in recent data. Over the past twelve months, the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, or the core PCE price index, has increased by 1.8 percent. Just several months ago, the twelve-month change was quite a bit higher, at nearly 2½ percent. It wouldn’t surprise me if core PCE price inflation edged down a little bit more over the next few years. This view is predicated on continued well-anchored inflation expectations. It also assumes the emergence of some slack in the labor market, as well as the ebbing of the upward effects of movements in energy and commodity prices. However, we do still face some inflation risks, mainly due to faster increases in unit labor costs and the depreciation of the dollar, and these will need to be watched carefully.\n\nWith that view of recent financial developments and the outlook for the U.S. economy, I’d like to turn to monetary policy. On September 18, the FOMC reduced the federal funds rate target by 50 basis points. In the accompanying press release, the Committee noted that the financial shock has the potential to intensify the housing correction and to restrain economic growth more generally. The action at the September meeting was meant to help “forestall” some of the potential fallout to the economy from the disruptions in financial markets and to promote moderate growth over time.\n\nThe Committee’s decision reflected a forward-looking and preemptive approach to policy. The policy move was not primarily a reaction to data in hand at the time of the meeting. Under the circumstances, available information on spending and output mainly reflected conditions before the financial disruptions began and was therefore less informative than under normal conditions about the appropriate stance of policy.\n\nI believe that it was important to put a substantial easing in place in September so as not to fall “behind the curve.” Given the long lags between policy actions and their impact on the economy, and the possibility that economic downturns can be difficult to reverse once they take hold, a more gradual and reactive approach would have created unnecessary economic risks. That said, it is inherently difficult to assess the stance of policy that is needed to ensure that the economy would grow at a moderate pace given uncertainties about financial developments and their impact on the economy.\n\nI view the Committee’s decision as reflecting a sensible balance in striving to achieve our twin goals—maximum sustainable employment and low inflation. The Committee noted in its statement that “some inflation risks remain.” I nevertheless considered the larger-than-usual cut in the funds rate prudent because of two features of the current environment. First, the stance of monetary policy before the September meeting was probably a bit on the restrictive side, at least according to many estimates of the so-called “neutral” or “equilibrium” federal funds rate. In fact, the stance of policy was growing more restrictive as core inflation gradually trended down. Second, with the economy operating near potential and inflation well contained, a case could have been made that the funds rate would need to move down toward a neutral stance, even if there had not been a financial shock.\n\nFinally, I’d like to emphasize what I hope my talk has already made clear—that these are uncertain times. Any forecast and any analysis of events should be made with a great deal of humility about its correctness. And that’s why I am keeping an open mind about prospects for the future and why the Committee stressed, to quote from the statement, that it: “will continue to assess the effects of these and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.”\n\nI’d be pleased to take any questions.\n\n1. I would like to thank San Francisco Fed staff members John Judd and Judith Goff for excellent assistance in the preparation of these remarks.\n\n# # #"

        "content": "I want to congratulate the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston for organizing a fascinating and thought-provoking conference. I applaud the Bank’s decision to establish a center to promote and support research in behavioral economics and concur wholeheartedly with the judgment that motivates these initiatives—that research in behavioral economics is broadening and enriching our understanding of decisionmaking. This research has the potential to strengthen the conceptual and empirical underpinnings of macroeconomic policy.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is one of a growing number of organizations that have already taken some implications of behavioral research to heart. This year, we began to automatically enroll new employees into our System’s savings plan, defaulting them into an asset allocation fund that includes fixed income, domestic, and international equity investments. Employees who do not want to participate can, of course, easily opt out. But our early experience mirrors well-known research findings: so far, an overwhelming fraction of employees who were defaulted in remain in. Of course, this choice reflects the Federal Reserve System’s appreciation of the striking findings of behavioral economics concerning the sensitivity of saving decisions to default enrollments.\n\nIn terms of the Federal Reserve’s public policy responsibilities, I can easily envision other ways in which explorations in behavioral economics could be of practical use. For example, one of the Federal Reserve’s responsibilities is to design consumer disclosures, including the information that borrowers receive from lenders when they take out a mortgage, apply for a credit card, or lease a new vehicle. As we have unfortunately seen recently, such disclosures have not always been effective in conveying the key information that is relevant to such decisions in a salient, understandable, and timely way. Indeed, recent research by the Federal Trade Commission2 documents that a large fraction of mortgage borrowers fail to understand the financial implications of prepayment penalties and other complex loan features. To improve the effectiveness of such disclosures, the Federal Reserve has begun to use consumer testing techniques,3 but there remains substantial scope for behavioral research to contribute to the design of more effective practices in the consumer disclosure area.\n\nToday, however, I would like to focus on some implications of behavioral economics for the conduct of monetary policy. I will concentrate on implications of behavioral research for the Phillips curve, although the papers at this conference demonstrate that behavioral economics has implications for many other aspects of macroeconomic modeling, including the behavior of housing and other asset prices, and the specification of crucial components of aggregate demand, such as the consumption function.\n\nThe Phillips curve is a core component of every realistic macroeconomic model. It plays a critical role in policy determination, because its characteristics importantly influence the short- and long-run tradeoffs that central banks face as they strive to achieve price stability and, in the Federal Reserve’s case, maximum sustainable employment—our second, congressionally mandated goal. I will argue that behavioral economics can enhance our understanding of the Phillips curve, and this is important for two reasons: First, better models of the inflation process help improve our forecasts and clarify limitations on what monetary policy can do. Second, the theoretical underpinnings of the Phillips curve are important in understanding what central banks should do. In other words, beyond determining the “constraints” governing what is feasible, models underpinning the Phillips curve have implications for the way in which central banks should interpret their price stability mandate and for assessing the welfare costs of fluctuations in output and inflation.\n\nThe New Keynesian model provides theoretical microfoundations for a Phillips curve that relates actual inflation to expected inflation one period ahead as well as to marginal cost. 4 This model has become a standard workhorse for policy analysis, and provides loose justification for empirical implementations of the Phillips curve, which typically relate actual inflation to lags of inflation (as a proxy for expected inflation), a measure of the output or unemployment gap (which proxies for cyclical fluctuations in marginal cost), and other variables reflecting “supply shocks” such as the prices of energy and imported goods. The coefficient on the unemployment gap in the Phillips curve determines the slope of the “short-run” Phillips curve relationship between unemployment and inflation and is a crucial parameter for monetary policy because it influences the sacrifice ratio—the cost in terms of unemployment or lost output to lower inflation. Virtually all empirical research on the inflationary process finds that the “short-run” Phillips curve is flat enough to generate a significant short-run tradeoff.\n\nOf course, the existence of this empirical short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment also helped motivate the development of the New Keynesian model in the first place. In particular, with no frictions and with fully maximizing agents, markets should always clear, and the labor market should be no exception. Thus, the short-run Phillips curve “should be” vertical.5 This divergence between theory and reality was the original motivation for Keynesian economics. But in contrast to the ad hoc behavioral assumptions underlying old-style Keynesian theory, modern researchers have “amended” the neoclassical model with well-specified assumptions concerning the nature of preferences, the process of decisionmaking, the frictions characterizing markets, and the details of expectation formation. The objective has been to build models on sound microfoundations that are not only rigorous but also realistic.\n\nViewed in this light, the now standard New Keynesian approach explains the short-run Phillips curve tradeoff by introducing a key “friction” into neoclassical theory, namely, price-stickiness; such a friction is often justified as a menu cost of changing nominal prices. The consequence is that firms change the prices they charge only periodically, not continuously. With staggered decisionmaking across pricesetters, the aggregate price level exhibits inertia, rationalizing the short-run Phillips curve tradeoff. Other frictions, such as wage rigidity and habit persistence in consumption, are typically added to improve the fit of the model.\n\nBehavioral macroeconomic models have extended this agenda, both by providing new justifications for wage and price rigidity and by incorporating additional departures from the frictionless benchmark. Of course, the jury is still out on which modifications are most important empirically for understanding the macroeconomy. Nevertheless, the evidence presented throughout this conference regarding how people behave is too compelling to simply ignore. Let me discuss a few examples of behavioral macroeconomics.\n\nSome behavioral models assume that people follow simple heuristics or rules of thumb that require relatively little cognitive effort or time (such as focusing on only a few salient details of a problem). Indeed, the psychology and economics literature that builds on the work of Kahneman, Tversky, and others generally concludes that people do not make decisions in the fully rational way commonly envisioned in standard macroeconomic models. As Benjamin and Laibson (2003) summarize the findings of this literature: “Economic agents make good decisions but not perfectly rational ones.”\n\nOther behavioral models, including those surveyed by Fehr, Goette, and Zehnder (2007) and by Rotemberg (2007) at this conference, go much further, arguing that individual behavior is affected by a reliance on nominal frames of reference and by considerations such as fairness, envy, social status, and social norms. As Rotemberg makes clear, such assumptions can also rationalize the phenomenon of “price-stickiness” embodied in the Phillips curve.\n\nOf course a logical question is why such additional complexities are worth incorporating into macro models if the New Keynesian approach, based on costly price adjustment, is empirically satisfactory. The problem is that the New Keynesian Phillips curve is not fully satisfactory. For example, it is not consistent with contractionary disinflations or with the inflation persistence observed in the postwar period. It also is not consistent with empirical estimates of the joint responses of unemployment and inflation to monetary shocks.6</p>\n\nBehaviorally based macroeconomic models help address these concerns about the New Keynesian Phillips curve, notably by modifying the process of expectations formation, the feedback between expected future inflation and current inflation, the link between labor market conditions and firms’ marginal cost, and the impact of “supply shocks” on the inflation process. They also offer new insights. For example, Mankiw and Reis (2002) assume that decisionmakers form expectations using “sticky” or stale information, an assumption they justify on behavioral grounds. To keep their model more tractable, they assume that all agents act as if they had rational expectations, but most use outdated information. With this amendment of the standard New Keynesian model, the Mankiw-Reis version generates a short-run Phillips curve that is downward-sloping and that is consistent with inflation persistence and costly disinflation.\n\nOf course, the assumption of rational expectations, which Mankiw and Reis maintain, is a clear, but probably unrealistic, benchmark. Ball (2000) suggests, on near-rationality grounds, that perhaps people forecast with optimal univariate estimation rather than acting as if they knew the entire model.7 For the postwar period, this approach makes expected inflation close to being last period’s inflation—so expectations depend heavily on recent experience. Inflation is thus persistent, but this persistence is not structural. An important implication for policy is that, if policymakers change their behavior, the empirical dynamics of inflation could change markedly.\n\nLet me next turn to the long-run properties of the Phillips curve. Most macroeconomists accept that the long-run Phillips curve is vertical, so that steady-state unemployment is unaffected by the average level of inflation. Intriguingly, some behavioral models raise the possibility that steady-state unemployment might depend on the inflation rate.8 For example, Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry (2000) explore the implications of a model with money illusion, a phenomenon which, according to surveys and other empirical evidence, appears to be both widespread and significant in decisionmaking. In their model, when inflation is sufficiently low, most agents don’t focus on the difference between real and nominal variables, so inflation is relatively unimportant for nominal wage bargains and for prices. As inflation rises, however, it becomes salient to a growing fraction of agents who take it fully into account. This hypothesis gives rise to a long-run Phillips curve that is bowed in at very low inflation rates, backward bending at slightly higher rates, and ultimately vertical at the “natural rate” when inflation is sufficiently high. The implication is that a very small amount of inflation may lower equilibrium unemployment. Beyond a point, however, higher inflation raises equilibrium unemployment, since inflation becomes an increasingly salient factor in decisionmaking. Akerlof et al. argue that, in the late 1990s, as inflation fell to low levels, it became less salient to wage bargains, reducing the effective natural rate of unemployment.\n\nClosely related to the idea of money illusion is downward nominal wage rigidity which, as Fehr et al. discuss, may reflect considerations of fairness. Pervasive evidence of such nominal rigidity was identified, for example, by the International Wage Flexibility project (see Dickens et al., 2007). As Tobin (1972) originally showed, such downward nominal wage rigidity means that, at sufficiently low inflation rates, a significant fraction of firms would optimally cut nominal wages. This possibility is explored in another paper by Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry (1996). In their model, if productivity growth and steady-state inflation are low, then long-run unemployment might be relatively high. The reason is that some firms might need to cut real wages which, at very low inflation, requires nominal wage cuts. If they’re unwilling or unable to implement such cuts, then they may lay off workers instead. This reduction in labor demand leads to an increase in unemployment. Of course, if productivity growth is high, as it has been on average since the mid-1990s, then downward nominal wage rigidity becomes a less important issue.9 Behavioral considerations thus point to the possibility of a long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment at very low inflation rates.\n\nDownward nominal wage rigidity, as well as downward real wage rigidity, may also affect the linkages in the Phillips curve among unemployment, marginal cost, and inflation. In particular, norms governing the pay increases that are deemed fair may result in a short-run Phillips curve that is convex rather than linear. The nonlinearity is due to the fact that, even with high unemployment rates, firms are unwilling to treat workers in ways they consider unfair—either cutting nominal wages or raising nominal wages by less than workers think they should receive, causing inflation to “bottom out” as unemployment rises. For the United States, Clark, Laxton, and Rose (1996) find evidence of nonlinearity, although tests to discriminate among alternative functional forms of the Phillips curve suffer from extremely low power, making a reliable assessment of the degree of convexity impossible. The degree of convexity of the short-run Phillips curve is potentially important, however, because the volatility of unemployment and mean unemployment are inversely related along paths with constant expected inflation. This means that policies to stabilize unemployment produce the payoff of lowering it on average.\n\nAnother implication of behavioral economics for the Phillips curve relates to the impact of productivity growth on equilibrium unemployment when real wages exhibit some rigidity, a phenomenon found by the International Wage Project to be prevalent in many countries. Ball and Moffitt (2001), for example, have shown that shifts in productivity growth, like other supply shocks, can shift the Phillips curve and thereby change, at least for a time, the equilibrium unemployment rate, or NAIRU. Behavioral economics suggests that norms may govern the real wage increases that workers consider fair, and these norms or aspirations may be historically rooted. Shifts in productivity growth make it easier or more difficult for firms to meet these norms, altering, at least for a time, the unemployment rate that is consistent with growth in real wages that is in line with productivity. During the 1990s, faster productivity growth enabled firms to more easily meet norms for real wage growth that were depressed by the post-1973 productivity decline. In this view, the sluggish upward adjustment of norms enabled unemployment to fall to 40-year lows without igniting inflation. In essence, the short-run NAIRU was below its long-run level. By contrast, the poor experience of the 1970s reflected the collision of inherited norms for rapid real wage growth with the unpleasant reality of a sharp productivity slowdown.\n\nLet me wrap up these remarks on the implications of behavioral research for the properties of the Phillips curve by noting that at least some of the behaviorally based insights have already crept into our internal analysis and forecasts. For example, Federal Reserve policymakers often attributed favorable inflation performance in the late 1990s to fast productivity growth and its effect on the short-run NAIRU. And policy simulations with FRB/US, the Board of Governors’ main model, sometimes assume that agents form expectations by estimating reduced-form vector autoregressions rather than using model-consistent expectations.  Moreover, issues related to communications and credibility figure prominently in FOMC discussions, because members recognize that well-anchored inflation expectations, as we have had in the United States since the mid-1980s, can reduce the sacrifice ratio and the sensitivity of inflation to supply shocks. More generally, the Federal Reserve recognizes that public understanding of its reaction function can help people form expectations in ways that are likely to enhance the stability of the economy. Given the importance that expectations formation plays in all aspects of modern macroeconomic models, I see a high payoff to further behavioral research on how people actually form expectations. Moreover, behavioral research could be very useful in helping us understand how best to communicate our views on the economy and on policy.\n\nSo far, I have discussed how behavioral research affects our understanding of what policy can do. I now want to draw on some of this discussion to address the question of what policy should do—namely, what we can learn about the appropriate objectives of monetary policy.\n\nI’ll start with inflation. In the long run, everyone agrees that inflation primarily reflects the actions of the central bank. But what inflation rate should we strive for as a long-run objective? Existing theoretical work, grounded in neoclassical models, provides surprisingly little guidance. It points to the importance of “shoe-leather” costs, since individuals tend to economize on their use of cash as inflation rises. However, these costs are probably small at low to moderate inflation. More important, in all likelihood, is the impact on the incentive to save and invest stemming from the interaction of inflation with the tax code. But behavioral economics brings other considerations into play. Empirically, the evidence from surveys performed by Shiller (1997) and those discussed by Di Tella and McCulloch (2007) at this conference, reveal that individuals strongly dislike inflation. It appears to reduce reported happiness. Such evidence, along with evidence suggesting that individuals heavily rely on nominal frames of reference in decisionmaking, reinforce the desirability of keeping inflation quite low. After all, zero inflation, correctly measured, means that the distinction between real and nominal variables is unimportant; indeed, targeting a constant price level would make it easier for people to plan for the future. However, some considerations highlighted by behavioral research point in the opposite direction. For example, the tendency of workers to ignore inflation in wage bargaining until it becomes salient and the prevalence of downward nominal wage rigidity suggest that there may be potential benefits from choosing an inflation target that is low but positive. These arguments reinforce a case for some small inflation cushion to guard against deflationary risks due to the “zero nominal bound” on interest rates. Although empirical work suggests that downward nominal wage rigidity is prevalent in the United States, its importance diminishes when productivity growth is high, as it has been since the mid-1990s.\n\nLet me next turn to some implications of behavioral economics for the Fed’s role in stabilizing the real economy. Along with price stability, output stabilization has been an important policy objective during the postwar period, and fluctuations in both output and unemployment have diminished. The questions for policymakers are how large are the welfare losses that result from such output volatility and how beneficial would further reductions be?\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, standard economic theory suggests that the losses associated with output volatility of the magnitude experienced during the postwar period are quite small. Lucas (1987, 2003) spawned a large literature by arguing that the welfare gains fromadditional stabilization of the economy are tiny. Given standard preferences and the observed variance of consumption around a linear trend since 1947, he calculates that the representative American consumer would be willing to reduce his average consumption by a trivial amount, only ½ of 1/10th of a percent, to eliminate allremaining consumption volatility. Lucas concluded that stabilization of output, even if possible, should not be a 10 macroeconomic priority.\n\nIf Lucas’s calculation were correct, then the average person in the United States would value consumption stabilization (complete insurance) by only around $16 a year. 11 Compared with the premiums we pay for very partial insurance (e.g., for collision coverage on our cars), this seems implausibly low. The New Keynesian model offers one basis to conclude that the costs may be larger. For example, Galí, Gertler, and López-Salido (2007) argue that, because of wage and price markups, steady-state employment and output are inefficiently low. In their model, the welfare effects of booms and recessions are asymmetric because marginal increases in employment result in diminishing welfare gains. In good times, with low unemployment, the marginal gain from additional job creation may be low, because marginal employees may be close to indifferent between work and leisure. In contrast, job creation in bad times may yield a sizeable welfare surplus. As a result, recessions are particularly costly—welfare falls by more during a business-cycle downturn than it rises during a symmetric expansion. If good policy reduces the frequency and severity of recessions, then the analysis of Galí et al. suggests that the resulting welfare gains may be substantial.\n\nBehavioral considerations suggest some additional reasons why output stabilization may raise welfare. In particular, some of the behavioral phenomena discussed previously create the tantalizing prospect that a more stable economy may benefit from higher average levels of employment, output, and consumption. As DeLong and Summers (1988, p. 434) once put it, stabilization might “…fill in troughs without shaving off peaks.”12 Or, as in Barlevy (2004), stabilization might increase the economy’s long-run growth rate. In contrast, both the neoclassical model, analyzed by Lucas, and the New Keynesian model, analyzed by Galí et al. predict that mean consumption, output, and unemployment are unaffected by the volatility of these variables.\n\nOne behavioral reason that a more stable economy might enjoy lower average unemployment relates to the convexity of the short-run Phillips curve. If this relationship is convex, rather than linear, higher volatility in unemployment is associated with a higher mean. Recall that such convexity could reflect the influence of downward rigidity in either nominal or real wages. Interestingly, using U.S. data for the period 1971 to 1995, Debelle and Laxton (1997) estimate that the increase in mean unemployment associated with the volatility in unemployment over this period amounted to a nontrivial 0.33%.13 Yellen and Akerlof (2004) show that a similar argument applies if the long-run Phillips curve is not vertical at low inflation rates.\n\nFor policymakers, the bottom line of such research is that behavioral economic models tend to reinforce the priority that policymakers should attach to the goal of stabilizing output. But the magnitude of the possible gains are difficult to infer from existing empirical estimates of the Phillips curve. In principle, the happiness literature might give us some more direct evidence on these benefits. As Di Tella and McCulloch emphasize in their paper, there is persuasive evidence that happiness is inversely correlated with both unemployment and inflation. The finding that lower unemployment raises satisfaction even when it is fairly low to start with is consistent with the New Keynesian assumption that equilibrium unemployment is inefficiently high. But this finding sheds little light on how policymakers should assess the welfare consequences of fluctuations. This hinges on the more subtle issue of how volatility in unemployment affects well-being for a given mean. On this point Wolfers (2003), using subjective measures of satisfaction, found evidence of nonlinearity in the relationship between life satisfaction and unemployment, implying that unemployment volatility does undermine well-being. Even so, Wolfers found that the welfare benefits of reducing volatility are subject to rapidly diminishing returns, so that further reductions in the volatility of unemployment would raise welfare by only a relatively small amount, albeit by more than Lucas’s estimate.\n\nThere’s a lot more work to be done here to validate and confirm that happiness responses correspond to well-being.14 In addition, we care about more than just whether people are happy; we’d like to understand why. There is considerable scope for more refined survey evidence that focuses more precisely on what it is that people dislike about unemployment and inflation, and why. 15\n\nLet me conclude by summarizing what I think policymakers can learn from behavioral research bearing on the Phillips curve. This research provides clearcut evidence that people often deviate from the way that benchmark neoclassical theories assume. People have money illusion, follow rules of thumb, and care about issues like fairness and equity. As I’ve discussed, there’s a growing body of literature that shows that macroeconomic theories built on behavioral foundations have strikingly different implications from more standard theories. Behavioral research thus offers the promise of unified theories that can explain microeconomic behavior as well as the movements of macroeconomic aggregates.\n\nWith respect to the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate, behavioral research supports the view that inflation is costly, although very modest inflation might help protect against downward nominal wage rigidity. Behavioral macroeconomic models also provide theoretical underpinnings for the view held by most policymakers that, in the short run, monetary policy can and should strive to stabilize the real economy.\n\nIn sum, research on behavioral economics is as exciting for policymakers as it is for academics. It helps policymakers understand what they should care about and improves the quality of our economic models. The work at this conference highlights some of the progress that has been made, but also suggests that the marginal product of further research in behavioral economics is still likely to be very high.\n\nEndnotes\n\n1. I am deeply indebted to staff in the Economic Research Department of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and most particularly to John Fernald, for their help in preparing these remarks.\n\n2. See Lacko and Pappalardo (2007).\n\n3. See Kroszner (2007).\n\n4. The New Keynesian intuition for such a relationship is that firms that are readjusting their prices today will want higher prices if the marginal cost of production is relatively high; but they are also concerned that they might be unable to change their price in the future. Hence, if they expect inflation to be high in the future, they will want to raise their price by more today in order to keep from being stuck with a price that is too low.\n\n5. In a simple version of the New Keynesian Phillips curve, Mankiw (2001) shows that the slope of the curve is αλ2/1-λ, where λ is the fraction of agents that adjust their prices each period and α is the response of the desired real price to movements in the unemployment gap with a small value of α reflecting greater real rigidity. With perfectly flexible wages and prices, λ = 1 and the curve is vertical.\n\n6. Mankiw (2001) highlights these critiques.\n\n7. A key motivation for Ball (2000) is that inflation appears very persistent in the postwar period but not persistent under the gold standard, which was a very different monetary regime. Common features of New Keynesian models, such as backward-looking agents or price indexing, can yield more persistence but not its apparent regime-specific nature.\n\n8. Technically, in standard Phillips curve models, this relates to whether the coefficient on expected inflation is one.\n\n9. Recent productivity data have been, on balance, weaker than the average since the mid-1990s. But most, if not all, estimates of trend productivity growth remain above the average growth rate from 1973-1995.\n\n10. As Lucas (2003) makes clear, even taking his estimates at face value, such a calculation does not imply that the Federal Reserve should ignore fluctuations. Very long, very deep downturns, such as the Great Depression, are costly, and policy has avoided such episodes during the postwar period, presumably averting sizeable welfare costs.\n\n11. Reis (2007) suggests this way of framing the benefits of stabilization.\n\n12. Yellen and Akerlof (2004) survey this literature.\n\n13. 0.33% is the estimated difference between the average historical rate of unemployment and the deterministic NAIRU, defined as the unemployment rate consistent with nonaccelerating inflation in the absence of shocks.\n\n14. Responses do appear correlated with things like income, employment status, education, marital status, and so forth. And there is some evidence that these measures are, in turn, mirrored in suicide data (see Daly, Wilson, and Johnson, 2007), which is clearly of a very objective nature.\n\n15.

        "content": "Good morning. It’s my pleasure to welcome you to this beautiful city. I’m delighted that NABE chose to have its national meeting here, and I’m especially pleased to have been invited to speak to you today. As some of you may know, I occasionally use colorful language to describe the economy. Certainly, the events in financial markets over the past couple of months have generated their share of it. But I believe these are times when there is particularly great value in speaking deliberately, keeping a cool head, conducting careful analyses, and closely monitoring emerging developments. So those considerations will be reflected in the tenor of my remarks today. I would like to discuss recent events in financial markets, consider their impact on the prospects for the U.S. economy, and offer my perspective on recent Fed policy actions, both in its role in promoting stability in financial markets and in its role in the conduct of the nation’s monetary policy. I want to emphasize at the outset that these remarks reflect my own personal views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nLet me begin with the financial markets and review some of the recent developments I consider to be relevant in evaluating the prospects for the economy going forward. Beginning in mid-July, global financial markets became highly volatile and increasingly averse to risk. In the U.S., perhaps the most dramatic illustration of the ensuing flight to safety was the decline in the three-month Treasury bill rate, which dipped by almost 2 percentage points between mid-July and August 20th.\n\nDramatically wider yield spreads on credit default swaps, which provide insurance against default on the underlying securities, are further evidence of increased risk aversion in financial markets. Indeed, wider spreads are evident for a host of underlying instruments, from mortgages to corporate bonds, with lower-rated instruments seeing especially big increases in spreads. At the same time, options-based implied volatilities on a range of assets, from equities to foreign exchange, increased markedly, reflecting heightened uncertainty about the future. Since mid-August, Treasury bill rates have partially rebounded and credit default spreads have abated somewhat, but risk aversion remains notably high. This same turbulence has hit markets abroad, where risk spreads and implied volatilities are up, and there has been a significant flight to safety.\n\nOf greater relevance to monetary policy are movements in the borrowing costs facing households and firms, since it is these interest rates that influence spending decisions and aggregate demand. On the corporate side, prime borrowers have experienced little change in their borrowing costs because higher spreads have been offset by lower Treasury rates. Issuers of low-grade corporate bonds with greater credit risk, in contrast, face sharply higher borrowing costs: spreads have widened so much that yields are up substantially since mid-July.\n\nIn the mortgage market, increased aversion to risk has been particularly apparent, with spreads above Treasuries increasing for mortgages of all types. Borrowing rates for low-risk conforming mortgages have actually decreased somewhat. But other mortgage rates have risen, including those available to some borrowers with high credit ratings. In particular, rates on jumbo mortgages, both fixed- and adjustable-rate, have risen noticeably since mid-July. Rates on home equity loans and lines of credit are also up, especially for those with high loan-to-value ratios.\n\nOf course, subprime mortgages have become difficult to get at any rate. And that reflects another sign of the increased caution of market participants, specifically, sharply restricted credit terms and availability. In the mortgage market, lenders have tightened credit standards, making nonprime and jumbo mortgages available to fewer borrowers. For example, mortgage lenders report raising FICO scores and lowering allowable loan-to-value ratios in many mortgage loan programs, and many subprime programs have been shut down altogether.\n\nMoreover, some markets have become downright illiquid; in other words, the markets themselves are not functioning efficiently, or may not be functioning much at all. This illiquidity has become an enormous problem for companies that specialize in originating mortgages and then bundling them to sell as securities. The markets for selling these securities have all but dried up, except for the lowest-risk, “conforming” agency mortgages that can be sold to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. And a market where many firms, including financial institutions, get short-term funding is illiquid as well, namely, the market for asset-backed commercial paper—short-term business loans that are secured by other assets, often mortgages. With liquidity problems in the markets in which many mortgage companies both sell assets and borrow, these firms have faced serious challenges, and a few have gone out of business.\n\nDepository institutions also face some illiquidity, specifically in the funding markets for maturities in the one- to six-month range. Compounding their liquidity problems are concerns that mortgages and other assets that are normally securitized may come back onto their balance sheets and that customers may draw on unsecured credit lines.\n\nTo assess how financial conditions relevant to aggregate demand have changed, we must consider not only credit markets but also the markets for equity and foreign exchange. These markets have hardly been immune to recent financial turbulence, but the changes since mid-July, on balance, are less dramatic. Broad equity indices are down, but not sharply. And the dollar has changed little on a trade-weighted basis, as appreciations against the euro and pound—which may reflect safe-haven demands—have been offset by a big depreciation against the yen, probably reflecting a withdrawal from the so-called “carry trade” in which investors borrowed at low rates in Japan and lent at higher rates in the U.S.\n\nAs these financial events have unfolded, many explanations have emerged. I have little doubt that scholars will study and debate the causes for some time to come. So I will only offer some tentative thoughts on why all of this happened.\n\nThe ostensible trigger seems to have been concern about growing delinquencies on subprime mortgages. There are legitimate and serious concerns about the extent to which subprime delinquencies are traceable to predatory lending practices and a deterioration in underwriting standards over the last few years. However, some of these delinquencies arguably resulted from environmental changes—rising market interest rates, as the Fed removed accommodation in the stance of policy, and intensifying weakness in housing markets, which slowed or reversed the long-standing trend of significant house-price appreciation.\n\nIn this new environment, borrowers with variable-rate mortgages have started to see their rates reset much higher than they may have expected, and most borrowers have seen their home equity building up much more slowly than expected or even shrinking. Among these are some—many in the subprime category—who were barely able to make the original terms of their mortgages, in part because these loans incorporated features like “piggyback” loans to cover down payments, loans requiring low or no documentation, interest-only loans, and adjustable-rate loans with the option to make reduced payments for a time resulting in negative amortization. For many of these borrowers, particularly those who bought homes during 2005 and 2006, the environmental changes have been enough to push them to delinquency or default.\n\nWhile the problems with subprime mortgages have understandably received a lot of attention, it is important to remember that the whole subprime market itself is only a relatively small part—10 to 15 percent, depending on the exact definition—of the overall mortgage market. How, then, could problems in this relatively small market infect so much of the financial sector, and possibly real economic activity? The answer appears to lie in the characteristics of some of the complex financial instruments that have been developed as a means to diversify and spread risk. These instruments include not only mortgage-backed securities, including subprime mortgages, but also CDOs—collateralized debt obligations that package bonds, including mortgage-backed securities—and CLOs—collateralized loan obligations that package business loans—and a variety of associated derivatives, such as credit default swaps and indices based on such swaps. These instruments are obviously very complex, which makes them difficult to understand and evaluate, not only for the average investor, but even for sophisticated investors. In particular, it is difficult to determine the risk embedded in these instruments and how to price them.\n\nInvestors have relied on a variety of means to assess their exposure to them—from high-powered mathematical models to agencies that assign ratings to them. But models are, at best, approximations, and, because these instruments are relatively new, there were not necessarily enough data available to estimate how they would do under the stress of a downturn in housing prices or economic activity. As for the rating agencies, once recent developments began to break, they quickly began announcing sharp downgrades, which intensified awareness of the uncertainty surrounding the risk characteristics of many of these instruments.\n\nAs delinquencies have risen in the subprime market, the complex instruments associated with those mortgages have come under question. Moreover, questions have arisen concerning the underwriting standards used by financial firms that received fees to originate and package mortgages for sale rather than holding them for their own account. In consequence, holders of these securities, many highly leveraged, have been forced to sell into illiquid markets, realizing prices that are substantially below their model-based estimates, or to sell liquid assets as an alternative. Significant losses have been realized in the process.\n\nOnce other investors saw how quickly and unpredictably such markets could cease to function well, those who used similar complex instruments likely grew concerned about how quickly and unpredictably their own exposures might change for the worse, leading them to pull back, too. One might say that these developments bring us back to Latin 101 and the root of the word “credit.” The root is “credo,” which means “I believe” or “I trust”—that is, investors’ belief was shaken, both in the information they had on the degree of risk these instruments embodied and in the price they were going for, and they are pulling back from these markets, presumably until they understand these instruments well enough to restore that belief.\n\nEven with corrections to credit underwriting standards, it still may turn out that these innovations don’t actually spread risk as transparently or effectively as once thought, and this would mean—to some extent—a more or less permanent reduction of credit flowing to risky borrowers and long-lasting shifts in patterns of financial intermediation. It also could mean an increase in risk premiums throughout the economy that persists even after this turbulent period has passed. In a speech I gave a few months ago, I focused on the phenomenon of low risk premiums in interest rates throughout the world.2 In fact, there was considerable debate about what might be causing the very low price for taking on risk. What we are seeing now could be the beginning of a return to more normal risk pricing. As such, this development would not be disturbing for the long run. However, as we are seeing, the transition from one regime to the other can be quite painful.\n\nThe Fed has three main responsibilities that pertain to these developments: promoting financial stability to help financial markets function in an orderly way, supervising and regulating banks and bank holding companies to ensure the safety and soundness of the banking system, and conducting monetary policy to achieve its congressionally mandated goals of price stability and maximum sustainable output and employment. With regard to its responsibilities for financial market stability, the Fed recently lowered the discount rate by 50 basis points and encouraged banks to borrow at the discount window, emphasizing the broad range of collateral that is acceptable for such loans. Such collateral includes mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed commercial paper that have become illiquid.\n\nAs a supervisor and regulator of banks, the Fed has long focused on insuring that banks hold adequate capital and that they carefully monitor and manage risks. As a consequence, banks are well-positioned to weather the financial turmoil. The Fed is carefully monitoring the impact of recent financial developments on the banking system and on core institutions involved in the payments system. Importantly, the Fed’s supervisory role has facilitated the collection of timely and reliable information on developments in banking and capital markets, and the insights gained through this process have been critical in shaping the Fed’s response in recent weeks.\n\nFor the conduct of monetary policy, the main question is how recent financial developments and other economic factors affect the outlook for the U.S. economy and the risks to that outlook. The reason this is the main question is that monetary policy’s unswerving focus should be on pursuing the Fed’s mandated goals of price stability and full employment. Monetary policy should not be used to shield investors from losses. Indeed, investors who misjudged fundamentals or misassessed risks are certain to suffer losses even if policy is successful in keeping the economy on track.\n\nWith those principles in mind, let me briefly review recent economic developments. The U.S. economy turned in a fairly good performance in the first half of the year. Growth in the first quarter was weak, but it picked up to a robust pace in the second quarter. For the current quarter, payroll employment did not rise as expected, but instead actually fell slightly in August, in part due to a drop in construction jobs. However, recent data on manufacturing output and on orders and shipments for core capital goods have been upbeat, and business investment in equipment and software promises to be a bright spot. Despite the hike in borrowing costs for higher-risk corporate borrowers and the illiquidity in markets for CLOs, it appears that financing for capital spending for most firms remains readily available on terms that have been little affected by the recent financial turmoil. Of course, the outlook for capital spending could worsen if business confidence were shaken by turbulence in global financial markets.\n\nThat said, financial market turmoil seems likely to intensify the downturn in housing. At the macro level, we would expect some effect on housing demand from the rate increases related to these markets, but the impact from rates alone would likely be modest. More important, in my view, are the effects stemming from disruptions to the availability of credit and the tightening of lending standards that are occurring. The illiquidity in many segments of the market for mortgage-backed securities seems likely to limit credit flows and therefore to have at least some negative effect on real residential construction, depending on how long the disruptions persist. A key point is that, even when liquidity in the mortgage-backed securities market improves, the risk spreads incorporated in mortgage rates will likely remain higher on a long-term basis than they have been in recent years, and this could prolong the adjustment in the housing sector.\n\nIndeed, forward-looking indicators of conditions in housing markets were pointing lower even before the financial market turmoil began. Housing permits and sales were trending down. Inventories of unsold new homes remained at very high levels, and they will need to be worked off before construction can begin to rebound. Finally, most measures of house prices at the national level fell moderately. Notably, despite these declines, the ratio of house prices to rents—a kind of price-dividend ratio for housing—remains quite high by historical standards, suggesting that further price declines may be needed to bring housing markets into balance. This perspective is reinforced by futures markets for house prices, which expect further declines in a number of metropolitan areas this year. The downturn in house prices would likely be intensified by a simultaneous decline in employment, should that occur, since significant job loss would weaken demand for housing and raise foreclosures.\n\nBeyond the housing sector’s direct impact on GDP growth, a significant issue is its impact on personal consumption expenditures, which have been the main engine of growth in recent years. The nature and extent of the linkages between housing and consumer spending, however, are a topic of debate among economists. Some believe that these linkages run mainly through total wealth, of which housing wealth is a part. Others argue that house prices affect consumer spending by changing the value of mortgage equity. Less equity, for example, reduces the quantity of funds available for credit-constrained consumers to borrow through home equity loans or to withdraw through refinancing. The key point is that, according to both theories, a drop in house prices is likely to restrain consumer spending to some extent, and this view is backed up by empirical research on the U.S. economy.\n\nIndeed, in the new environment of higher rates and tighter terms on mortgages, we may see other negative impacts on consumer spending. The reduced availability of high loan-to-value ratio and piggyback loans may drive some would-be homeowners to pull back on consumption in order to save for a sizable down payment. In addition, credit-constrained consumers with adjustable-rate mortgages seem likely to curtail spending as interest rates reset at higher levels and they find themselves with less disposable income.\n\nAnother engine of growth that could be a little weaker going forward due to the ongoing turmoil is foreign economic activity. Foreign real GDP—weighted by U.S. export shares—advanced at robust rates of 3¾ to 4 percent in 2004 and through the first quarter of this year. This growth was widespread, affecting nearly every continent. With the trade-weighted dollar falling over this same period, U.S. exports have been strong—real exports increased by an average of nearly 8 percent during 2004 through 2006. Partly for this reason, U.S. net exports, which consistently held growth down from 2000 to 2005, actually gave it a lift during 2006. Before the recent global financial turmoil, I had assumed a modest deceleration in world economic activity, which meant that net exports were likely to “turn neutral”—neither retarding nor stimulating growth in the year or so ahead. At this early stage of the financial turmoil, it’s very difficult to gauge the likelihood of this “neutral” scenario, but it does seem safe to say that these developments add some downside risks to it.\n\nTo sum up the story on the outlook for aggregate demand, I see significant downward pressure based on recent data indicating further weakening in the housing sector and the tightening of financial markets. As I have indicated, a big issue is whether developments in the relatively small housing sector will spread to the large consumption sector, perhaps through declines in house prices. Should the decline in house prices occur in the context of rising unemployment, the risks could be significant.\n\nWhile I do think that the present financial situation has added appreciably to the downside risks to economic activity, we should remember that conditions can change quickly for better or for worse—especially in financial markets—so it’s hard right now to speak with a great deal of confidence about future economic developments. It’s also important to maintain a sense of perspective: past experience does show that financial turbulence can be resolved more quickly than seems likely when we’re in the middle of it. Moreover, the effects of these disruptions can turn out to be surprisingly small. A good example is the aftermath of the Russian debt default in 1998. Many forecasters predicted a sharp economic slowdown as a result; but instead, growth turned out to be robust.\n\nTurning to inflation, signs of improvement in underlying inflationary pressures are evident in recent data. Over the past twelve months, the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, or the core PCE price index, has increased by 1.9 percent. Just several months ago, the twelve-month change was quite a bit higher, at nearly 2½ percent. I anticipate that core PCE price inflation will edge down slightly further over the next few years. This view is predicated on continued well-anchored inflation expectations. It also assumes the emergence of some slack in the labor market, as well as the ebbing of the upward effects of several special factors—including energy and commodity prices and owners’ equivalent rent.\n\nWith that view of recent financial developments and the outlook for the U.S. economy, I’d like to turn to Fed policies. It’s unusual for me to use the plural—policies—because I’m normally referring only to monetary policy in which the FOMC pursues its dual mandate for the overall economy of full employment and price stability.\n\nHowever, this time around the Fed took a number of steps to help restore liquidity in the financial markets, some of which I have already mentioned. One step involved a sizable injection of reserves to prevent the federal funds rate from rising above its 5¼ percent target in the face of huge demands for short-term, liquid funds. In addition, on August 17 the Fed announced that the discount rate had been cut 50 basis points to narrow the spread with the target federal funds rate. The statement also indicated a change to the usual procedure, namely, to allow loans of up to 30 days, renewable by the borrower. Furthermore, the Fed made clear that asset-backed commercial paper, which had become highly illiquid, is acceptable as collateral for discount window borrowing. These efforts to encourage the use of the discount window were designed to promote the restoration of orderly conditions in financial markets by providing depositories with greater assurance about the cost and availability of funding. While helpful, these actions have not, however, served as a panacea.\n\nOn the same day, the Fed also issued a new statement on monetary policy, which said, and I quote: “although recent data suggest that the economy has continued to expand at a moderate pace, the Federal Open Market Committee judges that the downside risks to growth have increased appreciably.” This assessment apparently is similar to that of market participants. Investors’ perceptions of increased downside risks have resulted in a notable decline in the rates on federal funds futures contracts and their counterparts abroad. The statement emphasized that the Committee is prepared to act as needed to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in financial markets.\n\nIn determining the appropriate course for monetary policy, we must recognize that most of the data available now reflect conditions before the disruptions began and, therefore, tell us less about the appropriate stance of policy than they normally would. In addition to data lags, appropriate policy decisions must also, I believe, entail consideration of the role of policy lags–that is, the lag between a policy action and its impact on the economy. Addressing these policy complications requires not only careful and vigilant monitoring of financial market developments, but also the formation of judgments about how these developments will affect employment, output, and inflation. In other words, I believe it is critical to take a forward-looking approach—gauging the effects of recent developments on the outlook, and, importantly, the risks to that outlook.\n\n1.

        "content": "Good afternoon, everyone. I’m delighted to have the opportunity to speak to you today. This is my first trip to Alaska as the President of the San Francisco Fed, and, in preparation, I reviewed some of the economic statistics about this region. The numbers say that local employment has been growing at a healthy clip this year, especially in the travel and tourism sector. As a policymaker, it is very nice for me to be able to have those statistics come to life, seeing firsthand the vigor of the economy in Anchorage. As a tourist, I’m glad to be doing my part to boost the economy here, and so far it has been a pleasure. For example, yesterday, a group of us visited your outstanding Museum of History and Art, and the exhibits were truly impressive, as are the plans for its expansion. The museum is a fitting jewel box for the many treasures it holds of the past and present of the people and cultures of this state.\n\nAlaska, of course, is not only famous for its immense natural beauty and its fascinating cultures. It also is the home of many of the key natural resources the U.S. economy depends on, and tomorrow I will get a chance to see a bit of that side of the state. Helvi will escort several of us to the DeLong Mountains where we will tour the Red Dog mine, which operates on land owned by the NANA Regional Corporation. From there, we will go to Kiana, a fishing village 30 miles inside the Arctic Circle in the Kobuk Valley.\n\nAlthough I obviously get a lot of personal pleasure out of traveling around the District to fascinating places like Alaska, I’m also here for important official reasons. One of the great strengths of the Federal Reserve is its connection to the citizenry of the country. In this respect, the twelve Reserve Banks play a particularly important role. Through our directors, our advisory councils, and through meetings like this one, we can get some insight into the public’s viewpoint on issues that are vital to the conduct of monetary policy—issues like labor market conditions, expectations about inflation, and industry-specific developments, to name just a few. So I’m very much looking forward to the question and answer session that will follow my remarks, because I’m sure that I’m going to learn from you as much as you’re going to learn from me!\n\nThis afternoon I plan to talk about the outlook for the U.S. economy and the prospects for monetary policy, concentrating on several important factors shaping that outlook. Before I begin my formal remarks, I would like to note that my comments represent my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAs many of you probably know, the Federal Open Market Committee last met on June 27 and 28 and voted to hold the federal funds rate, our main policy tool, unchanged at 5¼ percent. To most observers of the Fed, the decision probably had a familiar ring to it, because the funds rate has been kept at that level for the last twelve months. Indeed, my views concerning the logic of this decision will also have a familiar ring to anyone who has heard me discuss monetary policy during the past year. To my mind, the reason for adopting and maintaining the current stance of policy is that it promises to keep the overall economy on an adjustment path where growth is moderate and sustainable. The virtues of this path are that it avoids exposing the economy to unnecessary risk of a downturn, while, at the same time, it is likely to produce enough slack in goods and labor markets to relieve inflationary pressures. I believed a year ago, and still believe now, that such a path is likely and will enable us to achieve our dual mandate—low and stable inflation and maximum sustainable employment.\n\nAlthough the federal funds rate, has remained unchanged for the past year, a number of developments over that time have warranted our close attention as well as our deliberate consideration about the appropriate policy response. I plan to focus on several of these developments today, and, in particular, the risks they may still pose in diverting us from the desired path.\n\nOne issue concerns the possibility and potential consequences of a shift in financial conditions that could adversely affect economic activity: I’m thinking in particular about a possible shift in risk perceptions. There are now numerous indications that the premiums in financial returns that compensate investors for risk are notably low. One indication is the low level of long-term bond rates compared with expected future rates on short-term debt—in other words, an unusually low term premium.1 Similar indications can be found in a variety of places, including narrow spreads for credit risk on an array of assets including, with some notable exceptions, corporate debt, commercial real estate, and residential mortgages.\n\nOne reason that risk premiums may be low is precisely because the environment is less risky: the volatility of output and inflation has declined substantially in most industrial countries since the mid-1980s, and a number of financial developments associated with technological change and deregulation have reduced transactions costs, diversified and expanded the variety of credit providers, and fostered the creation of new instruments for efficiently allocating and pricing risk. In addition, the health of corporate balance sheets has improved dramatically, and household delinquency rates, including those on residential mortgages, have generally been quite modest.\n\nAt the same time, however, the concern has been expressed that some investors may be underestimating risks.2 For example, the rapid rise of lending at variable rates in the subprime mortgage market may have reflected an unduly sanguine view of the underlying risks; as we have seen, some households, large mortgage lenders, and hedge funds have felt the pinch of the problems in this market.\n\nThe low long-term rates and low risk premiums that have prevailed in financial markets over the last several years mean that overall financial conditions have been notably more accommodative than suggested by the current level of the real federal funds rate. Given that, a shift in risk perceptions would tend to push longer-term rates and credit spreads up, restraining demand.3\n\nIn fact, we have seen developments that might suggest to some that such a change may be starting. For example, in response to the problems in the subprime variable rate mortgage market, rates on certain default derivatives linked to those instruments have recently moved up substantially. In addition, there has recently been some tightening of lending standards and higher pricing of debt being issued in connection with private-equity financed leveraged buyouts. These recent reassessments of risk premiums seem to represent the market’s appropriate response to the discovery of a higher probability of specific adverse events. Nonetheless, I also believe such developments are worth watching with some care, since there is always the possibility that they do presage a more general and pronounced shift in risk perceptions.\n\nA particularly noteworthy development is the recent jump in intermediate and long-term interest rates. By mid-June, the nominal yields on five- and ten-year Treasuries had shot up by nearly 50 basis points above their May averages, and the conventional mortgage rate rose by nearly 35 basis points. Based on evidence from Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, the bulk of these increases was accounted for by real yields, while a smaller share was due to compensation for inflation.\n\nBut I would not say that these increases in long-term rates necessarily reflect a significant shift in risk perception. Rather, I would point to the fact that they coincided with a sharp upward shift in the expected funds rate path, as suggested by the futures market. This upward shift followed many months during which markets anticipated that the economy would weaken and that the Fed would respond by cutting interest rates fairly substantially. This view prevailed for some time, even though the FOMC’s policy statements have continually emphasized that its predominant concern was the possibility that inflation would not moderate as expected. So I suspect that the markets and the Committee have become more closely aligned, sharing the view that growth in the U.S. is, and is likely to remain, healthy. In further support of this view, stock market values have risen and implied volatilities have been flat or trended down, as we continue to get stronger news on overall economic growth. Moreover, these developments—robust economic data, rising long-term rates, higher expected policy paths and climbing stock market indexes—are global phenomena, occurring in many industrialized countries.\n\nInsofar as the rise in longer-term rates seems to be a response to favorable economic conditions—developments that have been part of my own forecast for some time—it has not had a big effect on my overall assessment of the economic outlook. For the very same reason, this rise in longer-term rates does not quell my concerns about a reversal in risk perceptions, a possibility which itself could pose a downside threat to the global economy.\n\nWith that perspective on recent financial developments in mind, let me now turn to an explicit discussion of the U.S. economy and the outlook for growth and inflation. Beginning in the second quarter of 2006, real GDP growth moderated noticeably, registering 2 to 2½ percent rates in the final three quarters of 2006, somewhat below most estimates of the economy’s potential growth rate. Growth in the first quarter of 2007 was notably weaker, but a good part of that was due to the temporary effects of business inventories and net exports. Based on partial monthly data, it seems likely that there was a bounce-back in the second quarter, with growth averaging a modest rate for the first half of the year as a whole. My expectation is for moderate growth during the remainder of this year and in 2008.\n\nI’d like to highlight developments in three sectors that will have an important influence on whether this forecast proves accurate. Two of them—personal consumption expenditures and exports—have been quite robust but are expected to slow moderately. The third is residential investment, which has been quite weak, but it is expected to have a much less negative impact on overall activity going forward. Thus, overall real GDP in the coming period will depend importantly on how the cross-currents among these three sectors play out.\n\nPersonal consumption expenditures have been the main engine of growth in recent years; indeed, with employment growth strong and equity and housing wealth rising, American consumers outspent their earnings, and that resulted in a personal saving rate that has been in negative territory since early 2005. Going forward, at least some of the growth in consumption can be expected to diminish for a couple of reasons. First, increases in housing wealth have slowed dramatically. Second, energy prices have moved back up this year. For example, after falling through the latter half of last year, the price of West Texas Intermediate rose sharply during the first half of this year. It averaged $67.50 in June, up from $54.20 in January; and with gasoline margins moving up over this period, the retail price of gasoline has moved up even more. Such increases act like a tax on consumers, often leading to reduced spending. Of course, here in Alaska, their impact has been largely beneficial. As you know, high oil prices bring substantial income into the state, and, no doubt, this has helped to keep employment and personal income growing at a healthy clip.\n\nAnother source of strength in recent years has been the very strong world economy. Foreign real GDP—weighted by U.S. export shares—advanced at robust rates of 3¾ to 4 percent in 2004 through 2006, and this growth has been widespread, affecting nearly every continent. With the trade-weighted dollar falling over this same period, U.S. exports have been strong—real exports increased by an average of nearly 8 percent during those three years. Partly for this reason, U.S. net exports, which consistently weighed growth down from 2000 to 2005, actually gave it a lift during 2006. Assuming a modest deceleration in world economic activity, net exports seem likely to “turn neutral”—neither retarding nor stimulating growth in the year or so ahead.\n\nOf course, a big drag on growth over the past year has come from residential construction. Housing is likely to remain an important source of weakness, so let me take a few moments to discuss it in detail. The cooling in the housing sector has, of course, been in part a response to a rise in financing costs. Interest rates on variable-rate mortgages have risen in recent years along with other short-term rates. However, until a few weeks ago, traditional fixed mortgage rates were actually down somewhat from their level at the beginning of the Fed rate tightening in mid-2004. With the recent increases, these rates now also are up. I should note that higher borrowing costs are not the only explanation for the recent cooling; it’s likely that it also reflects a necessary correction in house prices after years of phenomenal run-ups that ultimately have proved to be unsustainable.\n\nSince the end of 2005, activity in this sector has contracted substantially. Indeed, over the past four quarters, the level of residential investment spending declined more than 16 percent in real terms. And during that period, this sector—which represents only a little more than 5 percent of U.S. GDP—has taken a large toll on overall activity, subtracting a full percentage point from real GDP growth.\n\nThe more forward-looking indicators of conditions in housing markets have been mixed recently. Housing permits and sales have been weak. House prices at the national level either have continued to appreciate, though at a much more moderate rate than before, or have fallen moderately, depending on the price index one considers. Looking ahead, futures markets are expecting small price declines in a number of metropolitan areas this year. Finally, and importantly, inventories of unsold new homes remain at very high levels, and these most likely will need to be worked off before we see a rebound in housing construction.\n\nThe prospects for the housing market may also be affected by developments in the subprime mortgage market. I should note that the Fed pays close attention to these developments, not only because of their potential impact on the economy, but also because of our roles in bank supervision and regulation and in consumer protection.\n\nFrom the standpoint of monetary policy, I do not consider it very likely that developments relating to subprime mortgages will have a big effect on overall U.S. economic performance, although they do add to downside risk. The types of subprime loans of greatest concern are variable-rate mortgages. Delinquency rates on these loans have risen sharply since the middle of last year—they are now nearly 12 percent—and there are indications that lenders are tightening credit standards for these borrowers. Looking more broadly across all types of mortgages, however, delinquency rates have remained low; this includes prime borrowers with fixed-rate and variable rate mortgages and evensubprime borrowers with fixed-rate loans. Tighter credit to the subprime sector and foreclosures on existing properties have the potential to deepen the housing downturn. I am nonetheless optimistic that spillovers from this sector will be limited, because these mortgages represent only a small part of the overall outstanding mortgage stock.\n\nHousing markets in Alaska have not been immune to the slowdown observed nationwide, but, in part because of high oil prices, economic conditions here have been healthy and this has limited the intensity of the downturn in housing. In 2006 as a whole, sales of existing homes rose in Alaska while they were falling nationwide. However, the pace of sales here actually fell in the second half of last year and early this year, and the pace of home price appreciation has slowed substantially since 2005. Nevertheless, in a departure from the longer-term trend, the rate of appreciation here has been above the U.S. pace for the past couple of years.\n\nThe relatively consistent performance in Alaska’s housing market thus far has helped the state to avoid significant problems with respect to mortgage financing and payments. As in the nation as a whole, default and delinquency rates overall have remained low at least though early 2007. Delinquencies on adjustable-rate mortgages in the prime as well as the sub-prime market have increased somewhat in Alaska over the past year or two, but these increases have not been sufficiently large or widespread to significantly undermine mortgage credit conditions on net.\n\nThe bottom line for housing from a national perspective is that it has had a significant depressing effect on real GDP growth over the past year. While I wouldn’t want to bet on a sizable upswing, I also wouldn’t be surprised to see it begin to stabilize late this year or next. Furthermore, if and when it does stabilize, it could contribute to a pickup in overall growth in the future, as the negative force of its contraction turns neutral.\n\nTo sum up the story on output, real GDP appears to have advanced at a modest rate in the first half of this year. My best guess is that the pace will pick up a bit in 2007 to a rate just below potential, as housing’s negative effect eases up enough to offset the expected modest slowdowns in consumption and exports. As I’ve indicated, these crosscurrents may play out in unexpected ways, entailing both upside and downside risks, and they will bear careful watching.\n\nIndeed, careful watching will be required even if the scenario for economic activity that I see as the best guess and the best hope comes through. The reason is that a key part of the desired adjustment path would involve the emergence of enough slack in labor markets to counteract inflationary pressures. The latest labor market data show payroll employment growing steadily and at a robust pace. Moreover, the unemployment rate has, somewhat surprisingly, declined by half a percentage point over the past two years and now stands at 4½ percent; that rate may represent a degree of tightness in the labor market. If labor markets are indeed on the tight side, and if they remain there, then there may be reason for concern about the risk of building inflationary pressures.\n\nThis situation highlights a puzzle I have discussed before: Why has the labor market continued to be so strong, even while economic activity has moderated? Let me briefly outline some possible explanations, beginning with the more worrisome ones. One such explanation is that goods markets could be stronger than we think. This is a possibility because an alternative measure of real activity—real income—is considerably stronger than our standard measure of real GDP—which we normally measure on the output side. So, it’s possible, but by no means certain, that real GDP could be revised up in future benchmark revisions, meaning that both labor and product markets actually might contain inflationary pressures at present.\n\nSecond, a number of experts are now arguing that trend productivity growth may have slowed a bit recently,4 which might mean that the growth of potential output is lower than commonly assumed. Indeed, productivity has been surprisingly weak over the past year. Of course, discerning the extent to which this development reflects a short-lived, cyclical phenomenon, a downshift in the trend rate or both, is neither obvious nor straightforward. Those who believe that trend productivity growth has slowed a bit point to the slowdown in the first half of this decade in both the pace of productivity growth in the IT sector and the pace of investment in equipment and software, two factors that drove the productivity boom that began in the mid-1990s.\n\nAlthough this argument may well be correct, it seems likely to me that the recent decline in the productivity data mainly reflects cyclical factors; in other words, it is likely due to labor hoarding and lags in the adjustment of employment to output—common phenomena in periods when economic activity decelerates. Interestingly, most of the recent slowdown in labor productivity growth can be accounted for by such lags in just one sector—residential construction. Although this sector has experienced huge drops in spending, employment has been remarkably well sustained. Going forward, as the adjustment lags work themselves out, residential construction employment may post significant declines and productivity in that sector and the economy as a whole may rebound. The possibility of long lags in the adjustment of employment to economic activity is a benign explanation for the puzzle.\n\nAnother benign possibility is that labor markets may not actually be particularly tight. There are a variety of ways to estimate conditions in the labor market, and some of these don’t suggest much in the way of inflationary pressures. For example, the Conference Board index of job market perceptions, which is based on a survey of households, suggests that labor markets are only very slightly on the tight side. Moreover, if labor markets were tight, this could be expected to show up in robust growth of labor compensation. Instead, some of the data present a different picture: for example, the employment cost index shows remarkably restrained increases of only a little more than 3 percent over the past year.\n\nAt this point, I am not inclined to discount heavily these benign explanations. Looking at the price inflation data over the past year or so, signs of improvement are evident. Over the past twelve months, our main measure of consumer inflation—the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, or the core PCE price index—has increased by just under 2 percent. Just a few months ago, the twelve-month change was quite a bit higher, at nearly 2½ percent.\n\nMoreover, I expect to see some further improvement in core inflation over the next year or two. First, this should occur as the economy develops some slack in response to real growth that is modestly below the potential rate. Second, inflation may have been elevated partly because of some transitory factors that may unwind over the next year or so. One of those transitory factors is oil prices. Although core inflation, by definition, excludes energy prices, they still may affect it to the extent that they are passed through to the prices of other goods and services. While oil prices have risen recently, they are still below their peaks of mid-2006. Over the two and a half years before that, energy prices more than doubled, and this probably put some upward pressure on core inflation. However, the effects of energy price changes on inflation are inherently temporary, and these upward pressures are likely to dissipate in 2007, even if energy prices remain at their current levels.\n\nAnother transitory factor is upward pressures on rents, including imputed rents on owner-occupied housing that enter importantly into the calculation of the price of housing services and, therefore, consumer inflation. Over the last year, rents have been rising at an unusually rapid rate. But if rents adjust to more normal levels relative to house prices, these increases will taper off, also damping inflation.\n\nThat said, the risks to inflation are also significant. One I have already mentioned is the possibility that structural productivity growth has slowed, which could add to cost pressures. While cyclical swings in productivity are not generally passed on to product prices, a decline in structural productivity growth might escalate inflation pressures. Another risk is possible slippage in the market’s perception of our inflation objective. Although inflation compensation over the next five years, as measured in Treasury markets, has been essentially unchanged recently, longer-run inflation compensation rose modestly, along with the rise in long-term rates that I discussed earlier. My guess is that this increase largely reflects an elevation in inflation risk premiums or the influence of some idiosyncratic factors affecting the demand for Treasury debt, rather than an increase in long-run inflation expectations. I base this conclusion on the fact that longer-run inflation compensation also ticked up in the United Kingdom, a country where inflation expectations have been remarkably well anchored over the past decade and where inflation has been trending downward. The fact that longer-run inflation compensation rose in both countries, despite their different monetary policy regimes, suggests that a common explanation is needed, rather than one specific to the U.S. This result suggests that inflation expectations in the U.S. continue to be well anchored as they have been for at least the past ten years or so, as the Fed has established its credibility with the public about both its commitment to and its competence in keeping inflation at low and stable rates.5\n\nTurning to monetary policy, I hope I’ve made it clear that—based on what we know now—I think the current stance of policy is likely to foster sustainable growth with a gradual ebbing of inflationary pressures. It has been heartening to see core consumer inflation edging down in recent months. However, as the most recent statement noted, “a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated.” Moreover, upside risks to inflation continue to be present, given the possibility that labor markets are somewhat tight. I believe it is important to be particularly attentive to these risks not only because price stability is desirable in its own right, but also because a credible commitment to keeping inflation low and stable is necessary to ensure that inflation expectations remain well-anchored. At the same time, we must be careful not to pose unnecessary risks to continued expansion.\n\nAn “asymmetric policy tilt” seems appropriate given the upside risks to inflation. However, it is also essential that policy retain considerable flexibility in responding to emerging data. Last week’s FOMC statement thus continued to emphasize that “Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.”\n\n1. See also Eric Swanson, “What We Do and Don’t Know about the Term Premium,” FRBSF Economic Letter, forthcoming.\n\n2. There is some research into why risk might be underpriced, but so far, the answers remain tentative. Some have pointed to the greater role of investment managers in this more deregulated, competitive environment. These managers may have incentives to herd with other investment managers in order not to underperform their peers, and they may also have incentives to take more “tail” risks, in cases where compensation is weighted more towards achieving positive returns, without sufficient regard for low probability negative returns.\n\n3.

        "content": "Good afternoon, everyone. It’s a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak to the inaugural research conference of the Risk Management Institute, a joint effort of U.C. Berkeley and the National University of Singapore. I’m especially gratified that the San Francisco Fed is cosponsoring this event with the Monetary Authority of Singapore. My invitation to speak to you today was tendered by Andy Rose, who was my colleague and coauthor when I was at U.C. Berkeley, so, naturally, I was delighted to accept. I last was in Singapore in 1995, to attend the Monetary Authority’s 25th birthday celebration. My memories of that trip and of the interesting and gracious people I met remain vivid. At that time, I visited as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Today, as the President of the San Francisco Fed, I have an even keener interest in economic issues in Asia, because they are a special focus of research at the Bank’s Center for Pacific Basin Studies. Though I cannot be with you, I’m glad that Reuven Glick, our Group Vice President of International Research, is representing the Bank and presenting his work.\n\nThis afternoon I plan to talk about the outlook for the U.S. economy and the prospects for monetary policy. I will concentrate on several important factors shaping that outlook, including the pricing of risk in international financial markets, which is the focus of this conference. Before I begin my formal remarks, I would like to note that my comments represent my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAs many of you probably know, the Federal Open Market Committee last met on June 27 and 28 and voted to hold the federal funds rate, our main policy tool, unchanged at 5¼ percent. To most observers of the Fed, the decision probably had a familiar ring to it, because the funds rate has been kept at that level for the last twelve months. Indeed, my views concerning the logic of this decision will also have a familiar ring to anyone who has heard me discuss monetary policy during the past year. To my mind, the reason for adopting and maintaining the current stance of policy is that it promises to keep the overall economy on an adjustment path where growth is moderate and sustainable. The virtues of this path are that it avoids exposing the economy to unnecessary risk of a downturn, while, at the same time, it is likely to produce enough slack in goods and labor markets to relieve inflationary pressures. I believed a year ago, and still believe now, that such a path is likely and will enable us to achieve our dual mandate—low and stable inflation and maximum sustainable employment.\n\nAlthough the federal funds rate has remained unchanged for the past year, a number of developments over that time in both the U.S. and world economies have warranted our close attention as well as our deliberate consideration about the appropriate policy response. I plan to focus on several of these developments today, and, in particular, the risks they may still pose in diverting us from the desired path.\n\nOne issue concerns the possibility and potential consequences of a shift in risk perceptions in international financial markets. There are now numerous indications that risk premiums are notably low—in the U.S. and also globally. One indication is the low level of long-term bond rates compared with expected future rates on short-term debt—in other words, an unusually low term premium.1 Other indications can be found in the very low options-based implied volatilities on most types of financial instruments, including equities, debt, and exchange rates, in the narrow interest rate spreads between foreign securities and LIBOR, and in narrow spreads for credit risk on a wide array of assets including, with some notable exceptions, corporate debt, commercial real estate, and residential mortgages.\n\nOne reason that risk premiums may be low is precisely because the environment is less risky: the volatility of output and inflation has declined substantially in most industrial countries since the mid-1980s, and a number of financial developments associated with technological change and deregulation have reduced transactions costs, diversified and expanded the variety of credit providers, and fostered the creation of new instruments for efficiently allocating and pricing risk. In addition, the health of corporate balance sheets has improved dramatically, and household delinquency rates, including those on residential mortgages, have generally been quite modest.\n\nAt the same time, however, the concern has been expressed that some investors may be underestimating risks in both domestic and foreign markets.2 For example, in foreign markets, low borrowing costs have attracted money into such investment strategies as “carry trades,” where investors borrow at lower rates in one currency and invest, unhedged, in higher-yielding bonds in another currency. This strategy obviously exposes investors to substantial exchange rate risk, which they may be underestimating. In the U.S., the rapid rise of lending at variable rates in the subprime mortgage market may have reflected an unduly sanguine view of the underlying risks; as we have seen, some households, large mortgage lenders, and hedge funds have felt the pinch of the problems in this market.\n\nThe low long-term rates and low risk premiums that have prevailed in financial markets over the last several years mean that overall financial conditions have been notably more accommodative than suggested by the current level of the real federal funds rate. Given that, a shift in risk perceptions would tend to push longer-term rates and credit spreads up, restraining demand worldwide.3\n\nIn fact, in U.S. financial markets, we have seen developments that might suggest to some that such a change may be starting. For example, in response to the problems in the subprime variable rate mortgage market, spreads on certain debt and credit default swaps linked to those instruments have recently moved up substantially. In addition, there has recently been some tightening of lending standards and higher pricing of debt being issued in connection with private-equity financed leveraged buyouts. These recent reassessments of risk premiums suggest to me that they are focused on certain targeted instruments and therefore essentially represent the market’s appropriate response to the discovery of a higher probability of specific adverse events. Nonetheless, I also believe such developments are worth watching with some care, since there is always the possibility that they do presage a more general and pronounced shift in risk perceptions.\n\nA recent noteworthy development is the recent jump in intermediate and long-term interest rates. By mid-June, the nominal yields on five- and ten-year Treasuries had shot up by nearly 50 basis points above their May averages, and the conventional mortgage rate rose by nearly 35 basis points. Based on evidence from Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, the bulk of these increases was accounted for by real yields, while a smaller share was due to compensation for inflation.\n\nBut I would not say that these increases in long-term rates necessarily reflect a significant shift in risk perception. Rather, I would point to the fact that they coincided with a sharp upward shift in the expected funds rate path, as suggested by the futures market. This upward shift followed many months during which markets anticipated that the economy would weaken and that the Fed would respond by cutting interest rates fairly substantially. This view prevailed for some time, even though the FOMC’s policy statements have continually emphasized that its predominant concern was the possibility that inflation would not moderate as expected. So I suspect that the markets and the Committee have become more closely aligned, sharing the view that growth in the U.S. is, and is likely to remain, healthy. In further support of this view, stock market values have risen and implied volatilities have been flat or trended down, as we continue to get stronger news on overall economic growth. Moreover, these developments—robust economic data, rising long-term rates, higher expected policy paths and climbing stock market indexes—are global phenomena, occurring in many industrialized countries.\n\nInsofar as the rise in longer-term rates seems to be a response to favorable economic conditions—developments that have been part of my own forecast for some time—it has not had a big effect on my overall assessment of the economic outlook. For the very same reason, this rise in longer-term rates does not quell my concerns about a reversal in risk perceptions, a possibility which itself could pose a downside threat to the global economy.\n\nWith that perspective on recent financial developments in mind, let me now turn to an explicit discussion of the U.S. economy and the outlook for growth and inflation. Beginning in the second quarter of 2006, real GDP growth moderated noticeably, registering 2 to 2½ percent rates in the final three quarters of 2006, somewhat below most estimates of the economy’s potential growth rate. Growth in the first quarter of 2007 was notably weaker, but a good part of that was due to the temporary effects of business inventories and net exports. Based on partial monthly data, it seems likely that there was a bounce-back in the second quarter, with growth averaging a modest rate for the first half of the year as a whole. My expectation is for moderate growth during the remainder of this year and in 2008.\n\nI’d like to highlight developments in three sectors that will have an important influence on whether this forecast proves accurate. Two of them—personal consumption expenditures and exports—have been quite robust but are expected to slow moderately. The third is residential investment, which has been quite weak, but it is expected to have a much less negative impact on overall activity going forward. Thus, overall real GDP in the coming period will depend importantly on how the cross-currents among these three sectors play out.\n\nPersonal consumption expenditures have been the main engine of growth in recent years; indeed, with employment growth strong and equity and housing wealth rising, American consumers outspent their earnings, and that resulted in a personal saving rate that has been in negative territory since early 2005. Going forward, at least some of the growth in consumption can be expected to diminish, as increases in housing wealth have slowed dramatically and energy prices have moved back up this year.\n\nAnother source of strength in recent years has been the very strong world economy. Foreign real GDP—weighted by U.S. export shares—advanced at robust rates of 3¾ to 4 percent in 2004 through 2006, and this growth has been widespread, affecting nearly every continent. With the trade-weighted dollar falling over this same period, U.S. exports have been strong—real exports increased by an average of nearly 8 percent during those three years. Partly for this reason, U.S. net exports, which consistently weighed growth down from 2000 to 2005, actually gave it a lift during 2006. Assuming a modest deceleration in world economic activity, net exports seem likely to “turn neutral”—neither retarding nor stimulating growth in the year or so ahead.\n\nOf course, a big drag on growth over the past year has come from residential construction. Housing is likely to remain an important source of weakness, so let me take a few moments to discuss it in detail. The cooling in the housing sector has, of course, been in part a response to a rise in financing costs. Interest rates on variable-rate mortgages have risen in recent years along with other short-term rates. However, until a few weeks ago, traditional fixed mortgage rates were actually down somewhat from their level at the beginning of the Fed rate tightening in mid-2004. With the recent increases, these rates now also are up. I should note that higher borrowing costs are not the only explanation for the recent cooling; it’s likely that it also is a drop in demand that will be reflected in a necessary correction in house prices after years of phenomenal run-ups that ultimately proved to be unsustainable.\n\nSince the end of 2005, activity in this sector has contracted substantially. Indeed, over the past four quarters, the level of residential investment spending declined more than 16 percent in real terms. And during that period, this sector—which represents only a little more than 5 percent of U.S. GDP—has taken a large toll on overall activity, subtracting a full percentage point from real GDP growth.\n\nThe more forward-looking indicators of conditions in housing markets have been mixed recently. Housing permits and sales have been weak. House prices at the national level either have continued to appreciate, though at a much more moderate rate than before, or have fallen moderately, depending on the price index one considers. Looking ahead, futures markets are expecting small price declines in a number of metropolitan areas this year. Finally, and importantly, inventories of unsold new homes remain at very high levels, and these most likely will need to be worked off before we see a rebound in housing construction.\n\nThe prospects for the housing market may also be affected by developments in the subprime mortgage market. I should note that the Fed pays close attention to these developments, not only because of their potential impact on the economy, but also because of our roles in bank supervision and regulation and in consumer protection.\n\nFrom the standpoint of monetary policy, I do not consider it very likely that developments relating to subprime mortgages will have a big effect on overall U.S. economic performance, although they do add to downside risk. The types of subprime loans of greatest concern are variable-rate mortgages. Delinquency rates on these loans have risen sharply since the middle of last year—they are now nearly 12 percent—and there are indications that lenders are tightening credit standards for these borrowers. Looking more broadly across all types of mortgages, however, delinquency rates have remained low; this includes prime borrowers with fixed-rate and variable rate mortgages and evensubprime borrowers with fixed-rate loans. Tighter credit to the subprime sector and foreclosures on existing properties have the potential to deepen the housing downturn. I am nonetheless optimistic that spillovers from this sector will be limited, because these mortgages represent only a small part of the overall outstanding mortgage stock.\n\nThe bottom line for housing is that it has had a significant depressing effect on real GDP growth over the past year. While I wouldn’t want to bet on a sizable upswing, I also wouldn’t be surprised to see it begin to stabilize late this year or next. Furthermore, if and when it does stabilize, it could contribute to a pickup in overall growth in the future, as the negative force of its contraction turns neutral.\n\nTo sum up the story on output, real GDP appears to have advanced at a modest rate in the first half of this year. My best guess is that the pace will pick up a bit in 2007 to a rate just below potential, as housing’s negative effect eases up enough to offset the expected modest slowdowns in consumption and exports. As I’ve indicated, these crosscurrents may play out in unexpected ways, entailing both upside and downside risks, and they will bear careful watching.\n\nIndeed, careful watching will be required even if the scenario for economic activity that I see as the best guess and the best hope comes through. The reason is that a key part of the desired adjustment path would involve the emergence of enough slack in labor markets to counteract inflationary pressures. The latest labor market data show payroll employment growing steadily and at a robust pace. Moreover, the unemployment rate has, somewhat surprisingly, declined by half a percentage point over the past year and a half and now stands at 4½ percent; that rate may represent a degree of tightness in the labor market. If labor markets are indeed on the tight side, and if they remain there, then there may be reason for concern about the risk of building inflationary pressures.\n\nThis situation highlights a puzzle I have discussed before: Why has the labor market continued to be so strong, even while economic activity has moderated? Let me briefly outline some possible explanations, beginning with the more worrisome ones. One such explanation is that goods markets could be stronger than we think. This is a possibility because an alternative measure of real activity—real income—is considerably stronger than our standard measure of real GDP—which we normally measure on the output side. So, it’s possible, but by no means certain, that real GDP could be revised up in future benchmark revisions, meaning that both labor and product markets actually might contain inflationary pressures at present.\n\nSecond, a number of experts are now arguing that trend productivity growth may have slowed a bit recently,4 which might mean that the growth of potential output is lower than commonly assumed. Indeed, productivity has been surprisingly weak over the past year. Of course, discerning the extent to which this development reflects a short-lived, cyclical phenomenon, a downshift in the trend rate or both, is neither obvious nor straightforward. Those who believe that trend productivity growth has slowed a bit point to the slowdown in the first half of this decade in both the pace of productivity growth in the IT sector and the pace of investment in equipment and software, two factors that drove the productivity boom that began in the mid-1990s.\n\nAlthough this argument may well be correct, it seems likely to me that the recent decline in the productivity data mainly reflects cyclical factors; in other words, it is likely due to labor hoarding and lags in the adjustment of employment to output—common phenomena in periods when economic activity decelerates. Interestingly, most of the recent slowdown in labor productivity growth can be accounted for by such lags in just one sector—residential construction. Although this sector has experienced huge drops in spending, employment has been remarkably well sustained. Going forward, as the adjustment lags work themselves out, residential construction employment may post significant declines and productivity in that sector and the economy as a whole may rebound. The possibility of long lags in the adjustment of employment to economic activity is a benign explanation for the puzzle.\n\nAnother benign possibility is that labor markets may not actually be particularly tight. There are a variety of ways to estimate conditions in the labor market, and some of these don’t suggest much in the way of inflationary pressures. For example, the Conference Board index of job market perceptions, which is based on a survey of households, suggests that labor markets are only very slightly on the tight side. Moreover, if labor markets were tight, this could be expected to show up in robust growth of labor compensation. Instead, some of the data present a different picture: for example, the employment cost index shows remarkably restrained increases of only a little more than 3 percent over the past year.\n\nAt this point, I am not inclined to discount heavily these benign explanations. Looking at the price inflation data over the past year or so, signs of improvement are evident. Over the past twelve months, our main measure of consumer inflation—the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, or the core PCE price index—has increased by just under 2 percent. Just a few months ago, the twelve-month change was quite a bit higher, at nearly 2½ percent.\n\nMoreover, I expect to see some further improvement in core inflation over the next year or two. First, this should occur as the economy develops some slack in response to real growth that is modestly below the potential rate. Second, inflation may have been elevated partly because of some transitory factors that may unwind over the next year or so. One of those transitory factors is oil prices. Although core inflation, by definition, excludes energy prices, they still may affect it to the extent that they are passed through to the prices of other goods and services. While oil prices have risen recently, they are still below their peaks of mid-2006. Over the two and a half years before that, energy prices more than doubled, and this probably put some upward pressure on core inflation. However, the effects of energy price changes on inflation are inherently temporary, and these upward pressures are likely to dissipate in 2007, even if energy prices remain at their current levels.\n\nAnother transitory factor is upward pressures on rents, including imputed rents on owner-occupied housing that enter importantly into the calculation of the price of housing services and, therefore, consumer inflation. Over the last year, rents have been rising at an unusually rapid rate. But if rents adjust to more normal levels relative to house prices, these increases will taper off, also damping inflation.\n\nThat said, the risks to inflation are also significant. One I have already mentioned is the possibility that structural productivity growth has slowed, which could add to cost pressures. While cyclical swings in productivity are not generally passed on to product prices, a decline in structural productivity growth might escalate inflation pressures. Another risk is possible slippage in the market’s perception of our inflation objective. Although inflation compensation over the next five years, as measured in Treasury markets, has been essentially unchanged recently, longer-run inflation compensation rose modestly, along with the rise in long-term rates that I discussed earlier. My guess is that this increase largely reflects an elevation in inflation risk premiums or the influence of some idiosyncratic factors affecting the demand for Treasury debt, rather than an increase in long-run inflation expectations. I base this conclusion on the fact that longer-run inflation compensation also ticked up in the United Kingdom, a country where inflation expectations have been remarkably well anchored over the past decade and where inflation has been trending downward. The fact that longer-run inflation compensation rose in both countries, despite their different monetary policy regimes, suggests that a common explanation is needed, rather than one specific to the U.S. This result suggests that inflation expectations in the U.S. continue to be well anchored as they have been for at least the past ten years or so, as the Fed has established its credibility with the public about both its commitment to and its competence in keeping inflation at low and stable rates.5\n\nTurning to monetary policy, I hope I’ve made it clear that—based on what we know now—I think the current stance of policy is likely to foster sustainable growth with a gradual ebbing of inflationary pressures. It has been heartening to see core consumer inflation edging down in recent months. However, as the most recent statement noted, “a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated.” Moreover, upside risks to inflation continue to be present, given the possibility that labor markets are somewhat tight. I believe it is important to be particularly attentive to these risks not only because price stability is desirable in its own right, but also because a credible commitment to keeping inflation low and stable is necessary to ensure that inflation expectations remain well-anchored. At the same time, we must be careful not to pose unnecessary risks to continued expansion.\n\nAn “asymmetric policy tilt” seems appropriate given the upside risks to inflation. However, it is also essential that policy retain considerable flexibility in responding to emerging data. Last week’s FOMC statement thus continued to emphasize that “Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.”\n\n1.

        "content": "Good afternoon. I’m delighted to take part in today’s program honoring my long-time friend, coauthor, and former colleague, Rachel McCulloch. In my remarks today, I would like to focus on some aspects of the global economy that are salient to me from the standpoint of monetary policy. On the one hand, there is much that is heartening. World economic growth has been robust during the last few years and, in 2006, according to the IMF’s summary measure, performance was extraordinarily strong—the best in both overall and per capita terms since the early 1970s. China and India both grew at a blistering pace. But, importantly, growth was widely spread around most regions of the globe. At the same time, inflation was reasonably low among the advanced economies, and in most emerging markets and developing countries, it was quite moderate by historical standards.\n\nConditions in global financial markets have been supportive of growth. Real interest rates and risk spreads have remained relatively low despite monetary tightening by major central banks. Equity markets in many countries have hit new highs, and emerging markets have seen increasing private capital inflows.\n\nThese good outcomes across a broad range of countries might suggest that the world economy is not a very risky place. But monetary policymakers are paid to worry—to see dark clouds, not just silver linings. One worry, now longstanding, relates to the large imbalances in saving and investment flows among countries that underlie the current pattern of global growth. Standard debt dynamics suggest that the large and growing U.S. current account current imbalance is unsustainable. But theory offers little guidance on exactly how or when it may unwind. My concern here is that a sudden unwinding of these imbalances could be associated with sharp movements in exchange rates and asset prices that could produce destabilizing economic impacts around the globe. Given the enormous expertise of this audience on this issue, I will focus instead on a distinct but related worry, which concerns the possibility and potential consequences of an abrupt and disruptive shift in general risk tolerance in international financial markets.\n\nAt present, there are numerous indications that risk premia are notably low—in the U.S. and also globally. One indication is the low level of long-term bond rates compared with expected rates on short-term debt in the U.S. and other advanced economies. Of course, long-term rates have risen in recent weeks, but not by nearly enough to resolve what former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan coined, “the bond rate conundrum.” Another indication can be found in the very low options-based implied volatilities on most types of U.S. financial instruments, including equities, debt instruments, and exchange rates. Further indications are the narrow risk spreads on both foreign private and sovereign securities, which are near historic lows.\n\nThe phenomenon of low spreads may well reflect an environment wherein risk genuinely is reduced. The volatility of both output and inflation has declined substantially in most industrial countries since the mid 1980s, a phenomenon known as the “great moderation.” Recessions have become less frequent and less severe in most industrial countries, and inflation has been low worldwide. Arguably, macroeconomic management has improved significantly. Moreover, structural changes may have improved the capacity of economies to absorb shocks. Since lower macroeconomic volatility reduces the degree of uncertainty facing households and firms, it may explain the lower risk premia.\n\nIn addition, a number of long-term structural developments associated with technological change and deregulation have reduced transactions costs, diversified and expanded the variety of credit providers, and fostered the creation of new instruments for allocating and pricing risk. For example, the providers of credit go well beyond insured depository institutions to include asset managers, private equity investors, and hedge funds. Some of the new instruments include collateralized debt obligations, which permit illiquid loan obligations to be securitized, and credit default swaps, which investors use as insurance against corporate default. Thus, financial innovations and deepening credit markets may have contributed to a wider dispersion and a more efficient allocation of risks in financial system and thereby to lower risk premia.\n\nFinally, there may also be cyclical reasons for the decline in risk premia. Even as short-term nominal rates have risen in the U.S. and elsewhere in recent years, low-interest-rate funds have remained available from other economies, notably Japan and Switzerland. In addition, corporate leverage has been low, and this has dampened credit market volatility because debt service costs are low and the threat of default has declined.\n\nMy concern, however, is that investors may be underestimating the risks in both in domestic and foreign markets as indicated by a number of investment strategies. For example, here in the U.S., the rapid rise of lending at variable rates in the subprime mortgage market may have reflected an unduly benign view of the underlying risks, and some lenders have paid a high price for this view. Inflows into hedge funds have soared and private equity firms are borrowing at low interest rates with favorable terms, resulting in a wave of leveraged buyouts in both the U.S. and abroad. Some observers question whether the supposedly sophisticated investors in these funds fully understand the complexities of the investment strategies pursued by fund managers and the risks to which they are exposed.\n\nIn foreign markets, investor demand for emerging market assets has continued to expand, with inflows into dedicated bond and equity funds in those countries, including instruments denominated in local currencies, without much increase in risk spreads. Low costs of borrowing have also attracted money into “carry trades,” where investors borrow short-term at lower rates in one currency and invest, unhedged, in riskier, higher-yielding bonds in another currency. This strategy exposes investors to substantial exchange rate risk.\n\nThere is, of course, some research into why risk might be underpriced, but so far, the answers remain tentative. Some have pointed to the greater role of investment managers in this more deregulated, competitive environment. These managers may have incentives to herd with other investment managers in order not to underperform their peers, and they may also have incentives to take more “tail” risks, in cases where compensation is weighted more towards achieving positive returns, without sufficient regard for low probability negative returns.1 In addition, the apparent confidence of investors that extreme events will not occur has fostered increased demand for higher yield in riskier assets, resulting in greater risk appetite.\n\nAs we know from past experience, of course, the possibility of a sudden reversal in risk perceptions cannot be ruled out. Some recent reversals have had fairly limited effects. For example, in May and June of 2006, rising interest rates increased volatility in advanced economies, sparking a period of turbulence in emerging markets. In late February of this year, there were sharp movements in global financial markets, sparked by a drop in China’s fledgling stock market, as investors reacted to news about fundamentals in the U.S. and elsewhere, but markets soon recovered.\n\nBut it does not take a very long memory to recall the serious consequences of the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 which eventually escalated into one of global proportions. In that instance, an abrupt increase in investor risk aversion provoked sharp asset price declines and a frightening and sudden erosion of market liquidity. Fortunately, in the years since that crisis, the global financial system has arguably become far stronger. Many countries have taken advantage of the benign global environment and have reduced the ratio of public debt to GDP, improved the currency and maturity composition of debt, and increased international reserve holdings. They have also undertaken measures to increase the resilience of their financial markets, such as promoting the development of local currency bond markets. Their banking systems, too, have been buttressed by stronger supervision, thereby reducing the likelihood of devastating banking failures. Furthermore, the widespread adoption of more flexible exchange rate regimes creates greater scope for monetary policy and hence the potential to contain the economic spillovers of such turbulence.\n\nFrom a policy perspective, a natural question is what, if anything, central banks, including the Federal Reserve, can and should do to address potential risks associated with the possibility of excessive risk-taking in global financial markets. To mitigate the risks of financial instability, I believe that policymakers must mainly rely on supervisory tools and prudential regulation to ensure that financial institutions are properly capitalized and that they carefully and comprehensively identify, assess and manage risks of all types—market, credit, and operational. At the same time, the Federal Reserve is actively collaborating with other supervisors in the United States and globally, and encouraging private sector initiatives designed to strengthen the resilience of the financial sector and to improve its ability to manage the stresses that might emerge in the event of an unanticipated shift in risk preferences. A recent example involves credit default swaps. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has taken steps to promote private sector initiatives to correct a serious problem of confirmation backlogs in these contracts and to clarify the exposure of counterparties to them. In addition to mitigating potential risks, central banks must be prepared to respond to events that may have systemic effects. This requires understanding the nature of financial arrangements and their implications for risk. To this end, the Fed supports research on financial markets, communicates with institutions well beyond those we directly supervise, and cooperates with financial supervisors around the world.\n\nSome have espoused the view that central banks should go further—tightening monetary policy to dampen overly euphoric asset markets—to prick asset price bubbles before they burst. I do not espouse that view because it is exceptionally difficult to distinguish “bubbles” from fundamental-based booms and monetary actions impose certain short-run costs for very uncertain future gains. I therefore believe that central banks should stand ready to act to cushion the economy in response to shocks when and if they occur.\n\n1. R.

        "content": "Good evening, everyone. It’s a pleasure to be here with you. I know that the Money Marketeers have a long and rich history, and I’m honored to be among the many distinguished speakers who have addressed you over the years.\n\nTonight I plan to discuss the prospects for the U.S. economy. I’d like to return to a theme that I discussed in a speech a few months ago and that has been on my mind ever since. It concerns a puzzling economic development. The puzzle, as I put it then, was: Why is the labor market apparently going gangbusters, while growth in real GDP has turned in only a middling performance? The reason I’d like to revisit the puzzle is that, in the intervening period, its mystery has deepened: economic growth has unexpectedly slowed from “middling” to a crawl, while the unemployment rate has actually inched down and employment growth has remained robust. These and other recent developments have not dramatically changed my mainline forecast for the U.S. economy over the next year or so, but they have significantly increased the risks to the outlook, both for growth and inflation. While I’ve revised down my forecast for economic activity for the first half of 2007, I still expect to see a moderate pace in the second half of the year. At the same time, much of the news pertaining to the first quarter has been disappointing, and has raised the downside risk for growth. I continue to think that inflation is likely to edge down over the year, but, with labor markets appearing to have tightened further, rather than easing as I expected, the upside risks to this outlook have gotten bigger.\n\nBefore I begin to explain these points, let me note that my comments represent my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nGoing back a few months, the “middling” economic growth we had been seeing since the second quarter of last year was, in fact, not particularly surprising, considering the stance of monetary policy over the past couple of years. As this group well knows, the FOMC began raising the federal funds rate from a very low 1 percent back in mid-2004. After 17 stepwise increases, the funds rate reached 5¼ percent by June 2006, a level that I judged to be modestly restrictive. The Committee has held it at that level ever since.\n\nThe aim of these policy moves, to my mind, was to achieve an orderly slowing of growth to—and, for a time, below—its long-run trend. I anticipated that such a path for output growth would produce enough slack in the labor market to relieve potential inflationary pressures. Indeed, along with an expected reversal of transitory factors, a modest amount of slack would help to bring inflation down gradually to a more acceptable level than it had registered over the prior year.\n\nThus far, it looks as if things have shaped up pretty much as expected, at least as far as output is concerned. Real GDP growth registered 2 to 2½ percent rates in the final three quarters of 2006, somewhat below most estimates of the economy’s potential growth rate at the time, although growth this year appears, thus far, to be notably weaker. Most of the impetus for growth has come from a robust performance of personal consumption expenditures; indeed, with the impetus from past increases in equity and housing wealth, American consumers continued to spend more than they earned, and that resulted in a personal saving rate that fell even deeper into negative territory. The biggest drag on growth has come mainly from two sectors: residential construction and auto production. Since residential construction and the housing market more generally were—and are—such important factors in this story, let me take a few moments to discuss them in detail.\n\nThe cooling in the housing sector has, of course, been in part a response to a rise in financing costs. Although traditional fixed mortgage rates have actually fallen somewhat in recent years, rates on variable-rate mortgages have risen along with other short-term rates. I should note, however, that higher borrowing costs are not the only explanation; it’s likely that the recent cooling also is a necessary correction in house prices after years of phenomenal run-ups that ultimately proved to be unsustainable.\n\nResidential investment grew quite strongly for several years, but the pace of growth began to weaken toward the end of 2005. Since then, growth has turned negative. Indeed, the level of residential investment spending declined almost 13 percent in real terms during 2006, with especially steep drops over the last two quarters. In fact, during each of those quarters, this sector alone—which represents only a little more than 5 percent of U.S. GDP—subtracted a hefty 1¼ percentage points from real GDP growth.\n\nThe more forward-looking indicators of conditions in housing markets have been mixed recently. Housing permits fell sharply from the summer of 2005 through the summer of 2006, but have flattened out since then. Sales of new and existing homes have continued to fall. House prices at the national level either have continued to appreciate, though at a much more moderate rate than before, or have fallen moderately, depending on the price index you look at. Looking ahead, futures markets are expecting small price declines in a number of metropolitan areas this year. Finally, and importantly, inventories of unsold new homes remain at very high levels, and these most likely will need to be worked off before we see a rebound in housing construction.\n\nThe latest twist in the housing sector story is the trouble involved with subprime mortgages. Hardly a day goes by without a news story about the financial difficulties now faced by borrowers and some large lenders in this market. Certainly, these problems warrant our close attention and raise significant issues for bank regulators and supervisors. After all, so-called exotic financing instruments—like interest-only loans, piggy-back loans, and loans with the possibility of negative amortization—were often designed to allow subprime borrowers into the market. So it will be important to find the balance that not only protects borrowers but also provides them opportunities to secure loans to buy homes and refinance mortgages.\n\nThe types of subprime loans that present the biggest problem are variable-rate mortgages. Delinquency rates on these loans have risen sharply since the middle of last year—they now exceed 11 percent—and there are indications that lenders are tightening credit standards for subprime borrowers. Looking more broadly across all types of mortgages, however—including prime borrowers and even subprime borrowers withfixed-rate loans—delinquency rates have remained low. While a tightening of credit to the subprime sector and foreclosures on existing properties have the potential to deepen the housing downturn, I do not consider it very likely that such developments will have a big effect on overall U.S. economic performance. I say this, in part, because these mortgages represent only a small part of the overall outstanding mortgage stock.\n\nThe bottom line for housing is that it has had a significant depressing effect on real GDP growth over the past six months or so. While I wouldn’t be surprised to see it begin to turn around in the latter half of this year, I also wouldn’t want to bet on it. In other words, housing remains a significant drag on the economy and a source of uncertainty in the outlook—much as it has for some time now.\n\nHowever, two other developments have changed the risk profile of the economy. The first is something of a positive, in that the auto sector now appears poised to be less of a drag going forward. With the public demanding more fuel-efficient vehicles in the face of rising oil prices, U.S. automakers found themselves with large excess inventories of SUVs and trucks, so they cut back sharply on production last year. At this point, it appears that the adjustment to a lower level of inventories has been reached, and plans for auto production in the future look brighter.\n\nThe second development, unfortunately, is evidence of sluggishness in a new area—business investment in equipment, and, in particular, equipment outside of the reasonably strong high-tech area. The performance in non-high-tech equipment over the past nine months or so is surprising, since the business environment is marked by high profits, relatively favorable financing conditions, and growth in business output.\n\nPart of the explanation for this sluggishness reflects what’s happening in construction—given the slump in housing, it should come as no surprise that investment in construction-related equipment has fallen off. However, even if we ignore this category, business investment has still been weak.\n\nOne commonly heard explanation is “caution in the boardroom,” as companies have felt the shocks of corporate scandals, terrorist attacks, war, and surging oil prices. While there may be some truth to this explanation, it does seem to fly in the face of the rapid growth we’ve seen in employment, which—given the cost and disruption of hiring and then having to lay off workers—also should be restrained by caution about the future.\n\nAnother explanation for weak business equipment investment that may be more likely and that is a bit more troubling is the possibility that the trend rate of productivity growth has slowed from its very fast pace over the last five years or so. For 2000-2005, the estimated trend rate was a blazing 3 percent, but for 2006, the actual data on productivity growth came in at a rate of only 1-1/2 percent. Discerning the extent to which these new lower numbers reflect a short-lived, cyclical phenomenon, a downshift in the trend rate or both, is neither obvious nor straightforward.\n\nTo explore this point, let me put a little context around U.S. productivity growth. From the mid-1970s through the mid-1990s, the trend rate of labor productivity in the nonfarm sector rose relatively slowly, at only about a 1½ percent annual rate on average. Then, in the second half of the 1990s, trend productivity appears to have accelerated sharply, to about a 2½ percent annual growth rate. This upward shift frankly came as a surprise and generated reams of research, not to mention journalism touting the “New Economy.” On the research front, there is a broad consensus that this acceleration was traceable to developments in information and communications technology. The tech industry itself registered remarkable productivity gains; furthermore, firms outside that industry benefited not only from increases in the new tech equipment but also from new “organizational capital.” By this, I mean things like business models, production processes, and a trained workforce.1 Take the so-called big-box retailers, like Wal-Mart and others, for example. Their success in using information technology to boost their retailing business did not merely involve buying computers. Instead, they had to consciously invest in knowledge about how to use information processing to better manage and, indeed, to reorganize their far-flung supply chains. In addition, when they reorganized processes, they also needed to retrain their workforce.\n\nFrom 2000-2005, U.S. trend productivity growth is estimated to have accelerated again, as I mentioned, to around 3 percent. But productivity growth in the tech industry itself slowed down, and so did investment in tech equipment by firms that use it. Why, then, did productivity growth surge in this period, and what does the answer imply for productivity going forward? Here the stories are not so clear. One explanation begins with the notion that investment itself is disruptive, since firms have to divert resources to installing and learning to use the new capital. With less investment going on in the 2000s than in the late 1990s, there was less disruption, while, at the same time, firms continued to benefit from their earlier investments in reorganization. Taken together, these showed up as faster measured productivity growth.2 According to this explanation, if firms have slowed investment not only in IT but also in new organizational capital, then future productivity growth may also slow. But it also leaves open the possibility that firms will find further opportunities for organizational investments to benefit from fast information processing, and these investments may bear fruit again.\n\nAnother explanation for the productivity surge in 2000-2005 is that it reflected severe profit pressures that forced firms to cut costs by restructuring, engaging in mergers, and so on.3 Insofar as this explanation is at work, the cost-cutting resulted in one-time productivity gains and has not sown the seeds for faster productivity growth going forward.\n\nBoth explanations, then, are consistent with the possibility that trend productivity growth has slowed. However, I don’t want to overstate the degree of any possible slowing. We are still talking about trend growth going from about 3 percent in 2000 to 2005—the figure I cited earlier—to between 2 and 2½ percent now. So, productivity growth still would be reasonably strong, just not as strong as over the prior decade. As I said, a lower trend rate of productivity growth would help explain the sluggishness in business investment and put upward pressure on inflation for a time.\n\nBeyond this, however, it could have implications for crucial fundamentals in the economy. It could lower the trend growth rate of real GDP; indeed, many forecasters are currently making modest downward adjustments to estimates of trend real GDP growth into a range of 2½ to 3 percent. Likewise, because a lower trend rate of productivity growth reflects a lower return to capital, it also implies a lower neutral level of the federal funds rate.\n\nTo sum up the story on output, real GDP advanced at moderate rates of 2 to 2½ percent in the final three quarters of last year. Recent monthly data show a more sluggish performance in the first quarter. My best guess is that real GDP will pick up the pace a bit in 2007, as growth in spending on housing and equipment turns up. Personal consumption expenditures should advance solidly, but, given the recent increases in energy prices and the reduced impetus from housing and equity wealth, the pace is likely to be noticeably slower than in 2006. Taking all of these factors into consideration, my forecast for real GDP growth in all of 2007 is modestly lower than it used to be, and I think my comments should make it clear that there are downside risks to this outcome, since it depends on near-term rebounds in both housing and business investment in equipment. So, as a policymaker, these are things I will keep a close eye on.\n\nMoreover, even if these downside risks do not materialize and my “best guess” scenario for economic activity comes through, there is an additional layer of concern. Another key part of the desired “soft landing” would involve the emergence of enough slack in labor markets to help bring inflation down from where it currently stands. This is where I revisit the puzzle I posed at the beginning: if the economy is even more lackluster than before, why is the labor market still going gangbusters? The latest labor market data show payroll employment growing steadily and at a robust pace. Moreover, the unemployment rate has declined by three-quarters of a percentage point over the past year and a half and now stands at 4.4 percent; that rate suggests a degree of tightness in the labor market, because it is somewhat below common estimates of the rate that can be sustained in the long run without generating rising inflation. In other words, if labor markets are indeed on the tight side, and if they remain there, then there may be reason for concern about building inflationary pressures.\n\nIn my earlier look at the puzzle I discussed a set of benign possible explanations and a set of worrisome ones. For example, one benign, and likely, possibility is that part of the disconnect between the unemployment rate and output growth will be resolved by a little more patience. Labor markets adjust to output growth with a lag, and that lag is not always consistent over time. Another benign possibility is that the unemployment rate may be overstating the tightness of labor markets. There are a variety of other labor market indicators, and some suggest less tightness than the unemployment rate. For example, the Conference Board index of job market perceptions, which is based on a survey of households, suggests that labor markets are only very slightly on the tight side. Furthermore, measures of labor compensation do not all line up with tightness in labor markets. In particular, the employment cost index shows remarkably restrained increases of only 3 percent over the past year, about the same as the year before. These possibilities are much as they were a few months ago.\n\nThe worrisome possibilities that I considered back then, however, have become, unfortunately, more worrisome and could indicate building inflationary pressures. They revolve around the question of whether the apparent disconnect between labor markets and output reflects a misreading of how close output is to its long-run capacity. One possibility is that output is actually growing faster than the data show. In fact, there are some indications to that effect. An alternative measure of aggregate activity—one that looks at total income generated in the economy—suggests a higher level of activity than the traditional measure of GDP, which looks at production. If the income measure ends up being more accurate than the production measure, then the decline in the unemployment rate this year might not turn out to be surprising at all. Indeed, this would mean that both labor and product markets have been tight, which would add to our estimate of inflation pressures.\n\nThe other possibility is the one that I mentioned in connection with a possible slowdown in trend productivity growth: that is, that output’s long-run capacity may be lower than most economists have estimated. Slower growth in trend productivity would translate directly into slower growth in the trend growth rate of real GDP. The implication for inflation is that real GDP would have to grow at a slower rate than we previously thought was necessary to generate more slack.\n\nIn outlining these explanations for the disconnect between output and unemployment, my goal has been to highlight the added weight I am now giving to the worrisome side of things. At the same time, it’s important to note that I do not view these explanations as mutually exclusive—it is certainly possible that more than one could be in play. Moreover, I confess up front that I do not see a way to know which explanations carry more weight. What I do know is that the intensification on the worrisome side means that there is more uncertainty about the state of underlying inflationary pressures, so it will be especially important to monitor the incoming data very closely.\n\nThis uncertainty is a special concern when we look at the inflation data over the past year or so, which has been disappointing. Over the past year, our main measure of consumer inflation—the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, or the core PCE price index—has increased by 2.4 percent, which is higher than I would like to see.\n\nWhile the possibility of slower underlying productivity growth raises uncertainties about how to interpret the puzzle and the associated implications for inflation, it also has a more direct and distinctly pessimistic implication for inflation. In particular, a slowdown in the trend rate of productivity growth means that firms’ trend unit labor costs will rise more rapidly unless compensation growth declines in tandem. Absent such a moderation in compensation growth, firms may adjust to more rapid cost pressures by passing them into the prices consumers pay for their products, placing upward pressure on core inflation, at least for a time. However, there is one mitigating factor: the markups firms set above unit labor costs are currently at very high levels. So, even if trend productivity growth has slowed, firms do have the room to absorb the increases in unit labor costs without raising the prices of their products. It remains to be seen how all of this will play out.\n\nFurthermore, I believe there are two other important features of the economy that may well work in the direction of bringing inflation down. One of these is inflation expectations, which appear to have been well anchored for at least the past ten years or so, as the Fed has established its credibility with the public about both its commitment to and its competence in keeping inflation at low and stable rates. For example, in the face of the large oil price increases we’ve seen in recent years, this credibility shows up in the stability of survey and market measures of inflation expectations looking ten years ahead.4 Statistical analysis of the behavior of core inflation also lends some support to the view that inflation expectations have become anchored. Admittedly, this evidence is drawn from a relatively small sample, but it’s important because, if it holds up, it implies, that core inflation has become more likely to revert to its long-run average, which, over the past decade, is around 2 percent.\n\nThe second favorable feature, which I have already alluded to, is that core inflation may have been elevated partly because of some transitory factors that are likely to unwind over the next year or so. One is oil prices. Although core inflation, by definition, excludes energy prices, they still may affect core inflation to the extent that they are passed through to the prices of other goods and services. Energy prices have risen recently, but they are still well below their peaks of mid 2006. Over the two and a half years before that, energy prices more than doubled, and this probably put some upward pressure on core inflation. However, the effects of energy price changes on inflation are inherently temporary, and these upward pressures are likely to dissipate in 2007.\n\nAnother transitory factor is substantial upward pressures on rents, including imputed rents on owner-occupied housing that enter importantly into the calculation of the price of housing services, and therefore, consumer inflation. Over the last year, rents have been rising at an unusually rapid rate as potential buyers, increasingly being priced out of the housing market, have shifted from owning to renting. As rents adjust to more normal levels relative to house prices, I anticipate these increases will taper off, also lowering inflation.\n\nTo sum up my inflation forecast, then, I do expect the dissipation of upward pressure from energy prices and rents and the beneficial effects of anchored inflation expectations to bring inflation down modestly over 2007. However, I also am keenly aware that this pattern has yet to show up in the data. The inflation situation remains uncertain and, in particular, there are upside risks to my outlook, especially having to do with the situation in labor markets.\n\nFrom my perspective as a monetary policymaker, I would say that, in these circumstances, with heightened risks to both growth and inflation, the best course for policy is watchful waiting. I think that the current stance of policy is likely to foster sustainable growth with a gradual ebbing of inflation over time. However, the inflation risks are skewed to the upside. For this reason, the FOMC’s press release following its March meeting notes that “the Committee’s predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected.” I believe it’s important to remain focused on bringing inflation down gradually over time—not only because price stability is desirable in its own right, but also because a credible commitment to keeping inflation low and stable is necessary to ensure that inflation expectations remain well-anchored.\n\nWe cannot afford to go back to a world similar to the 1970s, where shocks that should have had only a transitory impact on inflation—whether due to oil prices, rents or movements in the dollar—shift longer-term inflation expectations and touch off a self-fulfilling wage-price spiral. The Fed’s commitment over the last two decades to keeping inflation low has fundamentally changed inflationary psychology and that has permitted both inflation and unemployment to be low and stable. Keeping inflationary expectations well anchored is essential to good outcomes for the economy overall.\n\nAt the same time that we must keep inflation moving down over time, we must be careful not to tighten too much, thereby posing unnecessary risks to continued expansion. An “asymmetric policy tilt” seems appropriate given the risks to inflation. However, the complexities of the current situation—including uncertainties concerning the behavior of output and employment, as well as growing downside risks to economic growth and the possibility that the neutral level of the funds rate has been lowered by a productivity slowdown—make it appropriate for policy to retain considerable flexibility in responding to emerging data. The statement thus emphasizes that “Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.” What all of these considerations add up to is that the stance of monetary policy will undoubtedly need to be adjusted in ways that are dictated by shifts in our forecasts for inflation, output, and employment in light of incoming data.\n\n1.

        "content": "Good afternoon, everyone. I’m Janet Yellen, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. I would like to thank Greenlining for inviting me to speak at this year’s Economic Summit. Before I begin, I would just like to add my own words of congratulations to Luis Arteaga, Erin Pak, and Cory Jasperson. It is heartening to see their commitment to improving the well-being of low-income and minority communities, as well as to hear about the range of innovative strategies and programs that are needed to accomplish lasting change.\n\nIn my remarks today, I would like to speak to the theme of this year’s summit, “seizing the opportunity.” The focus on opportunity is an important one. Since its inception, Greenlining has worked to reframe how financial institutions view low-income and minority communities, arguing—often passionately—that these markets represent a true business opportunity and not just a regulatory obligation.\n\nThis emphasis on “opportunity” mirrors a broader shift in the field of community development as a whole. Slowly—and perhaps not yet universally—community development strategies are evolving to focus on community assets rather than on community needs. In other words, instead of framing a neighborhood by its problems, such as high crime rates or disinvestment, the community development field has begun to emphasize the sometimes hidden assets of low-income neighborhoods, such as the market potential and untapped purchasing power of inner city residents, historical architecture, unique small businesses, and talented local entrepreneurs. As Chairman Bernanke noted in his Greenlining speech last year, quantifying these assets and helping investors become aware of the opportunities in underserved neighborhoods can help to enlist market forces in the service of community development.1\n\nHow is this focus on community assets different from community development efforts thirty years ago? Since I don’t have time today to go into a detailed history of community development, let me just illustrate how this shift in thinking can spur very different models of inner city revitalization.\n\nAs many of you know, downtown Los Angeles has undergone an incredible transformation over the past eight years. What you might not know, however, is that where we stand today—the Bonaventure Hotel—is located within the Bunker Hill redevelopment area,2 the site of one of the largest urban renewal projects in the country’s history. Once the home of the very rich, Bunker Hill fell into decline in the 1920s and 30s, and the neighborhood’s elegant mansions were converted into apartments to house low-income families. By the 1940s, 99 percent of the units in Bunker Hill were tenant occupied, many without running water, and the incidence of crime and disease in the neighborhood was among the worst of any area in Los Angeles.3 By 1955—after several attempts to attract private investment failed—Los Angeles city planners were convinced that only a massive infusion of federal dollars and an ambitious top-down redevelopment strategy would be able to reverse the decline. The solution to the problem of Bunker Hill was to remove it. Once the redevelopment plans were in place, the Chairman of the Community Redevelopment Agency boasted, “The Bunker Hill redevelopment project promises to become one of the biggest and most important slum clearance projects in the West.”4 It took thirty years—and for much of this time the land stood vacant—for the Community Redevelopment Agency to develop L.A.’s commercial downtown, including the Union Bank building, the Pacific Telephone and Telegraphic building, California Plaza, and the Bonaventure Hotel.\n\nUrban renewal in Los Angeles did transform dowtown L.A., and ultimately contributed to higher property values in the city. But, in hindsight, it also incurred significant costs. More than 7,000 families were displaced as their homes were destroyed to make way for commercial redevelopment in the area. Moreover, these commercial buildings were not enough to create a new vibrant neighborhood or stem the flight of businesses and families from the inner city. By the mid-1990s, downtown Los Angeles faced high office vacancy rates, problems with poverty and homelessness, and deserted streets at night.\n\nIn contrast to this top-down approach, the current transformation of downtown Los Angeles is driven from the bottom up—by local government working with the private sector, residents, nonprofits, and local entrepreneurs—all of whom are empowered by new resources to capitalize on their ideas and unlock the economic potential of this community. For example, rather than tearing down the old commercial buildings, this strategy relies on infill development and the adaptive reuse of historic buildings for new housing units. Investors are supporting local entrepreneurs and providing private equity to inner city businesses. Nonprofit organizations and community development financial institutions are helping to incubate new businesses by providing technical assistance and small business loans to low-income and minority entrepreneurs.\n\nEqually notable are local efforts to ensure that downtown residents benefit from these investments. The Staples Center Community Benefits Agreement sets an important precedent for how local government, private developers, and community groups can work together to promote equitable development. Among other features, the Agreement ensures that 20 percent of new housing units in the project area will be affordable to low-income households, and stipulates that 70 percent of the jobs at the new center pay a living wage. The Agreement also provides for preferential hiring treatment to local and displaced residents.5\n\nWhile these two different vignettes greatly over-simplify the complex realities of redevelopment, I hope that this brief exercise in “comparing and contrasting” does illustrate how much the model of inner city revitalization has changed over the last 30 years. It also points to how much the financing of community development has changed. Whereas early efforts at urban renewal were funded largely by centralized federal grants, today’s community development projects are more likely to be financed by a combination of public and private dollars. The Low Income Housing and New Markets Tax Credit programs, for example, both reflect a shift in the federal government’s role in community development. Instead of providing funds directly to neighborhoods, these programs encourage private investment by offsetting risk through tax incentives. The community development finance field has also become extremely innovative in the way it secures both equity and debt financing, and has brought a much wider range of investors, lenders, and funders to the table. Today, you have government investing alongside banks, pension funds, and venture capitalists, all looking at ways to develop the assets that are present but underutilized in low-income neighborhoods.\n\nDespite these innovations in community development finance and the shift to a “bottom-up” strategy, the lessons from the past should also caution us against thinking that the road ahead will be easy. While these new approaches hold much promise, Los Angeles must still contend with difficult issues such as homelessness, education, workforce training, and additional affordable housing for low- and moderate-income families. Substantial gaps in access to credit and capital also remain. To provide just one example, research studies suggest that minority-owned small businesses have a harder time getting access to credit than other businesses, even after controlling for a wide variety of factors related to creditworthiness.6 Finding new ways to help connect capital with viable investment opportunities in these underserved markets is critical for an asset-based approach to community development to work. At the San Francisco Fed, the Center for Community Development Investments is conducting research and holding conferences to explore ways to improve access to capital for community development, for example, by securitizing community development loans, expanding the availability of community development venture capital, and overcoming information barriers to investment in emerging domestic markets like downtown L.A.\n\nIn bringing my remarks to a close, I would like to underscore how important your efforts are to the strength of the communities across the country. I encourage you to continue working together to help provide increased economic opportunity in your communities, and I wish you the best of luck in your efforts. I am confident that the ideas and partnerships that you develop in forums like these will help to answer the critical challenges facing the community development field. Thank you.\n\n1.

        "content": "Good afternoon, everyone. It’s a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak to you today. My remarks will center on recent developments affecting the U.S. economy and what they may portend for the future and especially for the conduct of monetary policy. I will spend some time focusing on housing markets, since they may play a key role in determining which direction economic activity and inflation will head over the rest of this year. Before I begin, let me note that my comments represent my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAs you no doubt remember, the Federal Open Market Committee began to remove monetary stimulus in mid-2004, after a long stretch of keeping the federal funds rate—our main policy tool—at a very low level. Altogether, there were 17 consecutive quarter-point increases in the funds rate over about two years. During much of that time, the economy averaged solid growth, absorbing a good deal of the slack in labor and product markets. The object of the policy tightening was to slow the economy’s growth to a more sustainable pace and to foster a gradual decline in inflation, promoting price stability. In August of last year, the Committee voted to “pause,” that is, not to raise the funds rate another quarter point, but to leave it at 5¼ percent. By then, some of the effects of the earlier increases were being felt, as the economy showed signs of slowing, and this gave some sense of reassurance that inflation was likely to moderate from an elevated level. These moves held the promise of setting the economy on a glide path for the proverbial “soft landing”—an orderly slowing of growth that avoids the risk of a severe downturn while producing enough slack in labor and goods markets to relieve inflationary pressures and, indeed, to bring inflation down gradually to a more acceptable level than it has registered over the prior year or so.\n\nIn large measure, the economy has moved within range of this outcome. And at the last meeting of the Committee, the members voted to keep the funds rate at 5¼ percent. But as always, there are risks to this forecast that need to be watched closely. At this stage, the predominant risks center on whether inflation will continue to move down gradually. This concern was expressed in the statement following our last meeting, and I’d like to elaborate on that point in the remainder of my remarks.\n\nLet me begin with where inflation is right now. Based on our main measure—the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, or the core PCE price index—consumer inflation was 2.2 percent over the past year, which, as I indicated, is higher than I would like to see. However, it is encouraging that we have seen some easing recently: in the last three months, this index has registered a more acceptable 1.7 percent annual rate of increase. The core CPI, which came out earlier this week, was on the high side of expectations in January. However, this followed three straight months of low core CPI inflation; after smoothing through the volatility, this measure of inflation also has eased in recent months.\n\nOne explanation for this decline in inflation involves the impact of stabilizing, and now falling, oil prices. As I mentioned, core inflation, by definition, excludes energy prices, but they still may affect core inflation to the extent that they affect the prices of other goods and services. For example, transport companies might raise their prices to pass along the higher costs of filling their trucks’ gas tanks. This is known as “pass-through,” and it is likely that it has played at least some role in recent movements in core inflation. Now that oil prices have fallen a fair bit from recent highs and are expected by futures markets to remain at those lower levels, this upward pressure on core inflation is likely to dissipate and may even be turning into modest downward pressure. However, it’s important to remember that the effects of oil price changes on inflation are by their very nature temporary. So at some point, the fall in oil prices will no longer have a favorable effect. Abnormally rapid rent increases, likely reflecting an increase in the demand for rental units by would-be owners who have been priced out of the housing market, have also elevated core inflation over the past year. As the housing market adjusts over time, however, this source of inflationary pressure is also apt to dissipate.\n\nBeyond these temporary effects, the stability of inflation expectations is another reason to take a positive view and project a gradual diminution of inflation. Expected future inflation is one of the factors that businesses consider in setting their prices and that workers consider when they bargain for compensation. These expectations appear to have been well anchored over the past ten years or so as the Fed has established its credibility with the public about both its commitment to and its competence in keeping inflation at low and stable rates. One piece of evidence supporting this credibility is that, in the face of the recent large oil price increases, we’ve seen stability in survey and market measures of inflation expectations looking ten years ahead.1\n\nBy now you are probably asking yourselves, if the inflation rate has been falling and if inflation expectations are well anchored, why the concern about risks to the forecast of gradually lower inflation? Part of the answer is to be found in the strength of labor markets. The latest data show payroll employment growing at a rather robust pace for all of last year. Moreover, the unemployment rate has declined by half a percentage point over the past year and now stands at just over 4½ percent; that rate suggests a degree of tightness in the labor market, because it is somewhat below common estimates of the rate that can be sustained in the long run without generating rising inflation.\n\nI say “suggests” a degree of tightening in labor markets because there is uncertainty about it. For example, if labor markets are tight, one would expect that labor compensation—including both wages and benefits—would be rising rapidly. However, the available information on this provides a mixed picture. We have two broad measures of labor compensation. One, the employment cost index, is showing remarkably restrained increases of only 3¼ percent over the past year, up only slightly from the prior year, and this development would seem to belie tight labor markets. The other measure, compensation per hour, gives a higher reading of about 5 percent. However, this measure includes compensation methods like stock options that are more akin to profits than wages. So part of the strength in this measure may not actually indicate a tight labor market.\n\nStill, given the probability of some tightness, we would need to see real GDP growth remain moderately below its long-run trend for a time to have confidence that the economy is heading for a soft landing with inflation continuing to move lower. The impetus for the needed moderate growth is likely already in train, given the cumulative effects of the 17 stepwise increases in the funds rate that began a couple of years ago. Since then, short- and intermediate-term interest rates have risen substantially. For example, Treasury bill rates are up by more than 3½ percentage points from mid-2004. It’s true that corporate long-term rates are actually down by around ½ percentage point over this period, while conventional fixed mortgage rates are essentially unchanged. However, variable mortgage rates have risen along with short-term rates. The overall effect of such rate changes has been to reduce demand. Not surprisingly, the housing sector has been at the leading edge of the overall economic slowdown, and I’d like to turn my attention to that important sector now.\n\nNationally, growth in spending on residential structures—after adjusting for inflation—was quite strong during 2002 through 2005. The decline started toward the end of 2005 and residential investment has fallen—in absolute terms—by a total of 13 percent, with especially steep drops over the last two quarters. In fact, during both of those quarters, this sector alone—which represents only a small fraction of U.S. real GDP—subtracted a hefty 1¼ percentage points from real GDP growth. Housing starts have followed a similar pattern, reaching a peak in January 2006 and then falling by roughly 40 percent through January of this year. That, of course, includes the headline-grabbing plunge for January announced last week.\n\nDespite the continued weakness in housing construction, which as I said enters directly into the calculation of real GDP, there are some signs of stabilization in other aspects of housing markets, suggesting that construction activity may level out before too long. For example, home sales have steadied somewhat after falling sharply for a year or so. Considering this in combination with the continued drop in housing starts that I mentioned earlier, it is not surprising to find that inventories of unsold homes have begun to shrink. This development suggests that the process of resolving the imbalances between demand and supply in the housing market may be underway, and, as a result, we could very well see the drag on real GDP from housing construction wane later this year.\n\nOf course, such a turn of events is by no means a given, because the improvements we’ve seen may just be temporary. For example, it is possible that they were related to a decline in fixed mortgage rates since the middle of last year, a development that probably supported home sales, at least to some extent. However, the decline in mortgage rates came as a bit of a surprise to me in a period when the FOMC maintained the funds rate target at 5¼ percent, especially in view of the widely discussed “conundrum” about why long-term interest rates were already so low.2 Therefore, we can’t count on further declines in mortgage rates to bring the housing market back.\n\nIn addition to concerns about weakness in housing construction, there has been worry that difficulties related to housing markets could spread to consumer spending more generally. Since consumption expenditures represent two-thirds of real GDP, even a relatively modest impact from housing markets on this big sector could put a noticeable dent in overall economic activity.\n\nUp to this point, we haven’t seen signs of such spillovers. Consumption spending has been well maintained, showing a robust growth rate for all of 2006. However, going forward, there are at least a couple of ways that spillovers from weakness in housing could depress consumer spending, and these channels bear watching. First, housing makes up a significant fraction of many people’s wealth, so a significant change in house values can affect consumer wealth and therefore consumer spending. As you know, there have been fears about plummeting house prices. But so far, at least, house prices at the national level either have continued to appreciate, though at a much more moderate rate, or have fallen moderately, depending on the price index you look at. Looking ahead, futures markets are expecting small declines in a number of metropolitan areas this year. While these modest movements are undoubtedly imparting less impetus to consumer spending now than during the years of rapid run-ups, their effects are not likely to be dramatic.\n\nThe slowdown in housing market activity has certainly been noticeable here in the Sacramento area. Previously, the local housing market had been very hot, with home prices growing consistently at a double-digit pace from 2000 to 2005, reaching a peak growth rate of about 25 percent in 2004. This was fueled in part by substantial in-migration from other parts of California, notably the Bay Area, and other states; during the first half of this decade, Sacramento was ranked very highly among the nation’s metropolitan areas in its rate of domestic in-migration. This process slowed down as home prices rose and the region’s affordability advantage was eroded. Indeed, Sacramento was one of the first areas in the state to show signs of the current housing slowdown. Prices in this area started to flatten out in early 2006 while they were still rising in most of the rest of the state, and building permits fell substantially even before that, in 2005. The slowdown in the local housing market intensified as 2006 progressed, and the latest available numbers indicate that in the fourth quarter of last year, sales of existing homes were down about 25 to 30 percent, and prices were down by about 4 percent.\n\nThe price decline has been small so far, but it raises fears about a more significant drop. Such fears are understandable, based on the historical experience: between 1991 and 1996, Sacramento area home prices fell about 15 percent. However, a key difference between then and now is the overall health of the local economy. While the pace of employment growth slowed last year in the Sacramento area, as it did in the rest of the state, the state government’s fiscal situation has improved over the past few years, helping to create new jobs locally and keeping the area economy on a stable expansion path. Continued economic growth of this sort can only help the adjustment in your area proceed in an orderly fashion.\n\nReturning to the national economy, housing market developments also could spread to consumer spending if enough homeowners experienced financial distress. For example, rising variable mortgage rates could strain some consumers’ cash flow. What we find, however, is that, because of the rapid appreciation of home prices in prior years, most homeowners are sitting on a substantial amount of equity, a financial resource that they can fall back on. In particular, adjustable-rate borrowers with equity can avoid a rate reset by refinancing. Moreover, only a small fraction of outstanding variable rate mortgages are scheduled to be reset in each of the next few years.\n\nOf course, financial distress could be a bigger problem for some borrowers who used so-called exotic financing—like interest-only loans, piggy-back loans, and loans with the possibility of negative amortization. These instruments are often designed to allow subprime borrowers into the market. In fact, there are signs of trouble for some households. Delinquencies on variable-rate mortgages to subprime borrowers have risen sharply since the middle of last year and now exceed 10 percent. But fortunately, delinquency rates for other types of mortgages—including all prime borrowers and even subprime borrowers with fixed-rate loans—have edged up only very modestly. I know that it’s common to see newspaper stories about homeowners who have run into trouble, and those situations are, indeed, regrettable. From a national perspective, however, the group with rising delinquencies still represents only a small fraction of the total market, with little impact on the behavior of overall consumption.\n\nA forward-looking view of the credit risks associated with subprime mortgages can be obtained from a new financial instrument related to these mortgages.3 These instruments suggest a big increase in the risk associated with loans made to the lowest-rated borrowers, but little change in risk for other higher-rated borrowers. Based on these results, it appears that investors in these instruments expect the losses to be fairly well contained. Of course, a shift in market sentiment about the risk of some of these securities is always possible. Such a shift would have ramifications for mortgage financing and housing, likely through tighter credit standards and higher mortgage rates for certain borrowers. In fact, we already have seen some tightening among commercial banks in recent months.4\n\nThe bottom line for housing is that the concerns we used to hear about the possibility of a devastating collapse—one that might be big enough to cause a recession in the U.S. economy—while not fully allayed have diminished. Moreover, while the future for housing activity remains uncertain, I think there is a reasonable chance that housing is in the process of stabilizing, which would mean that it would put a considerably smaller drag on the economy going forward.\n\nIn addition to housing, weakness in auto production has slowed the economy during the past few quarters. The auto industry has felt the effects of high oil prices and people’s growing demand for more fuel-efficient vehicles. That has been good news for some of the foreign automakers, but not such good news for U.S. automakers, for which SUVs and trucks have been a key source of strength. As the demand for these vehicles dropped, producers found themselves holding unsustainably high inventories. It’s little wonder that they slashed production. These production cuts slowed overall real GDP growth in the U.S. last year. However, once the adjustment to a lower level of production is reached, probably in the not too distant future, this factor will cease to hold down growth in the U.S. economy.\n\nOutside of housing and domestic autos, the rest of the economy has been doing quite well; that’s why it might be called a “bi-modal” economy. I’ve already mentioned that consumer spending has been robust. Business demand also has been solid, fueled by high profits and relatively favorable financing conditions, leading to healthy growth in spending on business investment in structures as well as equipment and software. Growth in investment in high-tech goods has been especially strong and the outlook is favorable, as telecommunications companies expand their fiber-optics networks and businesses continue to improve their productivity by upgrading their IT equipment.\n\nThe net impact of both the weak and healthy sectors I’ve described has produced moderate real GDP growth rates of 2½ and 2 percent in the second and third quarters of last year. The advance estimate of fourth-quarter growth showed a surge to a strong 3½ percent rate. However, recent monthly data have been on the weaker side. After smoothing out the volatility, my overall assessment is that economic activity has proceeded at a moderate underlying pace for close to a year now.\n\nIn other words, it looks as if the economy is pretty close to the “glide path” I mentioned before—since the first quarter of last year, growth has slowed to a bit below most estimates of the economy’s long-run potential, and more recently the risk of an outright downturn has receded along with the early signs of stabilization of housing markets. At the same time, while core inflation remains on the high side of what I would like to see, it has begun to ebb modestly in recent months.\n\nA key question for inflation going forward —and therefore, for monetary policy—is what happens if the drag from housing and autos disappears later this year? As I’ve stressed, with labor markets apparently somewhat tight, something else will need to slow to keep growth below potential.\n\nOne possibility is consumer spending. Growth in that sector seems likely to slow because of a diminishing impetus from household wealth, as house prices increase less rapidly and as past increases in interest rates impose a greater drag. In general, it wouldn’t be surprising to see a slowdown in consumer spending given that the personal saving rate—the fraction of income not spent—has fallen to very low levels in recent years and even into negative territory! There are good reasons for much of the drop in the saving rate over the past decade, including the rapid growth in household wealth from housing and the stock market. Given the extremely low recent level of saving, it wouldn’t be shocking to see some rebound in the saving rate. That said, the saving rate has been falling for more than a decade, so it’s obviously risky to put too much reliance on an upswing this year.\n\nIn summary, I believe that a soft landing is the most likely outcome over the next year or two. However, I hope my remarks so far make it abundantly clear that there are sizeable risks to this forecast and that I am especially concerned about the upside risks to our inflation forecast.\n\nThese considerations play a key role in my views on monetary policy. I have supported the decision to hold policy steady at the current rate despite inflation remaining higher than I would like it to be. Let me be clear that I do want inflation to move down, but as I just indicated with my forecast, I believe policy may now be well-positioned to foster exactly such an outcome. Moreover, I continue to support the bias in policy toward tightening precisely because it gives due consideration to the upside risks to inflation.\n\nI’m casting my statements about the outlook in very conditional terms because of the great uncertainty that surrounds any economic forecast. This uncertainty argues for policy to be responsive to the data as it emerges. The decision to keep policy on hold allows us more time to observe the data so that appropriate adjustments can be made to achieve our goals of maximum stainable employment and price stability.\n\n1.

I owe a debt of gratitude to Ken Wilcox for facilitating the invitation. As you may know, Ken serves on the San Francisco Fed’s Head Office Board of Directors, having recently been elected to a second term. He and the other Directors, not only at the Head Office, but also at our Branch offices, play an important role in the formulation of monetary policy. Of course, the emphasis of our policy analysis and our policy decisions must be on what serves the best interests of the nation as a whole. But the Directors’ independent assessment of conditions in specific regions and specific industries often gives us insights into developing trends that the national data may not reflect for weeks or months. Our Directors also play a key role in communicating with the public about the Fed and its mission—and that includes hearing the public’s views on the economy and bringing that information back to the Boardroom. This kind of give-and-take with the public is a high priority for me, as well, so I am looking forward very much to hearing your comments and observations during the question and answer session.\n\nMy remarks today will center on recent developments affecting the U.S. economy and what they may portend for the future and especially for the conduct of monetary policy.

Based on our main measure—the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, or the core PCE price index—consumer inflation was 2.2 percent over the past year, which, as I indicated, is higher than I would like to see. However, it is encouraging that we have seen some easing recently: in the last three months, this index has registered a more acceptable 1.7 percent annual rate of increase. The core CPI, which came out this morning, was on the high side of expectations in January. However, this followed three straight months of low core CPI inflation; after smoothing through the volatility, this measure of inflation also has eased in recent months.\n\nOne explanation for this decline in inflation involves the impact of stabilizing, and now falling, oil prices. As I mentioned, core inflation, by definition, excludes energy prices, but they still may affect core inflation to the extent that they affect the prices of other goods and services. For example, transport companies might raise their prices to pass along the higher costs of filling their trucks’ gas tanks. This is known as “pass-through,” and it is likely that it has played at least some role in recent movements in core inflation. Now that oil prices have fallen a fair bit from recent highs and are expected by futures markets to remain at those lower levels, this upward pressure on core inflation is likely to dissipate and may even be turning into modest downward pressure. However, it’s important to remember that the effects of oil price changes on inflation are by their very nature temporary. So at some point, the fall in oil prices will no longer have a favorable effect. Abnormally rapid rent increases, likely reflecting an increase in the demand for rental units by would-be owners who have been priced out of the housing market, have also elevated core inflation over the past year. As the housing market adjusts over time, however, this source of inflationary pressure is also apt to dissipate.\n\nBeyond these temporary effects, the stability of inflation expectations is another reason to take a positive view and project a gradual diminution of inflation. Expected future inflation is one of the factors that businesses consider in setting their prices and that workers consider when they bargain for compensation. These expectations appear to have been well anchored over the past ten years or so as the Fed has established its credibility with the public about both its commitment to and its competence in keeping inflation at low and stable rates. One piece of evidence supporting this credibility is that, in the face of the recent large oil price increases, we’ve seen stability in survey and market measures of inflation expectations looking ten years ahead.1\n\nBy now you are probably asking yourselves, if the inflation rate has been falling and if inflation expectations are well anchored, why the concern about risks to the forecast of gradually lower inflation? Part of the answer is to be found in the strength of labor markets. The latest data show payroll employment growing at a rather robust pace for all of last year. Moreover, the unemployment rate has declined by half a percentage point over the past year and now stands at just over 4½ percent; that rate suggests a degree of tightness in the labor market, because it is somewhat below common estimates of the rate that can be sustained in the long run without generating rising inflation.\n\nI say “suggests” a degree of tightening in labor markets because there is uncertainty about it. For example, if labor markets are tight, one would expect that labor compensation—including both wages and benefits—would be rising rapidly. However, the available information on this provides a mixed picture. We have two broad measures of labor compensation. One, the employment cost index, is showing remarkably restrained increases of only 3¼ percent over the past year, up only slightly from the prior year, and this development would seem to belie tight labor markets. The other measure, compensation per hour, gives a higher reading of about 5 percent. However, this measure includes compensation methods like stock options that are more akin to profits than wages. So part of the strength in this measure may not actually indicate a tight labor market.\n\nStill, given the probability of some tightness, we would need to see real GDP growth remain moderately below its long-run trend for a time to have confidence that the economy is heading for a soft landing with inflation continuing to move lower. The impetus for the needed moderate growth is likely already in train, given the cumulative effects of the 17 stepwise increases in the funds rate that began a couple of years ago. Since then, short- and intermediate-term interest rates have risen substantially. For example, Treasury bill rates are up by more than 3½ percentage points from mid-2004. It’s true that corporate long-term rates are actually down by around ½ percentage point over this period, while conventional fixed mortgage rates are essentially unchanged. However, variable mortgage rates have risen along with short-term rates. The overall effect of such rate changes has been to reduce demand. Not surprisingly, the housing sector has been at the leading edge of the overall economic slowdown, and I’d like to turn my attention to that important sector now.\n\nNationally, growth in spending on residential structures—after adjusting for inflation—was quite strong during 2002 through 2005. The decline started toward the end of 2005 and residential investment has fallen—in absolute terms—by a total of 13 percent, with especially steep drops over the last two quarters. In fact, during both of those quarters, this sector alone—which represents only a small fraction of U.S. real GDP—subtracted a hefty 1¼ percentage points from real GDP growth. Housing starts have followed a similar pattern, reaching a peak in January 2006 and then falling by roughly 40 percent through January of this year. That, of course, includes the headline-grabbing plunge for January announced last week.\n\nDespite the continued weakness in housing construction, which as I said enters directly into the calculation of real GDP, there are some signs of stabilization in other aspects of housing markets, suggesting that construction activity may level out before too long. For example, home sales have steadied somewhat after falling sharply for a year or so. Considering this in combination with the continued drop in housing starts that I mentioned earlier, it is not surprising to find that inventories of unsold homes have begun to shrink. This development suggests that the process of resolving the imbalances between demand and supply in the housing market may be underway, and, as a result, we could very well see the drag on real GDP from housing construction wane later this year.\n\nOf course, such a turn of events is by no means a given, because the improvements we’ve seen may just be temporary. For example, it is possible that they were related to a decline in fixed mortgage rates since the middle of last year, a development that probably supported home sales, at least to some extent. However, the decline in mortgage rates came as a bit of a surprise to me in a period when the FOMC maintained the funds rate target at 5¼ percent, especially in view of the widely discussed “conundrum” about why long-term interest rates were already so low.2 Therefore, we can’t count on further declines in mortgage rates to bring the housing market back.\n\nIn addition to concerns about weakness in housing construction, there has been worry that difficulties related to housing markets could spread to consumer spending more generally. Since consumption expenditures represent two-thirds of real GDP, even a relatively modest impact from housing markets on this big sector could put a noticeable dent in overall economic activity.\n\nUp to this point, we haven’t seen signs of such spillovers. Consumption spending has been well maintained, showing a robust growth rate for all of 2006. However, going forward, there are at least a couple of ways that spillovers from weakness in housing could depress consumer spending, and these channels bear watching. First, housing makes up a significant fraction of many people’s wealth, so a significant change in house values can affect consumer wealth and therefore consumer spending. As you know, there have been fears about plummeting house prices. But so far, at least, house prices at the national level either have continued to appreciate, though at a much more moderate rate, or have fallen moderately, depending on the price index you look at. Looking ahead, futures markets are expecting small declines in a number of metropolitan areas this year. While these modest movements are undoubtedly imparting less impetus to consumer spending now than during the years of rapid run-ups, their effects are not likely to be dramatic.\n\nAs a homeowner in the Bay Area myself, I’ve naturally taken a close look at the housing market here, so let me digress a moment to give you my reading on the situation. In the fourth quarter, sales of existing homes were down about 15 to 20 percent, and after several years of rapid appreciation, house prices barely budged in 2006. Builders responded to the demand slowdown accordingly, pulling fewer permits for new homes last year. However, here in Silicon Valley, some encouraging evidence of stabilization in the rate of homebuilding emerged late in the year.\n\nI mentioned fears about plummeting house prices, and in this area, you don’t need a long memory to understand why people have harbored them. In the first half of the 1990s, area home prices fell more than 10 percent. However, a key difference between then and now is the overall health of the local economy. For example, despite the slowdown in residential construction activity, conditions on the nonresidential side have improved, helping to keep overall Bay Area construction employment growing in 2006. And for employment overall, the pace of growth actually picked up a bit last year. Continued growth of this sort should help the adjustment in local housing markets proceed in an orderly fashion.\n\nReturning to the national economy, housing market developments also could spread to consumer spending if enough homeowners experienced financial distress. For example, rising variable mortgage rates could strain some consumers’ cash flow. What we find, however, is that, because of the rapid appreciation of home prices in prior years, most homeowners are sitting on a substantial amount of equity, a financial resource that they can fall back on. In particular, adjustable-rate borrowers with equity can avoid a rate reset by refinancing. Moreover, only a small fraction of outstanding variable rate mortgages are scheduled to be reset in each of the next few years.\n\nOf course, financial distress could be a bigger problem for some borrowers who used so-called exotic financing—like interest-only loans, piggy-back loans, and loans with the possibility of negative amortization. These instruments are often designed to allow subprime borrowers into the market. In fact, there are signs of trouble for some households. Delinquencies on variable-rate mortgages to subprime borrowers have risen sharply since the middle of last year and now exceed 10 percent. But fortunately, delinquency rates for other types of mortgages—including all prime borrowers and even subprime borrowers with fixed-rate loans—have edged up only very modestly. I know that it’s common to see newspaper stories about homeowners who have run into trouble, and those situations are, indeed, regrettable. From a national perspective, however, the group with rising delinquencies still represents only a small fraction of the total market, with little impact on the behavior of overall consumption.\n\nA forward-looking view of the credit risks associated with subprime mortgages can be obtained from a new financial instrument related to these mortgages.3 These instruments suggest a big increase in the risk associated with loans made to the lowest-rated borrowers, but little change in risk for other higher-rated borrowers. Based on these results, it appears that investors in these instruments expect the losses to be fairly well contained. Of course, a shift in market sentiment about the risk of some of these securities is always possible. Such a shift would have ramifications for mortgage financing and housing, likely through tighter credit standards and higher mortgage rates for certain borrowers. In fact, we already have seen some tightening among commercial banks in recent months.4\n\nThe bottom line for housing is that the concerns we used to hear about the possibility of a devastating collapse—one that might be big enough to cause a recession in the U.S. economy—while not fully allayed have diminished. Moreover, while the future for housing activity remains uncertain, I think there is a reasonable chance that housing is in the process of stabilizing, which would mean that it would put a considerably smaller drag on the economy going forward.\n\nIn addition to housing, weakness in auto production has slowed the economy during the past few quarters. The auto industry has felt the effects of high oil prices and people’s growing demand for more fuel-efficient vehicles. That has been good news for some of the foreign automakers, but not such good news for U.S. automakers, for which SUVs and trucks have been a key source of strength. As the demand for these vehicles dropped, producers found themselves holding unsustainably high inventories. It’s little wonder that they slashed production. These production cuts slowed overall real GDP growth in the U.S. last year. However, once the adjustment to a lower level of production is reached, probably in the not too distant future, this factor will cease to hold down growth in the U.S. economy.\n\nOutside of housing and domestic autos, the rest of the economy has been doing quite well; that’s why it might be called a “bi-modal” economy. I’ve already mentioned that consumer spending has been robust. Business demand also has been solid, fueled by high profits and relatively favorable financing conditions, leading to healthy growth in spending on business investment in structures as well as equipment and software. Growth in investment in high-tech goods has been especially strong and the outlook is favorable, as telecommunications companies expand their fiber-optics networks and businesses continue to improve their productivity by upgrading their IT equipment.\n\nThis growing demand for high-tech products has especially important implications for Silicon Valley and the whole Bay Area. The IT sector accounts for about 20 percent of total salary payments in the Bay Area, which is more than twice the nationwide share. Following extensive retrenchment in the wake of the “tech wreck” in 2000, the Bay Area IT sector has rebounded smartly, with substantial gains in company earnings, employment, and venture capital spending realized over the past year. This reflects not only the success of local companies at capitalizing on growing worldwide demand for IT products, but also their talents for developing innovative new products that create sales opportunities. This success has been especially evident on the software and services side of the industry, where solid employment gains and rapid wealth creation have been primary contributors to the area’s economic revitalization.\n\nFor the national economy, the net impact of both the weak and healthy sectors I’ve described has produced moderate real GDP growth rates of 2½ and 2 percent in the second and third quarters of last year. The advance estimate of fourth-quarter growth showed a surge to a strong 3½ percent rate. However, recent monthly data have been on the weaker side. After smoothing out the volatility, my overall assessment is that economic activity has proceeded at a moderate underlying pace for close to a year now.\n\nIn other words, it looks as if the economy is pretty close to the “glide path” I mentioned before—since the first quarter of last year, growth has slowed to a bit below most estimates of the economy’s long-run potential, and more recently the risk of an outright downturn has receded along with the early signs of stabilization of housing markets. At the same time, while core inflation remains on the high side of what I would like to see, it has begun to ebb modestly in recent months.\n\nA key question for inflation going forward —and therefore, for monetary policy—is what happens if the drag from housing and autos disappears later this year? As I’ve stressed, with labor markets apparently somewhat tight, something else will need to slow to keep growth below potential.\n\nOne possibility is consumer spending. Growth in that sector seems likely to slow because of a diminishing impetus from household wealth, as house prices increase less rapidly and as past increases in interest rates impose a greater drag. In general, it wouldn’t be surprising to see a slowdown in consumer spending given that the personal saving rate—the fraction of income not spent—has fallen to very low levels in recent years and even into negative territory! There are good reasons for much of the drop in the saving rate over the past decade, including the rapid growth in household wealth from housing and the stock market. Given the extremely low recent level of saving, it wouldn’t be shocking to see some rebound in the saving rate. That said, the saving rate has been falling for more than a decade, so it’s obviously risky to put too much reliance on an upswing this year.\n\nIn summary, I believe that a soft landing is the most likely outcome over the next year or two. However, I hope my remarks so far make it abundantly clear that there are sizeable risks to this forecast and that I am especially concerned about the upside risks to our inflation forecast.\n\nThese considerations play a key role in my views on monetary policy. I have supported the decision to hold policy steady at the current rate despite inflation remaining higher than I would like it to be. Let me be clear that I do want inflation to move down, but as I just indicated with my forecast, I believe policy may now be well-positioned to foster exactly such an outcome. Moreover, I continue to support the bias in policy toward tightening precisely because it gives due consideration to the upside risks to inflation.\n\nI’m casting my statements about the outlook in very conditional terms because of the great uncertainty that surrounds any economic forecast. This uncertainty argues for policy to be responsive to the data as it emerges. The decision to keep policy on hold allows us more time to observe the data so that appropriate adjustments can be made to achieve our goals of maximum stainable employment and price stability.\n\n1.

        "content": "Good afternoon. On behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the Asia Society of Southern California and the Pacific Council on International Policy, I’m delighted to welcome you all here. This is the first in a series of presentations, seminars, and conferences the San Francisco Fed will be involved with over this year as we explore various facets of the Asian financial crisis, focusing on the stability and resiliency of financial sectors today and remaining challenges in the future.\n\nAt the time of the crisis, I was the Chair of President Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers, and, as you may imagine, it was definitely a “front-burner” issue for us. As the crisis spread from country to country, there was deep concern about how big the impact would be on the U.S. economy, and the markets certainly were jittery: that October, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged over 500 points. For the five Asian nations most associated with the crisis—Thailand, Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia—the toll in both human and economic terms was enormous: in 1998, these countries saw their economies shrink by an average of 7.7 percent and many millions of their people lost their jobs. More broadly, there was concern that the crisis had revealed new sources of risk in the international financial architecture. Now that I am a Reserve Bank President with responsibilities for overseeing financial institutions, I have an even greater awareness of how these issues remain vital for maintaining financial stability today.\n\nIn my remarks this afternoon, I would like to provide some background for the discussions that will take place in the follow-up events marking the tenth anniversary of the crisis. Let me note that, as usual, these comments are my own and do not necessarily represent the views of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System. I will first review the major strands of thought in the literature on the causes of the crisis, highlighting some of the vulnerabilities that were contributing factors. Then I will turn to conditions in the affected countries today and examine how their policy responses to the crisis have shaped the current Asian financial environment. I will round out my remarks with some thoughts on lessons learned, particularly for international financial institutions, and observations on China in the current environment.\n\nBefore I begin, I should note that the subject is not really a single Asian crisis, but rather several crises. The afflicted countries obviously differ very much from one another, both in terms of their levels of economic development and their institutional features. Therefore, the causes of the crises and, likewise, the policy reforms that have been adopted in the last 10 years are not uniform for the region as a whole. Nonetheless, there are some important overarching themes in these developments, and I will try to draw them out.\n\n***\n\nLet me begin by looking back. The financial crisis in Asia was in many ways very different from others. For example, earlier in the 1990s, both Mexico and Argentina suffered financial crises, largely stemming from their unsustainably high budget deficits and soaring inflation. By contrast, in most of the affected Asian countries, during the years leading up to the crisis, growth in economic activity was strong, inflation was relatively tame, investment was robust, and, with their budgets in surplus, their fiscal houses appeared to be in order.\n\nIndeed, these countries had enjoyed extraordinarily fast growth for decades. As their success grew, the international community encouraged them to open their economies to foreign capital and to liberalize their financial sectors, and there was movement in that direction beginning in the late 1980s. With freer capital markets and fewer distortions in the financial sector, foreign capital flooded in, typically as short-term loans to banks; by 1996, capital inflows had grown to $93 billion.1\n\nHow, then, did 1997 become the year of the “sudden stop” in East Asia—that is, the year that foreign investors not only stopped flooding these countries with capital, but, in fact, reversed course and pulled capital out, in a dramatic way, as $93 billion of inflows became over $12 billion of outflows?\n\nThe literature exploring this question is massive, and has generally offered two kinds of explanations, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive. According to one view, this situation is best characterized as a “liquidity” crisis—much like a banking panic, where depositors’ fears about insolvency, well-grounded or not, become a self-fulfilling prophecy as their withdrawals en masse bring the bank to ruin. In the case of the East Asian economies, foreign investors may have lost confidence in their fundamental soundness, perhaps because of news about the failures of the Korean chaebols Hanbo and Sammi Steel, as well as of Thai nonbank financial institutions. This loss of confidence could have led investors to unload their holdings of those countries’ securities in a kind of panic-selling. Thus, in this view, whether or not the loss of confidence was warranted, it became a self-fulfilling prophecy, as the downward pressure on Asian asset prices ultimately led to the deterioration in fundamentals that investors feared.2\n\nThe second view focuses more on the vulnerabilities that existed in these nations’ economic fundamentals, which threatened to lead to solvency difficulties. One such vulnerability was the pursuit of risky lending practices by financial intermediaries. In part this was due to problems with the quality of supervision and regulation of the financial sector. For example, in Thailand in the early 1990s, although regulatory requirements for banks were rigorous, actual enforcement of those requirements was less so—sometimes far less so, according to some studies; moreover, regulation of nonbank financial institutions was almost nonexistent. But the problem also lay with the long tradition of so-called “relationship lending.” Rather than basing lending decisions on sound information about the fundamental economic value of specific investment projects, banks and other financial intermediaries based them on personal, business, or governmental connections. As a result, bank loan portfolios became particularly risky. And these risks became grim realities when economic conditions slowed in these countries in early 1997, as many firms, such as the Korean chaebols I mentioned, faced serious financial difficulties.3\n\nIn spite of the risky lending practices that prevailed before the crisis, foreign investors poured money into these countries at record rates. Their willingness to do so appears to have stemmed in part from a second area of vulnerability—a perception that the governments of these nations stood ready to intervene to forestall bank failures. Here Korea provides a particularly clear example. Foreign branches of Korean banks were able to build up huge liabilities before the crisis, partly because foreign creditors correctly perceived that if their parent banks found themselves in financial difficulty—as they did after the onset of the crisis—they would receive assistance from the Korean government. Indeed, one study documents that foreign creditors began refusing to refinance their outstanding obligations when the level of these liabilities began to approach the Korean government’s holdings of foreign reserves.4 When foreign creditors refused to roll over their short-term loans, capital inflows were quickly replaced by capital outflows.\n\nThis brings me to a third vulnerability—explicitly or implicitly pegged exchange rate regimes, which are subject to speculative attacks if the markets perceive that the true value of the currency is misaligned with its pegged value. One explanation for the attacks that drove currency values down in Asia is tied to concerns about possible big government bailouts of the strained banking sector.5 If foreign investors expected that the bailouts would lead to high fiscal deficits, that expectation, in turn, would raise concerns that the governments might force their central banks to monetize their deficits, resulting in higher inflation and depressed currency values.\n\nAs we all know, the speculative attacks on exchange rate pegs appeared to spread from one country to another, a phenomenon now commonly referred to as “contagion.” Take the case of the attack on the Korean won that occurred shortly after the Thai baht fell and the Taiwanese dollar was devalued. One explanation for it hinges on trade competitiveness; that is, speculators might have expected the Korean government to be more willing to let the won depreciate once the other currencies had fallen in order to stay competitive with its Asian neighbors. Alternatively, speculators might have expected that the crises in those countries would worsen Korea’s export prospects, leading to an economic downturn in Korea which would put downward pressure on the won.\n\nWhatever the source of the contagion, the currency depreciations had devastating consequences due to the prevalence of “currency mismatches.” These existed because both domestic banks and their client firms had been issuing dollar-denominated liabilities to finance their investments, whose returns were denominated in local currencies. Presumably, they held these unhedged positions either because they had few other options, or, because at the time, they assumed that the pegs would hold.6 In any event, once the pegs collapsed, their balance sheets deteriorated severely, leaving them unable to service their debt obligations when their creditors refused to roll over their dollar liabilities.\n\n***\n\nWith their economies at such a low ebb, the expectations that the Asia crisis nations would stage a full and fast recovery were, frankly, not very high. Yet, remarkably, a full and fast recovery is exactly what happened. Between 1999 and 2005, these nations enjoyed average per capita income growth of 8.2 percent and investment growth averaging nearly 9 percent, with foreign direct investment booming at an average annual rate of 17.5 percent.7 Moreover, all of the loans associated with the International Monetary Fund’s assistance programs during the crisis have been paid back and the terms of those programs have been fulfilled.\n\nAt least part of this success is likely due to policy changes that have gone some way toward addressing the vulnerabilities I discussed. One such policy change has been an increasing shift away from targeting exchange rates and toward targeting an explicit desired inflation rate. Korea moved in this direction in 1998, followed by Thailand in 2000 and Indonesia in 2005. Changing the anchor for these countries’ monetary and foreign exchange policies has helped to mitigate the possibility of currency mismatches by encouraging private agents to hedge their currency positions, while also allowing for greater domestic flexibility in response to external shocks.\n\nNow, it should be admitted that these countries still manage their exchange rates to some extent. In fact, recent moves by the Thai government indicate an increased emphasis on this issue. After a series of foreign exchange interventions failed to stem the upward pressure on the baht last year, the Thai government imposed controls on capital inflows last month, first limiting sales of short-term securities to foreign investors and then imposing a de facto tax on portfolio capital inflows by requiring 30 percent of inflows to be placed in a non-interest bearing “reserve account,” refundable in full only after a year. While an investor sell-off of Thai equities forced the government to repeal some of the controls the next day, its determination to limit exchange rate movements appears to have increased.\n\nThe more typical way for these countries to limit exchange rate movements has been through intervention and the accumulation of dollar reserves. As a result, between 1997 and 2005, foreign exchange holdings in the five crisis countries quadrupled to over $378 billion.8\n\nWhile efforts to limit exchange rate appreciation may be motivated in part by competitiveness considerations, this build-up in reserves may also be motivated by memories of the crisis, as these funds could be used to smooth the effects if another “sudden stop” occurred.9 In any event, it is fair to say that the East Asian nations as a group have come a long way towards achieving exchange rate flexibility and price stability compared to where they were in the 1990s, and the improved macroeconomic conditions likely have played a role in their superior performance and in their renewed attractiveness as destinations for foreign direct investment.\n\nKorea, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia have also moved to improve banking supervision and regulation and to introduce more market discipline since the crisis. Korea’s progress in strengthening its supervision of financial institutions is especially significant.10 Korean commercial banks have also adopted Western-style board governance systems, where the majority of board members are outside directors, and they have reformed their executive compensation processes, with banks introducing or strengthening executive stock option programs geared towards tying compensation more closely to bank performance.11 Korean banks also quickly cleansed their balance sheets of nonperforming loans.\n\nAmong the other crisis nations, supervision and accounting transparency also have improved, and banks in Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines have succeeded in ridding their balance sheets of nonperforming loans. However, recent studies suggest that there are still weaknesses in enforcement, as there were before the crisis, which limits the regulatory gains achieved through tightening accounting standards.12 Nevertheless, compared to 1997, significant progress has been made. Indonesia has rebuilt and recapitalized its devastated banking sector. Malaysian banks’ new emphasis on lending to consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises has moved them away from relationship-based lending that was the norm prior to the crisis. Thailand has brought its previously unregulated finance companies under central bank supervision.\n\nAnother step towards decreasing the extent of bank-centered finance and the scope of implicit government guarantees on investment has been the development of local currency bond markets. Prices in these markets adjust to changes in perceived risk automatically and in ways that can pose substantially less systemic risk than foreign-currency-denominated short-term loans. This solution complements the other reforms, because, in order to function well, bond markets require timely, honest, and credible reporting of firms’ financial circumstances—in other words, a transparent, well-regulated, and well-functioning set of capital markets. Thus, borrowing in bonds from a large number of creditors could reduce the relationship lending problems believed to have played a role in poor lending decisions made by Asian banks before the crisis. Indeed, some have even argued that developed local bond markets could make it less costly to securitize bank loans and help banks better manage risk in their lending portfolios.13\n\nTo promote the development of local currency bond markets, a group of regional central banks launched the first stage of an “Asian Bond Fund” in 2003.14 To date, however, this Fund has not led to much growth in bond trading and issuance, in part because the fiscal prudence in a number of Asian countries has meant that too few government bonds are available to form a vibrant market in public debt securities. This in turn limits the corporate bond market, since government bonds add to the overall volume of bonds issued in that currency and thereby increase overall market liquidity. Bond market growth also requires a solid financial infrastructure, including a sound legal structure, effective credit ratings agencies, and a strong institutional investor base. Countries that develop this infrastructure will likely have a better chance at seeing meaningful growth in local bond markets.\n\n***\n\nSo far I have discussed several policy changes that the Asia-crisis nations have made to strengthen their financial systems and thereby avoid another crisis. But even with these measures in place—indeed, even with eventual improvements in these measures—there will always be some residual risk of systemic crises. Therefore, an assessment of the state of Asian financial markets today must include an examination of the capability of the international financial architecture and its major institution, the International Monetary Fund, to handle future financial crises.\n\nSome lessons have clearly been learned. One relates to the conditions for opening a country’s capital markets. With a strong financial system, the arguments in favor of unfettered capital flows are strong. But during a transition from a financial system with evident vulnerabilities, the path to the liberalization of capital accounts should be gradual and carefully managed. Failure to do so can expose the regulatory and moral hazard difficulties experienced in Asia.\n\nAnother lesson is one that the Fund has learned, namely, that its adjustment programs should be tailored to individual nations’ characteristics.15 For example, some critics have charged that while the austerity measures it advocated may have worked well in other financial crises, in the case of Asia they may have actually exacerbated the downturn.16 Although that claim remains controversial, the Fund has adopted new guidelines to ensure that its adjustment programs are shaped by individual country characteristics and that local authorities have a voice in steering adjustment policies during Fund-supported lending programs going forward.\n\nA third lesson is that transparency concerning both overall macroeconomic conditions and individual firm accounting is needed to guide successful domestic investment decisions. Here, too, the Fund has adapted by strengthening its international surveillance activities to provide early warnings of impending crises. In 1999, the Fund, together with the World Bank, launched the Financial Sector Assessment Program, with the aim of assisting emerging market economies in identifying weaknesses in their domestic financial sectors.\n\nOf course, in the decade since the Asian financial crisis, there have been other crises, and these, too, have led to some reforms in the international architecture. A notable episode was the Argentine crisis of 2002. This was the first large modern default where creditors were not primarily banks, as they were in Asia, but rather a multitude of bond claimants from many countries. On the positive side, the contagion issues that were prevalent in Asia did not arise, as the Argentine risk was well diversified across a large group. On the negative side, renegotiation efforts were hindered by the need to address the economic and legal differences of a large and disparate set of claimants.\n\nAnticipating the challenges raised by the movement toward predominantly bond-based finance from bank-based finance, the Fund has explored the question of lending workouts; it has even considered the possibility of formalizing sovereign debt renegotiations with mechanisms analogous to the bankruptcy procedures that prevail in domestic bond markets. For now, however, it appears that the problems of renegotiating with a broad set of claimants are being addressed in a less centralized manner, as governments such as Mexico have successfully issued bonds containing “collective action clauses” that establish at issue the procedures for orderly renegotiation in the event of default.\n\n***\n\nIn assessing financial conditions in Asia ten years after the financial crisis, one must consider the ascendance of China as a key economic power in the region. I did not mention China earlier in my discussion because China was not drawn as deeply into the financial crisis that spread through the region, even though it, too, had problems with its financial sector. The reason it stood apart is that it differed from the crisis countries in two important respects. First, its capital account was more closed, and second, much of the foreign investment was not short-term loans but direct investment, which in many cases involved actual plants and factories—“steel in the ground.” Today, despite China’s recent successes, it still shares some of the vulnerabilities faced by the Asia crisis countries in the 1990s. For example, although it has made significant progress in reforming its banking sector through reducing nonperforming loans, the government still has a degree of influence in Chinese bank lending decisions, and some have expressed continuing concern over the health of the banking sector. Commenting on the challenges China faces in its corporate governance and accounting standards, Chairman Bernanke noted recently17 that progress has been made in these areas, but large benefits could be achieved from further concentration on these issues.\n\nWhile China has increased the flexibility of the renminbi, permitting it to appreciate by 6.5 percent against the dollar since it was officially unpegged in July 2005, it is still much less flexible than the currencies of the Asia crisis countries. The central bank has resisted pressures for more rapid appreciation of the renminbi by intervening in the foreign exchange market and building up its holdings of foreign reserves. Limiting appreciation of the currency in this manner complicates the use of monetary policy to produce an orderly slowdown in China’s currently booming economy.\n\nAs an emerging leader within the region, China could also play a major role in promoting regional exchange rate flexibility. For example, Thailand’s Finance Minister recently argued that his nation’s economic conditions would be helped by a faster pace of renminbi revaluation. If China were to move more quickly, it could well encourage even greater exchange rate flexibility among the East Asian fledgling inflation-targeters, as they would be able to pursue their goal of reaching price stability without losing export competitiveness.\n\nIn conclusion, the crisis illuminated the importance of sound financial policies, including strong accounting principles and adequate regulatory oversight, as well as the importance of sound macroeconomic policies, including exchange rate flexibility. The good news is that, since the crisis, the Asian countries as a group have made great progress in these areas. Still, there are reasons to believe that continued vigilance will be required to prevent or ameliorate crises in the future. First, there is some risk that the policy reforms that were achieved in the wake of the disastrous crisis could be scaled back in the current era of relative regional prosperity. Second, private agents may respond to the relatively tranquil current economic environment by dropping some of the prudent investment practices that were adopted following the crisis.\n\nThe Asian financial crisis had a profound effect on the people and economies of the region. For that reason, it is worthwhile exploring the fundamental causes of the crisis, the recovery paths countries have adopted, and any current vulnerabilities that could undermine the stability of the financial system. The two conferences in June and September at the San Francisco Fed will delve more deeply into these issues. By looking ahead with that tumultuous event in mind, we hope to provide important insights for countries within the region, for the U.S. and Europe, their trading partners, and for emerging market economies around the world.\n\n1.

        "content": "Good afternoon, everyone. I was very pleased to receive your invitation to speak to the Rotary Club of Reno, because it gives me a chance to visit an important part of our District and to meet with area businesspeople. The Federal Reserve places a high priority on communication, and I definitely see that as a two-way street. Although I anticipate holding the floor for a full half hour, I am also very interested in hearing your observations on economic conditions, both nationally and locally.\n\nMy remarks today will center on recent developments affecting employment, output, and inflation in the U.S. economy and what they may portend for the future and especially for the conduct of monetary policy. In doing so, I will spend some time focusing on an emerging puzzle in the data: why is the labor market apparently going gangbusters, while growth in real GDP has turned in only a middling performance on average in recent quarters?\n\nBefore I begin, let me note that my comments represent my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIn describing the economy’s recent growth performance as “middling,” as I just did, I was not making a pejorative judgment. On the contrary, this relatively modest pace of growth is roughly what I would have expected, given the course of monetary policy. As you no doubt remember, the Federal Open Market Committee began to remove monetary stimulus in mid-2004, after a long stretch of keeping the federal funds rate—our main policy tool—at a very low level. Altogether, there were 17 quarter-point increases in the funds rate over about two years. During much of that time, the economy averaged solid growth, and the labor market tightened, with unemployment declining about a full percentage point to 4.5 percent, an exceptionally low level by historical standards. The object of the policy tightening was to slow the economy’s growth to a more sustainable pace and to foster a gradual decline in inflation, promoting price stability. In August of last year, the Committee voted to “pause,” that is, not to raise the funds rate another quarter point, but to leave it at 5¼ percent. By then, some of the effects of the earlier increases were being felt, as the economy showed signs of slowing, and this gave some sense of reassurance that inflation was likely to moderate from an elevated level. The aim of these policy moves, to my mind, at least, was thus to set the economy on a glide path for the proverbial “soft landing”—an orderly slowing of growth that avoids the risk of a severe downturn while producing enough slack in labor and goods markets to relieve inflationary pressures and, indeed, to bring inflation down gradually to a more acceptable level than it has registered over the prior year or so.\n\nIn large measure, the economy has moved within range of this outcome. Since the stepwise increases in the funds rate began, short- and intermediate-term interest rates have risen substantially. For example, Treasury bill rates are up by more than 3½ percentage points from mid-2004. It’s true that long-term rates, including conventional mortgages, are actually down a bit over this period. However, variable mortgage rates have risen along with short-term rates.\n\nThe overall effect of such rate changes has been to reduce demand. For example, although long-term fixed mortgage rates have not changed much, the rise in variable mortgage rates probably has contributed to the housing downturn, which has been a drag on the economy. I should note, however, that interest rates are not the only culprit. It’s likely that the recent cooling also is a necessary correction after years of rapid run-ups in house prices that ultimately proved to be unsustainable. Nationally, housing permits are down by about 25 percent from a year ago, and inventories of unsold houses are up significantly. The national data on residential investment reflect these developments and enter directly into the calculation of real GDP growth. After adjusting for inflation, (real) residential investment registered its fourth straight decline in the third quarter, which held overall real GDP growth down by a substantial 1¼ percentage points. The partial data we have on the fourth quarter suggests that there was a similar effect then.\n\nWhile the decline in housing activity has been significant and will probably continue for a while longer, I think the concerns we used to hear about the possibility of a devastating collapse—one that might be big enough to cause a recession in the U.S. economy—have been largely allayed. As I mentioned, long-term rates have remained low, and that has helped to cushion the downturn in housing activity. Likewise, the fears about plummeting house prices have not materialized at the national level, though some pockets of the country have seen house prices actually decline. The Reno area provides a striking example of how the market has turned around: after rising about 20 to 30 percent annually in 2004 and 2005, prices on existing homes began to fall in the second quarter of 2006. The decline appears to be modest so far.1 But for the country as a whole, house prices have continued to appreciate, though obviously at a much more moderate rate than they did earlier. The concern here was that a significant fall in the prices of houses, which make up such a significant part of so many people’s wealth, could lead to a weakening in consumer spending. Since consumption expenditures represent two-thirds of real GDP, even relatively modest effects of declining housing wealth could put a noticeable dent in overall economic activity. While slower house price appreciation is undoubtedly imparting less impetus to consumer spending now than during the years of rapid run-ups, consumer spending remains solid overall, outpacing real GDP growth in the second half of last year. We have seen few signs of substantial negative spillovers from weakness in housing markets to consumer spending.\n\nLooking at other sectors of the economy, we see a pretty robust picture, for the most part. Business demand has been solid, fueled by high profits and relatively favorable financing conditions, leading to healthy growth in spending on business investment in equipment and software, especially in the high-tech industries. Moreover, spending for the construction of nonresidential structures advanced smartly last year, and promises to remain robust for a while longer. For example, outlays on drilling and mining structures have continued to increase in response to oil prices that are still high by historical standards, though the pace of investment is moderating. Furthermore, fundamentals in commercial real estate markets improved last year, increasing demand for commercial space from office parks to warehouses. Going forward, even at a more moderate pace of economic expansion, private forecasters expect the positive trends in commercial real estate to continue but to moderate over the year as capacity comes online.\n\nIn addition to housing, auto production has been a drag on the economy during the past few quarters. The auto industry has felt the effects of high oil prices and people’s growing preferences for more fuel-efficient vehicles. That has been good news for some of the foreign automakers, but not such good news for some U.S. automakers, for whom SUVs and trucks have been a key source of strength. As the demand for these vehicles dropped, producers found themselves holding unsustainably high inventories. So it’s little wonder that they moved to ramp down production. These production cuts slowed overall real GDP growth in the U.S. in 2006. However, once the adjustment to a lower level of inventories is reached, probably in the not too distant future, this factor will cease to hold down growth in the U.S. economy.\n\nIn fact, energy prices themselves could be a source of support for growth this year. Over the past couple of years, the surge in the price of oil took a bite out of consumer spending, even though other factors, like growth of jobs, wages, and wealth, kept consumption moving up overall. Needless to say, it has been a relief to see that oil prices have not just stabilized but actually receded quite a bit since their peak in the middle of last year. At this point, futures markets expect them to stabilize around the current lower levels, and if they do, not only should the restraint we felt last year evaporate this year; the decline in oil prices would actually contribute to a pickup in growth. Of course, given the well-known volatility of energy markets, that’s a very big “if,” so they remain a wild card in the outlook as usual.\n\nSo, to sum up the story on output, real GDP advanced at moderate rates of only 2½ and 2 percent in the second and third quarters of last year. Recent monthly data have boosted estimates of growth in the fourth quarter, but such high frequency data can be volatile, and very recent developments don’t change my overall assessment that economic activity is proceeding at a moderate underlying pace. In other words, it looks as if the economy is pretty close to the “glide path” I mentioned before—growth has slowed to a bit below most estimates of the economy’s long-run potential, while the risk of an outright downturn has receded.\n\nThat would all be very comforting, except for the puzzle I mentioned at the beginning, which could have serious implications for inflation and, therefore, for the “soft landing” I’m hoping for. Just to restate the puzzle: if the economy is growing a bit below its long-run trend, why is the labor market going gangbusters? It is as if the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which produces the GDP data, hasn’t delivered its message to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The latest labor-market data show payroll employment growing steadily and at a rather robust pace. Moreover, the unemployment rate has declined by ½ percentage point over the past year and now stands at 4½ percent; that rate suggests a degree of tightness in the labor market, because it is somewhat below common estimates of the rate that can be sustained in the long run without generating rising inflation. Using a standard rule of thumb, the unemployment rate should have been essentially unchanged, given the 3 percent growth rate the economy has averaged over the past four quarters.\n\nThe ramifications of this puzzle are significant. If labor markets are as tight as the unemployment rate suggests, then there may be reason for concern about building inflationary pressures. If, on the other hand, they are not, then it is more likely that we are headed for a “soft landing.”\n\nLet me start with the worrisome possibilities, in which the puzzle could indicate building inflationary pressures. One such possibility is that the apparent disconnect between labor markets and output reflects a misreading of how close output is to its long-run capacity. This could happen because the economy’s long-run capacity may actually be lower than many estimates. It also could happen if output is actually growing faster than the data show. In fact, there are indications to that effect, namely, that actual output growth may have been faster than the pace reflected in measured GDP.\n\nAggregate statistics on the U.S. economy are calculated in two ways—we have measurements of total output and separate measurements of total income. In principle, these must be the same—every dollar of output generates a dollar of income for some economic entity, be it an individual or a firm. However, in practice, the statistical sources for output and income are different, so that the two measurements need not come out to the same aggregate number. This difference is known as the “statistical discrepancy,” a topic that tends to put even economists to sleep. However, I raise this obscure issue because it could have important implications.\n\nGrowth in gross domestic income has outpaced growth in gross domestic product by a whopping three-quarters of a percentage point over the past year. If the income measure ends up being more accurate than the output measure, then the decline in the unemployment rate this year would not be surprising at all. Indeed, this would mean that both labor and product markets have been tight, which would add to our estimate of inflation pressures.\n\nNow let me turn to the more benign possibilities, that is, where labor markets may not be signaling growing inflationary pressures. One possibility is that the disconnect between the unemployment rate and output growth will be resolved by a little more patience. Labor markets adjust to output growth with a lag, and that lag is not always consistent over time. So we may just need a little more time for the standard relationship to reassert itself, with increases in unemployment that reestablish the normal relationship with the slower rate of growth we’ve seen.\n\nAnother possibility is that even after the lags have worked themselves out, the unemployment rate may be overstating the tightness of labor markets. One form of evidence for this is that certain other labor market indicators suggest a bit of softening. In particular, the Conference Board index of job market perceptions, which is based on a survey of households, declined in both October and November. This index is historically very highly correlated with the unemployment rate, but now it is sending a different signal, suggesting that labor markets are roughly in balance, not tight. Similarly, in November, fewer firms reported openings that are hard to fill.\n\nAnother form of evidence bearing on this benign interpretation relates to labor compensation. If labor markets are tight, one would expect that labor compensation—including both wages and benefits—would be rising rapidly. However, the available information on this provides a mixed, and, I must admit, a somewhat confusing picture. We have two broad measures of labor compensation. One, the employment cost index, is showing remarkably restrained increases of only 3 percent over the past year, about the same as in the prior year, and this development would seem to belie tight labor markets. The other measure, compensation per hour, gives a higher reading of more than 4¼ percent.2 However, this measure includes compensation methods like stock options that are more akin to profits than wages. So part of the strength in this measure may not actually indicate a tight labor market. Taken together, these two indicators provide at best a mixed picture of tightness.\n\nMy own sense of how the labor market situation will affect inflation inclines me more toward the benign view than the worrisome view—and I say this with the appropriate caveats, of course: There are indeed large uncertainties—and in particular, upside risks—to the outlook for inflation.\n\nTo begin with, over the past year, our main measure of consumer inflation—the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, or the core PCE price index—has increased by 2.2 percent, which is higher than I would like to see. On a more positive note, inflation has come down in recent months, with this index up by a more acceptable 1.8 percent over the past three months.\n\nOne reason why inflationary pressure may be easing is due to the impact of stabilizing, and now falling, oil prices. As I mentioned, core inflation, by definition, excludes energy prices, but energy prices still may affect core inflation to the extent that they affect the prices of other goods and services. For example, transport companies might raise their prices to pass along the higher costs of filling their trucks’ gas tanks. This is known as “pass-through,” and it is likely that it has played at least some role in recent movements in core inflation. Now that energy prices have fallen a fair bit from recent highs and are expected by futures markets to remain at those lower levels, this upward pressure on core inflation is likely to dissipate and may even be turning into modest downward pressure.\n\nHowever, it’s important to recognize that the effects of energy price changes on inflation are inherently temporary. Once they have fully worked through the system, we will be left with the more fundamental and enduring influences of factors such as the extent of labor and product market tightness. This is why I spent so much time going into the puzzle about why labor and product markets are currently sending mixed signals about inflationary pressures. How this puzzle is resolved is a key issue for future inflation and therefore for monetary policy.\n\nA second reason to be optimistic about future inflation is that inflation expectations appear to have been well anchored over the past ten years or so as the Fed has established its credibility with the public about both its commitment to and its competence in keeping inflation at low and stable rates. For example, in the face of the large oil price increases we’ve seen in recent years, this credibility shows up in the stability of survey and market measures of inflation expectations looking ten years ahead.\n\nStatistical analysis of the behavior of core inflation over time also lends some support to the view that inflation expectations are well anchored. In such statistical analyses, the inflation data historically have exhibited “persistence.” This basically means that, when you’re forecasting inflation, it works pretty well to assume that the rate in the future will be the same as it is today. The implication of persistence is frankly worrisome: Since inflation is too high today, persistence implies it could stay too high for an extended period.\n\nHowever, research suggests that if a central bank’s commitment to price stability has gained credibility with the public, then the persistence observed in the inflation data will tend to be dampened. And as it turns out, recent research at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco finds less evidence of persistence during the past ten years. That is, rather than sticking at a certain rate, core inflation has tended to revert to its long-run average, which, over that period, is between 1-3/4 and 2 percent. Admittedly, the past ten years constitute a relatively small sample from which to draw definitive conclusions. Nonetheless, this evidence is important because, if it holds up, it implies that inflation may move down from its elevated level faster than many forecasters expect.\n\nTo sum up my inflation forecast, then, I find recent inflation readings encouraging, but I also am keenly aware that this pattern has yet to show up in the data on any sort of a sustained basis. The inflation situation remains uncertain and, in particular, there are upside risks to my outlook, especially having to do with the situation in labor markets.\n\nThese considerations play a key role in my views on monetary policy. I have supported the decision to hold policy steady at the current rate. That may seem a little surprising, given that inflation remains higher than I would like it to be and that there are some upside risks to my inflation outlook. Let me be clear that I do want inflation to move down, but I believe policy may now be well-positioned to foster exactly such an outcome while also giving due consideration to the risks to economic activity.\n\nI came to this conclusion by considering a variety of metrics that help assess the stance of policy. These measures include the forecast I have outlined today, as well as the recommendations from commonly used Taylor rules for monetary policy, named after John Taylor, a professor at Stanford who first suggested them. They give an estimate of an appropriate setting of the funds rate given where inflation is relative to an assumed target and a measure of tightness in goods or labor markets.\n\nTaken as a whole, a variety of these rules indicate that the funds rate is currently within the moderately restrictive range that appears appropriate. Current conditions in goods markets generally suggest that the current policy stance is sufficient to bring inflation down to more acceptable levels. In view of what I’ve said today, it will come as no surprise that consideration of the situation in labor markets provides less room for optimism on inflation. And while I am inclined to see labor market tightness as transitory, I do take it as a serious risk.\n\nEven if policy is now well positioned, as I think is likely to be the case, it will still take some additional time for inflation to unwind due to lags between policy actions and their impacts on economic activity and inflation. These lags can be anywhere from several months to a couple of years. This means that we have yet to see the full effects of the series of 17 funds rate increases—some are probably still in the pipeline.\n\nYou will note that I am casting my statements about the stance of policy and the outlook in very conditional terms. I do this because of the great uncertainty that surrounds economic forecasts and any simple measure of the tightness of monetary policy. Frankly, all approaches to assessing the stance of policy are inherently imprecise. Just as imprecise is our understanding of how long the lags will be between our policy actions and their impacts on the economy and inflation. This uncertainty argues, then, for policy to be responsive to the data as it emerges, especially since we are within range of the desired policy setting. The decision to keep policy on hold allows us more time to observe the data so that appropriate adjustments can be made over time.\n\n1. Based on OHFEO repeat-sales index, prices on existing homes sold in the Reno area rose 30.4% in 2004 and 22.5% in 2005, while NAR median price data show an increase of 25.5% in 2004 (2005 data are not available). By contrast, in 2006, the value of the OFHEO index fell at about a 3% annual pace in the second and third quarters, leaving prices approximately flat on net for the first three quarters; the NAR median price series shows larger declines (4.0% pace in Q2, 13.3% in Q3). Data recently reported in local newspapers indicate that the median sales price fell further in October.\n\n2. Corrected January 26, 2007.\n\n# # #"

As President of the San Francisco Fed, I wholeheartedly support the role our Bank plays as a “key partner” in your efforts. The San Francisco Fed and, I should add, the whole Federal Reserve System, place high priority on economic education and our partnership with the Council is part of a range of programs and activities to inform and instruct the public on economic issues. The Fed’s emphasis on economic education reflects our recognition that wise financial planning and decisionmaking are critical to any individual’s economic security. Beyond that, we recognize that an economically informed public is critical to our mission in monetary policy.\n\nOf course, even if I were not a Reserve Bank President, I still would applaud your efforts. As you know, I share with you a long history of being an economics educator myself, although my work has been with students at the undergraduate and graduate levels and not in the grade schools. In fact, I have heard about the new mandated economics curriculum for K-12 students in Arizona, and it looks pretty ambitious—introducing the concept of opportunity costs to third-graders, for example! It makes me think how much easier my job at Berkeley might have been if more of my students had had a grasp of such concepts before they walked into my class!\n\nToday I’m going to speak to you not as a professor, but as a national monetary policymaker.

In August of last year, the Committee voted to “pause,” that is, not to raise the funds rate another quarter point, but to leave it at 5¼ percent. By then, some of the effects of the earlier increases were being felt, as the economy showed signs of slowing, and this gave some sense of reassurance that inflation was likely to moderate from an elevated level. The aim of these policy moves, to my mind, at least, was thus to set the economy on a glide path for the proverbial “soft landing”—an orderly slowing of growth that avoids the risk of a severe downturn while producing enough slack in labor and goods markets to relieve inflationary pressures and, indeed, to bring inflation down gradually to a more acceptable level than it has registered over the prior year or so.\n\nIn large measure, the economy has moved within range of this outcome. Since the stepwise increases in the funds rate began, short- and intermediate-term interest rates have risen substantially. For example, Treasury bill rates are up by more than 3½ percentage points from mid-2004. It’s true that long-term rates, including conventional mortgages, are actually down a bit over this period. However, variable mortgage rates have risen along with short-term rates.\n\nThe overall effect of such rate changes has been to reduce demand. For example, although long-term fixed mortgage rates have not changed much, the rise in variable mortgage rates probably has contributed to the housing downturn, which has been a drag on the economy. I should note, however, that interest rates are not the only culprit. It’s likely that the recent cooling also is a necessary correction after years of rapid run-ups in house prices that ultimately proved to be unsustainable. Nationally, housing permits are down by more than 30 percent from a year ago, and inventories of unsold houses are up significantly. The national data on residential investment reflect these developments and enter directly into the calculation of real GDP growth. After adjusting for inflation, (real) residential investment registered its fourth straight decline in the third quarter, which held overall real GDP growth down by a substantial 1¼ percentage points. The partial data we have on the fourth quarter suggests that there was a similar effect then.\n\nWhile the decline in housing activity has been significant and will probably continue for a while longer, I think the concerns we used to hear about the possibility of a devastating collapse—one that might be big enough to cause a recession in the U.S. economy—have been largely allayed. As I mentioned, long-term rates have remained low, and that has helped to cushion the downturn in housing activity. Likewise, the fears about plummeting house prices have not materialized at the national level, though some pockets of the country have seen house prices actually decline. Phoenix provides a striking example of how the market has turned around: sales cancellations have been rampant on new homes, and, after rising about 40%-50% in 2005, in 2006 prices on existing homes flattened out and perhaps even declined a bit by the end of the year. It would not surprise me to learn that some of you have directly observed recent price declines in this area. But for the country as a whole, house prices have continued to appreciate, though obviously at a much more moderate rate than they did earlier. The concern here was that a significant fall in the prices of houses, which make up such a significant part of so many people’s wealth, could lead to a weakening in consumer spending. Since consumption expenditures represent two-thirds of real GDP, even relatively modest effects of declining housing wealth could put a noticeable dent in overall economic activity. While slower house price appreciation is undoubtedly imparting less impetus to consumer spending now than during the years of rapid run-ups, consumer spending remains solid overall, outpacing real GDP growth in the second half of last year. We have seen few signs of substantial negative spillovers from weakness in housing markets to consumer spending.\n\nLooking at other sectors of the economy, we see a pretty robust picture, for the most part. Business demand has been solid, fueled by high profits and relatively favorable financing conditions, leading to healthy growth in spending on business investment in equipment and software, especially in the high-tech industries. Moreover, spending for the construction of nonresidential structures advanced smartly last year, and promises to remain robust for a while longer. For example, outlays on drilling and mining structures have continued to increase in response to oil prices that are still high by historical standards, though the pace of investment is moderating. Furthermore, fundamentals in commercial real estate markets improved last year, increasing demand for commercial space from office parks to warehouses. Going forward, even at a more moderate pace of economic expansion, private forecasters expect the positive trends in commercial real estate to continue but to moderate over the year as capacity comes online.\n\nIn addition to housing, auto production has been a drag on the economy during the past few quarters. The auto industry has felt the effects of high oil prices and people’s growing preferences for more fuel-efficient vehicles. That has been good news for some of the foreign automakers, but not such good news for some U.S. automakers, for whom SUVs and trucks have been a key source of strength. As the demand for these vehicles dropped, producers found themselves holding unsustainably high inventories. So it’s little wonder that they moved to ramp down production. These production cuts slowed overall real GDP growth in the U.S. in 2006. However, once the adjustment to a lower level of inventories is reached, probably in the not too distant future, this factor will cease to hold down growth in the U.S. economy.\n\nIn fact, energy prices themselves could be a source of support for growth this year. Over the past couple of years, the surge in the price of oil took a bite out of consumer spending, even though other factors, like growth of jobs, wages, and wealth, kept consumption moving up overall. Needless to say, it has been a relief to see that oil prices have not just stabilized but actually receded quite a bit since their peak in the middle of last year. At this point, futures markets expect them to stabilize around the current lower levels, and if they do, not only should the restraint we felt last year evaporate this year; the decline in oil prices would actually contribute to a pickup in growth. Of course, given the well-known volatility of energy markets, that’s a very big “if,” so they remain a wild card in the outlook as usual.\n\nSo, to sum up the story on output, real GDP advanced at moderate rates of only 2½ and 2 percent in the second and third quarters of last year. Recent monthly data have boosted estimates of growth in the fourth quarter, but such high frequency data can be volatile, and very recent developments don’t change my overall assessment that economic activity is proceeding at a moderate underlying pace. In other words, it looks as if the economy is pretty close to the “glide path” I mentioned before—growth has slowed to a bit below most estimates of the economy’s long-run potential, while the risk of an outright downturn has receded.\n\nThat would all be very comforting, except for the puzzle I mentioned at the beginning, which could have serious implications for inflation and, therefore, for the “soft landing” I’m hoping for. Just to restate the puzzle: if the economy is growing a bit below its long-run trend, why is the labor market going gangbusters? It is as if the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which produces the GDP data, hasn’t delivered its message to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The latest labor-market data show payroll employment growing steadily and at a rather robust pace. Moreover, the unemployment rate has declined by ½ percentage point over the past year and now stands at 4½ percent; that rate suggests a degree of tightness in the labor market, because it is somewhat below common estimates of the rate that can be sustained in the long run without generating rising inflation. Using a standard rule of thumb, the unemployment rate should have been essentially unchanged, given the 3 percent growth rate the economy has averaged over the past four quarters.\n\nThe ramifications of this puzzle are significant. If labor markets are as tight as the unemployment rate suggests, then there may be reason for concern about building inflationary pressures. If, on the other hand, they are not, then it is more likely that we are headed for a “soft landing.”\n\nLet me start with the worrisome possibilities, in which the puzzle could indicate building inflationary pressures. One such possibility is that the apparent disconnect between labor markets and output reflects a misreading of how close output is to its long-run capacity. This could happen because the economy’s long-run capacity may actually be lower than many estimates. It also could happen if output is actually growing faster than the data show. In fact, there are indications to that effect, namely, that actual output growth may have been faster than the pace reflected in measured GDP.\n\nAggregate statistics on the U.S. economy are calculated in two ways—we have measurements of total output and separate measurements of total income. In principle, these must be the same—every dollar of output generates a dollar of income for some economic entity, be it an individual or a firm. However, in practice, the statistical sources for output and income are different, so that the two measurements need not come out to the same aggregate number. This difference is known as the “statistical discrepancy,” a topic that tends to put even economists to sleep. However, I raise this obscure issue because it could have important implications.\n\nGrowth in gross domestic income has outpaced growth in gross domestic product by a whopping three-quarters of a percentage point over the past year. If the income measure ends up being more accurate than the output measure, then the decline in the unemployment rate this year would not be surprising at all. Indeed, this would mean that both labor and product markets have been tight, which would add to our estimate of inflation pressures.\n\nNow let me turn to the more benign possibilities, that is, where labor markets may not be signaling growing inflationary pressures. One possibility is that the disconnect between the unemployment rate and output growth will be resolved by a little more patience. Labor markets adjust to output growth with a lag, and that lag is not always consistent over time. So we may just need a little more time for the standard relationship to reassert itself, with increases in unemployment that reestablish the normal relationship with the slower rate of growth we’ve seen.\n\nAnother possibility is that even after the lags have worked themselves out, the unemployment rate may be overstating the tightness of labor markets. One form of evidence for this is that certain other labor market indicators suggest a bit of softening. In particular, the Conference Board index of job market perceptions, which is based on a survey of households, declined in both October and November. This index is historically very highly correlated with the unemployment rate, but now it is sending a different signal, suggesting that labor markets are roughly in balance, not tight. Similarly, in November, fewer firms reported openings that are hard to fill.\n\nAnother form of evidence bearing on this benign interpretation relates to labor compensation. If labor markets are tight, one would expect that labor compensation—including both wages and benefits—would be rising rapidly. However, the available information on this provides a mixed, and, I must admit, a somewhat confusing picture. We have two broad measures of labor compensation. One, the employment cost index, is showing remarkably restrained increases of only 3 percent over the past year, about the same as in the prior year, and this development would seem to belie tight labor markets. The other measure, compensation per hour, gives a higher reading of more than 4¼ percent.1 However, this measure includes compensation methods like stock options that are more akin to profits than wages. So part of the strength in this measure may not actually indicate a tight labor market. Taken together, these two indicators provide at best a mixed picture of tightness.\n\nMy own sense of how the labor market situation will affect inflation inclines me more toward the benign view than the worrisome view—and I say this with the appropriate caveats, of course: There are indeed large uncertainties—and in particular, upside risks—to the outlook for inflation.\n\nTo begin with, over the past year, our main measure of consumer inflation—the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, or the core PCE price index—has increased by 2.2 percent, which is higher than I would like to see. On a more positive note, inflation has come down in recent months, with this index up by a more acceptable 1.8 percent over the past three months.\n\nOne reason why inflationary pressure may be easing is due to the impact of stabilizing, and now falling, oil prices. As I mentioned, core inflation, by definition, excludes energy prices, but energy prices still may affect core inflation to the extent that they affect the prices of other goods and services. For example, transport companies might raise their prices to pass along the higher costs of filling their trucks’ gas tanks. This is known as “pass-through,” and it is likely that it has played at least some role in recent movements in core inflation.2 Now that energy prices have fallen a fair bit from recent highs and are expected by futures markets to remain at those lower levels, this upward pressure on core inflation is likely to dissipate and may even be turning into modest downward pressure.\n\nHowever, it’s important to recognize that the effects of energy price changes on inflation are inherently temporary. Once they have fully worked through the system, we will be left with the more fundamental and enduring influences of factors such as the extent of labor and product market tightness. This is why I spent so much time going into the puzzle about why labor and product markets are currently sending mixed signals about inflationary pressures. How this puzzle is resolved is a key issue for future inflation and therefore for monetary policy.\n\nA second reason to be optimistic about future inflation is that inflation expectations appear to have been well anchored over the past ten years or so as the Fed has established its credibility with the public about both its commitment to and its competence in keeping inflation at low and stable rates. For example, in the face of the large oil price increases we’ve seen in recent years, this credibility shows up in the stability of survey and market measures of inflation expectations looking ten years ahead.3\n\nStatistical analysis of the behavior of core inflation over time also lends some support to the view that inflation expectations are well anchored. In such statistical analyses, the inflation data historically have exhibited “persistence.” This basically means that, when you’re forecasting inflation, it works pretty well to assume that the rate in the future will be the same as it is today. The implication of persistence is frankly worrisome: Since inflation is too high today, persistence implies it could stay too high for an extended period.\n\nHowever, research suggests that if a central bank’s commitment to price stability has gained credibility with the public, then the persistence observed in the inflation data will tend to be dampened. And as it turns out, recent research at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco finds less evidence of persistence during the past ten years.4 That is, rather than sticking at a certain rate, core inflation has tended to revert to its long-run average, which, over that period, is between 1-3/4 and 2 percent. Admittedly, the past ten years constitute a relatively small sample from which to draw definitive conclusions. Nonetheless, this evidence is important because, if it holds up, it implies that inflation may move down from its elevated level faster than many forecasters expect.\n\nTo sum up my inflation forecast, then, I find recent inflation readings encouraging, but I also am keenly aware that this pattern has yet to show up in the data on any sort of a sustained basis. The inflation situation remains uncertain and, in particular, there are upside risks to my outlook, especially having to do with the situation in labor markets.\n\nThese considerations play a key role in my views on monetary policy. I have supported the decision to hold policy steady at the current rate. That may seem a little surprising, given that inflation remains higher than I would like it to be and that there are some upside risks to my inflation outlook. Let me be clear that I do want inflation to move down, but I believe policy may now be well-positioned to foster exactly such an outcome while also giving due consideration to the risks to economic activity.\n\nI came to this conclusion by considering a variety of metrics that help assess the stance of policy. These measures include the forecast I have outlined today, as well as the recommendations from commonly used Taylor rules for monetary policy, named after John Taylor, a professor at Stanford who first suggested them. They give an estimate of an appropriate setting of the funds rate given where inflation is relative to an assumed target and a measure of tightness in goods or labor markets.\n\nTaken as a whole, a variety of these rules indicate that the funds rate is currently within the moderately restrictive range that appears appropriate. Current conditions in goods markets generally suggest that the current policy stance is sufficient to bring inflation down to more acceptable levels. In view of what I’ve said today, it will come as no surprise that consideration of the situation in labor markets provides less room for optimism on inflation. And while I am inclined to see labor market tightness as transitory, I do take it as a serious risk.\n\nEven if policy is now well positioned, as I think is likely to be the case, it will still take some additional time for inflation to unwind due to lags between policy actions and their impacts on economic activity and inflation. These lags can be anywhere from several months to a couple of years. This means that we have yet to see the full effects of the series of 17 funds rate increases—some are probably still in the pipeline.\n\nYou will note that I am casting my statements about the stance of policy and the outlook in very conditional terms. I do this because of the great uncertainty that surrounds economic forecasts and any simple measure of the tightness of monetary policy. Frankly, all approaches to assessing the stance of policy are inherently imprecise. Just as imprecise is our understanding of how long the lags will be between our policy actions and their impacts on the economy and inflation. This uncertainty argues, then, for policy to be responsive to the data as it emerges, especially since we are within range of the desired policy setting. The decision to keep policy on hold allows us more time to observe the data so that appropriate adjustments can be made over time.\n\n1. Corrected January 26, 2007.\n\n2. However, one shouldn’t exaggerate the importance of pass-through. Research suggests that the extent of pass-through for any given rise in energy prices has been lower in the past twenty-five years than it was back in the 1970s (see Mark Hooker, “Are Oil Shocks Inflationary? Asymmetric and Nonlinear Specifications versus Changes in Regime,” Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, May 2002).\n\n3.
