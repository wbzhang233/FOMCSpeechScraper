        "content": "These days, I am often asked how I think about monetary policy decisions. And that makes sense. Especially now, when the tradeoffs that many people fear—high inflation or hard recession—seem so severe. My answer is this: I am resolute and mindful. Resolute in achieving our goals. And mindful about how we do it.\n\nNow to some, it may seem like there is a conflict. They worry that resolute means “at any cost.” On the other side, people hear mindful and they worry we won’t go far enough—that we’ll stop short of getting the job fully done.\n\nBut resolute and mindful are complementary principles. And today, I will share how they inform my decisions as we strive to deliver low and stable prices and an economy that works for all.\n\nBefore I go on, let me remind you that the remarks I make are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of anyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\n\nFrom Low to High Inflation\n\nI’ll start by talking about where we are and how we got here. Because this, of course, sets the stage for what lies ahead.\n\nAs many of you know, Congress gave the Federal Reserve two mandates: price stability and maximum employment. Right now, we are only meeting one of those goals. The labor market is very strong and well aligned with our employment objective. In contrast, inflation is unacceptably high and has been that way for almost two years.\n\nThese unprecedented efforts worked. U.S. economic growth bounced back rapidly. By the second half of 2020, demand was growing and the labor market was on track to recover. Supply chains were lagging, but with vaccines coming online, there was hope that production would quickly return to full capacity.\n\nBy the fall of that year, inflation had risen further and looked to be gaining momentum. In contrast, unemployment was steadily declining and heading back to its historically low pre-pandemic level. In response, the Fed needed to remove accommodation and tighten policy much more quickly than it had previously signaled.\n\nPolicy Rebalancing\n\nThis and other forward guidance provided throughout that fall had an immediate impact. Almost overnight, financial conditions tightened. Market participants began pricing in expected future rate hikes, and businesses and households started readying themselves for a new interest rate landscape, pulling forward real estate purchases, restructuring debt obligations, and locking in longer-term fixed-rate loans. In other words, before we ever raised the federal funds rate, tighter financial conditions were already working their way through the system (Figure 1). Indeed, by the time of the first official rate hike of 25 basis points in March 2022, mortgage interest rates had risen three-quarters of a percentage point and broader financial conditions had tightened almost a full percentage point.\n\nThe responsiveness of financial conditions to our communications was notable and helpful. It gave us a head start on adjusting policy and mitigated the costs of an abrupt and unexpected change to the policy rate.\n\nWe began raising rates more quickly—expeditiously—moving the fed funds rate up in 75 basis point increments. This allowed us to swiftly withdraw accommodation and bring policy more in line with prevailing economic conditions. As of our last meeting just a few weeks ago, the target range of the federal funds rate stands at 3.75 to 4 percent, modestly restrictive relative to the neutral rate of interest. And we have signaled that there is more work to do.\n\nThis resolve has some people worried. They are concerned that resolute means unwilling to stop until the economy breaks or inflation hits 2 percent.\n\nFinding Sufficiently Restrictive\n\nAs we work to bring policy to a sufficiently restrictive stance—the level required to bring inflation down and restore price stability—we will need to be mindful. Adjusting too little will leave inflation too high. Adjusting too much could lead to an unnecessarily painful downturn.\n\nSo, what specifically do we need to be mindful of? Many things, of course. But in our November FOMC statement, we mention three in particular: the cumulative tightening in place, the lags in monetary policy, and the evolution of the data.\n\nLet’s start with cumulative tightening. Historically, we’ve used progress on the federal funds rate and where it stands relative to its neutral value as a gauge for policy restrictiveness. But in today’s world, that is only part of the picture. The funds rate does not capture the impact of the other tools in our tool kit, including the reduced asset holdings associated with balance sheet roll-off and the forward guidance we’ve provided about the future path of policy. It also misses the fact that central banks across the globe are tightening policy as well, likely amplifying the effects of our own rate hikes.\n\nAs we make decisions about further rate adjustments, it will be important to remain conscious of this gap between the federal funds rate and the tightening in financial markets. Ignoring it raises the chances of tightening too much.\n\nThis is consistent with what we have seen in the data. The Fed started tightening policy close to a year ago. Interest-sensitive sectors like housing started to cool very quickly. As mortgage rates rose, home sales, construction activity, and the pace of house price gains slowed. Labor markets remain solid but are showing early signs of cooling. Job openings are down about 10 percent from their March high and job growth is slowing from its rapid pace last year. And although one month of data does not a victory make, the latest inflation report had some encouraging numbers, including a long awaited decline in goods price inflation.\n\nLooking ahead, I will be watching for further calming in these areas, as well as signs that pandemic-related imbalances between supply and demand are continuing to subside. I will also be in continuous dialogue with business leaders, workers, and community members in my District. Policy decisions also require that we look forward. Real-time conversations yield insights about how people are faring and how the economy is changing before they ever show up in the published data.\n\nAs we navigate back to price stability, we will need to pay attention to all of these things and adjust policy accordingly. And because the economy is dynamic, we will need to do this on an ongoing basis. We have to constantly calibrate our stance of policy to meet evolving conditions.\n\nA Job Fully Done\n\nWhile resolute and mindful are not in conflict, there is a tension. And that’s what we want in policymaking.\n\nWe want to go far enough that we get the job done. That’s the resolute part. But not so far that we overdo it. And that’s the mindful part.\n\nSo, we will march unwaveringly toward our goals. Resolute and mindful, until the job is fully done.\n\nThank you.\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\nMertens, Thomas M., and John C.

        "content": "Good afternoon. It’s a pleasure to be back here in Boise and to be on campus at Boise State. So, thank you very much for the opportunity. I look forward to your questions and to our discussion.\n\nNow, these goals are often characterized as tradeoffs. More of one means less of the other. But for most people, they are deeply intertwined.\n\nI know this from my many years as a policymaker. But I also know it from experience.\n\nI grew up in Ballwin, Missouri, during the Great Inflation of the 1970s. Rapidly rising prices made it hard for working families like mine to afford the things we needed. Eventually, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates and inflation came down. But the abruptness and magnitude of the response caused two painful recessions. Unemployment soared. Jobs became tough to find. And one impossible situation gave way to another.\n\nI didn’t know it then, but this experience would teach me an enduring lesson, one that I would carry with me over the course of my career as a policymaker. The lesson is that economic security depends on both jobs and stable prices. Together, these two pillars form the foundation for everything else.\n\nSeen in this light, the Federal Reserve actually has a singular purpose: to keep the economy on a sustainable path by delivering low, stable prices and durable labor market strength.\n\nToday, I am going to discuss this singular purpose and how price stability and full employment work together to support it. But before I continue, let me remind you that the views I will express are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\n\nInextricably Linked\n\nIf you travel almost anywhere in the United States these days, you’ll hear two things about the economy. The first is that the labor market is strong. The second is that inflation is high.\n\nBoth of these things are true.\n\nSo it’s a great time to be a worker, right?\n\nWell, not so much. Inflation is high, running well over the Fed’s average 2 percent target for well over a year now. This can be traced back to a number of factors, but it boils down to a large and persistent imbalance between demand and supply. Demand has been supported by pandemic-related monetary and fiscal relief, robust household savings and, over the past year, a very strong labor market. At the same time, domestic and global supply have been highly constrained, hit by a series of negative shocks, including the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and severe labor shortages.\n\nPersistent high inflation across a broad range of goods and services is eroding the purchasing power of earnings, even those that are rising. This erosion is insidious—a gradual, but persistent chipping away of living standards. The picture makes this clear (see Figure 1). Price inflation measured by the consumer price index, or CPI, has been rising far faster than average hourly earnings. Indeed, average real wages, which take account of inflation, have declined by 9 percent over the past two years. This means that the average worker in the U.S. economy has lost rather than gained ground, all while the labor market remains historically strong.\n\nThis corroding of real wages is more than just painful. It also undermines the basic American promise, which says that if you work hard, you can get ahead. Inflation traps people in an endless loop of running fast and falling behind, unrelated to effort or input.\n\nEventually, this sense of falling behind starts to affect decisionmaking.\n\nDistortions and Decisions\n\nAs people struggle to keep up with rising prices, earning money becomes the central factor in determining which jobs they choose.\n\nNow, in some ways this seems fine. We work so we can buy things—to support ourselves, take care of our families, and give back to our communities. But when wages dominate all other considerations, like the type of job we do or the chance for future mobility, they become a wedge—putting space between what people need today and what they want for their future.\n\nWorkers everywhere are facing these choices. I recently heard an example at a gathering of local business leaders. One of them was from a large restaurant group with locations in multiple cities. It offered competitive salaries, health benefits, and lots of opportunities for professional growth. But longtime employees who had been advancing through the ranks and building careers with the organization were suddenly leaving. When the owner asked them why, he learned they were no longer able to afford rent near the city and had to move much farther away. Then gas prices started to rise and commuting so far became unsustainable. So many of them left to take lower-paying fast-food jobs nearer to where they lived. These jobs had fewer benefits and little opportunity for upward mobility. But what choice did they have? They had to manage their short-term budget pressures, even when it meant giving up jobs with brighter long-term prospects.\n\nAnd here again, these individual choices bubble up to firms. Their strategic decisions about where to locate, expand, and invest are shaped by the projected availability of workers, especially skilled ones. As they plan for their future, declining school enrollments will factor into all of these decisions.\n\nIn other words, persistently high inflation is painful and it’s disruptive. It seeps into everything, including investment, production, and growth. Over time, it accumulates into a mountain of misallocations and lost opportunities. And it adds up to a smaller economic pie for all.\n\nAnd this is why price stability is so crucial. It allows households and businesses to make decisions based on preferences, ideas, drive, and talent and lays the foundation for sustainable growth and durable expansion now and in the future. Price stability is like an asset that pays dividends year after year. And protecting it supports everyone.\n\nReturning to Two Percent\n\nThe question of course, is how?\n\nNavigating the economy toward a more sustainable path necessitates higher interest rates and a downshift in the pace of economic activity and the labor market. But for now, inducing a deep recession does not seem warranted by conditions, nor is it necessary to achieve our goals.\n\nAvoiding this kind of harsh recession will not be easy, but we must try.\n\nTwo Mandates, One Goal\n\nThe enduring lesson of my childhood is that people need both jobs and stable prices. That is why the dual mandate is not a choice between two desirable things. It is a balance meant to deliver on a singular goal—a sustainable and expanding economy that works for everyone.\n\nThat is the foundation of economic security. And that is what the Federal Reserve is working to achieve.\n\nThank you.\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\nAltonji, Joseph G., Lisa B. Kahn, and Jamin D. Speer. 2016. “Cashier or Consultant?

        "content": "A few weeks ago, I met a young man with a warehouse job. He was worried. He shared that he had just called in sick to his employer. When I asked him if it was COVID, he told me no. He just couldn’t afford the gas that day and still manage to pay his rent.\n\nNow it would be of little consolation to him to learn that much of the inflation we see today is driven by supply chain bottlenecks or the ongoing war in Ukraine. Nor would he be relieved to learn that excess demand, supported by fiscal and monetary policy aid and a robust recovery, were to blame. All he and so many others want to know is, when will this end?\n\nSo, let me start by saying here what I said to him: Bringing inflation down is the Federal Reserve’s number one priority right now. And we have the tools and the will to do it.\n\nBut we actually want to do more than that. We want to bring inflation down without crippling growth and stalling the labor market.\n\nAfterall that is the dual mandate. Our job is to ensure that Americans everywhere have opportunities to earn a living and the confidence that the living they earn will hold its value.\n\nSo today, I will talk about how we can achieve that. But first, let me remind you that the views I share are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\n\nEvolving Risks\n\nTo understand the path going forward, we first need to understand how we arrived here. So, let’s start there.\n\nThe earliest signs of rising inflation pressures came in the spring of 2021. At that time, overall inflation was running below the Fed‘s 2 percent target, as it had been for over a decade.\n\nBut conditions were changing. Fiscal and monetary policy support were charging through the system, boosting demand for a variety of goods. At the same time, COVID was still ravaging supply chains, disrupting production and distribution, and leaving accumulated backlogs for a range of products.\n\nThe challenges were apparent. Consumers were robustly purchasing goods, while suppliers were having trouble making and delivering them. And as we would expect, price pressures emerged.\n\nIn other words, at that time the risk landscape on future inflation was decidedly two-sided. We could act preemptively to stave off the potential for broadening price pressures only to find inflation once again too low, or we could wait until the path of inflation was clearer and find ourselves with inflation too high.\n\nThe Power of Communicating\n\nThe evolving landscape meant that monetary policy had to pivot. And it had to do so quickly.\n\nBut just as the risks facing the economy have evolved, so has our policy approach, which can respond more nimbly now to incoming data than it could in the past.\n\nFor example, in the fall of last year, as incoming information confirmed that persistent and broad price pressures were forming, FOMC participants signaled that the future path of policy would likely be tighter. The December FOMC statement and the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) moved sharply relative to previous releases, projecting an earlier date of liftoff and a faster pace of rate hikes than previously anticipated. At the same time, we communicated that the balance sheet would adjust accordingly.\n\nFollowing this forward guidance and prior to any actual movements in the funds rate, yields on Treasuries across all durations rose, and rates in other markets followed suit. Mortgage rates, for example, started an ascent that currently puts them at their highest levels in a decade.\n\nWhile adjustments in financial markets after FOMC communications are not unusual, the speed and magnitude of the movements during the past six months have been unprecedented, as the figure shows.\n\nThe fact that financial conditions and real activity are adjusting to expected monetary policy tightening, even when actual rates have not fully risen, means that long and variable lags may not be as long, or variable, as typically assumed. And that supports policy nimbleness, allowing monetary policy to be tighter than the actual level of the Fed Funds rate would suggest.\n\nBut guidance requires action. And here is how I see that work evolving.\n\nFrom Risks to Realities\n\nJust as 2021 required navigating a broad range of possible outcomes, policymaking now is also about managing risks. If supply continues to fall short and inflation remains high, we will need to do more. If conditions improve and supply bounces back, we can do less.\n\nRegardless of which path we take, there will likely be some slowing in the economy. That’s how monetary policy works. We remove accommodation or adjust rates into more restrictive territory, and growth slows and the labor market cools.\n\nThe question is: how much economic slowing are we likely to see? Here, history gives us some useful reference points.\n\nOne is the Great Inflation of the 1960s and ’70s and the subsequent Volcker disinflation, which, by the mid-1980s, had brought inflation down from its double-digit peak. But it came at a very high cost, pushing the economy into what was then the most severe recession since the Great Depression.\n\nFor a number of reasons, I expect our economic transition now to look more like the mid-1990s than like the 1970’s Great Inflation and subsequent painful disinflation. That’s because many of the factors that helped fuel the Great Inflation are not as prominent today.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is also different than it was back then. We are a far more transparent institution now. We regularly share our views about the economy, our goals, and our expected policy path. This tells markets and the public more generally what we are thinking and how we are likely to react as the economy changes. This consistent communication has helped keep longer run inflation expectations anchored despite persistent months of high inflation readings. It also has allowed us to respond to evolving data more nimbly and influence the behavior of financial markets and the economy more quickly.\n\nFinally, conditions in the economy are quite different now than they were in the Great Inflation. There is a sizeable amount of excess demand in both product and labor markets, supported by COVID related fiscal and monetary policy. This translates into large, accumulated back orders for goods and historically high job vacancies in the labor market. Adjusting rates to slow the economy will most likely reduce these backlogs and high job vacancies before digging into current production and employment.\n\nIn its extreme form, this implies that policy adjustments to lower inflation will be cost free. While I think that scenario is highly unlikely, I do expect the costs of adjustment to be moderate, with some slowing of GDP growth below its longer-run trend and an increase in the unemployment rate from the very low levels we see today.\n\nThis would, to my mind, constitute a relatively smooth transition from a pandemic-wracked, highly accommodative economy to one in which tighter policy supports both full employment and price stability.\n\nThat is the future that I am working toward.\n\nCommitment\n\nCreating that future will not be easy. Some have called it a narrow path.\n\nBut we know the direction we need to head, we understand the risks we face, and we have the tools to respond to a range of conditions however they emerge.\n\nMost importantly, we have the will to act. Not just for this moment, but also for similar events in the future. Always recognizing that our decisions affect every American and no one should have to choose between fueling up to get to work and paying rent to keep their home.\n\nThank you.\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\nBasu, Susanto, and John G.

        "content": "Thank you for that kind introduction.  I’m so happy to be here and honored to be part of your celebration.\n\nSpeaking of celebrating, before I get started, I would like all the graduates—and only the graduates—to give yourselves a big round of applause.  This is a special day, and I want each of you to take in its meaningfulness.  For everyone else—family, friends, professors, university leaders—these graduates are our future and I stand with you in looking forward to what they will do.\n\nNow the last time I sat where you are today was 1994, almost 30 years ago.  I was graduating with my Ph.D. from Syracuse University and looking forward to my new life as an economist.  So when I got my first job in the research department at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco I was excited.  And in 2018, when I got the job I have now as president and CEO I was ecstatic.\n\nWhen the job as President became available, I knew I was qualified.  But I also knew the competition would be tough.  After all, the Fed is a storied institution.  Many of the world’s great economists have passed through its doors.  Most of my colleagues arrived from schools like Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Stanford—pedigrees that could be intimidating.  And now I was competing against hundreds of applicants inside and outside of the Fed with portfolios that I thought could be better than mine.\n\nAnd so, I did what many of us do to stand out:  I wrote a beautiful cover letter.  It was truly a work of art.  It expounded on history, the state of the nation, and how my long list of credentials, accumulated over my career, were meant for an opportunity like this.  One week later when I finished, I proudly showed it to an acquaintance who had experience in hiring.  And she said, “Wow Mary, this letter is amazing.” And then she said, “…but anyone could have written it.”\n\nMy heart sank, but I also knew she was right.  I had written the letter I thought the hiring committee wanted to read.  And I was presenting the person I thought I needed to be to get the job.  A person, in my mind, who bore only an abstract resemblance to the real me.\n\nLet me tell you about the real me:  I grew up in Ballwin, Missouri.  And when I was fifteen, I dropped out of high school. My family was struggling and I thought my time would be better spent earning an income.  So, I cobbled together a schedule of odd jobs.  I worked at a donut shop and at Target, hoping to eventually become a bus driver—stable employment with good income and benefits.  By an unexpected twist of fate, I met someone who encouraged me to get a GED.  Later, I became the first in my family to attend and graduate from college.\n\nThat was my story, and it was—to put it mildly—very different from most of my colleagues and anyone else who had ever held the position I was trying to get.  So I left it out of the letter and focused on credentials and accomplishments and things that made me similar rather than different.\n\nAnd it wasn’t the first time I had done this.  In my early years at the Fed, I felt the need to fit into a certain mold.  So, I went shopping.  I bought pearls and skirt suits, even a scoop neck sweater.  Now anyone who knows me, or has even seen me, knows that I’m most comfortable in slacks and a collared shirt, my outfit of choice most days.  But back then, I dressed as the person I thought people wanted to see.  I even tried to style my hair a certain way.  I worked to become economist Mary, rather than just Mary.\n\nBut that mindset spread and began to permeate everything.  In conversations with colleagues, I was careful not to veer into topics that were too personal.  I tried not to reveal too much of my background.  I kept things focused on work, job, and contribution, all with the view that people can’t judge what they don’t know.\n\nPretending, as it turns out, is exhausting.  It is also hugely limiting.  I was sitting on a mountain of experience that gave me unique insight into how the economy functions.  As a kid from Missouri, I witnessed firsthand how people get left behind—fall through the cracks—and the lasting impact, generations out, that this can have on families.  I saw the toll that poverty takes and the stress people feel when they don’t have opportunities.  But I never talked about it.  And so on the outside I looked like everyone else. I had become Mary the economist with a job as a researcher, instead of Mary from Missouri with a GED.\n\nThe irony of course, is that no one actually asked me to play a role.  I had done this to myself. And when I started to understand that, I started to change. Gradually. Little by little, I shed the pearls and the skirts.  I let my hair be wild.  I even agreed to a profile story in a major news outlet that revealed personal details about my past.\n\nGetting the space to be myself was a remarkable gift.  I felt newly at ease, and that ease translated into opportunities.  By being open and me—all of me—I attracted people with diverse ideas.  I connected my experiences with my research and found capacity that I didn’t know I had. I became so much better at my job.  But mostly I found fortitude and confidence from aligning my inner with my outer self.  Mary with a GED who also had a Ph.D. And perhaps unsurprisingly, my career took off.\n\nWhich brings me back to 2018, 20 years after I stopped wearing pearls, applying for the top job at the bank where I had built my career, and here I was back to my old habits.  Once again, playing a role.  Back to being the Mary that I thought people wanted.\n\nSo, I re-wrote the letter.  But this time, I leaned into my story.  I talked about my life growing up in Ballwin, MO, the eldest of four siblings, in a family with challenges, and how those experiences helped me understand the responsibility of institutions and the honor of serving others.  I also talked about dignity and the importance of the economy in creating and sustaining opportunities for everyone.  I wrote it in two hours.  And no one else could have written it.  And when I hit send, I felt absolutely terrified.\n\nOf course, we all know how the story ends.  Six months and many interviews later, I got the job—not in spite of where I came from, but, in part, because of it.  And I relearned what I’d learned many times before.  Difference, my difference, is a virtue, not a weakness.\n\nAnd this brings me to the time in my speech where I very much want to impart some lasting wisdom.  A philosophy for how to live your life and accomplish your dreams.  It’s simple:  “Be yourself.” “Stay true to who you are.” This is good advice.  You should do those things.  But the truth is, you probably already know that.\n\nWhat you might not know—what I have learned over the course of my 30-year career—is that being yourself isn’t a switch that you can simply turn on. It’s a journey of discovery, and it’s one that you will have to take over and over again.\n\nThroughout your lives and career, you will likely lose yourself here and there.  You will drift away from the person you know you are.  You may feel out of sorts or like you don’t fit in.  And you may want to hide. And in those times, you very well might do as I have done, and take refuge behind a mask of your own making. And that’s okay.  It’s part of being human.\n\nThere is safety in conformity.  Being yourself, especially when yourself is different from others, can feel risky.  It leaves all of us feeling vulnerable and exposed. But as you embark on your careers—as you stretch for new things and find yourself in unfamiliar places—find your way back, return to the core of who you are.  That is the place from which your greatness will grow.\n\nYou are the sum total of every experience, every triumph, and every hardship that you have endured.  And this singular equation is your superpower.  It is the secret combination that unlocks your innate talents and sets you apart from every other person you meet.  It is what makes your letter uniquely yours.\n\nAnd so, class of 2022: what will your letter say?\n\nMy wish for you is that it will say the things you are most afraid to reveal.  That these revelations will upend assumptions about who belongs where.  That your bravery will fly in the face of the worry and fear and all of the other emotions that arise when we strive for something more.  And most of all, I hope your letter will be unmistakably, unapologetically, you.\n\nAnd to that you, I say:  Congratulations on this momentous achievement of your graduation.  I cannot wait to see what amazing things you will do."

        "content": "Good morning.\n\nI am thrilled to be back in Las Vegas. But even more than that, I’m thrilled to see that Las Vegas is back. I saw this at the airport and driving around town yesterday. And I also heard it from the civic, business, and community leaders we met. Nevada is thriving, growing, and moving enthusiastically toward a post-pandemic world.\n\nAnd this is true for the economy as a whole. After two years of pandemic-related economic challenges, signs of health are everywhere. The job market is robust, household and business balance sheets are strong, and consumer and business sentiments are solid, despite the war in Ukraine and rising prices at the gas pump.\n\nOf course, everyone agrees that inflation is too high. Across the country, Americans are waking up and going to bed worried about whether their incomes will keep up with the rising cost of rent, food, and fuel. Businesses are also worried, some thinking twice about committing to long-term contracts that may become too costly to fulfill if prices continue to rise. Put simply, households and businesses are feeling the pain and asking when things will get better.\n\nSo today, I will spend my time discussing inflation and how monetary policy has and will adjust to bring it down and put the economy back on a sustainable path. But before I get started, let me remind you that the views I will share today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\n\nFocusing on Inflation\n\nThe key insight of the dual mandate is that both sides matter. It was critical to assist the economy in recovering the job losses that occurred early in the pandemic, and it is now critical to stem what has been a longer-than-expected run of high inflation.\n\nThe question is how to do that smoothly. And to determine that, we have to understand how we got here.\n\nThe simple answer is COVID. Lockdowns early in the pandemic, transportation issues, and labor shortages constrained the supply of many goods. And these supply disruptions fell largely outside the scope of policy. After all, policymakers can do little to get more cars to the lot or more appliances into stores.\n\nIn contrast, we have a range of tools to help people buy what they need. And these tools were deployed to help households sustain while we fought the pandemic. For those who lost their incomes, fiscal policy provided a lifeline. To bolster growth and employment, monetary policy turned accommodative. These measures helped sustain consumer spending and get people through the worst of the crisis.\n\nSince high inflation was initially caused by the pandemic and our responses to it, the expectation has been that it will recede as COVID does. The problem is that, while COVID has abated, it has not disappeared. We can more easily do things like go out for dinner, travel, and see a movie. But countries and firms managing new variants and rising caseloads have not been able to return to full production. So, supply chain disruptions have lingered. And the war in Ukraine has further pressured supply, especially for energy, food, and other critical commodities.\n\nThis is a history no one wants to repeat. And it’s why the Fed is taking actions today, far earlier than in the 1970s, to tighten policy, rebalance demand and supply, and ensure that both of our dual mandate goals are achieved.\n\nThe obvious next question is, how will we get there?\n\nHow We Get There Matters\n\nThe truth is, there is a hard way and an easier way.\n\nTo see what I mean, imagine you’re in a car. You’re driving along the highway and you spot a hazard up ahead. At this point, you know you need to slow down. One way to do it is to slam hard on the brakes. You’ll achieve your goal, but you and your passengers will probably suffer in the process. You might jerk forward in your seat or spill coffee on your lap. That’s the hard way. The better way is to purposefully and smoothly decelerate. You avoid the danger, and you spare yourself and others the whiplash. Most importantly, you get to continue your trip.\n\nI think we can all agree that this is good driving. But it is also good policymaking. If we slam the brakes on the economy by adjusting rates too quickly or too much, we risk forcing unnecessary adjustments by businesses and households, potentially tipping the economy into recession. If we ease on the brakes by methodically removing accommodation and regularly assessing how much more is needed, we have a good chance of transitioning smoothly and gliding the economy to its long-run sustainable path.\n\nFor many reasons, this is not my modal outlook. First, the conditions we face today are very different from the 1970s. For one thing, current high inflation readings have a clear catalyst—the pandemic. Moreover, the duration of rising prices has been far shorter—a year, rather than a decade. And in stark contrast to the 1970s, longer-run inflation expectations have remained stable.\n\nThis bullishness likely reflects the strong underlying momentum in the U.S. economy, as well as the public’s confidence that, even as rates rise and the economy slows, growth and the labor market will remain solid.\n\nBut this will take work. And let me turn to that next.\n\nNavigating Policy Out of the Pandemic\n\nAs I have noted, the inflation outlook combined with a strong labor market leave no doubt that further policy tightening is appropriate. The question is, how much and how quickly?\n\nLet’s start with how much. The first step is to remove the accommodation that we provided during the pandemic. That means raising the federal funds rate to its neutral level, which most forecasters put at around 2.5 percent in nominal terms. We started that journey in March with a 25-basis-point rate increase, so we still have significant work to do. Moving purposefully to a more neutral stance that does not stimulate the economy is the top priority.\n\nAnd this is where the question of timing comes in. How quickly should we get there? Accounting for the risks of being too fast or too slow, I see an expeditious march to neutral by the end of the year as a prudent path. We will continue to evaluate the data and the risks, but today I see little indication that the economy needs policy accommodation.\n\nThere is the uncertainty about COVID. While it feels like our recovery from the pandemic is gaining traction here in the United States, China and other global producers are in the midst of another wave of lockdowns to manage outbreaks. This makes it hard to declare victory on the pandemic or to be comfortable about the projected recovery of supply chains.\n\nAll of this means that it’s hard to fully know what next year will look like. Will we be in a world where supply chains have healed, inflation has come down, and policy can remain close to neutral? Or will we be in a world where disruptions remain, inflation persists, and monetary policy must further adjust to restrain the economy, balance supply and demand, and return inflation to our price stability objective? The data will tell us over the course of this year, and we will be prepared to respond when it does.\n\nBut no matter what happens next year, that will not be the end of our work. The Fed’s overarching job is to foster a long and durable expansion that delivers both full employment and price stability. We need to calibrate policy to get back on that path. We need to manage the economic headwinds immediately in front of us. But we also need to lay the groundwork for the economy we want in the future. A truly smooth transition does both.\n\nGo Smooth to Go Far\n\nLet me leave you with a story that illustrates my approach to policymaking and how I will navigate the challenges ahead. As a teenager, I worked at a donut shop. Part of my job was to drive a delivery truck. I drove the long-distance route at night, when traffic was sparse. As you might expect, I sometimes went a little too fast. And as you also might expect, that didn’t turn out too well. I wound up losing my license for three weeks—which, to me, felt like a lifetime.\n\nThat youthful mistake taught me a valuable lesson. Getting there is important. But so is the journey. In my attempt to get there quickly, I actually didn’t get there at all. Though I didn’t know it at the time, I had taken the hard way.\n\nBut we don’t have to. A smooth and methodical approach to policy will alert us to hazards along the way, prepare us for unexpected bumps in the road, and ultimately keep us moving forward—not just to our immediate destination, but to all of the destinations that follow.\n\nThank you.\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\nCoibion, Olivier, and Yuriy Gorodnichenko. 2015. “Is the Phillips Curve Alive and Well After All?

        "content": "Thank you, Andrew. Let me begin by saying welcome to everyone. Good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening, from wherever you’re viewing. I extend a very warm welcome to you. My only disappointment about this conference is that we’re not in person, but hopefully next year will either be in person or hybrid. For now, we will continue virtually and continue to do the important work of this conference.\n\nI’d like to take a moment to say why this event is so important to us. We’ve been hosting this conference for a very long time. And in each of the years I’ve attended, which is now more than I can count, we do the same thing. We bring in cutting edge researchers, research, and policymakers to have a dialogue and a productive discussion about the problems that face us as central banks, as nations, and as societies. And today will be no departure from that.\n\nWe are delighted to have a terrific program, but also to have Deputy Governor Sharon Kozicki from the Bank of Canada talk about some of the things that she and the Bank of Canada are facing, and actually central banks across the globe as we make monetary policy.\n\nNow, when I think about the challenges of central banking right now, they’re easy to enumerate, but hard to grasp. So, we start with coming out of a pandemic where central banks offered extraordinary support, along with fiscal agents, to get as many people through the pandemic as possible. And, while in many countries, we’re hoping that we’re moving from pandemic to endemic, we only have to look at parts of Asia to realize that we’re not there yet. So, we still have to grapple with those things and think about how to best support our economies. And at the same time, we have a devastating war in the Ukraine. I would be remiss if I didn’t start by extending my heartfelt sympathy to the Ukrainian people and all the suffering that they’re enduring. But it also affects the economy. It creates uncertainty, it creates challenges in supply chains for commodities, and it puts additional pressure on inflation, which is too high. Higher than most policymakers have as their target for price stability. And that’s true across the globe. But in the United States, we’re at a 40-year high. People are thinking about inflation when they go to bed at night and when they wake up in the morning, and that’s far from our target for price stability.\n\nAnd then, of course, we have things that typically get called existential threats, but I don’t think they’re existential. We’re seeing them already. And that is threats to our climate, and how it will not just threaten our physical environment, but also change the allocation of production. Change the pricing for assets, all things that will matter as we try to craft policy going forward. We also have inequality. Generations of economists have documented this, but we’re starting to ask better questions about inequality, moving from what I was taught, which is just a scoring of well-being, and how certain people aren’t doing as well as others. But we’re asking fundamentally how much inequality we can endure and still have an economy that’s sustainable and works for everyone.\n\nThese are all big questions that both monetary policymakers and fiscal agents have to think about, that we as societies have to think about. And so our program today is very well suited, as it has been historically, for asking and answering the questions that we face. We’ll have a couple of papers on inflation and what’s driving it. And we’re going to have an important paper on climate and another important paper on inequality. And when you think about those things, this is what the conference is about. It’s about bringing us together, taking on the challenges that we face, and asking and answering these questions with evidence, thoughts, and paradigms that help us do better and make our policy better.\n\nSo with that, I will say that I’m really looking forward to the day. I would be remiss not to thank the conference organizers. I’d like to thank from the San Francisco Fed Andrew Foerster, Huiyu Li, Fernanda Nechio and Nicolas Petrosky-Nadeau, who have put the program together and carry the tradition of bringing together the best research with policymaking in a way that will be a robust dialogue.\n\nAnd I finally have to thank Margaret Cliver, who works behind the scenes to make all of this possible so that we can have our dialogue. Without Margaret, none of this would happen. So thank you, Margaret, for all the work you do. Thank you to the conference organizers and Deputy Governor Kozicki for coming and to all the researchers here presenting your work. I look forward to an exciting day and I’m appreciative of everything that all of you do. With that, I’ll turn it back to Andrew to start the morning session."

        "content": "It’s hard to believe it’s been almost two years since COVID-19 hit our shores. And while it’s not fully behind us, we’ve come a long way, especially in the economy. Growth is up.  Unemployment is down. And people are getting back to their lives.\n\nBut as anyone who has shopped, bought gas, or paid rent lately knows, inflation is high—higher than it has been in nearly four decades.\n\nFor some, this is a sign that price stability is at risk. That, absent aggressive action by the Fed, the economy will be propelled into a 1970s-style “Great Inflation.”\n\nLike many of you, I lived through that time. I remember my parents’ daily complaints about rising prices and rising bills, and the hours-long waits at gas stations in the hot Missouri sun, stuck to the vinyl seats of our station wagon.\n\nHigh and rising inflation made life harder. And there was no end in sight.\n\nBut the picture today looks different. And so does the Federal Reserve. We have evolved as an institution, and our understanding and tools have evolved as well. I’ll spend my time today talking about how this evolution makes us better prepared to meet our dual mandate goals of price stability and full employment, even in these challenging times.\n\nFirst, I want to remind you that the views I will express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThen…\n\nBefore I talk about what’s different this time, let me talk about what exactly happened during the “Great Inflation.” What was it like?\n\nPeople wondered how it had happened.\n\nThe first has to do with fundamental economic changes and our inability back then to measure and understand them in real time.\n\nBut the story doesn’t end there. The Fed’s policy misses were amplified and perpetuated by institutional factors and by its own communication strategy.\n\nWhen two oil price shocks created even higher inflation, prices and wages grew in near lockstep. And here is where the Fed’s own communication practices exacerbated things.\n\nBecause of this, the Fed operated largely behind closed doors. The public became aware of Fed policy actions by watching how markets reacted following Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. And the main source of information that market participants, households, and businesses had about the Fed’s commitment to price stability was what they could glean from incoming inflation data.\n\nThe result was predictable.\n\nAnd you can see it in this figure. The green and blue lines show two measures of actual inflation and the red line shows inflation expectations.\n\nBefore long, inflation dynamics and future inflation were deeply intertwined with inflation psychology. And with the Fed offering little guidance or reassurance that it would do something about it, the situation snowballed.\n\nIt wasn’t until the Fed implemented a series of steep interest rate hikes that inflation finally started to recede.\n\n…Now\n\nNow inflation is high again and many are concerned that we could soon be facing another long and painful period, followed by another long and painful correction.\n\nBut that’s not what I see. Let me explain.\n\nYou’ve heard many, including me, talk about how inflation itself is different this time. It’s been pushed up by pandemic-related imbalances between policy-supported demand, which has remained robust, and COVID-disrupted supply, which has been slow to recover. Both of these factors should recede as the pandemic weakens its grip.\n\nBut these are not the differences that matter most. The main reason I’m confident we are not heading for another 1970s-style Great Inflation is that the Federal Reserve is different. And I’m not referring to the people of the Fed, who clearly have changed, but to the practices and beliefs, which have changed even more.\n\nActing on this insight required a radical transformation. The Fed had to break open its “black box” of decision-making and embrace transparency.\n\nTo understand the magnitude of this transformation, you have to recall that, for most of its history, the Fed was uncommunicative.\n\nAs the figure illustrates, the Fed went from being mostly silent to explicitly and intentionally transparent.\n\nThe effects of these efforts can be seen in the data.\n\nThis tells us that businesses and markets are listening. They’re hearing the Fed’s communications and believe that we will act on our commitments.\n\nMost importantly, greater transparency and a strong commitment to achieving our goals assures Americans that periods of high inflation or unemployment will not last forever; that there is an end in sight.\n\nFocused and Aware\n\nBut transparency is not a destination, it’s a practice. And it requires ongoing communication if we are to keep the credibility that we so value.\n\nIn that spirit, let me tell you about how I see the economy today and the policy adjustments that will be needed to move us to a sustainable path.\n\nLet’s start with the economy. By almost any measure, it is doing well. GDP growth, consumer spending, and business investment are all up, and the labor market continues to post solid job gains, low unemployment, and strong wage growth. Importantly, labor market gains have been broad based, occurring for a wide range of groups, including those who are traditionally disadvantaged—African Americans, Hispanics, and people with less than a college education.\n\nThis means it is time to move away from the extraordinary support that the Fed has been providing during the pandemic and bring monetary policy in line with the challenges of today. Absent any significant negative surprises, I see our next meeting, in March, as the appropriate time to begin this adjustment.\n\nThe timing and magnitude of future funds rate and balance sheet adjustments will depend on how the economy and the data evolve. And this will depend on how well we transition from pandemic to endemic; how much and how quickly supply chains recover; how rapidly workers sidelined by health, family care, or other COVID-related barriers return to the labor force; and how quickly the fiscal boost that aided spending in 2020 and 2021 fades. We will closely watch all of these developments and let the data determine the appropriate path of policy.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the next few years will require focused awareness; focus on bringing inflation back down to levels consistent with price stability and delivering a labor market that works for everyone; and awareness, of the uncertainty that lies ahead and the challenges that are surely before us.\n\nDifferent Never Rests\n\nThat for me is the main lesson of the Great Inflation. It’s not really about the Fed. It’s not even really about economics.\n\nIt’s about humility.\n\nIt’s about knowing that ours is an economy in transition. And that none of us knows for sure what the new future holds.\n\nWe need to move forward with confidence—in our policy, in our tools, and in the credibility the Fed has built. But we also have to remember that evolution isn’t static. And to meet the needs of a constantly changing economy, we have to be constantly changing.\n\nToday’s Federal Reserve looks different than it did 50 years ago. And I expect that it will look different again in 50 more.\n\nAnd that will be a good thing. It will mean the evolution continued. And that next time will also be different.\n\nThank you.\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\nBasu, Susanto, and John G.
