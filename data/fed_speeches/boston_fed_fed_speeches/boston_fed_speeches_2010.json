        "content": "Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce Providence, Rhode Island\nThank you for inviting me to speak with you here in Providence. Over the past 25 years or so, my family and I have followed and enjoyed the rebirth that happened in Providence - from trying some of the great downtown restaurants to occasionally taking in the WaterFire celebration.\nHowever, I have also witnessed what has happened to many Rhode Island communities over the past three years, as a result of the recession. Rhode Island has suffered to an even larger extent than the rest of New England. Despite the downtown rebirth I mentioned, unfortunately a drive today through Providence includes some empty storefronts and foreclosure signs.\nSo, it is particularly appropriate to be in Rhode Island to discuss what national monetary policy is doing to address economic problems, here and around the country. [Note]\nThere has been a great deal of attention paid to the monetary policy actions that were initiated by the Federal Reserve at the last Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. There has been much commentary, from a wide range of observers, on our decision to pursue large scale asset purchases. Given the intensity of the public debate, I have decided to take a somewhat different approach today than I usually do in my talks. Today I am going to do my best to answer the five questions I most often hear about these recent monetary policy actions in my conversations and meetings around New England.\n[Slide 2] Question 1 is, Why was policy changed at the November FOMC meeting?\nBefore we look at the data, I'll preview my answer. The policy change we at the Fed just announced was consistent with the central bank's mandate, given how far the national economy is from our gauges of health.\nCongress, which created the Federal Reserve in 1913, has provided significant guidance over the years on what should be our primary areas of focus. Unlike some foreign central banks that only have one target - price stability - the Federal Reserve has been tasked with pursuing the lowest possible unemployment rate consistent with price stability. So we refer to a \"dual mandate,\" meaning both maximum employment and stable prices.\nMembers of the Federal Open Market Committee or FOMC - the presidents of the Reserve Banks and the members of the Board of Governors in Washington - all provide quarterly estimates of where we expect inflation and unemployment to be in the long-run. We can consider those long-run estimates to reflect what members see as achieving our dual mandate for price stability and maximum sustainable employment. According to past submissions, most members expect that inflation is likely to settle close to 2 percent and that the unemployment rate is likely to settle between 5 and 6 percent, in the long run.\nObviously the national economy is quite some distance from those long-run targets. And in places like Rhode Island, the gap is even larger. From a national perspective, Figure 1 highlights that the unemployment rate, which is currently 9.6 percent, has been well above that 5 to 6 percent range for some time, as a result of the long recession. Most of this unemployment likely reflects the dramatic decline in demand for goods and services that characterized the recession. With inadequate demand leading to very high unemployment rates, one would generally expect that such a large gap (in relation to the long-run target) would yield a strong bias towards more accommodative monetary policy.\nTurning to the stable prices side of our dual mandate, Figure 2 shows that core inflation has fallen quite significantly. The core consumer price index or CPI, which had been above 2 percent before the recession, is now below 1 percent. With the current amount of slack in the labor markets, it is certainly possible that inflation could fall further. Thus, on inflation we are also far from where we want and expect to be in the longer run - and we are continuing to experience disinflationary pressures. Again, such a large gap on the inflation side of our mandate should provide a strong bias towards more accommodative monetary policy.\nIn short you see unemployment close to double the mandate-consistent target, and inflation about half of what we consider consistent with price stability.\nStill, an argument against further monetary easing could be made if one thought the economy was about to take off. But are things about to turn, or turning now - as some suggest? Unfortunately, recent data have not been particularly encouraging. Figure 3 shows that GDP (shown in blue) grew by only 2 percent in the third quarter. Even less encouraging is the fact that final sales (shown in green) - which is a better measure of demand for our products, since it excludes inventory investment from the GDP number - was quite anemic in the third quarter, and indeed growth in final sales has been falling over the past four quarters. As I have noted in prior talks, we are likely to need four to five years of relatively strong growth (above \"potential\" ) to bring the unemployment rate down significantly (to a rate consistent with \"full employment\" [Footnote 1]).\nFurthermore, Figure 4 shows that the growth in final sales from the low point of the recession (shown in the dark line extending out five quarters) has been quite weak, and certainly in the weak camp among previous recessions. With these doubts as to the strength of final sales shown in the data, one has to question the likelihood that, other things equal, the economy will grow fast enough to significantly reduce the unemployment rate in an acceptable timeframe and reduce these disinflationary pressures.\nWith both employment and inflation falling short of the long-run expectations that reflect the Fed's mandate, one would expect additional accommodative monetary policy. However, with the federal funds rate close to zero, the Fed's usual policy tool could not be utilized. However, monetary policy can still be conducted. The asset-purchase policy announced at the November FOMC meeting was in my view strongly consistent with our dual mandate from Congress - in other words, the pursuit of maximum sustainable employment and stable prices.\nStill, some have argued very forcefully that we should not have taken further action. This leads to the second question.\n[Slide 7]\nQuestion 2 is, What is the likely cost of not changing monetary policy?\nAgain, as we turn to the evidence, let me sum up my answer to this important and at times overlooked question. Not changing policy risked further disinflation, a rise in the real cost of funds tantamount to monetary tightening, and risks of continued and possibly worsening pain in labor markets. Allow me to explain.\nFigure 5 highlights how severe the recession has been, in terms of output. We saw dramatic declines in GDP in the United States (the black line), but the chart shows that many other countries experienced an even more severe decline in output, and for some countries it is not clear they have reached their recession trough as yet. Particularly in Europe, where some countries have had sovereign debt problems and significant fiscal austerity, the output decline is striking.\nWhile that chart shows that in fact the impact on output was lesser in the U.S. than in many countries,Figure 6shows that the impact on labor markets here in the U.S. has been more severe than in most countries; in fact, only severely distressed Spain and Ireland have seen a bigger effect on employment. The U.S., again shown by the black line, is still well below the peak employment of prior to the onset of the recession, and the decline has been more significant than in many other countries. Firms in the U.S. moved particularly aggressively to cut jobs, particularly as the recession deepened in the aftermath of financial problems in the fall of 2008.\nFigure 7 shows one of the problems with labor markets remaining extremely weak for a protracted period. The percent of jobless workers who have been unemployed for 27 weeks or more is over 40 percent. This is much higher than in recent recessions, as you can see in the shaded recession sections of the chart. In fact, it is the highest reading on record for this series.\nLong periods of unemployment can have particularly corrosive effects. Not only do people have to deplete their savings, but unfortunately long-term unemployed job-seekers can find it quite difficult to re-enter the workforce - because skills may atrophy and because hiring firms may shun those who have been unemployed for a long time.\nIn short, there are real and significant long-term costs to individuals and the economy when the unemployment rate remains stubbornly high.\nAllow me to walk you through the next couple of charts, which highlight that it can be costly to not do anything to counteract further disinflation. As those of you in this room know, many economic decisions are influenced by the real cost of borrowing. Figure 8 gives us a historical perspective, going back to 1980, comparing in the top chart the short-term federal funds rate and the inflation rate. The bottom chart shows what you get when you put the two together - the real federal funds rate resulting from the effective rate minus the change in the core CPI.\nIf we simply narrow the time frame of the chart, as in Figure 9, we see clearly that if short-term interest rates are fixed - say at about the zero bound, as now - but the inflation rate declines, then the real interest rate actually increases. You see this in the red line on the bottom chart. As a result, a decline in the inflation rate when interest rates are fixed amounts to monetary tightening. Given the state of the economy, a monetary contraction right now is both unintended and undesirable. So we want to prevent any further disinflation - not only because it gets us closer to a harmful deflationary situation, but also because it represents a monetary tightening when conditions are indicating that further accommodation is desirable.\nIf the federal funds rate was not close to zero right now, the arguments for reducing it - that is, for easing in monetary policy - would be quite strong. However, the federal funds rate is quite close to zero. And this leads us to the third question.\n[Slide 13]\nQuestion 3 is, How Different are large scale asset purchases (LSAPs) from traditional monetary policy?\nBefore we look at the data, I'll preview my answer to this question. Are large-scale asset purchases a fundamentally different policy, either in intent and mechanics? The answer is no, LSAPs are much closer to traditional monetary policy than many commentators assume. We simply move in other markets than the federal funds market. And, like traditional monetary policy actions, we're not talking about \"bailouts\" or stimulus spending or placing a debt burden on future generations. Let me explain.\nIn more normal times when the FOMC wants to ease monetary policy, we buy Treasury bills and, in paying the sellers for them[Footnote 2], we create additional bank reserves. By making more reserves available to the banking system, we ease conditions in the overnight market for funds - the federal funds market - so the primary impact of these purchases is a reduction in the federal funds rate. But more importantly for the economy, we expect the reduction in the funds rate to over time translate into declines in mortgage rates, corporate bond rates, exchange rates, and a rise in stock prices - all of which of course help stimulate economic activity.\nNow that the federal funds rate is near zero and the reserves in the system are quite large, the usual course is not an option. Instead of relying on the indirect effects of targeting a lower funds rate, we are opting to more directly affect the interest rates that have the greatest connection to real spending; by buying Treasury bonds and creating additional bank reserves. Since there are already substantial reserves in the system, the primary expected effect is lowering the long rate by purchasing a significant amount of longer-term Treasury bonds. Like conventional policy, one would expect that mortgage and corporate rates will fall, and exchange rates will be impacted, providing additional stimulus to the economy. That is in fact what has already happened, which leads to Question 4.\n[Slide 14]\nQuestion 4 is, What has been the impact of the LSAP to date?\nBefore we explore the data, I'll again share the punch line, which is that these policy actions, like more standard reductions in the federal funds rate, have basically had the expected effects and - despite some short-run volatility as we get under way - should be broadly effective and helpful to the economy going forward.\nStarting with Chairman Bernanke's Jackson Hole speech, the markets have gradually come to expect that more monetary accommodation was likely. As a result, the impact on financial markets of any easing was likely incorporated into prices prior to the actual announcement. The next set of charts highlights that the effects one might expect from a conventional monetary accommodation do indeed seem to have occurred in anticipation of this less-conventional action.[Footnote 3]\nI should note that while longer rates have been trending down as desired, there has been some recent movement up, too. Lots of things affect rates in the marketplace, but I am certain that our purchases over time will contribute to lower rates than we would otherwise be seeing.\nFigure 10 explores inflation expectations, and highlights the fact that the implied inflation rate over the next 10 years as measured by the difference between the 10-year Treasury yield and the 10-year inflation-indexed Treasury yield had fallen to well below 2 percent. As the markets began to anticipate the LSAP program, the implied inflation rate has risen to a little over 2 percent. Thus, the action seems to have convinced market participants that further disinflationary pressures in the U.S. were likely to be resisted by monetary policy.\nFigure 11 shows that corporate bond rates and mortgage rates have fallen over this period, although there has been an uptick over the last couple of days. Lower rates on these instruments will make it easier for firms to finance investments and for home buyers to purchase homes, all other things equal.\nFigure 12 shows that there has been a decline in the U.S. dollar exchange rate. While not a goal of our policies, this should stimulate exports and reduce imports. It is important to re-emphasize that in the U.S., as in any country with a flexible exchange rate system, a modest currency depreciation is the normal consequence of easing monetary policy. By lowering short- and long-term interest rates, investors will, on the margin, seek assets that provide somewhat greater returns than U.S. assets, and in the process, will lower the demand for dollars and depreciate our currency.\nWhile this is an issue that has been passionately discussed in many parts of the globe, I think it is important to note - as shown on Figure 13 - that the current trade weighted exchange rate is really not much different than what it was before the recession. Exchange rates have at times fluctuated for a variety of reasons during this period, including periods of so-called flight to quality that pushed U.S. rates down, and periods of flight from European currencies as a result of some sovereign debt issues - both of which tended to push the dollar up. At the same time, the data show that the Federal Reserve's current monetary accommodation to date has merely helped restore the dollar exchange rate to the level it was three years ago.\nFigure 14 shows that the stock market has generally risen over the last several months, despite some downward movement over the last couple of days. While this is not a targeted goal of our policy, it is an indicator that the combination of lower rates and better economic prospects are being manifested in a rise in stock prices. This increases household wealth for those who own stocks and should provide for somewhat stronger consumption, going forward.\nFigure 15 provides some rough estimates of what the impact of the LSAP easing could be, over time, using the Boston Fed's internal simulation models. While such estimates are by nature quite uncertain, we estimate that the impact could be a reduction in the unemployment rate by the end of 2012 of a little less than half a percent. This would translate into more than 700,000 additional jobs that we would not have had in the absence of this monetary policy action.\nIn short this action, like more standard reductions in the federal funds rate, has broadly speaking had the expected short-run effect and should be helpful going forward. This leads to the final question.\n[Slide 21]\nQuestion 5 is, What are the risks of the current policy?\nThe short answer is that there are - of course - some risks. We should not gloss over them, but neither should we overstate them. I am very confident that they can be managed and are worth taking.\nNormally the Federal Reserve buys primarily short-term securities. By purchasing long-term securities the Federal Reserve is in fact taking on the risk that their value will fall as interest rates rise. The reason is that as interest rates rise above the rates paid on the securities we hold, the lower-rate securities we hold will (not surprisingly) fall in value, as investors favor the higher-rate newer-issue securities. Of course, an environment in which most interest rates were rising would imply an economy where disinflation was no longer a problem, which is one of the macroeconomic outcomes the policy is indeed seeking. But in fact the Fed has a number of options and plenty of flexibility to manage the holdings in the best interests of the economy and taxpayers. We could hold instruments to maturity, or could sell securities of certain maturities. And, of course, interest income will accrue. I believe the most likely net outcome will actually be a benefit to the taxpayer, although that is not the objective of our balance sheet moves (rather, our dual mandate is).\nA second risk arises from the fact that the Treasury market is quite large - much larger than the federal funds market in which we normally operate. While relatively small purchases of securities during normal times can be sufficient to move the federal funds rate, it takes large asset purchases to have a significant impact on a market as large and deep as the Treasury bond market. As a result, this policy requires the Federal Reserve to expand its balance sheet much more than would a traditional monetary easing. Large expansions of the balance sheet can complicate exit strategy, when that becomes appropriate. While the Federal Reserve has a variety of tools designed to tighten policy, either by raising interest on excess reserves, removing reserves, or selling securities, some of these tools have not been used in the past. Naturally this makes the exact impact of various tools somewhat more uncertain than normal. Still, I am very confident of the Fed's ability and will to exit, when necessary.\nA third risk is that these measures have not been conducted in the United States, at least at the current scale. While there are many similarities with typical monetary policy and several other countries (for example Japan and the U.K.) have also been pursuing large scale asset purchases, the lack of recent U.S. historical precedent makes the possibility of unintended consequences higher than with more typical monetary policy actions.\nAnother risk is that we might be too successful in raising inflation. Thus any policy action needs to take care to make clear that the desire is to maintain well-anchored inflation expectations. But this can best be achieved by insuring that inflation does not get too high nor too low.\nFinally, some have argued that the Fed is embarking on a policy of monetizing the federal debt. I would counter that this is a temporary monetary policy action taken to return inflation and unemployment somewhat more quickly than otherwise to levels consistent with our mandate. It is a policy designed to help reduce longer term rates over a fixed period of time, not at all a policy to finance government debt indefinitely. I have noted in previous talks that it is important to provide short-term stimulus, given the current economic situation, but that long-run budget projections are not sustainable and will need to be addressed. It is important to note that large scale asset purchases do not necessarily need to use Treasury-security purchases to stimulate the economy; indeed in our first round we did so with mortgage-backed securities.\nSo all in all there are of course risks to evaluate in light of the current state of the economy and our mandate. We are aware of these risks. I fully expect that we will be able to manage them.\n[Slide 22]\nConcluding Observations\nAs I conclude I would like to reiterate that the actions taken earlier this month are consistent with the important mandates that Congress has set for the Federal Reserve in terms of employment (reflecting growth) and prices. With unemployment so high and inflation unusually low, most models indicate that further monetary accommodation is warranted. In addition, I believe the cost of having high unemployment rates for an extended period of time, or likewise further disinflation, could be quite high and potentially very damaging.\nThe recently announced LSAP program has many similarities with more typical monetary policy actions, but of course there are risks with any policy that we have not had significant experience with. Nonetheless, the initial reactions seem similar to what we would have expected from more typical monetary policy. And the Fed has the tools to minimize its own particular risks.\nIn short, these actions are likely to reduce the unemployment rate and reduce the risk of further disinflation relative to not taking action. This is exactly what I hoped would be the result of the program.\nLet me leave you with an analogy - and a seasonally appropriate one at that. This past weekend, many New Englanders woke up to a lawn full of leaves. Many took out their lawn mower intending to get to work picking up those leaves. When pulling on the starter cord, some no doubt heard the engine sputter and cough. The immediate reaction is to fiddle with the choke switch and give a little more gas to the engine. Once you get the engine started and running smoothly, you still have the task of mowing up all those leaves. But you won't make any progress unless you first get the engine operating. And so it is with monetary policy. Our economy has been faltering and sputtering, so it was necessary to take some steps to get it actually \"running.\" Of course this Fed policy will not solve the economy's problems, just as getting the motor started does not in and of itself take care of the leaves in your yard. Solving the economy's problems will take time and actions by the public and private sectors - but getting the economic engine running is the essential first step to the broader work ahead.\nThank you again for having me join you today. I hope that in the future we will gather under very different and much improved economic circumstances, and I can assure you that we at the Federal Reserve will work diligently towards that end.",

        "highlights": "",
        "content": "Revisiting Monetary Policy in a Low Inflation Environment - Boston, MA\nI'd like to welcome everyone to the second day of our conference. As has been mentioned already, this is in some sense a retrospective. The first conference on monetary policy in a low inflation environment was held in Vermont in October of 1999. I would note that several speakers we will hear from today also provided comments at that gathering 10 years ago, and I am pleased to have them back in New England to see if a decade of relevant data has influenced their thinking on the topic. [Note]\n[Slide 2] At that conference, Alan Blinder was on the policy panel, a place he finds himself again today. He said at the time that it was of some interest that the conference was being held at the U.S. Federal Reserve, and not in Japan or Europe. One might attribute the location to unusually good forecasting prowess evidenced by our Research Director, Jeff Fuhrer, who was actively engaged in organizing the earlier conference as well as this one.\nThe earlier conference took place under very different economic circumstances. It was held in the midst of the period that I believe Jim Stock named \"the Great Moderation,\" reflecting the reduced volatility we were seeing in unemployment and inflation. There was a growing sense of confidence that severe business cycles had been tamed, as policymakers better understood and calibrated fiscal and monetary policy. At the time of the conference, the unemployment rate was 4.1 percent and the core inflation rate was 2.1 percent.[Footnote 1]\nDespite the propitious economic environment at the time, I will say that participants at the conference said quite clearly that monetary policy in a low inflation environment would be quite challenging.\n[Slide 3] Perhaps the best summary of this concern was provided those ten years ago by Kazuo Ueda, who is on the policy panel again this time. His summary of policy when the zero bound was hit was that \"it will be a lot more painful than you can possibly imagine.\" Unfortunately, his comments have been accurate and prophetic - and quoted rather prominently of late.\nPerhaps, as well, they were more true in Japan than anywhere else in the world. At the time of our first conference on this topic, many participants were expecting the Japanese deflation to be quickly eradicated and the country to be \"on the mend.\" Now, more than a decade later, Japan continues to combat deflation with its policy still running up against the zero lower bound.\nOther participants at the earlier conference for the most part viewed Japan as an anomaly, and seemed to think that the likelihood of others ending up in Japan's predicament was quite low. Unfortunately, that probability seems to have shifted, and we now face a world where Japan, Europe, and the U.S. are challenged by the need to conduct monetary policy with short-term interest rates close to zero.\nAll in all, there was some disagreement over how effective alternate policies could be, but there was a sense that there was little reason not to try them, should circumstances merit it.\n[Slide 4] Figure 1 highlights just how different this so-called Great Recession has been. The chart shows the percent employment change from the peak of employment in post-war recessions. The scale of the job loss during this recession, shown by the black line, is sobering.\n[Slide 5] Another feature of this Great Recession involves the significant difficulties within financial institutions and financial markets, and the contributions of those difficulties to the economic downturn. While at the earlier conference there was due concern about the banking and financial systems, I think it fair to say that the role that financial institutions and markets can play in aggravating the business cycle was not fully appreciated. A challenge that remains is how best to incorporate financial market developments in our economic models, as much of the modeling only rather poorly captures the role of financial intermediation.\n[Slide 6] It goes without saying that the circumstances surrounding this conference are very different than those of ten years ago. Unfortunately at today's conference, unlike ten years ago, we find unemployment at 9.6 percent, core CPI inflation well below 2 percent, and short-term interest rates bound by zero. Japan is still fighting deflation. So the problems faced by policymakers in the United States and abroad are no longer just matters of academic debate.\nToday I would like to briefly discuss how we should, in my opinion, interpret some of the data and experience we have seen since that prior conference. In particular, I would like to draw some observations from the Japanese experience, and from the Federal Reserve's Large-Scale Asset Purchase (LSAP) Program.\nThe Case of Japan\nFirst, while the Japanese stock market and real estate markets peaked in 1990, and were substantially off their peak prices in the middle of the 1990s, the core inflation rate remained low but definitely positive (as shown in Figure 2).  While every such situation is unique, the conditions in Japan that moved a low-inflation environment to one of actually falling prices were monetary and fiscal tightening, and also deferring the process of addressing significant problems in the financial sector. \n[Slide 8] Second, it is worth noting that Japan and Europe and the United States are facing substantial challenges in monetary policymaking, in part because of lingering financial problems.  Because the transmission of monetary policy occurs through the banking system, impaired banking systems and financial markets greatly complicate the conduct of monetary policy. \nThird, the fact that Japan is still battling deflation highlights how pernicious deflation can be, and how difficult it is to counteract once it has been firmly established.\n[Slide 7] Japan is the one industrialized country that has faced the zero bound and deflation problem for well over a decade. I would note several points we can draw from Japan's battle with deflation.\n[Slide 9] It is important to note that Japan has significantly altered monetary and fiscal policy to try to address its deflation problems. For fiscal policy, as shown in Figure 3, Japan has more than tripled its debt-to-GDP ratio since the early 1990s, as the government has tried to ignite the economy with more expansionary fiscal policy.\n[Slide 10] Similarly, the Bank of Japan has more than tripled the size of its balance sheet since 1990, to try to combat deflation - as shown in Figure 4.\n[Slide 11] These expansionary monetary and fiscal policies no doubt prevented deflation from being a much more severe problem than it nonetheless has been. Concerns expressed at our earlier conference, and many economic models, highlighted a risk of a strong deflationary spiral, given the significant slack in the Japanese economy. Thankfully, policy did prevent this severe outcome. However, it was not sufficient to prevent a low but persistent degree of deflation. This experience may indicate that a gradual response may not be as effective as a more active response to arrest deflationary pressures - before they become embedded in thinking that can affect household and business spending.\nFrom a policy perspective I take several lessons from the Japanese experience. First, should deflation occur, it can be quite difficult to overcome. Second, insuring against the risk of deflation may be much cheaper than waiting until it has occurred and then trying to address it. Finally, financially fragile economies may be particularly vulnerable to negative impacts from premature austerity measures.\nMonetary Policy Lessons from the LSAP Program\n[Slide 12] Now I would like to touch on some lessons for monetary policy from the LSAP program. As you know, after reaching the zero lower bound in rate-setting and seeing continued problems in economic outcomes, the Federal Reserve made a policy decision to purchase large quantities of government-backed securities in the secondary market, in its Large Scale Asset Purchase or \"LSAP\" program. Because such programs are relatively new phenomena in the United States, it was difficult to predict with precision how the economy would react.[Footnote 2] Without good historical experience to rely on, and because we are operating at the zero bound for the first time in post-war history, it is important to use the evidence we have to draw out a better understanding of LSAP programs and related channels.\nThere are many potential impediments to accurately measuring the effects of the LSAP program. First, it is difficult to isolate the impact of the program from other relevant changes such as shifts in fiscal policy, changes in policies of major trading partners, or developments in supervisory or regulatory policies that can have an impact on financial markets. Second, these programs have been operating when many economic and financial variables are outside their normal ranges. Thus, the impact of the program may differ depending on economic and financial conditions prevalent during their operation. Third, to the extent that policy changes are anticipated, the effect of a policy change may be difficult to measure with any degree of certainty.\n[Slide 13] Despite these challenges, many researchers have begun to evaluate the policy channels that are impacted by an LSAP program.[Footnote 3] While there is much work to be done, and the sample of U.S. experience is fairly limited, allow me to provide my own take on the evidence that is currently available.\n[Slide 14] Figure 5 shows the impact on mortgage rates of the announcements of the LSAP program - when it was first announced and at the March FOMC meeting when the parameters of the initial program were detailed.\nSince the initial program focused on purchases of mortgage securities, one might expect the largest impact to be on mortgage rates. Mortgage rates that had been trading at 6 percent prior to the announcements declined to roughly 5 percent. Empirical event studies that try to correct for possible confounding events tend to find an impact on mortgage rates in the range of 25 to 100 basis points. Thus, I think the empirical evidence supports the view that an LSAP program can influence the market rate of the asset being purchased. Certainly the impact may be influenced by the economic and financial conditions at the time of the announcement and purchase. The scale of the program should be sensitive to the prevailing conditions, and the size of the program would need to vary to accomplish a particular interest rate outcome.\n[Slide 15] An LSAP program will be most effective if it not only influences the rates on assets being purchased, but also influences rates on other assets with similar characteristics. For example, purchases of mortgage securities are likely to influence the price and yield of other long-term securities that may also be held by investors looking for long-term assets. As the rate on MBS securities falls, some investors will look to buy these other assets, and the increased demand will bid up their prices and push down their rates.\n[Slide 16] Indeed, as Figure 6 highlights, other long-term rates did fall with the LSAP announcements. Both long-term Treasury and corporate bond rates fell with the announcements. Several studies have concluded that the cross-correlation is relatively high, indicating that a broader array of long-term rates will be influenced by an LSAP program. Thus, the precise focus of the program's asset buy may be less critical than the broader fact that the central bank is purchasing long-duration securities, and that rates on all long-duration securities will be impacted by the program. Lower long-term rates should stimulate demand for assets influenced by the cost of borrowing long - such as investments by businesses, and home and car purchases by consumers.\n[Slide 17] Another channel that LSAPs may influence involves conveying the likelihood that short-term rates will remain low. While the Federal Reserve has used language referencing \"an extended period\" in the FOMC minutes for some time, the markets interpretation of that period is likely to be influenced by actions taken.\n[Slide 18] Indeed, as Figure 7 shows, prior to the LSAP program announcements the three-year Treasury rate had been trading above 2 percent. Since the announcements, the three-year Treasury rate has been below 2 percent - and more recently has been trading closer to the rate on shorter-term Treasuries. As of Wednesday of this week, the one-year Treasury was trading at 0.22 percent, the two-year was trading at 0.37 percent, and the three-year was trading at 0.57 percent. This compression of rates is consistent with market participants anticipating that low rates are likely to continue for quite some time. Of course, not only Treasury securities are influenced by expectations of policy; rates on other securities of short to medium term are likely to be lower as well.\n[Slide 19] Another area that is potentially impacted by an LSAP is foreign exchange. This is a mechanism that received significant attention at our earlier conference.\n[Slide 20] Since exchange rates are determined by a variety of policies, both here and abroad, the empirical relationship may be difficult to detect. This is particularly true for the dollar exchange rate, where the precautionary demand for dollars can cause large movements in the exchange rate as investors look to park funds in dollars during periods of economic turbulence. Nonetheless, one might think that the exchange rate would be influenced by policies to reduce domestic interest rates as investors move funds to countries yielding a higher return. As Figure 8 highlights, the relationship with the LSAP and exchange rates is not visually compelling, but nonetheless this is a channel worth studying and better understanding.\n[Slide 21] Another potential channel involves bank lending. As large corporations issue long-term debt at attractively low rates, they become less dependent on loans or lines of credits from banks. As larger firms move to capital markets for financing, it should free up bank balance sheets to allow a focus on those firms that really depend on banks for financing. The strength of this channel needs to be explored more thoroughly.\nConcluding Observations\n[Slide 22] This conference, more than 10 years after our earlier conference on the topic, has benefitted from the additional experience that countries around the world have had, in the interim, with monetary policy in a low inflation environment. I would summarize by saying that clearly, conducting monetary policy in a low inflation environment is difficult - and particularly so when that low inflation environment also includes wrenching financial difficulties and stubbornly high unemployment rates. At our earlier conference there was probably too little appreciation of the potential challenges, and too low a weight placed on how a low inflation environment could be hampered by the zero lower bound on short-term interest rates.\nWhile it may be too early to draw firm conclusions about monetary policy at the zero bound for short-term interest rates, I would like to draw some tentative conclusions.\nFirst, a policy of gradually adjusting monetary and fiscal policy, as conducted in Japan after deflation first occurred, may not be as effective as an active policy response taken before deflation has become embedded in the economy.  Of course, it should depend on the given situation and incoming data.\nSecond, while monetary policy may have difficulty fully offsetting a severe shock when the zero bound is hit, there are still important channels for monetary policy to use to mitigate the negative shocks. \nThird, it is not a coincidence that in Japan, the United States, and Europe these economic problems have been encountered in conjunction with banking and financial market problems.  Analysis of monetary policy with the zero bound needs to more richly capture the aspects of the financial sector that are major contributors to economic difficulties.\nFinally, we all recognize that conducting unconventional monetary and fiscal policy at the zero bound requires political will.  This of course must be factored into any analysis of policy options.\nThank you, and I look forward to the rest of today's discussion on this crucial topic.",

        "content": "\"Rethinking Central Banking\" Conference Washington, D.C.\nThank you for inviting me to offer a few observations on some design and implementation issues we all face with regard to macroprudential supervisory policies. [Note]\nPerhaps a positive offshoot of the recent severe financial crisis is that it has galvanized policymakers to expedite work on macroprudential supervision and regulation. The sense of urgency has helped regulators make significant progress on increasing bank capital buffers and has sharpened the focus on liquidity risk. These efforts are important, and should improve the strength and resiliency of the financial system when fully implemented.\n[Slide 2] Over the last year I have sometimes made a comparison between new and needed financial regulations and the regulations developed in the 1800s to prevent the \"great fires\" that had plagued many major cities. One thing that greatly reduced the risk of such fires was the development and enforcement of tough new building codes. This meant using building materials that were less flammable, and raising structures that made it far less likely that a building would catch fire - or that would suppress the spread of a fire, should it nonetheless occur. In many respects I see enhanced capital and liquidity rules as equivalent changes in our financial system, which should make financial institutions far less susceptible to \"financial firestorms.\"\nAnother aspect of the solution to great fires was the move to hiring professional fire fighters with adequate equipment and sufficient access to water to quickly respond to a fire. This reduced the risk that if a fire occurred, it would spread in some catastrophic way.\nThe importance of response time is highlighted in the questions that get asked when you take out fire insurance on your house. They ask how close you are to the nearest fire station, and how close you are to a fire hydrant. The questions are important because the answers impact the extent of the damage a fire can cause. They also impact the likelihood that a fire at a neighbor's house could spread and impact your home.\nResponse time is also critically important in financial regulation and in limiting financial damage. Today I am going to briefly discuss one type of financial \"first response\" - the ability to retain capital in the banking system by cutting bank dividends when problems first emerge.\nGiven the evidence in the data, I will highlight the fact that in relation to dividends, bank management and supervisors responded quite slowly in the United States during the financial crisis. I will suggest that macroprudential supervision should include early detection of problems, and in a troubled banking system the reduction of dividends to retain capital.\nThe Timing of Dividend Reductions\nFigure 1 shows that in August 2007, as the financial crisis emerged, banks became willing to lend to each other at one-month maturity only at rates dramatically different from the previous year. While the increase in August 2007 looks a bit less spectacular than the spike that followed the events of the fall of 2008, it was nonetheless a dramatic change. The economic implications of emerging financial problems contributed to the significant response in monetary policy.\nBut as Figure 2 highlights, the 2007 events did not lead to similarly significant changes in supervisory policy. The dividends on common stock declared by the largest banking organizations (the 19 SCAP [Footnote 1] participants and others) actually increased in the fourth quarter of 2007, and did not show dramatic reductions until after the financial crisis hit a crescendo in the fall of 2008.\nFigure 3 puts in perspective the cumulative cash dividends of the largest banks by comparing them to the Capital Purchase Program (CPP) funds they received.\n[Slide 6] This suggests that if dividends had been halted at the SCAP banks once the LIBOR rate rose, nearly $80 billion would have been retained as capital. This represents close to 50 percent of the CPP funds used to recapitalize these banks in the fall of 2008. Clearly a proactive approach to dividend retention could have substantially reduced the need for an emergency infusion of public funds.\nFinancial Indicators of Emerging Problems\nRegulatory dividend policy was focused on the ability of banks to pay dividends out of earnings. However, earnings declines occurred later than the financial market responses to emerging problems. In addition, banks' management and boards of directors rarely are proactive in reducing dividends, because of concerns that it will signal that they are experiencing more severe financial problems than their peers. With earnings somewhat slow to react to emerging problems, and boards reluctant to signal problems, most of the large banks were very slow to react to the crisis with reduced dividends.\nSimilarly, banks' supervisory ratings were also slow to react, as shown in Figure 4. The measure of the share of assets in so-called \"problem\" banks [Footnote 2] - the blue line - responds only with a delay. A similar pattern emerges if one looks at the percentage of bank assets in the three lowest supervisory ratings (CAMELS ratings of 3, 4, or 5), although it captures a much higher percentage of total bank assets. In contrast, the credit default swap spread for the four largest U.S. banking organizations - the green line - began to climb in the fall of 2007 and continued to climb throughout 2008 and into 2009. I should note that we use the four largest banks simply because of the availability of historical credit default swap data, but our modeling suggests this is representative for the largest banks more generally.\nFigure 5 shows that a similar pattern emerges if one uses the market capitalization relative to assets of the four largest banking organizations. [Footnote 3] Like the credit default swaps, the measure (the green line) began to decline significantly in the fall of 2007 and continued to decline through 2008 and into 2009. Again this financial indicator of bank health moved far more quickly than regulatory ratings (see the blue line) or dividend reductions.\nFigure 6 highlights another issue - that as financial markets took a bleaker view of banks' financial prospects (in the top chart), banks had begun to tighten credit standards (in the bottom chart). By the end of 2007, credit standards had tightened substantially, relative to where they were in the beginning of that year. Banks seek to maintain reasonable capital-to-assets ratios and loans are, of course, assets for banks. If capital is eventually reduced due to loan write-downs, and banks reduce lending to maintain capital-to-asset ratios, the \"collateral damage\" to those who would like to borrow from \"supply-constrained\" banking institutions can impose a significant cost to the economy more broadly. So the impact of only slowly reducing dividends, rather than retaining capital in the banking system, extends well beyond losses to stockholders and potentially taxpayers.\nPolicy Implications\n[Slide 10] Even from the perspective of microprudential supervision, more proactive dividend reduction would have ameliorated some of the costs of the financial crisis. Rather than basing regulatory dividend policy on accounting constructs that tend to be slow moving and backward looking, regulatory policy should prompt supervisors to look forward and thus more proactively seek reductions in dividends in appropriate circumstances. In particular, given the financial-market signals of impending problems that I have highlighted today, I believe that supervisors need in such circumstances to be more proactive in seeking capital retention through reduced dividends at banking organizations.\n[Slide 11] Of course, signaling problems can make it difficult for supervisors to mandate reductions at individual institutions. When a wide variety of indicators suggest potential problems in the banking sector, signaling problems could be avoided if, hypothetically, all banks were required to reduce dividends - or all banks with outsized exposures. For example, banks with large real estate exposures in loans and securities could in such a situation be required to reduce dividends before accounting losses were realized. Such a policy might very well reduce the credit-availability problems that have unfortunately been a hallmark of this financial crisis.\nIn retrospect, empirical analysis suggests that bank management and supervisors had an opportunity to retain capital once problems became identifiable, but before the full extent of the crisis emerged in the fall of 2008. In the spirit of learning and applying lessons, one must consider whether this dynamic could repeat itself - or indeed is repeating itself. For example, in some parts of the world today, sovereign risk exposure seems problematic and elevated credit default swaps and low stock market valuations have not prevented some banks from continuing to pay dividends.\nIn sum, I suggest that more aggressive policy may not only reduce potential taxpayer exposure to the banking sector, but also insulate the broader economy from the sorts of loan-supply shocks that can provide significant headwinds to an economic recovery.\nThank you.",

        "content": "The Forecasters Club of New York\nThank you for the opportunity to speak with you today at the Forecaster's Club.[Note] Working at the Fed over the last 25 years has given me a healthy regard for the challenges you face every day as you attempt to divine the future path of the economy. Even during the best of times it is not easy, but this has been a particularly challenging time in forecasting. It has proven to be very difficult to incorporate the effects of the financial system into models of the economy - in part because the financial sector may have a significant impact on economic forecasts only during the rare occasions when the sector is badly disrupted.\nWhile financial markets and financial institutions are now in far better shape than two years ago, the collateral damage on the economy from the financial shocks has been severe. The damage has, unfortunately, followed the pattern established in the aftermath of previous significant financial disruptions, which tend to cause an extended period of subpar economic growth. [Footnote 1]\nThese days, as in past recoveries, it is not uncommon to hear some observers say that there is little that policymakers can or should do. This is not my perspective, and I want to use this opportunity to share some of the analytical and empirical underpinnings for my views.\nWhile these topics are getting a lot of attention of late - understandably - many of us have been researching them for some time. And I would just like to reiterate that I take an empirical, data-driven approach to policymaking responsibilities - a fact I believe my talk today will demonstrate.\nWhile certainly the economic problems we are facing are daunting, I do not see them as insurmountable. In fact, although the economy is far from where we would like it to be, we are in a far better place than we were two years ago, when financial markets and economic activity were in the process of \"seizing up.\" The stock market is well off its lows, interest spreads have narrowed, and the economy has had four quarters of positive, if anemic, growth.\nAnd it was policy - monetary policy and fiscal policy, and to some degree supervisory policy - that played a critical role in the improvements we have seen over the past two years. We have a long way to go, but it would have been much longer but for a number of parties making difficult but appropriate policy decisions.\nHowever, while we have seen positive growth over the past year, it has been slow. We have seen some increases in employment, but there has not been any significant reduction in the high percentage of workers who are unemployed. And, while financial market conditions have improved dramatically, credit availability remains an issue for many individuals and businesses. In short, policymaking has been effective at stabilizing the economy, but the recovery remains far too weak to restore what we consider full employment with the speed I would like to see.\nToday I would like to touch on a number of issues, including some of the recently hypothesized impediments to a more robust recovery. I would also like to explore some of the options for generating a more robust recovery - options that policymakers need to consider and debate, thoughtfully and analytically, as we go forward.\nAllow me to preview my punch line. I've called this talk \"How Should Monetary Policy Respond to a Slow Recovery?\" My answer to that question is: vigorously, creatively, thoughtfully, and persistently, as long as we have options at our disposal. And we do have options, despite having pushed short-term rates to the zero lower bound.\nDislocations in the Labor Market?\nSome hypothesize that a more robust recovery is impeded by dislocations in the labor market. Indeed, history shows that even with a relatively mild recession there can be significant dislocations. The 2001 recession provides a good example. As Figure 1 shows, information technology and manufacturing were two industries that saw significant declines in employment in that downturn. The end of the \"dot-com\" euphoria and structural shifts in the manufacturing sector caused those two industries to be disproportionately affected, while we had only modest declines in the cyclical construction industry, and increases in employment in several industries. Similarly, the 1990 recession had a decline in employment of more than 5 percent in only the construction industry, when overbuilding in several regions of the country led to a significant readjustment in construction-industry employment.\nIn fact, in each of the three previous recessions there was a decline of 5 percent or more in no more than two industry categories - as the figure shows - with many industries experiencing little or no net job loss over the course of the recession. Structural shifts across industries are not uncommon in recessions - and also, some structural dislocation seems inevitable as it will always take some time for capital and labor to flow to those industries with the greatest opportunities.\nIn rather stark contrast, the most recent recession is far less a reflection of dislocation in a few industries but rather reflects a general decline in almost all industries. As the chart on the far right shows, in this recession there has been a peak to trough loss of employment of 5 percent or greater in construction, manufacturing, retail trade, wholesale trade, transportation, information technology, financial activities, and professional and business services. To me, this does not suggest that the driver is structural change in the economy increasing job mismatches - although no doubt some of that exists - but instead I see here a widespread decline in demand across most industries.\nNot surprisingly, given this far-reaching decline in labor demand, job vacancies are remarkably low. Not only are they low, but they are also well below the experience in most recent recessions, making small movements in job-vacancy rates particularly difficult to interpret. For example, economists and forecasters are estimating Beveridge curves (plotting the relationship between job vacancies and unemployment)[Footnote 2] well outside historical experience, making it difficult to draw strong conclusions about recent movements.\nFigure 2 highlights that job mismatches are not the primary problem. The bottom chart shows that the percentage of small businesses with one or more hard-to-fill jobs open is near the low point for the series over nearly 25 years. According to survey data, businesses are having no problem finding skilled workers for what were considered hard-to-fill vacancies. This is consistent with my ongoing discussions with representatives of businesses, who generally report no difficulty finding qualified workers even for quite specialized positions.\nHowever, as the top chart on the figure shows, most small businesses are not expecting to increase employment. When I talk with representatives of businesses, the primary reason they give for this is they are not seeing sufficient demand for their products. If they were confident that demand would pick up, they would - and easily could - hire additional workers.\nBalance Sheet Adjustments?\nAnother impediment to a more robust recovery could well be balance sheet adjustments by financial and nonfinancial firms, and households. To explore this, let's examine this cycle in some more detail. Figure 3 splits the time since the onset of the recession into three periods:\nThe first period runs from the beginning of the recession in December 2007 through August 2008.  Up to that point, the recession looked quite similar in depth and duration to previous recessions.  The only sector with a very substantial decline in employment was the construction industry. \nThe second period is from August 2008 through June 2009.  After the large financial shocks that occurred in September and October of 2008, there were large and widespread declines in employment across a wide variety of industries.  Both the disruption of credit and concerns that we could see an extremely severe contraction caused most businesses to become far more cautious. \nThe final period, from June 2009 to the present, encompasses the recovery to date.  This recovery has been quite slow, with continued sharp declines in construction activity.  In fact, the first year of the recovery has an employment pattern similar to shallow recessions, indicating just how weak the recovery has been so far. \nMost forecasts of employment and unemployment during this period did not anticipate the severe turn of events. Figure 4 provides the Blue Chip forecast for unemployment at the beginning of the first two periods in the charts we just saw - and the actual unemployment experience. In December 2007, few saw cause for great alarm. The expectation was that unemployment would remain stable near 5 percent, when in fact what actually happened was a marked increase in the unemployment rate.\nIn part, the forecasts were off because many of the financial disruptions that were already evident were not well captured in econometric models. Also, recessions are notoriously difficult to predict, and most models struggle to capture turning points.\nThe second chart on Figure 4 shows that even in August 2008, many forecasts did not predict great difficulties. For the most part, the unemployment rate was expected to remain near 6 percent, when in reality it rose to over 9 percent. Thus, one month before the worst of the financial crisis emerged, there was little expectation of a significant financial shock or the major impact that it would have on the overall economy.\nFortunately, the Federal Reserve had already begun to ease - and continued to ease quite dramatically - despite most forecasts predicting a more benign outcome. We had already reduced the federal funds rate very substantially by August, and as a result of the financial crisis eventually pushed the federal funds rate essentially to its lower bound of zero. Thus, during much of this period monetary policy was quite proactive. While it could not offset the effects of the severe problems emerging in the economy, the policy stance was more responsive than if it had been in synch with most private forecasts at the time. This policymaking was key to avoiding far worse outcomes.\nFigure 5 looks at the forecasts for unemployment at the end of this year over the span of time I referred to as the recovery period. At the beginning of 2010, the unemployment rate was 9.7 percent. As the figure shows, there has been a consistent view that the recovery would be weak and make only limited progress on reducing unemployment. While through April the forecasts were getting more optimistic about labor market trends, since then forecasters have been raising their forecasts for unemployment. Regrettably, I have to concur with the view expressed in these forecasts - that the unemployment rate is likely to be very close to the very elevated level at the beginning of the year.\nFigure 6 provides some context for that pessimism. While two of the past four quarters had growth (in blue) above estimates of potential, the expansion in what we call \"final sales\" (in red) has been below potential. Since by definition the difference between GDP and final sales reflects inventories, we need final sales to pick up - especially as temporary stimulus from inventories, and government, subsides. Unfortunately, there is little evidence in the data of that happening, with growth in the second half of 2010 likely to be in the vicinity of 2 percent.\nThe bottom graph on Figure 6 shows the change in the employment-to-population ratio (in green). While there was employment growth in the first half of 2010, it has only resulted in a slight improvement in the employment-to-population ratio.\nWith that background, let me note that one challenge in getting the economy to grow faster has been the desire of households and businesses to essentially \"rebuild\" their balance sheets in the wake of this so-called \"Great Recession.\" Figure 7highlights that the personal savings rate has risen, and Figure 8 shows that households have increased their holdings of cash and securities. While rebuilding wealth and remaining more liquid are natural reactions to recent conditions - and positive in a long-term sense - the fact is they portend rather modest increases in consumption in the near term, until consumers become more confident about their prospects.\nFigure 9 highlight that businesses and banks have also been increasing their holdings of cash and securities. While this is natural, such behavior will likely keep growth in business fixed investment rather restrained.\nThe Policy Response\nSo how should monetary policy react to a very anemic recovery? The usual monetary policy response to slow growth in nominal GDP would be to continue reducing the federal funds rate, and during the past two slow recoveries that is what the Federal Reserve did. As I have already highlighted, by central bank standards we moved rather quickly to recognize the severity of the problem in this downturn, and responded with monetary accommodation. However, since the end of 2008 the federal funds rate has been bounded by zero, which has eliminated the ability to decrease short-term interest rates.\nA simple Taylor Rule calculation, shown in Figure 10, relates movements in the federal funds rate to deviations in inflation and unemployment from their targets. The far right section of the chart highlights that given the very low level of inflation and the very high level of the unemployment rate, the Fed would have continued to reduce the funds rate over the past two years, but for the zero lower bound.\nConstrained by the zero bound, the Federal Reserve utilized less conventional policies - as shown in Figure 11. Most of these approaches had never been tried in the United States prior to the crisis. New policies outside of historical experience necessarily involve some uncertainty about their impact. We were fortunate that Chairman Bernanke and the Federal Open Market Committee had the courage to undertake unconventional policies in the \"teeth\" of a crisis. It is easy - and I dare say commonplace - to underestimate the economic disruption that would likely have arisen if we at the Fed had stuck to our \" comfort zone.\"\nIt is easy with hindsight to see the financial meltdown as an historic economic crisis, one that galvanized officials to push out the boundaries of policymaking and take action. But in my view, current economic conditions - an unemployment rate near 10 percent, sluggish growth, and undesirably low inflation - together constitute a serious economic problem. While it's clear to everyone why a high unemployment rate is a problem, one of the reasons we worry about a too-low rate of inflation is that the closer to zero the inflation rate gets, the greater the risk it could fall into a harmful deflation.\nAs I said earlier, we do have options, despite having pushed short-term rates to the zero lower bound. One of the challenges is that with unconventional policies, costs can be apparent but benefits more indirect, and harder to track.\nThe Federal Reserve's large-scale asset purchases - primarily purchases of mortgage-backed securities - arguably had multiple effects, including maintaining market function in the mortgage markets. But in my view their primary impact on the economy was achieved by reducing mortgage rates. Rates had been around 6 percent prior to the change in policy, and moved closer to 5 percent as our purchases began to accumulate, as shown in Figure 12. It also appears that by \"removing duration\" from the market, other long-term rates were also reduced in response to our purchases.\nOf course, none of this is easy or without complications. There are concerns about things like creating distortions in credit allocation, complicating exit strategies when they become appropriate, and exposing the Federal Reserve to interest-rate risk. Those issues are important to recognize, and to work to mitigate. At the same time, we cannot take lightly how far off the mark unemployment and inflation seem to be.\nNow I'd like to make a few observations on Fed purchases of Treasury securities.\nFirst, the positives: Purchases of long-term Treasury securities are likely to push down long-term interest rates on Treasury bonds, but also are likely to reduce rates on other long-term securities. Some have argued that it would be difficult to reduce Treasury rates further, but Figure 13 highlights, importantly, that U.S. Treasury rates are still well above the zero bound, roughly equivalent to rates in Germany, and well above long-term rates in Japan.\nNow some concerns: While purchases of Treasury securities have the advantage of not directly \"allocating credit\" to a particular industry, they have the disadvantage of only indirectly affecting the private borrowing rates that more directly affect private investment spending. In addition, Treasury purchases raise for some a concern that the Fed intends to monetize the federal debt, using monetary policy to accommodate the financing of fiscal policy. I can assure you that we have no desire or intention whatsoever to do so.\nWhile lower long-term rates are likely the primary channel through which asset purchases would influence the economy, purchases of Treasury or mortgage-backed securities also expand the Federal Reserve's balance sheet and increase the amount of reserves in the financial system. This expansion of reserves might serve as an effective signal that highlights the determination of the Federal Reserve to reduce disinflationary pressures.\nCertainly, views on securities purchases differ within the ranks of policymakers and all manner of observers. I would just reiterate that it is important to keep firmly in mind the goal of such purchases: to stimulate the economy by reducing long-term interest rates to a level that is more consistent with where they would be, were we able to further reduce the federal funds rate.\nConcluding Observations\nWhile the economy is growing, it is currently growing too slowly to significantly reduce the unemployment rate or stem disinflationary pressures created by the high degree of slack in the economy. While fiscal policies may be the most effective way to stimulate the economy when short-term interest rates approach the zero bound, unconventional monetary policies provide additional policy options. Of course, policymakers need to carefully weigh the benefits and costs of unconventional monetary policy - some of which I have tried to share with you today. Yet all in all, my firm view is that it is important that policymakers be open to implementing policies consistent with achieving full employment, and an appropriate level of inflation, within a reasonable time frame. Thank you.",

        "highlights": "",
        "content": "Federal Reserve Conference on REO and Vacant Property Strategies for Neighborhood Stabilization\n[Slide 1] I'm very happy to be here today, to take part in a conference on topics of such importance.\nHousing has played a central role in the financial crisis and the subsequent economic difficulties that we have been experiencing now for more than three years. [Note]\nThis conference brings together people from around the country who have been on the front lines looking for solutions to mitigate the personal and societal costs of mounting foreclosures, and the buildup of REO properties. By gathering together, we can learn from each other's successes - and also from each other's well-intentioned failures.\nI expect we will learn that a single solution may not work in all regions of the country. What seems promising in Cleveland and in other cities in the northern Midwest may not be the best solution for New England, or for Southern California. The reason, I suspect, is that the effects of the housing and financial crisis on any community depend, importantly, on the attributes of the community. For example, how susceptible is the population to extended spells of unemployment or other income disruptions? How healthy was the local economy and industry before the crisis? And how well-equipped are local nonprofit and governmental institutions - and civic leaders - to respond to the fallout from the crisis?\n[Slide 2] My comments today will focus on the foreclosure and REO problem in my region - New England. In particular, I want to ask how best to understand the problem: Is it a housing problem that affects all communities similarly? Or is it a foreclosure and REO problem that affects all communities in a similar way? Or is the problem better understood as a crisis that is reflected differently in each community, and thus requires solutions that are very likely to differ, across communities?\nI'll just take a moment to preview my remarks. I will first show that New England locations, defined by zip codes, with a high concentration of REO properties have (not surprisingly) incurred larger declines in home prices than zip codes with lower REO concentrations. I will then highlight that many of these same communities were areas that faced challenges even before the foreclosure crisis - challenges that made these communities more likely to suffer disproportionately the consequences of the crisis. [Footnote 1]\nI will then touch briefly on research and policy implications. In particular, do we need more holistic approaches to addressing this crisis? Should there be more state and federal revenue sharing focused on providing flexible funds to the communities most affected? My answer to both of these questions is a yes. But I would also argue that we need to not only explore alternative solutions, but also do a much better job of establishing which solutions work - and then try to replicate effective solutions on a larger scale.\nHow Should the Foreclosure Problem Be Framed?\n[Slide 3] Finding the right solution requires asking the right question. So I want to begin by asking, what is the question we are trying to answer?\nTo that end I suggest we do a little exercise. We might gain some insight into how the attendees at this conference are framing the question by looking at the non-profit organizations on the program. What is their key focus? If we assume the name of an organization was chosen to indicate its central mission, by noting the keyword in the name we may learn something about their primary focus. On the agenda for this conference, five non-profit organizations have \"community\" or \"neighborhood\" in their names; two have \"housing\" ; and one has \"foreclosure\" or \"REO.\" Most of you are no doubt focusing on rising foreclosures and REO properties, but it seems that you see these through the \"lens\" of community. However, it is less clear that public policies have been similarly aligned.\n[Slide 4] To help illustrate why the framing of a problem is important, we should consider what the focus might be if we assume different primary objectives.\nIf one looks at the problem as primarily a foreclosure and REO problem rooted in the housing bubble, the solutions will tend to emphasize mitigating the foreclosure problem or accelerating the disposition of REO properties.  Some will also advocate for a reconsideration of the legal system’s approach to personal bankruptcy and foreclosure. \nIf, instead, one views the problem as being primarily a housing problem, you might address the problem differently.  You might focus on solutions that result in sustainable home ownership.  For example, what should be the minimum down payment on a house, and what financing approaches would results in sustainable home ownership?  The solutions to this sort of a problem might be focusing on financial education, addressing predatory home financing, and redefining appropriate underwriting standards.  The availability of affordable rental housing might also be a focus. \nIf the problem is seen through the lens of community, however, foreclosure may be viewed as a symptom of broader problems affecting neighborhoods – such as high concentrations of unemployment, elevated crime rates, and poor code enforcement.  Let me be clear; I am not saying that “the community is the problem,” but rather that, in this view, different communities will experience problems differently because of their different characteristics, requiring different solutions in many cases.  The public policy solution for this problem may be to have more general revenues available for non-profits and local governments to address the problem in a more holistic fashion.\n[Slide 5] Clearly there are elements of all three in the current crisis. This is a foreclosure problem. This is a housing problem. This is a community problem. However, as I just illustrated, the solutions may be somewhat different, depending on how one frames the problem. So, we should ask, do we have the right balance as we think about the best way to address a serious - and I would argue multifaceted - public policy problem? My own view is that too little focus has been on community problems because the focus has been more targeted to housing and foreclosures.\nEvidence from New England\n[Slide 6] As we consider these questions, I'd like to share with you some evidence from New England - and in particular Greater Boston.\n[Slide 7] The first chart provides REO per square mile in three New England states by zip code and compares that with the change in the median housing sales price from 2005 to 2008 for the same zip code. As you can see in the chart, in areas with a lower concentration of REO there is not a strong correlation with changes in median sales price. However, as the concentration of REO increases there is a much stronger correlation with median sales price change. Zip codes with higher concentrations of REO tend to have seen larger declines in median sales price.\nLet me be quick to acknowledge the open question of causality. We are doing more statistical work to try to understand the causality in the REO-concentration and house-price relationship. That work needs to also control for factors such as population density.\n[Slide 8] The next figure highlights that high concentrations of REO are not the only problem afflicting those communities. Zip codes with four or more REOs per square mile also have higher property crime rates, higher rates of low birth-weight babies, higher unemployment rates, and weaker small business activity. Note that all these charts are for the time period that generally precedes the foreclosure crisis, so these communities were already challenged.\n[Slide 9] Indeed, the next figure highlights that children in these communities were being impacted even before the dramatic increase in foreclosures. Communities that would eventually have four or more REO properties per square mile had higher high school drop-out rates and higher failures in statewide math tests.\nIt is hard to imagine that dramatic increases in foreclosure rates would not exacerbate these problems. A foreclosure is likely to mean not only a loss of home, but also a disruption in where, or whether, kids are in school. Since foreclosure is often related to unemployment, marital stress, or physical ailments, the foreclosure is likely to make it difficult for even the most determined student to excel. The impact of the foreclosure crisis on children is something we are trying to better understand at the Boston Fed.\nThe bottom chart on slide 9 highlights that these communities have a large gap between their municipal service needs and their ability to raise revenues to pay for those needs (…the so-called \"fiscal gap\" ). A recent study at the Boston Fed highlights that non-school revenue sharing in Massachusetts is not well aligned with communities' fiscal gaps. [Footnote 2] Changes in revenue sharing are critical to helping those communities address their problems. Potentially, a federal revenue sharing program at the national level that focuses on these communities could help. These funds could be provided in a flexible way so they could target those areas of most importance - since local governments may be in a better position to determine if the funds should be directed to more teachers, more code enforcement, more police, or more assistance to non-profit organizations that are making a difference in their communities.\n[Slide 10] Now, since a picture is worth a thousand words, I would like to show you some maps that demonstrate how clusters of REO are associated with a host of other community problems.\nThe next five figures [Slide 11] , [Slide 12] , [Slide 13] , [Slide 14] , [Slide 15]] show the community patterns in the data. Those communities with very high REO per square mile also fare poorly in many other dimensions. Many communities are performing poorly in all the criteria illustrated in the figures. If these are community problems, we may need to search for community solutions.\nImplications for Research and Policy\n[Slide 16] The patterns in these data imply a need for more holistic approaches to the problem. This is not a one-size-fits-all foreclosure or housing problem; these are community problems. Of course, I am showing you examples from New England and one needs to examine how similar or dissimilar the patterns are in other regions.\nBut it seems, in sum, that communities with some of these challenging attributes are likely to experience higher rates of foreclosure and REO. And the same communities experience greater hardships in the face of rising foreclosures and REO.\nRather than treating the symptom - the high REO problem - we need to better understand how to resolve the more general problems in communities that lead to higher concentrations of REOs and exacerbate the effects of high REOs. However, the challenge of finding holistic solutions is significant, and longstanding.\nI am encouraging Boston Fed staff to work to better understand how foreclosures and REO can exacerbate problems in troubled communities - and to look for data that can better determine which solutions work, under which circumstances. For example, we have been examining the issues and barriers keeping the city of Springfield, Massachusetts from prosperity, with an eye to assisting Springfield and also sharing the lessons more broadly. As part of that work we have examined the factors that have helped other similar cities around the country achieve a greater degree of resurgence.[Footnote 3]\nI am particularly encouraging my staff to look at how foreclosures affect children. While not responsible for the foreclosure problem, children may be affected by its consequences for years to come, if it prevents them from meeting their potential in school and eventually in the labor force.\n[Slide 17] While more research needs to be done on the communities, and on which solutions work, we should also reflect on how we are spending our public policy dollars. Are they appropriately balanced to the problems of housing, foreclosure, and community need? If a more holistic approach is needed, states and the federal government may need to examine the most effective and efficient way to address the broader problems in these communities, including potentially looking at revenue sharing that provides a flexible way to address the fiscal gap faced by many of our hard-pressed communities.\nThank you. I believe we are now proceeding to the next session on the conference agenda.",

        "content": "The Money Marketeers of New York University New York\nI am happy to be with you this evening. I appreciate your warm welcome, and your invitation to join the long and distinguished line of individuals who have addressed the Money Marketeers over the decades.[Note]\nI have always taken some delight in Yogi Berra quotes. As a Red Sox fan, I could always hope that garbled metaphors by the legendary Yogi would be as confusing to the players as they were to the public, which might translate into opportunities when the Red Sox came to New York. Alas, in the early going this season it is not the Yankees that seem confused.\nYogi Berra was not only a great catcher and manager, but also an astute observer of the obvious. If he were to summarize this talk he might suggest a title like \"Knowing Your Destination is a Good Start in Getting Where You Are Going\" or some other derivation of what I believe is his actual quote: \"You've got to be very careful if you don't know where you are going because you might not get there.\"\nWhen setting monetary policy, it is very important to have a clear idea of where you want the economy to go. And fortunately, there is now much more transparency about the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC's) expected destination, because the FOMC releases its long-term projections for inflation and unemployment. Unfortunately, however, actually reaching our desired destination will prove challenging and involve choices, as I will discuss this evening.\nAt our January meeting, the central tendency of the FOMC members' long-run projections for unemployment was 5.0 to 5.2 percent, and for inflation (measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index or PCE) was 1.7 to 2.0 percent. At present, both unemployment and inflation diverge significantly from these longer-term goals, with the March unemployment rate at 9.7 percent, and core PCE inflation over the past year at 1.3 percent. In such circumstances, one might think that the current path of monetary policy would be particularly straightforward.\nUnfortunately, just knowing your destination doesn't get you there. To reach your destination you need to know how you want to get there. If I plug a destination into my new GPS device, it asks whether I want the quickest route, or the geographically shortest route, or a route that meets some other criteria. The quickest route is likely to involve highways, but may cover more miles. The shortest route may take side roads that reduce distance and save gas, but take substantially more time. And, of course, you may run into traffic or construction that forces you to adapt your route.\nWhen setting monetary policy there may be a variety of paths you can take to reach the destination. For instance, aggressive pursuit of accommodative monetary policy by the Fed and stimulative fiscal policy by Congress and the Administration might get us more quickly to our desired destination - but could enlarge the deficit or risk igniting inflation expectations. Alternatively, aggressive pursuit of less accommodative policies - that is, removing monetary and fiscal stimulus sooner rather than later - could result in a more extended period of underutilized resources; or worse, significantly increase the length of the journey to our ultimate destination.\nRight now, we are far from our destination, and the rest of my remarks will focus on selecting among the alternate routes to our objective.\nThe economy is currently beginning to recover from what many are calling the Great Recession. While real GDP began to increase in the third quarter of last year, growth so far has been insufficient to improve conditions much in the labor markets. This unfortunate reality can be seen in Figure 1, which shows the employment-to-population ratio over the past 30 years with the shading representing recessions. The decline of about five percentage points in the employment-to-population ratio in this recession is striking, as many workers have either become unemployed or dropped out of the work force.\nWhile it is not uncommon for the employment-to-population ratio to decline in a recession, Figure 2 shows how dramatic the decline has been in this recession, compared with previous ones.[Footnote 1] The loss of jobs has been particularly acute in construction and manufacturing. The severity of the job losses in these male-dominated industries is one of the reasons that males in some age groups have experienced such a significant decline in their employment-to-population ratio, as shown in Figure 3. For example, the March unemployment rates for males between the ages of 20 and 24 was 18.4 percent, more than 5 percentage points higher than for females in the same age group.\nThe sharp reduction in the ratio of employment to population highlights our challenge - achieving a full recovery will require creating jobs for those currently unemployed and actively seeking work, those entering the labor force as the population grows, and those likely to return to the labor force once jobs become more available. Employing all these workers within a reasonable period of time will require very strong economic growth. The question is, how likely is that?\nFigure 4 shows the growth rate in each of the first three years of the last three recoveries, as well as the average rates for all three recoveries. The most recent two recoveries were quite slow to get started, but picked up steam over time. This is the pattern projected in most forecasts for this recovery.\nOver the past three quarters, GDP has increased 3.7 percent.[Footnote 2] However, some of the growth resulted from temporary rebalancing of inventories by businesses, as suggested by Figure 5, which shows that the percent change in real final sales was quite a bit smaller than the percent change in GDP. The gap between them would be inventory rebuilding.\nMost private forecasts expect growth in the next four quarters to be fast enough to begin to make more improvement in the labor market. My own expectation is consistent with this. As financial headwinds subside, and consumers and businesses gain more confidence in the recovery, expenditures that have been deferred will be made - and we should begin to see stronger economic growth.\nDespite this forecast of an improved outlook, we will need very strong growth if we are to return to 5 percent unemployment in a reasonable time frame. Economists frequently use a rule of thumb, called Okun's Law, to characterize the relationship between output growth and unemployment. According to Okun's Law, if the economy grows one percentage point faster than its potential for one year, the result will be a decline in the unemployment rate of approximately one-half of a percent. Of course, I would highlight that this is a rule of thumb, and that the relationship is more complicated than this and, of course, subject to error.\nBut using the simple rule of thumb implied by Okun's Law, the left side of Figure 6 shows the rates of GDP growth necessary to return unemployment to 5 percent over different time frames. The chart highlights that we need several years of very strong growth to reach 5 percent unemployment. For example, to reach 5 percent unemployment by the end of 2013, real GDP growth would have to average 5 percent per year.[Footnote 3] Such a growth rate has some historical precedent, as shown on the right side of the chart, but it is much faster than the growth rate in the past two recoveries. And to reach 5 percent unemployment by 2015 would still take growth averaging 4.2 percent per year - considerably faster than the average rate of growth after the 1991 and 2001 recessions.\nGiven the need for very rapid growth to get unemployment back to 5 percent, let me pose an oversimplified question - why would policymakers not keep monetary policy very accommodative, and fiscal policy very stimulative, until we had a sustained growth rate that brought the economy much closer to full employment? At least on the monetary side, one reason might be concern among policymakers that rapid growth would be inflationary.\nTo explore that, let's turn to Figure 7, which shows the total and core inflation rates, measured by changes in the CPI, with recession shading. What the chart shows is that inflation has declined in each recession, including this so-called Great Recession. It also highlights that inflation tends to continue falling in the early stages of a recovery. Figure 8 shows the change in the inflation rate from the business cycle peak. From the peak (shown at zero on the horizontal axis) the inflation rate is very restrained, and generally negative, for many months. With substantial excess capacity in the economy during the early stages of a recovery, workers don't tend to demand higher wages, and firms don't feel at liberty to substantially increase prices. Since the Great Recession has resulted in substantial excess capacity, it would be unusual to see increases in the inflation rate in the early stages of this recovery.\nHowever, while inflation does not normally increase in the early stages of a recovery, some economic observers may be concerned that this recovery will be different, because of the unusual actions that the Federal Reserve needed to take. As you know, the Federal Reserve took extraordinary measures to stabilize the financial system - measures that were critical to setting the stage for the current recovery. Figure 9 depicts the additions to the central bank's balance sheet from these temporary operations. As you can see in the chart, the liquidity facilities that we set up to restore more effective financial market functioning have wound down. At the same time, however, in response to the severity of the economic recession the Federal Reserve decided to expand its purchases of mortgage-backed and agency securities. These purchases were undertaken to improve market functioning in the mortgage market, and even more importantly, as a way to reduce a key interest rate at a time when many short-term interest rates were close to, or at, the zero lower bound.\nThe purchase program ended in March, and these balances will naturally be dropping over time as households prepay mortgages, sell their homes, or refinance. This decline in our balance sheet will actually occur without the Fed taking any specific actions. But it will occur slowly, and absent any action of the Fed's part, the balance sheet will remain elevated for years.\nThis expansion of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet raises concerns for some observers and commentators. An important side effect of our asset purchases has, necessarily, been a dramatic swelling of so called excess reserves in the banking system. When the central bank purchases assets, it credits the selling institution with reserves. Over time, banks could choose to lend out these reserves, which would turn the reserves into broader money - and a rapid expansion of the broader money supply would be inflationary. However, as Figure 10 suggests, the current problem is not a rapid expansion in lending and the money supply. In fact, quite the opposite; banks have been reluctant to lend. Many have taken significant losses that have drained their capital; and, at the same time, the financial condition of many potential borrowers is worse than before the recession.[Footnote 4]\nWere that situation to change and bank lending to accelerate, the Federal Reserve could drain the excess reserves from the banking system. We have a variety of tools. We could sell some of our long-term assets, thereby increasing longer-term interest rates. We now pay interest on reserves, and that rate could be increased to discourage bank lending. The size of our balance sheet, the composition of the balance sheet, and our short-term interest rate target are all instruments that we have available to reach our destination of full employment with stable prices. Fundamentally, decisions about shrinking our balance sheet - like decisions to tighten interest rates - should be conditional on economic conditions.\nSome analysts warn of rapid inflation arising from the expansion of the Fed's balance sheet; but these forecasts have not been borne out. In fact, despite the buildup in excess reserves, the inflation rate has been falling - and I expect this trend to continue over the near term. The experience in both Japan and the United States is that after a banking crisis, excess reserves have not been inflationary in the short term. Of course, once the banks have recapitalized and economic resources are more fully utilized, we would not want to have a large stock of excess reserves. Again, as noted, we have a variety of tools to remove excess reserves at a time when that becomes appropriate.\nAs a result, I agree with many forecasters who expect disinflation in the near term. The substantial excess capacity in labor markets that I mentioned earlier has caused compensation to decline quite markedly (see Figure 11). Because employee compensation is the main cost component for most companies, lower labor costs enable businesses to improve profit margins without substantial price increases - particularly as the demand for goods and services improves.\nThis brings us back to Yogi Berra, who famously said, \"When you come to a fork in the road, take it.\" At times, a fork in the road is exactly what confronts monetary policymakers. We would face a fork, for example, if inflationary pressures were building despite a high unemployment rate. In this case, the choice between restraining inflation and supporting employment is a difficult one, and the policy decision becomes more complicated. However, with employment well below the level of full employment, and disinflation continuing to move us away from my own inflation target of 2 percent, one does not currently need to make such trade-offs.\nAnother possible complication could occur if very low interest rates were causing excessive, leveraged bets that were inflating the price of assets that have macroeconomic importance. While we need to be vigilant against the buildup of asset bubbles, there is little evidence of such a problem now. Many financial institutions are still deleveraging - a factor in why we are seeing too little lending rather than too much. Real estate can be a very important asset because it serves as collateral for many loans. However, in the current situation both residential and commercial real estate are, at best, stabilizing.\nEven if we were to see asset prices rising, it is not obvious that somewhat tighter interest rates will make a significant difference. A more targeted approach would be to examine whether supervisors should require tighter lending standards, or higher capital requirements, in areas where asset prices are appreciating rapidly. This would make sense from the perspective of good risk management - if institutions hold assets that appreciate quickly, they should retain sufficient capital and be vigilant in credit standards to insure that they can weather a quick reversal in asset prices. Raising short-term interest rates because of exuberance in one market is a blunt, and possibly ineffective, tool against the exuberance of investors in a particular asset. As a result, in my view, short-term interest rate-setting is better suited for calibrating the growth in the overall economy, rather than focusing on a particular asset class.\nConcluding Observations\nIn sum, while the incoming economic data have certainly been more positive of late, we remain far from our \"stated\" destination. Even with rapid growth in the economy, spurred by accommodative monetary policy and stimulative fiscal policy, it is likely to take years before we approach the growth and inflation rates that would really reflect achievement of the two elements of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate.\nThe economy, while in a much better place than a year ago, is still susceptible to negative shocks. Serious fiscal problems loom for state and local governments, the U.S. government, and governments around the world - particularly those that have expended large sums of money to recover from this financial crisis and recession. Clearly over time we need to have much more sustainable levels of budget deficits, at all levels of government, here in the U.S. and abroad.[Footnote 5] However, I would just note that rapid movement to fiscal austerity, like rapid removal of monetary accommodation, could of course significantly delay the time it takes to reach full employment.\nWhile financial markets have improved significantly, real estate problems, bank closures, and significant non-performing loans on the books of many banks continue to provide financial headwinds to the recovery. And clearly - as the headlines of the past week have highlighted - financial problems abroad still have the potential to result in slower U.S. exports, and may hold potential further problems for global financial institutions.\nIn sum, my view is that with inflation expectations stable, core PCE inflation rates declining, and significant excess capacity in the economy, accommodative monetary policy remains appropriate.\nThank you.",

        "content": "The Global Interdependence Center's Conference on \"Financial Interdependence in the World's Post-Crisis Capital Markets\" Philadelphia\nThank you, Charles, for your kind introduction. I am very happy to be here today, to offer some perspectives on central banking and systemic supervision in an interdependent world - and in particular some lessons from the past that may serve us well in the future.[Note]\nThe past three years have dramatically underscored the interdependence of the world's financial institutions and financial markets. The financial crisis also, by the way, increased awareness of the interdependence of the actions of monetary and fiscal authorities around the world. In light of the crisis and the reality of financial interdependence, the Federal Reserve expanded the types of policy actions it was willing to take. My view is that our openness to innovative measures was critical to avoiding far more severe outcomes - by which I mean cascading failures of financial firms and a locking up of liquidity and credit extension, further impeding households and companies and eventually leading to unemployment that far exceeds our current, far too high, level.\nHowever, I must also stress that the nation's \"financial crisis toolkit\" was, unfortunately, incomplete, resulting in the Federal Reserve needing to reluctantly take some controversial actions - notably as a result of government in general lacking adequate tools or powers to address the resolution (or \"winding down\" ) of certain institutions, especially systemically important nonbank financial firms. If the U.S. puts in place better resolution powers for such institutions, the Federal Reserve will not need to be involved in lending under unusual and exigent circumstances to systemically important institutions that we have no regulatory or supervisory powers over, to prevent even worse outcomes. Unfortunately, at this point the U.S. is operating with the same incomplete toolkit available to policymakers that we had before the crisis. I know that Congress is considering various proposals for financial regulatory reform. My hope is that establishing resolution authority for systemically important nonbank financial firms will be an area with broad bipartisan agreement and support for change.\nLooking Back, to Look Forward\nDespite the Fed's aggressive use of both traditional and non-traditional policy tools, the economy is experiencing a slow recovery from a very severe recession, particularly when it comes to jobs.[Footnote 1] Still, with recent events fresh in our minds it is an appropriate time to discuss the actions a central bank should take during a crisis - and in the periods that precede a crisis - and the tools and powers needed to help avoid future crises. Of course, policymakers and lawmakers are studying these matters right now.\nSo now is the time to be compiling and applying the lessons of the crisis and its lead-up. But as I've noted in other talks, we must learn the right lessons, not necessarily the commonly accepted ones. The generally accepted narrative does not always stand up to closer scrutiny, and reacting to these narratives might lead to the wrong remedies. When you consider the human toll of this financial crisis and recession, nothing is more important than making sure we parse out and learn the \"real\" lessons. Otherwise the fixes may miss the mark and invite unintended consequences.\nSo today I would like to pose some key questions: Did monetary policy cause the housing bubble that played such a large role in this crisis? Was it, as some have suggested, mainly due to the Fed keeping rates too low for too long, after the 2001 recession? Or should our attention be less on monetary policy and more on supervisory policy? Looking forward, what are the best remedies to avoid a similar crisis in the future? Do we need traditional supervision done better, as some assume, or do we need something quite different? And does the recent financial crisis and recession suggest, as some say, that the central bank should not be involved in supervising financial institutions and mitigating financial instability, going forward?\nAgain, my focus is on avoiding future financial crises. In that spirit, I will touch on the ways that the Federal Reserve could and should use a combination of monetary and supervisory tools to foster better macroeconomic outcomes. To do this, I will look back at our recent economic history - specifically, the early part of the last decade[Footnote 2] - to investigate whether we could have employed a better mix of policy actions to strengthen the economy after the 2001 recession while avoiding the buildup of financial imbalances that occurred - in other words, avoiding the bubble that eventually burst.\nCauses of the Crisis?\nAs we unpack these issues I should begin by emphasizing that understanding the causes of asset-price \"bubbles\" is very difficult. Most economists are uncharacteristically humble in admitting their ignorance about what causes asset prices to diverge from their fundamentals (in other words, what causes bubbles).\nStill, research by Boston Fed economists points to a clear role for house prices in the recent crises. The rapid ascent of house prices - which started in 1998, accelerated in 2004, and reversed in 2006 - is in our view central to understanding the eventual challenges. The expectation of rising prices provided the incentive for potential homeowners to invest more in housing, and made them - and their lenders - more comfortable with putting relatively little money down. Rising prices also mitigated the risk to institutions and investors that held assets based on these mortgages. After all, as long as prices continued to rise, mortgage holders who got into financial trouble could sell or refinance rather than default, insulating the holders of their mortgages from financial loss. This encouraged more relaxed credit standards, including low downpayments. Of course, a higher loan-to-value ratio exposed the homeowner and the lender to risk should prices fall significantly, but this risk was judged to be minimal. House prices were expected to continue rising.\nThere is evidence that financial institutions understood the risks that would arise if house prices fell, but assigned too low a probability to this potential outcome. Thus they were woefully unprepared to weather the consequences when prices did indeed fall. Many investors believed that rising house prices made the possibility of significant losses on securitized pools of subprime loans remote.[Footnote 3] They realized that a significant decline in house prices would indeed cause subprime securitization deals to suffer enormous losses, but assigned a very low (or nonexistent) probability to the sort of drop in house prices that actually occurred. Although some housing experts had raised concerns that the rise in housing prices was not sustainable, noting unusually high ratios of house prices to income or rent, most took comfort in the fact that nominal housing prices had not fallen at the national level since World War II. Even the pessimistic forecasts tended to envision a gradual leveling off of prices rather than an outright decline.\nThe story fits with the notion of a classic bubble. The key feature of a bubble is that investors willingly pay high prices not because of the asset's intrinsic value, but because they believe some other investor will pay more for it in the future. The other key element of a bubble is that it almost always bursts.\nAll of this implies an important role for supervisors in undertaking scenario analyses that would make clear the exposures to such risks, both for individual institutions and for the financial system as a whole. I will return to this theme in a moment.\nDid Monetary Policy Cause the Bubble?\nAgain, understanding asset bubbles is not easy. One of the most prevalent theories on the source of the bubble involves the low interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve during the recovery from the 2001 recession, when the federal funds rate remained quite low - staying at 1 percent from June 2003 to June 2004 (Figure 1).\nLet's look closely at the episode. At the time, the rationale for maintaining such a low federal funds rate seemed clear. That rationale is summarized in the FOMC's outlook for inflation and unemployment. Figure 2 shows the internal Board of Governors staff forecast - a well-respected input to the FOMC's policy deliberations - for core inflation and unemployment as of the end of 2003. At the time, the Board staff had forecast that the unemployment rate would gradually fall to 5 percent over the next two years, while core inflation (as measured by changes in the core consumer price index or CPI) would edge down slightly and remain around 1.5 percent. Five percent was the staff estimate of \"full employment\" at that time; so to put this another way, the unemployment rate was expected to be above the full employment level for the next two years. Meanwhile, inflation was expected to be low.[Footnote 4]\nWhile the unemployment forecast was spot on, the inflation forecast was, in contrast, too low. Actual inflation was higher and more erratic. Had the Federal Reserve's inflation forecast been more accurate, monetary policy might have been somewhat less accommodative.\nAdditionally, in the post-September 11 environment, potential downside risks to the economy from other terrorist attacks were a concern. Policymakers were also anxious not to repeat the mistakes of their Japanese counterparts in the 1990s, who had withdrawn support prematurely, leading to deflation and a lost decade of economic growth.\nSo, did accommodative interest rates fuel the housing bubble? Actually, the relationship between interest rates and bubbles is not as obvious as one might think. Figure 3 highlights the federal funds rate and the 30-year fixed mortgage rate. While the 30-year rate declined during the period of federal funds rate easing, the drop was relatively modest relative to the decline in the fed funds rate. Over the 10 years shown in the chart, the 30 year mortgage rate averaged 5.99 percent; while during the one-year period when the federal funds rate was 1 percent, the 30-year mortgage rate averaged 5.51 percent. As the federal funds rate increased in 2005 and 2006, the 30-year mortgage rate fluctuated close to the 10 year average.\nSo mortgage rates were a bit lower while Fed policy was accommodative - but not dramatically lower.[Footnote 5] Most economic models of housing price movements would suggest that such relatively modest fluctuations in mortgage rates - less than half a percent - would produce only modest changes in house prices.[Footnote 6]\nMoreover, contrary to the generally-assumed narrative, the empirical link between periods with low interest rates and asset bubbles is not particularly strong. Generally speaking, lower interest rates lead to higher prices for a wide variety of assets, but they do not necessarily lead people to expect continued increases in asset prices - that key characteristic of a bubble that I mentioned a moment ago.\nIn addition, house prices also rose rapidly in other countries - in many cases more rapidly than in the United States. See Figure 4. Ireland and Spain, in particular, witnessed dramatic booms in house prices - and subsequent declines. Note that in contrast Germany, which had the same monetary policy as Ireland and Spain, did not experience a dramatic increase. All this makes it difficult to root an explanation for the bubble entirely in the choices made by U.S. monetary policymakers.\nI am not saying that low rates could have had no role in moving housing prices higher. But I suspect the booming demand for real estate derived in large measure from incorrect expectations that housing prices would not fall, rather than from the short-run effect on housing demand of low short-term rates and slightly lowered mortgage rates.\nPolicy Responses\nIf we cannot predict when bubbles will happen - or even, as many suggest, identify their presence - then what can policymakers do? Financial policymakers can ameliorate the problems that bubbles cause by taking a forward-looking and systemic view of financial risk regulation. Traditional \"prudential\" supervision tends to focus on areas of high risk at individual institutions. Systemic or \"macroprudential\" supervision needs to focus on possible misperceptions (and mispricing) of risk more generally and the way that risk is dispersed throughout the system, directly and indirectly. More scenario analysis, such as that done in the so-called \"stress test\" of large institutions last year, needs to be a focus for future systemic supervision - whether accomplished by a given agency or a council charged with systemic oversight.\nIn the financial context, forward-looking risk regulation focused on scenario analysis may have done a better job of identifying potential risks from a bursting bubble. Properly done, scenario analysis would have highlighted the sensitivity of financial institutions to various risks, like falling house prices. Not that this is easy to do. But certainly it is realistic to say that scenario analysis could have identified that values and ratings of subprime securities (especially the most exotic) were extraordinarily sensitive to assumptions for which no one had especially good information. This suggests the need, going forward, for more \"stress-test\" type exercises - to first identify, and then address,[Footnote 7] emerging risks.\nTraditional bank supervision tends to focus on the current condition of a firm by identifying write-downs of nonperforming assets and validating the ratings of loans and the adequacy of reserves. This partly reflects the current focus in accounting on incurred losses. In contrast, the systemic supervision that is needed would focus on possible future losses and is inherently forward-looking. Doing this well requires an understanding not only of institutions but also markets, and it requires taking into account the full range of outcomes, both expected and potential - including those that have a low likelihood of occurring but that could have serious adverse consequences. While we may not be able to eliminate all bubbles, we should be able to limit the degree to which the financial sector feeds and propagates these booms, and the sector's vulnerability to subsequent busts.\nSuch work is particularly well suited for the Fed. Its role as \"lender of last resort\" (where we lend at a penalty rate and have never had a Discount Window loss), its responsibility for bank supervision, and its constant monitoring of the economy provide the Federal Reserve with a unique window on financial-stability issues. It is a serious gap that there is no assigned responsibility for forward-looking, systemic risk supervision - and filling this gap in some way is probably the highest priority in regulatory reform.\nI would also emphasize the systemic nature of optimal supervision and regulation, because another aspect of achieving financial stability involves understanding the interdependence of financial institutions. Ideally, supervisors should have a good idea of how a failure of one institution would impact its counterparties; as well as the circumstances under which a large number of institutions would become insolvent. Most accounts of the financial crisis make clear how concern about counterparty risk fuelled panic among market participants. It also weighed mightily on policymakers trying to cobble together solutions to the crisis.\nIt goes without saying that understanding counterparty risk can be exceptionally complicated. Large financial institutions have a variety of subsidiaries around the world. As a result of acquisitions they often have legacy information systems that can make it difficult to aggregate their true counterparty exposure to one entity. Certainly this is an area where financial institutions and regulators need to do more work, to be better prepared for any future crises.\nAs part of scenario analysis, firms should be asked by supervisors to provide information on counterparties and exposure, to examine how major counterparty failures would affect them - and, if possible, how their own failure would impact their major counterparties. The regulators should then be able to compare results across institutions to get a better appreciation of, and ability to monitor, the counterparty risk.\nWe want analysts within a given financial institution to realize their firm would take big losses if, for example, a particular asset price were to fall. A systemic supervisor, conducting similar analyses across a variety of institutions, could see if others were in similar shape. And even if this supervisor saw only a small chance of a \"meltdown\" scenario for a particular asset price, they could evaluate the impact and perhaps conclude that the chance of a cascading systemic financial crisis was too big of a chance to take.\nOf course, it is also important to understand under what economic or financial situations such problems might rear their heads. Supervisors need to collect this information regularly, and some public reporting of interconnectedness would provide the public with a useful understanding of the risks inherent in the institutions, markets, and systems on which they rely.\nConcluding Observations\nTo conclude, I would just stress that supervisory tools can and should provide an alternative to monetary policy actions for addressing bubbles or other imbalances in certain areas of the economy or financial system. If we take a good hard analytical look at the last recovery, we see that the low fed funds rate was not the standout, and standalone, culprit that many assume. This is a crucial matter to consider right now, when rates are very low - in my opinion, totally appropriately - because some are predicting that these rates will fuel another bubble.\nFinancial regulatory reform needs to address who has responsibility for regulating and supervising systemic risk as well as who has responsibility for regulating and supervising systemically important institutions. In particular, reform should enhance the potential to wind down or resolve systemically important institutions that are failing. This is critical to avoiding future crises.\nBecause of the substantial synergies between monetary policy, the lender-of-last-resort role, and supervision of banks, I believe the Federal Reserve should play a significant role in overseeing systemically important institutions and addressing systemic risks. It is also important that the Federal Reserve continue to supervise community banks, which provide a window on lending to small businesses and other bank-dependent borrowers. The reality is that supervisory policies should not be independent of monetary policy - and similarly monetary policy should not be conducted without the valuable insights gained from supervision of large and small banks. Understanding the business cycle and its potential impact on the institutions under supervision should be integral to bank supervision and to understanding systemic risk. And supervisory powers provide an important alternative tool to traditional monetary policy as a way to address bubbles and insure the best possible economic outcome.\nThe crisis has highlighted how undesirable it is for the U.S. central bank to have to be involved in the rescue of individual institutions. However, it has also reinforced the important role that the central bank can and should play in maintaining financial stability. Remember that concerns over financial instability and the experience of financial panics were key motivations for the founding of the Federal Reserve by Congress. No one is happy with the current state of the economy and the suffering of so many Americans who seek jobs or face foreclosure. But the Federal Reserve's efforts to help maintain financial stability have averted much worse outcomes.\nI believe the Federal Reserve can and should be more focused on financial stability issues going forward. As a result, whatever actions are taken in Washington with regulatory reform, it is in everyone's interest that any changes not impede the ability of the Federal Reserve to be a lender of last resort or to troubleshoot the functioning of financial markets during a crisis.\nWith all this in mind, I would say that legislation that does not provide a significant supervisory and systemic responsibility for the Federal Reserve risks making us as a nation even less prepared for the next crisis than we were for this one.\nThank you.",

        "content": "The Connecticut Business , Industry Association and the MetroHartford Alliance Economic Summit , Outlook 2010 Hartford, Connecticut\nI am very pleased to be back at this important event, focused on the economy in the year ahead. I thank Jim Smith for that generous introduction, and the CBIA and the MetroHartford Alliance for inviting me to share my perspectives with you. [Note]\nAs we begin a new year, financial markets are in a much better state than they were a year ago. Interest spreads reflecting a \"panic premium\" on risk have narrowed to more normal levels, markets have resumed much more normal trading patterns, and the Federal Reserve is likely to be able to wind down many of its emergency lending facilities without any adverse impacts, as soon as next month - as the Federal Open Market Committee affirmed in its statement last month.\nBut despite the improvement in financial conditions, the recovery in the real economy has proceeded more slowly - with the declines in the first half of 2009 turning to slow but positive growth in the third quarter, and what appears to be stronger growth in the fourth quarter. This is resulting, in part, from firms less aggressively cutting inventories as their sales prospects improve. [Footnote 1]\nIn sum it seems to me that growth will be positive, but slow enough that unemployment remains much higher than I would like. I would be happy if in hindsight it is clear I have been too pessimistic. But as I see it, the economy faces three significant \"headwinds.\"\nFirst, while the banking crisis has passed, banking problems remain. Most economies that experience significant banking problems have been slow to recover, and that is likely to be true this time in the U.S. Loans at banks have declined over the past several quarters, as many businesses are constrained by their balance sheets and reluctant to take on new debt. [Footnote 2] Many banks are also concerned with their balance sheets - and particularly their capital ratios [Footnote 3] -- and have restrained their terms of lending to avoid taking on too much additional risk, given that they are still working through problems with existing loans.\nSecond, consumers and businesses will likely remain cautious - which is consistent with positive but slow growth. Consumption will continue to be subdued, as consumers are fully aware that housing prices are well off their peak, unemployment rates are high, and home foreclosures are continuing. Consumer caution and the desire to rebuild savings will likely result in some increase in the savings rate, which is of course good in the long run but dampens growth in the short term. Many businesses seem likely to only gradually expand investment, at least until they are more confident that the economy will continue expanding even after some of the stimulative government support winds down. Also, many businesses may be limited in how much external funding they can raise.\nThe third headwind involves the fact that recessions this severe have broader ramifications for labor markets. Workers become discouraged and leave the labor force, while the skills of workers that are unemployed for long periods may atrophy, and new entrants in the labor market often have to settle for jobs at levels below what they would be offered in a more robust economy.\nIndeed, to most Americans, economic prospects are better measured by an expansion of jobs rather than growth in GDP. So I would like to spend the rest of my time with you reviewing some of the patterns we have seen in labor markets during early stages of previous recoveries. Of course, given the severity of this recession, consumer and business behavior this time may be somewhat more restrained than in past recoveries.\nTo reveal a bit of the \"punch line,\" my conclusions from the analysis I am about to walk through are that the employment response in the last two recoveries was much slower than it was in the two earlier recoveries in the 1970s and 1980s. [Footnote 4] And unfortunately the financial headwinds, lingering labor market problems, and a cautious attitude of consumers and businesses in the wake of the financial crisis make it likely that recovery in employment terms will also be slow this time.\nUnfortunately, I expect a rather slow recovery in output, and a rather slow recovery in employment given the level of output growth - and I will explain why, this morning. But since unemployment is so fundamentally important, I think it is good to study our labor markets and earlier recovery periods so policymakers, businesses, and workers can anticipate and adapt to the experience we are likely to see.\nIn addition, I would note that during the early phases of a recovery, improvements in unemployment tend to lag those in the economy. But the strength of the recovery is partly dependent on how confident businesses and consumers are becoming that the economy will be able to grow fast enough for tangible progress in labor markets and the recovery will become self sustaining.\nEmployment Patterns in the First Year of Recovery\nAllow me to walk you through a few slides that help illustrate employment patterns in the first year of recoveries.\nGDP growth in the just-completed fourth quarter of 2009 looks like it will prove to have been stronger than in the third quarter, a result largely driven by businesses bringing their significant inventory draw-down to a close.\nAs shown in Figure 1, this is not unusual for the first year of a recovery. Consider the following logic. The difference between real GDP and real final sales is the change in inventories. In the first year of the recovery from the four previous recessions, real GDP grew faster than real final sales. This shows how the normalizing of inventories has been an important source of economic growth in the early stages of most recoveries.\nThe figure shows that the smallest inventory response was in the recovery in the early 1990s. Since inventories are often bank-financed, so-called headwinds provided by the troubles in the banking system that result in credit constraints are, unfortunately, a potential source of restraint on inventory replenishment now, as then. Indeed, research I have done with colleagues Joe Peek and Geoff Tootell confirms that inventory buildup tends to be more restrained during periods of significant banking problems.\nThus today, as in the early 1990s, inventory levels became quite low during this recession as businesses prepared for the worst, and I expect that inventory buildup will be an important source of growth - but also that it will likely be more restrained than one might have otherwise expected, because of tighter credit conditions.\nFigure 2 shows that the past two recoveries did not feature job growth in the first year of the recovery, in sharp contrast to the recoveries of the 1970s and 1980s. The past two recessions had positive economic growth in the first year of the recovery, but it was not rapid enough to generate job growth. In contrast, in the recoveries in the 1970s and 1980s, growth was sufficient to yield employment growth in the first year of the recovery.\nFigure 3 illustrates another pattern typical of recoveries. While there has been a longstanding downward trend in the average weekly hours of production workers, it is common for average hours to decline more steeply during a recession. Note that in prolonged recessions, where the shading is the widest, average weekly hours decline more significantly - as workers are placed on shortened work weeks.\nAs the economy begins to recover, businesses will restore the hours of such workers before hiring additional new workers. Note that in our current recession, there was a significant decline in the hours of production workers, which are just beginning to show signs of a rebound.\nAnother harbinger of a recovery in employment is growth in temporary services. Firms often extend work weeks and hire temporary workers before committing to hiring permanent workers. As Figure 4 highlights, the use of temporary workers fell quite dramatically during the recession, but has been rebounding more recently. Of course temporary jobs reduce the unemployment rate, and provide a needed bridge for workers looking for, but not yet finding, more permanent employment. But when businesses become more confident of the strength of the recovery, they will begin to hire permanent workers rather than rely on temporary workers.\nLabor-Market Dynamics that Impact Employment Growth\nNow I would like to explore with you some of the labor-market dynamics that will likely restrain employment growth in this recovery.\nThe severity of a recession can have a significant impact on how quickly firms resume hiring. As Figure 5 shows, this recession was quite severe in a number of respects. This recession was much longer than typical, making it difficult for those that lost their jobs to find employment. Research has highlighted the fact that workers that have been unemployed for extended periods can have significant difficulty being rehired. It may be that their skills atrophy, or just that their sector of the economy is particularly hard-hit. And potential employers may worry about the underlying reasons for the long unemployment spell.\nAs shown in the figure, currently the percentage of the unemployed who have been out of work for 27 weeks or more is much higher than in previous recessions, at just under 40 percent. This is likely to be one impediment to our seeing significant, speedy declines in unemployment.\nThe next set of challenges is related to the lack of business confidence that I cited earlier. Businesses are most likely to hire new workers when they are confident that their sales and orders will increase significantly for an extended period of time. Absent this confidence, businesses have at their disposal several alternatives for deploying more labor without incurring all the costs entailed in new hires.\nThe first of these alternatives is reflected in the blue line in Figure 6. Roughly 6 percent of the labor force is working part time for reasons related to the economy. Such a high percentage of workers being placed on part time work schedules is, as you can see in the figure, much higher than in the past two recessions - and was last at these levels in the 1980s.\nMany workers reflected in these data had their schedules reduced to part time because employers want to retain them but did not have sufficient work to keep them on full time. Before an employer is likely to do any significant new hiring, they will usually return these workers to full time work. While that defers new hiring, it does of course mean additional income for the worker.\nA second alternative to permanent hires is evident in the data for weekly overtime, which declined quite significantly during this recession, as shown in Figure 7. Businesses frequently will not only restore the aforementioned workers to full time status, but also begin incurring overtime before making the investment in new hires. While there has been some rebound in overtime work, you can see in the figure that it remains well below pre-recession levels.\nA final alternative to employment growth is improving the efficiency of the existing work force. In recent quarters, employers have found ways to produce more goods with fewer workers. While a more productive work force is very good news for the economy in the long run, it lessens the need for hiring in the short run.\nThe combination of these labor market challenges and the headwinds from problems in the banking sector make it quite likely that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually. While layoffs are subsiding, in sum it seems that new hiring is likely only after employers more fully utilize existing employees.\nIndustry Patterns\nNow I would like to share some thoughts on various industries and recoveries.\nFigure 8 shows the changes that have occurred in the industrial mix of employment over the past 30 years. Overall, much less of the work force is employed in manufacturing, which has fallen from 21 percent of the work force to only 9 percent of the work force now. The two areas that have increased significantly are professional and business services, and education and health services - both areas that have tended to be less responsive to economic downturns.\nGiven the difficulties in predicting overall employment trends going forward, it is even more difficult to determine which industries are likely to be engines of growth. However, it is instructive to see which industries, in the past, have tended to grow in the first year of a recovery.\nFigure 9 shows four industries that have tended to perform well in the first year of a recovery - professional and business services, education and health services, leisure and hospitality, and to a lesser extent government. The first three are areas that have increased their share of total employment, and all have tended to be less sensitive to economic downturns.\nWhile it is quite possible that these areas will grow in the initial stages of this recovery, that growth is likely to be restrained by various factors. In education and health services, there is the matter of the significant retrenchment in college endowments, and uncertainty as national health reform proposals are debated in Washington. Government spending grew modestly in the first year of the past recoveries from recessions. This time, however, the outlook for government employment remains quite dim - as federal, state, and city governments struggle with rather severe revenue shortfalls and budget issues.\nProfessional and business services, and leisure and hospitality, have often increased employment in the first year of a recovery; however, the degree has been significantly less in the past two recoveries compared to the 1980s (and in fact negative for professional and business services in 2001-2002). The strength in these sectors this time around will depend on how quickly consumer and business confidence returns.\nFigure 10 highlights industries that have had more mixed results in the first year of a recovery and are uncertain this time as well. While construction employment will be restrained by low housing prices and elevated foreclosures - and commercial construction employment is restrained in many areas by falling commercial real estate prices and high vacancy rates - employment levels in these sectors have experienced such significant declines that we may still see some rebound.\nThe behavior of the consumer will help determine employment in manufacturing and retail trade. It is unclear how willing consumers will be to increase spending once the government's various stimulus programs abate. If consumption is relatively restrained, as many expect, then these sectors are not likely to hire significantly until consumers become more confident. On the bright side, though, a potential upside to manufacturing employment is the strong growth occurring in some emerging economies and prevailing exchange rates that favor U.S. exports.\nConcluding Observations\nTo sum up my remarks and conclude, I think we can gain insights on this recovery from the experience and trends of the past. Certainly for economies that experience substantial financial shocks, recovery is normally quite slow. While inventory rebuilding will likely provide some spark, the strength of underlying demand as government stimulus subsides is an open question.\nThe employment picture overall has improved, and the outlook is certainly much brighter than one year ago. Layoffs are abating, although many firms are not yet ready to do new permanent hiring. Any significant hiring will likely have to wait while current labor resources are more fully utilized.\nSo it appears that this recovery will likely experience only a slow improvement in the employment picture, and that the unemployment rate will remain quite elevated during the early phases of the recovery. GDP growth is expected to be strong enough to produce some employment growth, but that rate of employment expansion will not likely be rapid enough to put a large dent in the unemployment rate.\nOur research and analysis at the Boston Fed suggests that with significant capacity in labor markets, wages and salaries and the ability of businesses to increase prices are all likely to be restrained, resulting in little immediate inflationary pressures. In my view this should allow for accommodative monetary policy to continue to support the economy until the underlying demand of consumers and businesses becomes self-sustaining.\nThank you again for inviting me to speak with you today. I do wish each of you solid improvements in your businesses in the year ahead, and better economic times for all New Englanders as the recovery proceeds. Thank you.",
