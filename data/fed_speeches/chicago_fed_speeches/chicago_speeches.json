In particular, I'd like to focus on a key element to the outlook: housing markets.\n\nGrowth outlook\nTo start, it is useful to remember the Federal Reserve's two objectives for monetary policy: maximum sustainable economic growth and price stability. When assessing sustainable growth, we often use a benchmark called potential output growth—or potential GDP growth. GDP, or gross domestic product, is our broadest measure of economic output. This potential growth rate of the economy depends primarily on how fast productivity grows and how fast the labor force grows.\n\nAs you know, productivity measures how much output can be produced by an hour of work, and it receives most of the attention. It is the fundamental determinant of our standard of living. During the past decade, we have seen a dramatic pick-up in productivity growth. It had averaged less than 1-1/2 percent per year between the early 1970s and mid-1990s, but since then it has averaged over 2-1/2 percent per year.\n\nThe sector with the most dramatic acceleration in productivity is manufacturing. Beginning in the 1970s, manufacturers increasingly used technology to improve efficiencies in all aspects of their businesses. Many manufacturers began investing in computer numerical code machine tools, which cut curves as easily as straight lines and build complex 3-D structures efficiently. Some have set up computer networks with their suppliers, to facilitate automatic ordering. And one snack maker even used a supercomputer to study the aerodynamics of its potato chips after it found that too many were flying off the assembly line. With these advances in technology and better management of the workplace in general, manufacturing productivity growth took off, averaging 2.9 percent per year in the 1980s, 3.8 percent in the 1990s, and then 5.0 percent over the past 5 years.\n\nThese productivity gains are good for the country overall. But we should recognize that sometimes productivity gains require difficult changes for firms and workers. The human costs can be significant, as individual workers are forced to switch jobs or move into new industries. Many of these costs have been felt acutely here in the Midwest.\n\nI do not want to minimize the impact of the job losses associated with changes in the economy, no matter what their source. We should strive to ease the transition for the impacted workers and their families, whether it is through financial assistance, retraining programs, or other efforts.\n\nBut dynamic changes in the economy are important if we are to continue to increase overall incomes and our standard of living. Commentators often point to our manufacturing job losses as a sign that we are losing our edge in manufacturing. In fact, the job losses are an unfortunate consequence of the strength of productivity in the manufacturing sector. Even as the number of manufacturing jobs declines, factories in the United States are producing record volumes of machinery, computers, plastics, and other manufactured goods, and in general they are producing them at lower costs—all due to strong productivity growth.\n\nIndeed, the underlying trends in productivity for manufacturing and other sectors of the economy remain quite solid today. I went to the International Manufacturing Technology Show this summer and was impressed by the amount of new technology and tools in development. I was probably most impressed by one device that was similar to an ink jet printer, only it uses metal dust to \"print\" three-dimensional parts. These innovations and others should continue to support gains in productivity and, by extension, a healthy growth rate of the economy's potential output.\n\nThe other factor that affects potential output, the size of the available labor force, receives less attention. But as our demographics change, it deserves more scrutiny. Growth in the population over 16 has slowed over the past 10 years and is projected to slow a bit further over the coming decade. The labor force participation rate—the share of the working-age population that is working or actively looking for a job—is also declining and expected to continue to trend down, as more baby boomers retire.\n\nThese developments have important implications for our benchmarks for the monthly employment statistics. Earlier in the decade, most economists estimated that job growth of about 150,000 per month was consistent with an economy expanding near potential. However, research at the Chicago Fed and elsewhere suggests that, given the slower growth in the labor force, monthly increases of roughly 100,000 are most likely consistent with potential.1 This transition has not yet been fully appreciated by many market observers. Job growth has averaged 138,000 over the past six months. By the old standard, 138,000 would have been slightly subpar. But given current trends in the labor force, such growth is quite solid. Indeed, labor market conditions have been strong enough that the unemployment rate has declined to just under 4-1/2 percent, further evidence of tight labor markets.\n\nThe changes in labor force growth also imply that, in the absence of changes in productivity trends, our estimates of potential GDP growth should be revised down somewhat to around 3 percent.\n\nAgainst this 3 percent benchmark, it is clear that the actual GDP growth rate of 3-1/2 percent that we experienced during the past few years is not sustainable today. A deceleration to average or even below average growth rates—as we have seen recently—is only natural.\n\nReal GDP increased at a 2.2 percent rate in the third quarter. Similarly, the National Activity Index, which is a barometer of economic growth published by the Chicago Fed, has moved down in recent months, and the data for October were consistent with an economy expanding at below-average growth rates. Part of the slowdown reflects the natural moderation in growth.\n\nA significant part, though, was due to developments in the housing sector. Residential investment has fallen 7.7 percent year-to-date, and in the third quarter it shaved 1.2 percentage points off of GDP growth. Additionally, home prices have been rising more slowly and by some measures have even declined. These developments raise important questions for the economy as a whole: Will there be further declines in housing markets? And will the current declines and any further declines in housing lead to more general economic weakness?\n\nHere, it's important to remember the positive longer-run fundamentals underpinning housing demand. Since the mid-1990s, the housing capital stock—which reflects the number of homes in the U.S. as well as their size and quality—has been growing about 3 percent per year on average.\n\nThis demand for housing has been supported by the step-up in productivity growth, which improved the long-run income prospects for Americans. Furthermore, financial innovations lowered borrowing costs and greatly increased access to credit. As a result, the homeownership rate in the U.S. has increased from 64 percent in the mid-1990s to 69 percent in 2005, with improvements across nearly all demographic and income groups. And many people have put their money into bigger and better homes. Over the past decade, the size of a typical new home increased nearly 20 percent, and many homeowners invested in home improvements and renovations. Today, many middle-class homes have bigger kitchens and more bathrooms, and it's not uncommon to see some with state-of-the-art media rooms.\n\nNonetheless, with underlying housing demand growing 3 percent per year, the large gains in residential investment—which averaged 8-1/2 percent per year between 2001 and 2005—clearly could not continue indefinitely. Moreover, housing demand may slow to less than 3 percent, as demographics point to slower growth in household formation. As a result, we at the Chicago Fed expect some further weakness in residential construction.\n\nBy themselves, the declines in residential investment could contribute to some volatile numbers for overall GDP growth. But their direct impact on the economy is limited by the relative size of residential investment. Home construction is on average only about 5 percent of GDP—that's about the same as people spend on recreation items such as books, golf clubs, and tickets to theater and opera.\n\nIn order to generate more general economic weakness, the housing slowdown would have to spill over into other sectors of the economy. One avenue for this to occur is through home prices. We all know that home prices have soared during the past five years. The factors that caused fundamental increases in the demand for housing should be reflected to some degree in higher home prices. But there is still a risk that prices have also been boosted by factors unrelated to demand fundamentals. If that is the case, prices in some regions could unwind and reduce residential construction. And the negative wealth effects from softening house prices could reduce consumption more than anticipated.\n\nCurrently, we do not see the slowing in housing markets spilling over into a more prolonged period of weakness in the U.S. economy overall. On balance, the 95 percent of the economy outside of housing remains on good footing. Employment has been increasing near its long-run sustainable pace. Productivity trends remain solid. Recent declines in oil prices should give household budgets a boost. Economic growth in other countries should increase demand for our exports. And current financial conditions are not very restrictive by historical norms.\n\nMy baseline forecast is that GDP growth will pick up from the weak third quarter and average somewhat below its potential growth rate over the next year or so. Of course, that's an average—I do expect to see some volatility in the numbers.\n\nHere in the Midwest, the outlook is more nuanced. While a significant risk to the national outlook is the fallout from the housing slowdown, that risk seems smaller here. Home construction did not quite boom here as it did elsewhere. And home price appreciation was more subdued here. The biggest home price gains in the U.S. were in cities such as Miami, Phoenix, and Las Vegas. In southeast Wisconsin, the run-up in home prices was slightly below the national average during the past five years. Other parts of the Midwest, particularly Michigan and Indiana, did not have any run-up at all. These movements suggest that home prices in the region have been little influenced by factors unrelated to demand fundamentals.\n\nInstead, the biggest risk to the regional economy relates to the struggles of the auto industry. Light vehicle sales have slowed somewhat from the pace of the past two years. Furthermore, customer tastes have been shifting from large pick-ups and SUVs to more fuel-efficient vehicles. In response, the Big 3 automakers have been cutting light truck production to get their inventories in line with sales. Many of those cuts have been felt acutely here in the Midwest, restraining local economic activity. And ongoing restructuring efforts by the Big 3 will likely continue to contribute to relatively sluggish growth in the region.\n\nNonetheless, all of the news in the auto industry isn't negative. The so-called transplants—the Toyotas, Hondas, and other foreign-brand vehicles assembled in the U.S.—continue to sell well. Indiana and several southern states have had some success attracting transplants, bringing with them additional jobs supplying auto parts to the assembly plants. Most recently, Honda announced that it is going to open an assembly plant in Greensburg, Indiana, that will employ 2000 workers when it comes on line in 2008.\n\nInflation outlook\nFor Fed policymakers, the national growth outlook is only one piece of the puzzle. The other is inflation. Many policymakers assess inflation with a comfort zone—that is, a range for inflation that they feel is consistent with their view of price stability.\n\nBy my standards, inflation has been too high. I prefer to see it between 1 and 2 percent. But the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, also known as core PCE, has been running at or above 2 percent for 30 months, and in October it was 2.4 percent. In part, core inflation has been elevated because businesses have raised their prices in response to earlier increases in energy costs. High levels of resource utilization also have added more generally to inflationary pressures.\n\nLooking ahead, core inflation likely will come down somewhat over time. The recent declines in oil prices clearly are a positive factor. And the expected deceleration in economic growth will help avoid sustained pressures from resource constraints.\n\nOf course, there are risks to the inflation outlook. We could see further cost shocks, or we could be wrong about reduced pressures from resource constraints. Long periods of high resource utilization are often associated with rising costs and prices. As recently as 2000, the unemployment rate fell below 4 percent and \"Help Wanted\" signs were everywhere. Businesses offered attractive wages to many workers, and these costs were passed along in the form of higher core consumer price inflation. Today, the unemployment rate has fallen to 4.4 percent and labor markets have tightened. Compensation per hour, which includes benefits as well as wages and salaries, appears to have accelerated somewhat above the 4 percent range seen in 2004 and 2005. With productivity growth reverting from exceptionally strong growth rates, unit labor costs are also accelerating. Some of this increase in costs has been absorbed by businesses in the form of lower profit margins, and there may still be room for margins to absorb some further pay increases. But the risk remains that labor cost pressures will show through to inflation.\n\nThe recent price data have been consistent with some easing in inflation. But that is only one month. The key is whether that trend can be sustained and how quickly inflation will move back to the range that is commensurate with price stability. If actual inflation continues at high levels, it could cause inflation expectations to run too high. If firms and workers expect inflation to be high, they will want to compensate by raising prices and wages or building in plans for automatic increases. In this way, high inflation expectations can lead to persistently high actual inflation.\n\nPolicy implications\nTaking all of the factors on growth and inflation into account, my current assessment is that the risk of inflation remaining too high is greater than the risk of growth being too low. As reflected in the minutes of the October meeting, all Federal Open Market Committee members agreed that inflation risks remained the dominant concern. Thus, some additional firming of policy may yet be necessary to bring inflation back to a range consistent with price stability in a reasonable period of time. But that decision will depend on how the incoming data affect the outlook.\n\nIn each of our past three meetings, the FOMC has held the funds rate target at 5-1/4 percent. The Committee's decision to pause gives us more time to gather information on a number of important developments and assess their implications for the outlook for growth and inflation. And we were able to pause because inflation expectations have been contained. Nonetheless, we have to be vigilant in monitoring these expectations. If they did increase, it would be incumbent on the Federal Reserve to adjust policy to affirm our commitment to price stability.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, I am optimistic about the fundamentals of the U.S. economy. In the near term, we face some challenges from slowing residential investment and elevated inflation rates. But we have the ability to weather these challenges. Together with the Federal Reserve's commitment to its policy goals of sustainable growth and price stability, our nation's core economic values provide a solid foundation for the economy to expand over time.\n\n*The views presented here are my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.\n\n1 The methodology for forecasting labor force participation developed in Aaronson and Sullivan (2001) suggests that, currently, the participation rate is trending downward about 0.2 percentage point per year. Alternatively, Toosi (2005) forecasts a drop of about 0.1 percentage point per year over the next ten years, while Aaronson, et al. (2006) predict a drop of about 0.3 percentage point per year. Given that the working-age population is growing at a rate of about 1.2% per year, the median of these estimates implies a labor force growth rate of about 0.9% per year. On a base of around 135 million, this suggests monthly increases of approximately 100,000 for nonfarm payroll employment.

The human costs can be significant, as individual workers are forced to switch jobs or move into new industries. Many of these costs have been felt acutely here in the Midwest.\n\nI do not want to minimize the impact of the job losses associated with changes in the economy, no matter what their source. We should strive to ease the transition for the impacted workers and their families, whether it is through financial assistance, retraining programs, or other efforts.\n\nBut dynamic changes in the economy are important if we are to continue to increase overall incomes and our standard of living. Commentators often point to our manufacturing job losses as a sign that we are losing our edge in manufacturing. In fact, the job losses are an unfortunate consequence of the strength of productivity in the manufacturing sector. Even as the number of manufacturing jobs declines, factories in the United States are producing record volumes of machinery, computers, plastics, and other manufactured goods, and in general they are producing them at lower costs—all due to strong productivity growth.\n\nIndeed, the underlying trends in productivity for manufacturing and other sectors of the economy remain quite solid today. I went to the International Manufacturing Technology Show this summer and was impressed by the amount of new technology and tools in development. I was probably most impressed by one device that was similar to an ink jet printer, only it uses metal dust to \"print\" three-dimensional parts. These innovations and others should continue to support gains in productivity and, by extension, a healthy growth rate of the economy's potential output.\n\nThe other factor that affects potential output, the size of the available labor force, receives less attention. But as our demographics change, it deserves more scrutiny. Growth in the population over 16 has slowed over the past 10 years and is projected to slow a bit further over the coming decade. The labor force participation rate—the share of the working-age population that is working or actively looking for a job—is also declining and expected to continue to trend down, as more baby boomers retire.\n\nThese developments have important implications for our benchmarks for the monthly employment statistics. Earlier in the decade, most economists estimated that job growth of about 150,000 per month was consistent with an economy expanding near potential. However, research at the Chicago Fed and elsewhere suggests that, given the slower growth in the labor force, monthly increases of roughly 100,000 are most likely consistent with potential.1 This transition has not yet been fully appreciated by many market observers. Job growth was 92,000 last month, and the gains in September and August were revised up by a total of 139,000. As a result of these increases, job growth has averaged 138,000 over the past six months. By the old standard, 138,000 would have been slightly subpar. But given current trends in the labor force, such growth is quite solid. Indeed, labor market conditions have been strong enough that the unemployment rate has declined to just under 4-1/2 percent, further evidence of tight labor markets.\n\nThe changes in labor force growth also imply that, in the absence of changes in productivity trends, our estimates of potential GDP growth should be revised down somewhat to around 3 percent.\n\nAgainst this 3 percent benchmark, it is clear that the actual GDP growth rate of 3-1/2 percent that we experienced during the past few years is not sustainable today. A deceleration to average or even below average growth rates—as we have seen recently—is only natural.\n\nReal GDP increased at a 1.6 percent rate in the third quarter. Similarly, the National Activity Index, which is a barometer of economic growth published by the Chicago Fed, has moved down in recent months and is now consistent with an economy expanding at below-average growth rates. Part of the slowdown reflects the natural moderation in growth.\n\nA significant part, though, was due to developments in the housing sector. Residential investment has fallen 7-1/2 percent year-to-date, and in the third quarter it shaved 1.1 percentage points off of GDP growth. Additionally, home prices have been rising more slowly and by some measures have even declined. These developments raise important questions for the economy as a whole: Will there be further declines in housing markets? And will the current declines and any further declines in housing lead to more general economic weakness?\n\nHere, it's important to remember the positive longer-run fundamentals underpinning housing demand. Since the mid-1990s, the housing capital stock—which reflects the number of homes in the U.S. as well as their size and quality—has been growing about 3 percent per year on average.\n\nThis demand for housing has been supported by the step-up in productivity growth, which improved the long-run income prospects for Americans. Furthermore, financial innovations lowered borrowing costs and greatly increased access to credit. As a result, the homeownership rate in the U.S. has increased from 64 percent in the mid-1990s to 69 percent in 2005, with improvements across nearly all demographic and income groups. And many people have put their money into bigger and better homes. Over the past decade, the size of a typical new home increased nearly 20 percent, and many homeowners invested in home improvements and renovations.\n\nNonetheless, with underlying housing demand growing 3 percent per year, the large gains in residential investment—which averaged 8-1/2 percent per year between 2001 and 2005—clearly could not continue indefinitely. Moreover, housing demand may slow to less than 3 percent, as demographics point to slower growth in household formation. As a result, we at the Chicago Fed expect some further weakness in residential construction.\n\nBy themselves, the declines in residential investment could contribute to some volatile numbers for overall GDP growth, as we saw in the third quarter. But their direct impact on the economy is limited by the relative size of residential investment. Home construction is on average only about 5 percent of GDP—that's about the same as people spend on recreation items such as books, golf clubs, and tickets to theater and opera.\n\nIn order to generate more general economic weakness, the housing slowdown would have to spill over into other sectors of the economy. One avenue for this to occur is through home prices. We all know that home prices have soared during the past five years. The factors that caused fundamental increases in the demand for housing should be reflected to some degree in higher home prices. But there is still a risk that prices have also been boosted by factors unrelated to demand fundamentals. If that is the case, prices in some regions could unwind and reduce residential construction. And the negative wealth effects from softening house prices could reduce consumption more than anticipated.\n\nCurrently, we do not see the slowing in housing markets spilling over into a more prolonged period of weakness in the U.S. economy overall. On balance, the 95 percent of the economy outside of housing remains on good footing. Employment has been increasing near its long-run sustainable pace. Productivity trends remain solid. Recent declines in oil prices should give household budgets a boost. Economic growth in other countries should increase demand for our exports. And current financial conditions are not very restrictive by historical norms.\n\nMy baseline forecast is that GDP growth will pick up from the weak third quarter and average somewhat below its potential growth rate over the next year or so. Of course, that's an average—I do expect to see some volatility in the numbers.\n\nHere in Indiana, the outlook is more nuanced. While a significant risk to the national outlook is the fallout from the housing slowdown, that risk seems smaller here. Home construction did not quite boom here as it did elsewhere. Building permits in Indiana were little changed between 2001 and 2005, a time when permits increased by a third (32.7%) nationally. And home price appreciation was more subdued here. The biggest home price gains in the U.S. were in cities such as Miami, Phoenix, and Las Vegas. Indiana home prices have increased an average of 3.2 percent per year over the past five years, which was well below the national average (9.4%) and even a bit below Indiana's average annual gain since 1980 (3.6%) These movements suggest that home prices in Indiana have been little influenced by factors unrelated to demand fundamentals.\n\nInstead, the biggest risk to the regional economy relates to the struggles of the auto industry. Customer tastes have been shifting from large pick-ups and SUVs to more fuel-efficient vehicles. In response, the Big 3 automakers have been cutting light truck production to get their inventories in line with sales. Many of those cuts have been felt acutely here in the Midwest, restraining local economic activity. And ongoing restructuring efforts by the Big 3 will likely continue to contribute to relatively sluggish growth in the region.\n\nNonetheless, all of the news in the auto industry isn't negative. The so-called transplants—the Toyotas, Hondas, and other foreign-brand vehicles assembled in the U.S.—continue to sell well. Indiana has had some success attracting transplants to the state, bringing with them additional jobs supplying auto parts to the assembly plants. Most recently, Honda announced that it is going to open an assembly plant in Greensburg that will employ 2000 workers when it comes on line in 2008.\n\nInflation outlook\nFor Fed policymakers, the national growth outlook is only one piece of the puzzle. The other is inflation. Many policymakers assess inflation with a comfort zone—that is, a range for inflation that they feel is consistent with their view of price stability.\n\nBy my standards, inflation has been too high. I prefer to see it between 1 and 2 percent. But the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, also known as core PCE, has been running at or above 2 percent for 30 months, and in September it was 2.4 percent. So, further moderation in inflation is important. In part, core inflation has been elevated because businesses have raised their prices in response to earlier increases in energy costs. High levels of resource utilization also have added more generally to inflationary pressures.\n\nLooking ahead, it's likely that core inflation will come down somewhat over time. The recent declines in oil prices clearly are a positive factor. And the expected deceleration in economic growth will help avoid sustained pressures from resource constraints. Still, there is a risk that core inflation could run above 2 percent for some time. We could be wrong about reduced pressures from resource constraints, or we could see further cost shocks. And perhaps most importantly, if actual inflation continues at high levels, it could cause inflation expectations to run too high. If firms and workers expect inflation to be high, they will want to compensate by raising prices and wages or building in plans for automatic increases. In this way, high inflation expectations can lead to persistently high actual inflation.\n\nPolicy implications\nTaking all of the factors on growth and inflation into account, my current assessment is that the risk of inflation remaining too high is greater than the risk of growth being too low. Thus, some additional firming of policy may yet be necessary to bring inflation back to a range consistent with price stability in a reasonable period of time. But that decision will depend on how the incoming data affect the outlook.\n\nIn each of our past three meetings, the Federal Open Market Committee has held the funds rate target at 5-1/4 percent. The Committee's decision to pause gives us more time to gather information on a number of important developments and assess their implications for the outlook for growth and inflation. And we were able to pause because inflation expectations have been contained. Nonetheless, we have to be vigilant in monitoring these expectations. If they did increase, it would be incumbent on the Federal Reserve to adjust policy to affirm our commitment to price stability.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, I am optimistic about the fundamentals of the U.S. economy. In the near term, we face some challenges from slowing residential investment and elevated inflation rates. But we have the ability to weather these challenges. Together with the Federal Reserve's commitment to its policy goals of sustainable growth and price stability, our nation's core economic values provide a solid foundation for the economy to expand over time.\n\n*The views presented here are my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "This morning, I'll talk about the outlook for the economy and how it affects monetary policy. In particular, I'd like to focus on a key element to the outlook: housing markets.\n\nGrowth outlook\nTo start, it is useful to remember the Federal Reserve's two objectives for monetary policy: maximum sustainable economic growth and price stability. When assessing sustainable growth, we often use a benchmark called potential output growth—or potential GDP growth. GDP, or gross domestic product, is our broadest measure of economic output. The potential growth rate of the economy depends primarily on how fast productivity grows and how fast the labor force grows.\n\nProductivity, which measures how much output can be produced by an hour of work, receives most of the attention. It is the fundamental determinant of our standard of living. During the past decade, we have seen a dramatic pick-up in productivity growth. It had averaged less than 1-1/2 percent per year between the early 1970s and mid-1990s, but since then it has averaged over 2-1/2 percent per year.\n\nThe size of the available labor force receives less attention, but as our demographics change, it deserves more scrutiny. Two factors determine the growth in the labor force: growth in the population over 16—the working-age population—and the labor force participation rate, which is the share of the working-age population that is working or actively looking for a job.\n\nCurrently, both of these factors point to slower labor force gains. Growth in the working-age population has slowed over the past 10 years and is projected to slow a bit further over the coming decade. The participation rate is also declining and expected to continue to trend down, as more baby boomers retire.\n\nThese developments have important implications for our benchmarks for the monthly employment statistics.

These movements suggest that home prices in the region have been little influenced by factors unrelated to demand fundamentals.\n\nInstead, the biggest risk to the regional economy relates to the struggles of the auto industry. Customer tastes have been shifting from large pick-ups and SUVs to more fuel-efficient vehicles.

And ongoing restructuring efforts by the Big 3 will likely continue to contribute to relatively sluggish growth in the region.\n\nThe Chicago metro area will feel some of the declines in the auto industry. But Chicago is the business services hub for all of the Midwest. And fortunately, not all Midwest businesses are struggling, and many others continue to record strong sales. Such growth, along with continued U.S. economic expansion, is lifting Chicagoland employment.\n\nInflation outlook\nFor Fed policymakers, the national growth outlook is only one piece of the puzzle.

            "content": "Good morning. I'm Michael Moskow, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. On behalf of the Chicago Fed and our cosponsor, the Midwestern Higher Education Compact, I would like to welcome you to today's conference, \"Can Higher Education Foster Economic Growth?\" This is the second conference that the bank has sponsored on understanding the trends affecting higher education and the economic impact of colleges and universities on the economy.\n\nAt last year's conference we heard a great deal about the need for higher education institutions to take a more active role in the economy. As a sector of the economy, higher education already represents a major employer, producer of human capital, and R&D center. However, some suggest that this role should be expanded, with higher education directly influencing the development of key industries and specific local economic opportunities. At the outset, I have to profess that I am no fan of industrial policy, and there are aspects of this university engagement model that strike me as having an industrial policy flavor. The ability to predict where the next big industry will emerge is a highly uncertain science. Given this, a key question for me is the ability and efficacy of higher education taking on this economic development mission.\n\nStill, slower-growth regions tend to look to their long-lived assets as a source of renewal. This provides the Midwest with some measure of optimism since it's home to many of the world's foremost colleges and universities. So several speakers at last year's conference asserted that the region's higher education institutions represent some of the primary assets that the Midwest has available to provide highly skilled human capital, transfer technology, and create new industries. Such assets are relatively fixed and their success is frequently related to the vitality of the local and regional economy. While other economic actors have an increasingly global perspective and less direct interest in the local economy, higher education is being asked to fill new roles regionally.\n\nBut should the region's universities play a direct role in the economic development of the region? The key question for today's conference is how we should think about higher education and its role in economic development. Should higher education have an explicit role in regional economic development, or does this dilute the other, more central missions of colleges and universities?\n\nThe economic challenge is being picked up in the U.K. without, seemingly to date, an undue burden on its other missions. In Great Britain, higher education has been challenged to develop a third mission, or \"third stream,\" that provides colleges and universities with an explicit economic development role. After teaching and research, \"application\" is becoming a defined mission for British colleges and universities. Application may seem a rather pedestrian mission for institutions that are often described as \"ivory towers,\" where being removed from the day-to-day demands of society is often viewed as a virtue. In this British context, however, the term \"application\" takes on a richer meaning and is integrated into the more familiar teaching and research missions. In describing this new mission, the late Ernest Boyer, former president of the Carnegie Foundation, wrote that the discovery and application of knowledge are interrelated. \"New intellectual understandings can arise out of the very act of application—whether in medical diagnosis, serving clients in psychotherapy, shaping public policy, creating an architectural design, or working with the public schools.\"\n\nRooted in this third stream is a basic belief that universities need to take an active role in knowledge transfer and knowledge exchange. By embracing the application of knowledge to economic growth and social issues, the university is able to take a leading role in fostering growth and helping economies transition to knowledge-based industries. Still, it will take many years to evaluate the costs and benefits of such an initiative.\n\nMeanwhile, even if we do accept the propriety of this mission, the question still remains about what the best approaches are for doing this. To date, there has been little rigorous evaluation of the effectiveness of the mission or the viability and replicability of its varied approaches. And so there is a need to go from anecdotal stories about university successes in local and regional economies to specific models that describe how each level of the higher education system, from community colleges to flagship universities, can contribute to economic growth. In short, we need to develop a specific strategy for describing an appropriate \"third stream\" for U.S. higher education.\n\nOne goal of today's conference is to identify not just isolated case studies of success but replicable models with clearly designated strategies that better define an emerging role for higher education institutions. This is not without irony, because American universities pioneered engagement and extension through the land-grant system, which began in 1862. America's land-grant colleges and universities played a crucial role in providing applied research to improve agricultural productivity and engineering and mechanical arts knowledge. The question then becomes: What is the modern land-grant mission of higher education? Does it need to be redefined or expanded?\n\nGiven this history, why is the interaction between U.S. industry and higher education seemingly so limited today? A survey of industry leaders in the U.S. and the U.K. found that the overwhelming number of industry respondents in the U.S. felt that the primary benefit of higher education to their business was in providing skilled workers. Unlike British respondents, they did not look to universities to provide them with strategies or specific knowledge that would make them more competitive in their industry. U.S. firms look internally and to their competitors to develop industry-specific innovation. Based on my own personal business experience, the private firms that I have worked with often relied on consultants rather than academics when it came to answering business strategy questions, such as whether to enter a new market. Even when universities are directly partnering with a firm, it is often due to the relationship with a specific faculty member rather than because of a stated university policy of economic engagement. However, some corporations have pared their own research efforts and appear more interested in establishing closer ties with higher education institutions. This is particularly true for health care and pharmaceutical firms.\n\nThe survey found that British businesses were far more likely to see universities as strategic partners in their business growth and product development and that British firms had more trust in their relationships with universities. This suggests some more questions about these relationships in the U.S.:\n\nAre there barriers here that limit business-university engagement? For example, intellectual property rights are often seen as a contentious issue between private firms and universities.\nIs there an inherent tension between higher education, whose mission is to disseminate knowledge broadly, and industry, with its goal of capturing proprietary knowledge to gain competitive advantage?\nWill the needs of business firms be better served by private-sector consultants than by universities trying to provide consultant-like services?\nIndustry requires interdisciplinary approaches to solving its toughest problems, and yet most higher education institutions retain the traditional single-discipline academic departmental structure.\n\nI look forward to hearing your thoughts on these subjects. Again, thank you for attending today's program. We will be producing a summary of the conference that will appear in the bank's Chicago Fed Letter publication as well as posting all of today's presentations on the conference website.\n\n*The views presented here are my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "Tonight, I'll begin by talking about the economy and monetary policy. Then I'll discuss housing markets, which currently are an important part of our policy deliberations and a topic of particular interest to this audience.\n\nEconomic growth outlook\nSo let's start with economic growth. Real GDP—our broadest measure of economic output—increased at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the second quarter of the year. We'll get the third-quarter estimate in two weeks—the latest consensus is for the number to be 2.3 percent. So growth over the past six months has been slower than over the previous few years. But much of the slowdown is part of the natural process of the economy shifting from a high-growth, recovery mode to what is a more sustainable path for the longer run.\n\nA number of factors should support sustainable growth. Over the past six months, employment has been increasing at about 120,000 per month, a bit above its long-run sustainable pace. The unemployment rate is low—4.6 percent. Productivity trends remain solid as technology continues to advance and firms learn more and better ways to use it. Furthermore, recent declines in oil prices should give household budgets a boost, and solid economic growth in other countries should increase demand for our exports. Still, there are factors restraining economic activity. The most notable one is weakness in the housing sector, and there also is uncertainty about how important this factor will be for overall growth. Putting these considerations together, over the next year or so I expect the economy to expand, on average, somewhat below its long-run sustainable growth rate—which many economists estimate as roughly 3 percent per year. Of course, that's an average—and I expect to see some volatility in the numbers on a quarter-by-quarter basis.\n\nInflation outlook\nOf course, the Federal Reserve is charged by Congress with fostering financial conditions that support two objectives: maximum sustainable economic growth and price stability, or low and stable inflation. Many policymakers employ a comfort zone for inflation—this is a range for inflation that they feel is consistent with their view of price stability.\n\nBy my standards, inflation has been too high. I prefer to see it between 1 and 2 percent. But the 12-month change in price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, also known as core PCE, has been running at or above 2 percent for 29 months, and in August it was 2-1/2 percent. In part, core inflation has been elevated as businesses passed on earlier increases in energy costs to the prices of their products. High levels of resource utilization also have added more generally to inflationary pressures.\n\nLooking ahead, it's likely that core inflation will come down somewhat over time. The recent declines in oil prices clearly are a positive factor. And the expected deceleration in economic growth will help avoid sustained pressures from resource constraints. Still, there is a risk that core inflation could run above 2 percent for some time. We could be wrong about reduced pressures from resource constraints, or we could see further cost shocks. And perhaps most importantly, if actual inflation continues at high levels, it could cause inflation expectations to run too high. If firms and workers expect inflation to be high, they will want to compensate by raising prices and wages or building in plans for automatic increases. In this way, high inflation expectations can lead to persistently high actual inflation.\n\nPolicy implications\nTaking all of the factors into account, my current assessment is that the risk of inflation remaining too high is greater than the risk of growth being too low. Thus, some additional firming of policy may yet be necessary to bring inflation back to a range consistent with price stability in a reasonable period of time. But that decision will depend on how the incoming data affect the outlook.\n\nAt our August and September meetings, the Federal Open Market Committee held the funds rate target at 5-1/4 percent. The Committee's decision to pause gives us more time to gather information on a number of important developments and assess their implications for the outlook for growth and inflation. And we were able to pause because inflation expectations have been contained. Nonetheless, we have to be vigilant in monitoring these expectations. If they did increase, it would be incumbent on the Federal Reserve to adjust policy to affirm our commitment to price stability.\n\nHousing overview\nCertainly one development that we are assessing—and one that could test the economy's resilience—is the slowdown in housing. As you all are well aware, after posting sold gains for nearly a decade, housing starts and sales of new and existing homes began to drop sharply early this year. We also have seen a marked deceleration—and by a couple of measures, outright declines—in house prices. Clearly, these developments impact many of you through your business interests in real estate—not to mention the value of your own homes. And as I noted, they also raise important questions for the economy as a whole. Will the declines in housing markets coincide with more general economic weakness—as we saw during the recessions in the 1970s and 1980s? Or will the overall economy continue to grow at moderate rates despite a contraction in housing, as we saw in the mid-1960s?\n\nThere are simply too many factors in play to be able to give clean answers to these questions. However, what I would like to do is step back and look at recent developments in the context of the economic fundamentals underpinning residential investment. Such a perspective can help us gauge how the current situation may play out and can highlight some important sources of uncertainty to the outlook.\n\nHistorical facts about residential investment in the macroeconomy\nLet's start by looking at some facts about the role of residential investment in the macroeconomy. Residential investment includes spending on the construction of new single- and multi-family homes as well as renovations and improvements to existing homes. On average, over the past 50 years residential investment has accounted for a bit under 5 percent of GDP. That's about a third more than businesses spend building factories, offices, and commercial space, but in the same ballpark as how much households spend on recreation, which includes items such as golf clubs, football tickets, and, as the Commerce Department likes to call it, legitimate theatre and opera.\n\nFive percent of GDP sounds small; but residential investment also is highly volatile, and over shorter periods of time it can influence GDP growth a good deal. For example, residential investment increased more than 25 percent and accounted for a full percentage point of GDP growth in 1976. But it fell at close to a 20 percent rate during the twin recessions in 1980 and 1981 and subtracted nearly a percentage point from growth in each of these years.\n\nIt's important to remember, though, in the early 1980s mortgage rates were almost 20 percent and the unemployment rate reached nearly 11 percent. The drop in housing then largely was the result of these macroeconomic influences, and not the cause of them. That is, the recessions did not occur because residential investment fell so much; rather, the factors that caused the recessions also resulted in sharp declines in residential investment.\n\nResidential investment and the stock of housing—some basic concepts\nOf course, lots of factors affect residential investment both on a quarter-by-quarter basis and in terms of the longer run.\n\nNow investment bankers like to talk about stocks and bonds. But economists are boring—we like to talk about stocks and flows. Residential investment is a flow—it's the stream of new housing units being built. This flow adds to the capital stock of housing—it increases the total number of housing units in the economy. Of course, it's not just the number of houses that matter, but also their size and quality—the capital stock of housing is an overall concept that encompasses the number, size, and quality of homes in the U.S.\n\nA number of longer-run factors underpin the demand for housing. One is demographics; as the number of households increase, so does the demand for housing. Another is long-run income prospects; as these improve, people will demand bigger and better homes. And the investment value of a home—as influenced by taxes and other factors—also underpins the demand for housing.\n\nSuppose a change in some factor—such as income prospects—causes a one-time increase in the demand for housing. Residential investment (the flow) will have to increase to build the new, bigger houses. But once they are built, growth in residential investment will drop back to roughly its old value. In other words, a one-time step up in the demand for the stock of housing results in an up-and-down cycle in residential investment. Economists talk about this as the stock-adjustment cycle—the natural fluctuation in residential investment in response to changes in the desired housing stock. But as the fundamentals stabilize, the long-run growth rate of the housing stock will settle down to some sustainable rate. This rate also anchors the flow of residential investment because, averaged over long periods of time, the stock and the flow must grow at the same rate.\n\nThat said, people have a good deal of discretion in determining exactly when they purchase a new home. So even if underlying fundamentals do not change, over the short run residential investment can fluctuate a good deal more than what's due to stock adjustment considerations. In particular, people will react to the short-run swings in housing affordability caused by cyclical movements in income, unemployment, and interest rates. As a result, residential investment can fall sharply during recessions as households delay purchases because they are concerned about near-term prospects. And it can then surge early in a recovery as households that had delayed spending jump back into the market when conditions turn more favorable.\n\nResidential investment in the 1980s\nThe 1980s provide an example of how both long and short-run developments simultaneously influence residential investment. With regard to the long run, there was a marked decline in the rate of growth of households in the U.S. as the baby boomers finished moving out of their parents' homes to set up their own households. This reduced the underlying demand for new housing units and helped generate a stock-adjustment cycle. In the end, the average growth rate of the housing capital stock fell about a percentage point between the 1970s and 1980s. But this longer-run development often is forgotten because of the dramatic short-run cyclical swings that occurred back then. I already mentioned the plunge in residential investment during the twin recessions, but it also surged more than 50 percent in the first two years of the 1983-84 recovery.\n\nAs an aside, the story is somewhat different when we consider the cyclical swings in total construction—the sum of residential and nonresidential investment. Overall, nonresidential investment generally is less volatile then residential construction, and the swings in growth of the two series are relatively independent. For example, while residential investment fell by more than one-third during the twin recession in the 1980s, nonresidential investment changed little on net. So total construction spending was off just 20 percent during that period. Indeed, we are seeing such differences today. For example, payroll employment in residential construction has changed little, on net, so far this year, but employment in nonresidential construction has expanded at a healthy clip.\n\nResidential investment in the 1990s and 2000s\nLet's now consider housing during the 1990s. Longer-term fundamentals changed again. Household formation rates slowed further, but other factors boosted housing demand. Starting in 1995, the growth in the housing capital stock began to increase, eventually rising to a bit above 3 percent over the past couple of years. In order to achieve this, residential investment rose even more—it averaged an 8-1/2 percent annual growth rate between 2001 and 2005.\n\nWhat developments contributed to this? Part of the pick up reflects an increase in the share of households who own their homes. After changing little over the previous 10 years, the homeownership rate rose steadily, from about 64 percent in 1994 to an all-time high of 68.9 percent in 2005. Because an owner-occupied house typically is bigger than a rental unit, the shift towards homeownership raised the growth in the housing capital stock.\n\nMuch more significant, though, is the fact that people are demanding bigger and better houses. Between 1995 and 2005 the median size of new homes increased nearly 20 percent, and the new homes were coming with more bathrooms and other amenities. Spending on home improvements also rose noticeably.\n\nAn important factor supporting these increases was the marked pick up in the underlying rate of productivity growth of the economy that began in the mid-1990s. This raised the wealth and long-run income prospects of American households, some of which was spent on bigger and better houses.\n\nIn addition, housing has become a more attractive investment. Borrowing rates fell and changes in the tax code favored housing relative to other investments. And, importantly, financial innovations lowered borrowing costs and increased access to mortgage markets. The momentum of these changes continued to increase through the 1990s.\n\nOne financial innovation was securitization. Most single-family mortgage originations now are bundled together and sold as mortgage-backed securities. Bundling reduces risk by averaging defaults and prepayments across a large number of loans, and securitization spreads the remaining risk among the large number of investors in the pool. Thus, both lower the risk premia built into mortgage rates.\n\nOther innovations increased the efficiency of mortgage origination. Automation has made the process—including credit scoring—much less costly. In addition, homebuyers can now easily shop the internet for a wide range of competing mortgage brokers for the lowest interest rates. These changes have contributed to a drop in initial fees and charges on mortgages from about 2-1/2 percent in the mid-1980s to under 1/2 percent in recent years.\n\nFinally, instruments such as sub-prime mortgages, interest-only loans, and hybrid ARMs have opened up financing to borrowers who previously could not obtain it at all or could not borrow as much as they would like. True, these instruments are riskier than traditional mortgages. Still, to the extent that both borrowers and lenders understand the risks involved and markets have priced this risk properly, they represent a net gain to society. Here, there is a role for public policy: On the part of the Fed, we are promoting financial literacy efforts for borrowers and supervising lenders with regard to both the disclosure of terms and costs to borrowers and to the risks of carrying such non-standard loans on their books.\n\nTogether, these financial innovations likely have been an important factor in boosting the desired stock of housing. A strong piece of evidence is the dramatic increase in the homeownership rate that I mentioned earlier. Many people who were not able to access or afford sufficient credit now are able to get a mortgage and purchase a home. And homeownership rates are up across nearly all demographic groups and income categories. The increases have been particularly impressive for Hispanics and Asians. So, although more can be done, minorities and others who in the past had difficulty obtaining credit are sharing in the gains. This is a quite positive development.\n\nImplications going forward\nSo where do we go from here? As I said earlier, I can't answer this question definitively. But the analysis I just discussed can help structure our thinking.\n\nSome factors clearly point to soft residential investment—indeed, we've already seen it post a double-digit decline in the second quarter, and it likely fell a good deal in the third quarter as well. Part of the swing reflects the natural stock-adjustment mechanism I described earlier. Growth in residential investment and the residential capital stock must average the same rate over the long run. So the 6 to 12 percent gains in investment we experienced the past few years clearly are not sustainable against the backdrop of the 3 percent growth rate in housing capital. Moreover, housing stock growth might settle out somewhat below this 3 percent rate. Some of that growth likely reflected one-time adjustments, such as the extraordinary rise in the rate of homeownership. Furthermore, demographics point to slower growth in the working-age population in the years ahead, which would tend to reduce household formation.\n\nIn addition, there is the issue of the large increases in house prices that we have seen over the past 5 years. Now, it's important to remember that the factors I just mentioned that caused fundamental increases in the demand for housing also should be reflected to some degree in higher house prices. That said, in some locales, such as Las Vegas, house price increases seem to have defied gravity. To the extent that factors unrelated to demand fundamentals are boosting house prices in some regions, there is a risk that they could unwind and reduce residential construction. This risk is much smaller in other cities, particularly many here in the Midwest, which have experienced only modest house price appreciation.\n\nFurthermore, there are some very important fundamentals that should continue to support housing demand. First, productivity growth should continue to bolster gains in wealth and income—some of which will be spent on housing. Second, the financial innovations that have led to more efficient mortgage markets and increased access to credit are here to stay. Third, financial conditions are not very restrictive—after all, 30-year mortgage rates currently are under 6-1/2 percent. Furthermore, there are no \"extra\" factors reducing the supply of credit—contrast today's environment with the 1960s and 1970s when there were regulatory ceilings on interest rates or with the early 1990's when there was the \"capital crunch.\"\n\nConclusion\nSo, where does this leave us? On balance, we at the Chicago Fed expect some further weakness in residential construction as markets work through the stock adjustment process and there is some unwinding of unusual price movements. Some declines in residential investment could be large, and could contribute to some volatile numbers for overall GDP growth on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But currently we do not see the slowing in housing markets spilling over into a more prolonged period of weakness in the overall economy. So on balance, we expect GDP growth to average somewhat below potential over the next year or so. There are risks, of course. For example, negative wealth effects from softening house prices or the impact of higher interest rates—manifested in part through the repricing of ARMS—could reduce consumption more than anticipated. Such developments deserve monitoring.\n\nBut we cannot forget the plus side of the ledger. Outside of housing, there do not appear to be any imbalances that would foreshadow large adjustments in spending in other sectors. And, as I noted earlier, income growth and spending should be supported by the trends in productivity, recent oil price declines, and improved growth prospects for many of our trading partners.\n\nWith regard to inflation—it has been too high. Looking ahead, I think core inflation will gradually come down somewhat over time. But there are substantial risks to that forecast. Persistently elevated inflation rates could show through in inflation expectations. If this occurs, we will have to act accordingly.\n\nLooking ahead, I am optimistic about the fundamentals of the US economy. Our nation's core economic values—our belief in free markets and competition, our use of technology and innovation, and our openness to trade—give the economy the ability to weather short-term challenges and provide a solid foundation to expand over time. And the Federal Reserve's commitment to price stability means that we will be achieving this in an environment of low and stable inflation.\n\n*The views presented here are my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "At its August meeting, the FOMC announced no change in the federal funds rate target, for the first time in 17 meetings. The front page headline of the Chicago Tribune was \"Fed Stops Here.\" The Financial Times of London, however, had a different perspective. It argued that a careful reading of the statement accompanying the decision indicated just a pause in the rate cycle. To me these two stories illustrate the uncertainties of making monetary policy in today's complex economy.\n\nIn addressing the current situation, three questions present themselves—regarding growth, inflation, and monetary policy. In terms of economic growth, the U.S. economy is decelerating from what have been relatively high growth rates over the last three and a half years. The first key question is: how will this deceleration in activity settle out? That is, will the current moderation in growth provide some counterweight against potential resource strains—or how likely is it that the moderation builds into a more significant slowing in economic activity?\n\nOn the pricing front, core inflation has increased and now stands above the 1 to 2 percent range, which several policymakers—including myself—have identified as a comfort zone for inflation, or a zone consistent with price stability. So, the second key question is: when will inflation return to the comfort zone?\n\nIn terms of monetary policy, the third key question is: how should policy react to these developments going forward? That is, against the backdrop of our policy goals, how should we assess the cross-currents and weigh the uncertainties about growth and inflation?\n\nIn my remarks today, I'd like to give you my perspective on these three questions.\n\nGrowth outlook\nTo start, it is useful to remember the Federal Reserve's policy mandate. In accordance with the Federal Reserve Act, the primary goals of monetary policy are to achieve maximum employment and price stability. For a variety of reasons, each of these goals requires some interpretation. One might take price stability to literally mean a flat level of prices, or zero inflation. But, as I'll discuss later, an inflation rate of zero isn't the best operational goal, so instead policymakers interpret price stability to be a low and stable rate of inflation. Similarly, maximum employment might be taken to literally mean that every person of working age has a job. But, at any given moment in time, many men and women voluntarily choose not to work and some are not employed because they are changing jobs. So instead, we focus on achieving maximum sustainable growth, which in turn creates the job opportunities that lead to the highest sustainable levels of employment.\n\nTo set a benchmark for maximum sustainable growth, we often use a concept called potential output growth, or potential GDP growth. (GDP, or gross domestic product, is our broadest measure of economic output.) The potential growth rate of the economy depends primarily on two factors: how fast productivity grows and how fast the labor force grows.\n\nProductivity, which measures how much output can be produced by an hour's worth of work, receives most of the attention, in part because of the dramatic change we have seen in it during the past decade. Productivity growth had averaged less than 1-1/2 percent per year between the early 1970s and mid-1990s, but since then it has averaged over 2-1/2 percent per year.\n\nThe sector with the most dramatic acceleration in productivity is manufacturing. Manufacturing productivity growth averaged 2.5 percent per year from the 1950s to the 1970s. But things changed beginning in the 1970s, as significant technological advancements spread through the manufacturing sector. For example, many manufacturers began investing in computer numerical code machine tools. These cut curves as easily as straight lines and build complex 3-D structures efficiently, thus reducing the number of machining steps that required human action. Other advances in technology, improvements in logistics, and better management of the workplace also created efficiency gains. Manufacturing productivity growth took off, averaging 2.9 percent per year in the 1980s, 3.8 percent in the 1990s, and then 5.0 percent during the past 5 years.\n\nThese productivity gains are good for the country overall. But we should recognize that they aren't good for everyone. The human costs of this process can be significant, as individual workers are forced to change jobs or move into new industries. Many of these costs have been felt most acutely here in the Midwest.\n\nI do not want to minimize the impact of the job losses associated with changes in the economy, no matter what their source. We should strive to ease the transition for the impacted workers and their families, whether it is through financial assistance, retraining programs, or other efforts.\n\nBut dynamic changes in the economy are important if we are to continue to increase overall incomes and our standard of living. Commentators often point to our manufacturing job losses as a sign that we are losing our edge in manufacturing. In fact, the job losses are an unfortunate consequence of the strength of productivity in the manufacturing sector. Even as the number of manufacturing jobs declines, factories in the United States are producing record volumes of machinery, computers, motor vehicles, plastics, and other manufactured goods—and in general they are producing them at lower costs—all due to strong productivity growth.\n\nIndeed, the underlying trends in productivity for manufacturing and other sectors of the economy remain quite solid today, and should continue to support a healthy growth rate of potential output.\n\nThe other factor that affects potential output—the size of the available labor force—receives less attention. But, as our demographics change, it deserves more scrutiny. The growth in the labor force is slowing, reducing the potential growth rate of GDP. It also affects our benchmarks for one of the most closely watched economic statistics: payroll employment.\n\nThere are two components to labor force growth: growth in the working-age population, and changes in how many people in that group participate in the labor force. Growth in the working-age population has slowed to 1.2 percent per year over the last 10 years, compared to a peak of nearly 2 percent in the mid-1970s. Over the next decade, it's projected to slow a bit further. These developments reflect the demographics of the baby boom and echo boom generations and patterns of immigration.\n\nThe labor force participation rate, which measures the proportion of the population aged 16 and older that is working or actively looking for work, is also declining. The participation rate had been rising for many years, but it likely reached a peak in the late 1990s, and should continue to trend down over the next several years. Several factors are at work, but most importantly, labor force participation will be pushed down as the baby boomers wind down their careers, therefore increasing the share of the population that is retired. In addition, the long-running increase in women's participation has leveled off, and the long-running decline in men's participation continues.\n\nSo the trends in both the growth of the population and labor force participation point to slower growth in the labor force. This has important implications for our benchmarks for the monthly employment statistics. Earlier in the decade, most economists estimated that job growth of about 150,000 per month was consistent with an economy expanding near potential. However, research at the Chicago Fed and elsewhere suggests that, given the slower growth in the labor force, monthly increases of roughly 100,000 are most likely consistent with potential.1 This transition has not yet been fully appreciated by market observers. In each of the past three months, financial markets have expected job growth of about 160,000 on average. When actual job growth averaged just above 100,000, many analysts interpreted this as a sign that the economy is growing slower than its potential. In contrast, we at the Chicago Fed see these numbers as actually consistent with an economy moving ahead at about its potential.\n\nThat said, these changes in labor force growth also imply that, in the absence of changes in productivity trends, our estimates of potential GDP growth should be revised down 2 or 3 tenths of a percentage point to near 3 percent.\n\nAgainst this 3 percent figure, it is clear that the actual GDP growth rate of 3-1/2 percent that we experienced during the past few years is not sustainable. While it is natural for growth to be above trend for a time after a recession, the last recession ended almost five years ago. Consequently, a deceleration to average growth rates is only natural. If the economy continued to expand above potential, imbalances would develop that would lead to rising inflation and, possibly, the premature end of the expansion.\n\nOn top of the natural deceleration in output, higher energy prices, the slowing in housing markets, and other factors should push near-term growth a bit below potential for a short period. However, I don't see evidence of a more worrisome downshift in activity. Importantly, the job market is solid: The unemployment rate is below 5 percent and, as I just noted, job creation has been consistent with potential output growth. And financing conditions appear reasonably accommodative. So businesses and consumers are likely to continue spending at a reasonably healthy rate.\n\nOf course, there are some risks. One relates to housing. The orderly declines that we've been expecting could become more significant. Housing had been an area of strength for an extended period during this business cycle. The large increases in home values added an indirect boost to household spending growth by increasing homeowners' wealth.\n\nSome analysts say that housing is overvalued and that prices are going to decline nationwide. To be sure, we currently are seeing a good deal of softening in housing markets, and home prices are increasing at a slower rate. Looking ahead, most forecasts for GDP growth factor in slow home price appreciation and marked declines in residential investment. But it seems unlikely that prices will actually decline for the nation overall. Housing markets are local in nature. Home prices have risen only modestly in Chicago, Bloomington, and most Midwestern cities; the largest increases have occurred in cities such as Miami, Phoenix, and Las Vegas. Even if there were large price declines in some cities, there probably would be little spillover to a more general drop in prices nationwide. And even if prices did decline nationally, history suggests that the impact on consumer spending would be modest and gradual.\n\nAnother risk to the outlook relates to energy. Crude oil prices have more than doubled since 2002. Gas prices have moved well above $3 per gallon in many areas. And home heating and cooling costs are also elevated. Given the large amount we spend on imported energy, increases in oil and gas prices represent a sizable transfer of income from U.S. consumers to foreign producers, which can negatively affect economic growth.\n\nTo date, the rapid increases in energy costs haven't led to much of a slowing in U.S. economic growth. Some of the negative effect of rising oil prices has been offset by solid productivity growth and accommodative monetary policy. Plus, the U.S. economy is less dependent on oil today. In 1980, it took the energy equivalent of 2-1/2 barrels of oil to produce one thousand dollars of real GDP; today, it takes the equivalent of 1-1/2 barrels. In addition, in the early 1980s, 11 cents of every dollar of consumer spending went to energy-related expenses; in 2005, it was only 8.5 cents. And, the increase in crude prices, after adjusting for inflation, is smaller than during the energy shock in the 1970s. The level remains below the peak reached in 1980 of $86 per barrel in 2005 dollars. Nevertheless, the cumulative effect of higher energy prices may yet have a more significant impact on economic activity going forward.\n\nInflation outlook\nThe outlook for inflation also poses a number of concerns for policymakers. As I mentioned earlier, the Federal Reserve Act charges the FOMC with maintaining price stability, which is generally regarded as low and stable inflation.\n\nMany policymakers think about price stability as inflation staying within a certain comfort zone. For core PCE inflation—that is, for the Personal Consumption Expenditures index excluding food and energy prices—I set my comfort zone between 1 and 2 percent. That's the range of inflation rates I consider to be consistent with price stability. But that doesn't mean that I view the 1 to 2 percent range as a \"zone of indifference.\" I think it's better to be in the middle of the range. In fact, some research suggests that an inflation rate of about 1-1/2 percent strikes a good balance between avoiding the costs of inflation with the value of having a cushion to push short-term real rates into negative territory in periods when the economy is weak.\n\nGiven the shocks that are constantly hitting the economy, it's unrealistic to think we can always stay near 1-1/2 percent. So specifying a zone gives us a rough indication of where we should try to keep inflation, at least most of the time.\n\nFor the past 27 months, the 12-month change in core PCE has been running at or above 2 percent, and is now 2.4 percent. One reason for core inflation being elevated has been the sharp run up in energy prices. Even though core inflation does not include energy prices directly, businesses may pass through higher energy costs to the prices of their products, thus raising core inflation. For example, airfares have increased because fuel costs have gone up. And the prices of other goods, such as sofas, have increased because they include foam cushions that are made with petrochemicals. In fact, the magnitude of the energy and commodity price increases has been large enough to account for a goodly portion of the increase in core inflation.\n\nLooking ahead, it's likely that core inflation will come down somewhat, but risks remain. The expected deceleration in economic growth will help avoid the inflation pressures from tightening resource constraints. Moreover, the oil futures market expects that oil prices will stabilize. Should this occur, once businesses adjust their own prices to cover the higher energy costs, overall inflation should return to its earlier rate.\n\nBut there is a risk that core inflation could run above 2 percent for some time. We could yet see further cost shocks, and we no longer have excess capacity to help offset their effects on inflation. We also might not have seen the end of the effects of the highly accommodative policy that was in place during 2003 and 2004. As a result, economic growth could continue to average above potential for some time, putting further pressure on resources. And perhaps most importantly, inflation expectations could rise. Indeed, in recent weeks some financial market observers have questioned what a 1 to 2 percent inflation comfort zone means when core inflation has been above 2 percent for so long.\n\nHigher inflation expectations make it more difficult to keep inflation contained. If firms and workers expect inflation to be high, they will want to keep up with the perceived general increase in prices and costs. They will set higher prices and wages or build in plans for automatic increases. In this way, higher inflation expectations can boost actual inflation and become self-fulfilling. That is, they can lead to a persistently higher inflation rate, instead of simply a temporary increase. To date, inflation expectations appear to be contained. Nonetheless, we have to be vigilant in monitoring these expectations; if they did increase, it would be incumbent on the Federal Reserve to adjust policy in a way that would affirm our commitment to price stability.\n\nPolicy implications\nOf course, the FOMC must consider both its goals of price stability and maximum sustainable growth in assessing risks to the outlook. We need to judge the likelihood of certain events occurring and understand the costs to the economy if they do. At the August meeting, the FOMC held the funds rate target at 5-1/4 percent, but it noted that \"the extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.\" By pausing at this time, the Committee will have more time to evaluate a variety of important developments. This was a constructive choice for a number of reasons.\n\nFirst, the amount of liquidity in financial markets. It continues to be difficult to judge just how restrictive or accommodative financial conditions are today. Despite the increase in the federal funds target from 1 percent to 5-1/4 percent, long-term interest rates remain low and financial liquidity appears to be deep . With more time, we'll be better able to determine the impact of past rate increases on financial conditions.\n\nSecond, housing. While we factor a housing slowdown into our outlook, there is some evidence—such as higher rates of cancellation in homebuilding contracts—that the slowdown could be more extensive. Although it is only 5 percent of GDP, an unexpectedly sharp decline in residential investment could have significant implications for a number of other economic sectors. With more time, we can better assess the extent of the slowdown and possible spillover effects.\n\nThird, the resilience of growth. In the second quarter, GDP growth slowed to 2-1/2 percent, due to weaker household spending and business investment. I believe a good portion of this moderation was probably due to transitory and one-off events, such as the timing of shipments in transportation and communications equipment. But, more time will provide greater information about whether there is more fundamental weakening in the economy. Alternatively, growth could recover even more than expected.\n\nAnd finally, energy prices. Recent increases in core inflation have occurred at a time when energy and other commodity prices have been elevated. We expect these prices to a least level off. Accordingly, the passthrough effects on inflation from these cost increases should wane somewhat. More time and data will help us quantify the contribution of these effects.\n\nOf course, as I noted earlier, we are very concerned about inflation expectations. To date, they have been contained, even as core inflation has remained above 2 percent. This stability of expectations, so far, allowed us to wait and gain information on the other developments in the economy.\n\nTaking all of these factors into account, my assessment is that the risk of inflation remaining too high is greater than the risk of growth being too low. Thus some additional firming of policy may yet be necessary to bring inflation back into the comfort zone within a reasonable period of time. That decision will depend on how the incoming data affect the outlook. And we must remember that the typical lags are long between monetary policy actions and changes in inflation. So we need to balance the benefits of gaining new information against the costs of waiting too long. If inflation stays stubbornly high while we wait to see the effects of earlier policy actions, inflation expectations could increase—and that would be very costly.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, while the near-term policy path is uncertain, the FOMC's resolve to achieve price stability and sustainable growth remains certain. The credibility of the Federal Reserve is an important factor in the economy's long-term health, and it is an asset that we do not treat lightly. In the 1970s, we saw how rising inflation and eroding Fed credibility can disrupt the economy, and in the early 1980s, we saw the painful effects on American workers and businesses when the Fed had to act aggressively to lower inflation and inflation expectations.\n\nLooking ahead, I am optimistic about the fundamentals of the US economy. Together with our nation's core economic values—our belief in free markets and competition, our use of technology and innovation, and our openness to trade—the current environment of price stability, and the Fed's credibility to defend it, give the economy the ability to weather short-term challenges and provide a solid foundation to expand overtime.\n\n1 The methodology for forecasting labor force participation developed in Aaronson and Sullivan (2001) suggests that, currently, the participation rate is trending downward about 0.2 percentage point per year. Alternatively, Toosi (2005) forecasts a drop of about 0.1 percentage point per year over the next ten years, while Aaronson, et al (2006) predict a drop of about 0.3 percentage point per year. Given that the working-age population is growing at a rate of about 1.2% per year, the median of these estimates implies a labor force growth rate of about 0.9% per year. On a base of around 135 million, this suggests monthly increases of approximately 100,000 for nonfarm payroll employment.

            "content": "The latest economic headlines have generally been positive. Real GDP grew at a brisk pace in the first quarter of this year. The pace of job growth has moved up and down, but on balance has been solid in recent months; and the unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest point in more than four years. However, core inflation has been running somewhat higher in recent months, a development that requires close monitoring.\n\nToday, I will talk about these and other developments, and what they mean for the outlook for economic growth, inflation, and monetary policy in the U.S.\n\nOutlook for economic growth\nLet's start by reviewing recent developments. Real GDP growth bounced back to 5.3 percent in the first quarter after a surprisingly weak reading for the last three months of 2005. Notably, spending by consumers and businesses increased at a much higher rate in the first quarter than it did in the fourth.\n\nGDP growth is expected to slow this quarter; but this step down is natural given last quarter's outsized gain. Looking beyond these quarterly fluctuations, the outlook is good: Sound underlying economic fundamentals appear to be supporting self-sustaining economic growth. According to the Blue Chip consensus, real GDP is expected to increase about 3-1/2 percent this year, due in part to the strong first quarter, and increase 3 percent in 2007. I think this forecast is reasonable.\n\nImportantly, this forecast puts the economy close to many economists' estimates for potential growth—that is, it is close to the rate at which the economy can expand while fully employing labor and other resources and at the same time keep inflation stable. The potential growth rate of the economy depends primarily on two factors: how fast productivity grows and how fast the labor force grows.\n\nProductivity, which measures how much output can be produced by an hour's worth of work, receives most of the attention, and it's easy to see why. Productivity growth had averaged less than 1-1/2 percent per year between the mid-1970s and mid-1990s, but then it jumped to over 2-1/2 percent per year. ¹ And the underlying trends in productivity remain quite solid today. This has caused the potential growth rate of GDP to increase, and it has resulted in a more rapid improvement in our standard of living. That 1 percentage point acceleration may seem small, but it cuts the time to double our productivity from about 50 years to 30; which in turn means that incomes grow much more rapidly.\n\nThe size of the available labor force, however, has been growing more slowly over the last few years. This is a drag on the potential growth rate of GDP. There are two components to labor force growth: growth in the working-age population, and changes in how many people in that group participate in the labor force. Growth in the working-age population has slowed to 1.2 percent per year over the last 10 years, compared to a peak of nearly 2 percent in the mid-1970s. And it's projected to fall a bit further over the next decade.\n\nThe labor force participation rate, which measures the proportion of the population aged 16 and older that is working or actively looking for work, had been rising for many years. But, it likely reached a peak in the late 1990s, and should trend down over the next several years. Several factors are at work. First, there seems to have been acceleration in the decline in teenagers' participation. Teenagers are going to school more and working less. Second, the long-running increase in adult women's participation appears to have largely run its course. Younger women are not participating in the labor force much more than their mothers did when they were young. That's a big change from a generation earlier. Third, the rate for adult men has been declining for many years and there is no reason to expect this trend to change. Finally, and most importantly, labor force participation will be pushed down as the baby boomers wind down their careers, because it means the share of the population that is retired will increase.\n\nIt's worth noting that the trends in labor force participation are quite different for the Hispanic population. The working-age Hispanic population is growing around 3 percent per year, much more rapidly than the overall population. Also, the Hispanic population is younger on average, and as a result, Hispanics tend to have somewhat higher labor force participation rates. For these reasons, Hispanics have accounted for about 40 percent of our recent labor force growth, even though they make up less than 14 percent of the population. Moreover, some estimates suggest that they could account for almost 60 percent of labor force growth in the next few years. With the decline in the overall participation rate, the growing number of Hispanic workers is adding needed vibrancy to the U.S. economy.\n\nWith overall population growth continuing to slow and labor force participation not expected to rise, we probably need to adjust our benchmarks for what level of employment growth is consistent with economic growth near potential and a steady unemployment rate. It used to be that increases in payroll employment that averaged 150,000 per month were consistent with flat unemployment. Now that number may be closer to 100,000. These developments also imply that, in the absence of changes in productivity growth, our estimates of potential GDP growth should be revised down 2 or 3 tenths of a percentage point to a range of 3 to 3-1/4 percent.\n\nAlthough the near-term outlook for the economy is mostly favorable, as always there are some risks. One relates to home prices. Housing has been an area of strength throughout this business cycle, and we've seen strong increases in home prices. These higher valuations have increased homeowners' wealth, helping to facilitate more robust spending growth.\n\nSome analysts have suggested that housing has become overvalued and that prices are going to decline nationwide. To be sure, we are seeing some softening in housing markets, and home prices are increasing at a slower rate. But it seems unlikely that prices will actually decline nationwide. Housing markets are local in nature. Home prices have risen only modestly in Chicago and most Midwestern cities; the largest increases have occurred in cities such as Miami, Phoenix, and Las Vegas. Even if there were large price declines in some cities, there probably would be little spillover to a more general drop in prices nationwide.\n\nMost forecasts for GDP growth factor in some moderation in home price appreciation and residential investment. But if prices did decline nationwide, history suggests that the impact on overall consumer spending would be modest and gradual.\n\nAnother risk to the outlook relates to energy. Crude oil prices have more than doubled since 2002. Gas prices have topped $3 per gallon in many areas. And home heating and cooling costs are also elevated. Given the large amount we spend on imported energy, increases in oil and gas prices represent a sizable transfer of income from U.S. consumers to foreign producers, which can negatively affect economic growth.\n\nYet despite the recent increases in energy costs, we haven't seen much of a slowdown in U.S. economic growth over the past couple of years. Some of the negative effect of rising oil prices has been offset by solid productivity growth and accommodative monetary policy. Plus, the U.S. economy is less dependent on oil today. In 1980, it took more than 15,000 BTUs of energy to produce one real dollar of GDP; today, it takes less than 9,000 BTUs. In addition, in the early 1980s, 11 cents of every dollar of consumer spending went to energy-related expenses; in 2005, it was only 8.5 cents. And, the increase in crude prices, after adjusting for inflation, is smaller than during the energy shock in the 1970s. The level remains below the peak reached in 1980 of $86 per barrel in 2005 dollars.\n\nNevertheless, the cumulative effect of higher energy prices may yet have a more significant impact on consumer spending going forward. This will require careful monitoring because of the potential impact on the growth of the economy.\n\nOutlook for inflation\nIn addition to being a risk to growth, rising energy prices are also a risk to the outlook for inflation. When economists try to assess the underlying trends in inflation, we like to look at so-called \"core\" measures, which strip out volatile food and energy prices. The readings on the core price index for personal consumption expenditures, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, have stayed low, relative to my early years on the FOMC in the mid-1990s. Nonetheless, for most of the past year core PCE inflation has been running close to 2 percent, which is at the upper end of the range that I feel is consistent with price stability.\n\nEven though core inflation does not include energy prices directly, businesses may pass through higher energy costs to the prices of their products, thus raising core inflation. Higher oil prices find their way into many products, some that you might not think of. To give one example, I've heard from a furniture manufacturer that increases in petrochemical prices have raised the cost of polyfoam used in sofas and chairs. He said, \"This is the first time in 30 years that the stuffing costs more than the fabric.\" And the price of other goods—even those that don't include any petrochemical materials—may rise because the cost of shipping them has increased.\n\nHowever, higher energy prices do not necessarily imply a persistent rise in inflation. Suppose energy costs stabilize, as the oil futures market predicts. Once businesses adjust their own prices to cover the higher costs, prices would not have to rise faster than increases in the cost of other inputs, and overall inflation would return to its earlier rate. Thus, the energy price increases we have seen to date should result in a one-time increase in prices and a temporary rise in the core inflation rate, not a sustained higher rate of core inflation. Indeed, this pattern can be seen in the slightly lower range for most core inflation forecasts in 2007 compared to 2006.\n\nThere are other concerns, however. First, with the unemployment rate currently at 4.6 percent and capacity utilization somewhat above its long-run average, it is important to ask how much slack remains in the economy. Many estimates place the natural rate of unemployment around 5 percent. While there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding these estimates, an unemployment rate of 4.6 percent likely indicates a vibrant labor market in which more firms may begin to bid up wages to attract and retain workers.\n\nLong periods of high resource utilization are often associated with rising costs and prices. For example, as recently as 2000, the unemployment rate fell below 4 percent and \"Help Wanted\" signs were everywhere. Businesses offered attractive wages to many workers, and these costs were passed along in the form of higher core consumer price inflation. We are not at that point yet. Increases in compensation have been relatively moderate, and strong trends in productivity have held back the rise in overall unit labor costs. Furthermore, manufacturers often tell me they have a great deal of flexibility to produce without generating cost pressures.\n\nInflation inertia\nStill, given that the economy is operating close to potential, we need to be careful to monitor for the emergence of any economy-wide strains on resource utilization. Such strains would have the potential to increase inflationary pressures, which can have long-lasting consequences. Inflation in the US tends to exhibit inertia. That is, it has a pronounced tendency to stay near whatever level it has been in the recent past. So, when economic developments occur that would eventually cause inflation to change, the actual price adjustments tend to be slow to emerge. However, once in place, the effects are very persistent.\n\nThis inflation inertia results from the complexity of firms' price-setting decisions. These decisions often require a lot of time and effort to implement. As a result, many prices are not changed on a frequent basis. For example, most restaurants don't want to print a new menu each day, so their prices change less frequently. Automakers enter into annual contracts for the purchases of many inputs, including steel and glass. And some services—such as apartment rents, college tuition, or cell phone service—are sold with longer-term contracts, so their prices change even less often. There are exceptions, of course. Prices of gasoline and some other commodities are adjusted on nearly a daily basis.\n\nHowever, even some prices that appear to adjust frequently are relatively rigid on a longer-term basis. For example, some firms run sales every few weeks, perhaps when inventories creep up, but the decisions about their base level of prices are made only a few times each year. According to research, the prices for typical consumer goods and services—such as auto maintenance, dry cleaning, and cosmetics—are in effect for about 8 months on average.\n\nOf course, firms will want to raise their prices when their unit costs increase. But, there can be a significant amount of time between when cost pressures begin to build and when the firm actually raises prices. For instance, wages are often adjusted only once per year, so it can take quite some time for tightening labor markets to be reflected in higher wages and other employment costs. And even when costs do rise, firms often adjust their prices gradually. This is because in the short run, competitive pressures can keep them from more rapidly increasing prices.\n\nBecause they are slow to adjust their prices, firms need to anticipate the economic conditions that will prevail over the time until it next adjusts its pricing policy. This makes inflation expectations crucial. If firms expect inflation to be high, they will want to keep up with the general increase in prices. As a result, they will set their own prices higher or build in plans for automatic increases. The higher inflation expectations can become self-fulfilling.\n\nFirms likely form these crucial expectations of inflation largely by taking note of recent actual inflation rates. Because the data bounce around so much from month to month, inflation must be averaged over a period of at least a year or two. The dependence of future inflation on inflation expectations, and the dependence of inflation expectations on several years of inflation rates, contributes to the inertia we see in inflation data.\n\nSince I came to the Fed in 1994, I've talked to many firms about their planning processes, and I have seen important changes in how inflation expectations affect business' price-setting behavior. Initially, most firms would say that they expected their costs to rise by a few percentage points over the coming year and they would plan to increase prices by a similar amount. Given their plans, that's usually what happened. By the late 1990s, however, things had changed dramatically—most firms would say that they thought they would be unable to raise their prices over the coming year. But they still expected to earn greater profits anyway—by boosting productivity and demanding price concessions from their suppliers. That's when I felt we were making real progress on achieving price stability. Firms had come to expect overall inflation to be low and were acting accordingly.\n\nPolicy discussion\nInflation inertia has important implications for monetary policy. It might naively be considered a good thing. If the economy started to overheat, inertia means that we would initially see only a small run-up in inflation. But inflation inertia is a double-edged sword. If underlying inflation were to rise significantly above levels associated with price stability, it would have a strong tendency to stay at high levels absent a commensurate policy response. In order to avoid such a scenario, monetary policy needs to remain vigilant for signs of incipient inflation and adjust its stance accordingly.\n\nThe 12-month change in core PCE has been running close to 2 percent for the past several months. Personally, my comfort zone for core inflation is between 1 and 2 percent—that's the range of inflation rates I consider to be consistent with price stability. But that doesn't mean that I view the 1 to 2 percent range as a \"zone of indifference.\" I think it's better to be in the middle of the range. In fact, some research suggests that an inflation figure of about 1.5 percent strikes a good balance between avoiding the negative effects of inflation with the value of being able to push short-term real rates into negative territory in periods when the economy is weak.\n\nGiven the shocks that are constantly hitting the economy, it's unrealistic to think we can always stay near 1.5 percent. So specifying a zone gives us a rough indication of where we can expect to keep inflation, at least most of the time.\n\nBut when we are running near the top or bottom of the range, there's a greater chance that a shock will push us outside of our comfort zone than if we're in the middle of the range. The Blue Chip forecasts indicate that inflation will likely remain contained, and this is my view as well. Importantly, solid underlying trends in productivity should keep overall production costs in check. But, as I mentioned earlier, there are risks to the inflation outlook—namely, the potential for energy cost pass-through, pressures from increases in resource utilization, and rising inflationary expectations. With inflation at the upper end of my comfort zone, an unexpected increase in inflation would be a serious concern, while a decline in inflation would be beneficial. So I think monetary policy should be calibrated to bring us back to the middle of the range over time.\n\nMoreover, setting policy in a way that tends to move inflation toward the center of the comfort zone is useful for anchoring the public's expectations of inflation. If inflation runs near the top of the comfort zone for long enough, people may begin to question whether that zone accurately reflects our policy. For instance, if inflation were to stay at 2 percent for a couple of years, the public might conclude that 2 percent is not the upper limit of our notion of an acceptable range, but rather the middle of what we think is appropriate. Such tendencies can lead to creeping inflation.\n\nWhen formulating my views on policy, I factor in all of these considerations regarding cost pass through, inflation expectations, inflation inertia, and where inflation is relative to my comfort zone. And, my views about the appropriate policy action depend critically on how various developments affect the outlook for inflation and growth. In other words, monetary policy is conditional. The FOMC will react to changes in economic prospects. Future policy is not predetermined, nor will it be a mechanical reaction to the next number on inflation or employment. Currently, the exact path for policy is much less certain than it was when rates clearly were well below any rates consistent with long-run sustainable growth and price stability. This increases the importance of economic conditionality in our decisions about the timing and magnitude of policy changes.\n\nConclusion\nBut, don't mistake uncertainty about the near-term policy path for any weakening in our resolve to achieve price stability and sustainable growth. The credibility of the Federal Reserve is an important factor in the economy's long-term health, and it is an asset that we do not treat lightly. In the 1970s, we saw how rising inflation and eroding Fed credibility can disrupt the economy, and in the early 1980s, we saw the painful effects on American workers and businesses when the Fed has to act to lower inflation expectations. Together with our nation's core economic values—our belief in free markets and competition, our use of technology and innovation, and our openness to trade—the current environment of price stability, and the Fed's credibility to defend it, give the economy the ability to weather short-term challenges and provide a solid foundation to expand overtime.\n\n*The views presented here are my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.\n\n¹This is productivity for the entire economy, not just nonfarm businesses.",

            "content": "Good morning. I'm Michael Moskow, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. It's my pleasure to welcome you to our 42nd Annual Conference on Bank Structure & Competition, the longest-running annual conference in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe success and longevity of this conference can be traced first and foremost to the quality of the speakers and presentations each year. This year is no exception, with an outstanding array of keynote presenters, including the heads of two federal bank regulatory agencies, the chairman and CEO of one of the largest banks in the country, and one of the world's most well-known and influential academic economists. I'm certain that you'll find these presentations noteworthy, thought provoking, and entertaining.\n\nThe Bank Structure Conference, as we call it, has long-since expanded its focus beyond the structure of banking markets and how that structure affects bank performance. Each year we choose a theme that spotlights a pressing issue in the world of banking and, more broadly, financial markets and institutions. In recent years the conference has tackled the issues of corporate governance, government-sponsored enterprises, and the role of the financial safety net.\n\nOur conference theme this year is \"Innovations in Real Estate Markets: Risks, Rewards, and the Role of Regulation.\" No banking issue directly touches more people than real estate lending. When people talk about interest rates, many discuss their mortgage payments and whether they should refinance. This has never been more true than today, when about 69 percent of American households own their own homes—an all-time record.\n\nInnovations in financial markets have been an important source of this increase in homeownership. Many people who would otherwise be forced to wait years, perhaps decades, before buying a home can now use adjustable rate, option-ARM, no-money-down, or other innovative mortgage instruments to afford the house of their dreams. And those that already own have benefited as well. The real estate loan has never been more flexible as a general lending instrument. Homeowners can now use the equity in their home to finance many different types of higher-interest debt or smooth their consumption through difficult times, such as when a family member loses a job or requires a long hospital stay.\n\nThese benefits can accrue beyond the individual homeowner. The last recession was a mild one partly because these financing innovations continued to facilitate the growth in mortgage lending and refinancing, supporting growth in residential investment and household consumption during the downturn and early recovery. And once people acquire equity in their homes, they have additional incentives to invest in their homes and communities.\n\nBut these innovations have also generated risk—the risk that comes naturally from leverage. With less equity, people have less of a cushion to withstand adverse shocks to home prices or interest rates. Today, many believe that home prices have little room for additional growth and are more likely to fall than to rise further, especially in particular housing markets on the East and West Coasts and in some cities in the South and Southwest. Plus, with many adjustable-rate loans being made in a historically low interest rate environment, some people will soon be faced with these loans repricing under less favorable financial conditions.\n\nOur theme panel this morning should give us a good overview of the pressing issues that real estate markets pose for banks and other financial institutions. Ken Thompson, chairman, CEO, and president of Wachovia Corporation, will give us the insights of a banking industry leader at lunch today. After two more housing-related sessions this afternoon, we resume tomorrow morning with a keynote address by Robert Shiller from Yale University. As you know, Bob predicted the price declines in the equity markets several years ago, and he has now issued similar warnings about housing prices.\n\nOur Friday morning panel on federal preemption of state banking laws should provoke vigorous debate, especially in light of recent aggressive maneuvers by states to defend their regulatory turf.\n\nJohn Dugan, the Comptroller of the Currency, will deliver tomorrow's final keynote address. The conference concludes with concurrent sessions that follow Comptroller Dugan's luncheon speech.\n\nAnd now, I'd like to introduce this morning's keynote speaker. For 17 of the last 18 years, we've been honored with a keynote address by former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, who first addressed this conference in 1988, his first full year as chairman. This year, we both continue a tradition and begin a new one with a keynote address by the new Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke. Ben became chairman of the Federal Reserve Board on February 1 of this year, after having served on the Board previously from 2002 to 2005. In the interim, he was Chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nBefore joining the Board the first time, Ben was professor of economics and public affairs and chairman of the economics department at Princeton University. And before joining Princeton in 1985, he taught at the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University. Ben's stellar academic career also includes visiting stints at NYU and MIT. He has published a great number of scholarly articles on monetary policy and macroeconomics, as well as several books and two widely used textbooks. He is the former editor of the American Economic Review. He has also served as Director of the Monetary Economics Program of the National Bureau of Economic Research and as a member of its Business Cycle Dating Committee.\n\nWe're very grateful that Ben could be here today to speak at our conference, and we hope that it's the beginning of another long tradition. Please welcome Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke.\n\n*The views presented here are my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "I'd like to take this opportunity to talk about two longer-term issues that we must address in order to maintain a healthy economy and continued improvement in our standard of living in the future—the importance of financial education and our substantial and still growing current account deficits.\n\nBut first, a brief description of what we do at the Chicago Fed. We're one of the twelve district reserve banks across the country that, together with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., serve as the nation's central bank. The Chicago Fed covers a region that includes most of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Our mission is to help maintain a sound U.S. financial system and to promote maximum sustainable economic growth and price stability.\n\nWe carry out our mission with three main activities. First, we conduct monetary policy, which involves controlling how much money and credit flows through the economy. Second, we supervise and regulate banks to make sure they are safe and sound while complying with government rules and regulations. And third, we are involved in the payments system through processing electronic funds transfers and paper checks.\n\nOf course, there are other activities that we pursue to help support our mission. One is financial education and community outreach. It's especially important for consumers to have as much knowledge as they can when making financial decisions. These decisions can have important effects on how credit gets allocated and used, which can impact the economy and monetary policy. And financial decision making is so much more complex and challenging today than it used to be. For instance:\n\nMany retirement and savings plans now require people to take more responsibility for their personal investments. With 401k plans, employees will sometimes have 20 or more options on where to invest. And employers often offer little help in determining the best investment mix.\nCredit is more broadly available, particularly to young adults, seniors, and low- and moderate-income people. Ten years ago, it was college students who were increasingly being solicited for credit cards—now it's high school students. A recent poll of teenagers reported that about 10 percent of 17-year-olds had a credit card, and almost 20 percent of 18- and 19-year-olds had one.\nBut this credit can also be more costly, too: The highest penalty rate charged to consumers with a major credit card jumped from just over 20 percent in the early 90s to over 40 percent now on some cards issued to risky borrowers. And many credit card agreements are now written so that the company can raise your rate if you are late on any of your bills, not just their credit card.\nFinally, technology makes it possible to offer more complex and customized financial products, playing a role in the conduct of virtually every traditional financial transaction. Several companies, including PayPal, are now offering people the ability to send money to each other, purchase items from select companies, or donate money to charity by using text messaging on their cell phones!\nAnd data from the recently released JumpStart report, which surveyed high school seniors from around the country, show that knowledge of basic and important financial concepts is lacking. A sample question from the survey asked about what type of credit card user would pay the most in finance charges per year, holding constant the amount purchased on the card. The correct answer was someone who only pays the minimum amount each month. This question was missed by about 30 percent of the respondents.\n\nIn addition, few understood how the risk and returns from investing in stocks differed from putting money in checking or saving accounts. Perhaps this reflects the survey response that fewer than 20 percent had taken any kind of money management or personal finance course. And don't think that this is just an issue of family background: students from families with incomes of $80,000 or more only answered about 55 percent of the questions correctly, not much more than those with family incomes of less than $20,000.\n\nThe importance of this information and knowledge becomes more acute when you examine the investing and saving behavior of the average family. The 2004 Fed Survey of Consumer Finances reveals that over half of U.S. households have no retirement savings beyond Social Security—and we all know the concerns about the sustainability of our current level of Social Security benefits if the method of funding those benefits remains unchanged. Also, almost half of U.S. households carry a credit card balance, with the average amount of that balance over $5000.\n\nGiven these facts, we need to focus more on the importance of financial education and literacy. At the Chicago Fed, a big part of our effort in this area is our fifth-annual Money Smart WeekSM, which is going on this week. More than 150 organizations are participating in this year's events, with over 250 free educational activities being held throughout the Chicago metropolitan area. Our goal is to achieve greater awareness of programs and services being provided in the Chicago area that are designed to help consumers learn how to make sound financial decisions. To accomplish this task, we work with our Money Smart Advisory Council and partners, which include schools, libraries, nonprofits, banks, media, businesses, and city and state government agencies. We've even arranged for several landmark Chicago buildings to display green lights this week to bring more visibility to this important campaign.\n\nA great deal of the need for financial education arises because many people today are spending more than they earn and face difficulty financing their borrowing. The fact that we spend more than we earn is also true on a national scale, as evidenced by our large and growing current account deficits. But the issues regarding the financing of our current account deficit are much more complex.\n\nA current account deficit, as you know, means that a country is spending more than it is earning. To be more precise, the consumers, firms, and government of a country are collectively spending more than the total income that they are earning from domestic production and earnings on net investment returns from abroad. The current account deficit can also be thought of as the extent to which national investment exceeds national saving. The changes in the current account deficit over the past 10 years largely reflect a steady decline in the national saving rate; the investment share of GDP has fluctuated quite a bit, but on net it has risen only a couple of percentage points.\n\nHow big are these deficits, and how fast have they been growing? In 2005, the U.S. current account deficit reached $805 billion, or 6.4 percent of GDP. This deficit has been growing rapidly since 1997, when it stood at just 1.7 percent of GDP. These persistent and widening deficits have translated into a large increase in the U.S. net foreign debt position. Prior to 1986, the U.S. was a net creditor to the rest of the world. During the early 1990s, net foreign debt stayed in a narrow range of 5 to 6 percent of GDP. Since then, however, it has widened steadily and is currently estimated at over $3 trillion, or 25 percent of GDP.\n\nSo what are those fundamental economic factors in the U.S. economy that have affected our desired saving and investment? To answer this, it helps to identify the three sources of national saving: households, businesses, and governments. An obvious candidate to explain the falling U.S. saving rate would be the large shift in the U.S. fiscal balance. From 1998 to 2001, U.S. governments—federal, state and local—ran fiscal surpluses of 1 to 2-1/2 percent of GDP. Since 2002, however, they have been running fiscal deficits in the range of 2-3/4 to 3-3/4 percent of GDP. But research by economists at the Fed suggests that the growing fiscal imbalances explain less than 20 percent and certainly not the bulk of the change in U.S. net saving or the current account.\n\nOf course, that doesn't lessen the importance from the point of view of U.S. public policy of reducing these large fiscal deficits. Growing medical costs and rapidly changing demographics will soon put an enormous strain on our ability to fund our entitlement programs. A large and growing public debt could also eventually put upward pressure on interest rates and crowd out private investment.\n\nAnother factor that may help explain the drop in net saving in the U.S. is the persistent rise in productivity growth rates that began in the mid-1990s. Higher productivity has three related effects, all of which serve to widen the gap between saving and investment. First, it raises the demand for investment because it increases the rate of return on capital. Second, higher productivity also increases households' permanent income. This means that households are willing to temporarily reduce saving out of current income in order to consume more today. Indeed, they know they can afford to do so because the higher return from a dollar's worth of investment will boost income in the future. And third, higher productivity attracts foreign saving. The increased GDP growth and higher risk-adjusted rates of return on capital enhance the attractiveness of investment opportunities in U.S. markets relative to those in slower-growing industrial countries, such as Europe and Japan. Furthermore, with the persistence of solid productivity growth and its relatively younger labor force, the U.S. could continue to experience relatively higher GDP growth and thus continue to attract foreign capital and retain domestic capital for some years to come.\n\nOver time, however, as higher productivity and capital accumulation boost income, the saving rate will move back up. And because of the higher income growth, this increased saving rate can be achieved while maintaining the higher levels of consumption. So how far along are we in this process? Well, it's not clear. The U.S. national saving rate has been constant over the last 4 years, so perhaps we are at the turning point, and the saving rate is about to start to rise back up to its long-term level. But it's too early to tell.\n\nIt's important to realize that U.S. GDP growth and overall economic conditions generally have been good over the past decade despite the large U.S. current account deficit. And right now, our debt service is low: The rates of return that foreign investors earn in the U.S. are low relative to the rates of return that we earn on our investments abroad. So with our relatively high pace of GDP growth, we have been able to service our debt largely from the growth of the economy, rather than by a substantial reduction in the level of consumption. In addition, the open capital markets that make such current account deficits possible have obvious economic benefits. Without them, it would have been much harder for the U.S. to accumulate the additional capital needed to exploit the increase in productivity. Instead of borrowing cheaply from abroad, the U.S. would have had to sacrifice a significant amount of current consumption in order to finance the necessary investment.\n\nStill, an economy the size of the U.S. cannot run large current account deficits indefinitely. For it to do so, the rest of the world would have to run persistently high net saving rates. Eventually, these countries will want to consume or invest more in their own countries. With fewer funds available, the U.S. current account deficit would fall.\n\nNo one can say when this adjustment away from such high current account deficits will begin. But I expect that when it does, the adjustment will be gradual, without a major disruption to U.S. economic performance. One reason is that many of the forces driving investment and saving in the U.S. and the rest of the world are long-lived developments driven by fundamental economic factors. Also, our large creditors likely would prefer a gradual adjustment of the U.S. external debt because they would undoubtedly suffer large capital losses in the event that there was a rapid unwinding of portfolio positions.\n\nConclusion\nThough seemingly unrelated, financial education and the current account deficit are two long-term issues that we must focus on if we want to ensure that the economy remains strong in the future. Both topics at their core deal with understanding how current spending—by the individual or by the nation—must be balanced against future income prospects and future needs. The key is that we recognize the costs and trade-offs that we incur when we make these consumption decisions. A little more financial education would certainly help in this regard.\n\n*The views presented here are my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "Our purpose here today is to analyze the challenges facing the U.S. automobile industry, focusing especially on suppliers. To set the tone, let me take you back to November 2003—the last time we held a special conference on the auto industry. That conference was part of the Chicago Fed's manufacturing assessment project. We met in our former Detroit branch building to discuss the rapid decline of the manufacturing sector in this region.\n\nThe main questions then concerned the nature of the downturn. We asked whether manufacturing was at a \"crossroads\" or merely experiencing a \"bump in the road.\" In other words, were the recent weaknesses in manufacturing attributable to transitory, cyclical factors, such as the worldwide recession and a high-valued dollar? Or did the growth of low-wage economies overseas presage a structural change in which domestic production would migrate overseas at an increasing rate?\n\nOur project paid special attention to the auto sector, an industry that looms large in manufacturing, especially in the Midwest. Much auto production and related activity takes place in Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, and the Canadian province of Ontario. This important industry represents over 3 percent of U.S. GDP and an even higher share of output in the Midwest. Accordingly, structural changes in the automotive industry have a significant impact on this region.\n\nEven then it was clear that if one industry faced a structural turn, it was autos. While overall vehicle sales generally were strong, the traditional Big Three automakers faced serious challenges. And it was clear that the Midwest would continue to be affected by shifts in the regional distribution of motor vehicle production and in the relationships between companies and their suppliers. These relationships need to be put into sharper focus. Automotive suppliers are the lesser known part of the auto sector, even though they employ 3 to 4 times as many workers as assemblers. In addition, supply companies are being asked to play a much more important role in the value chain in such areas as logistics and research and development.\n\nAnd so, the suppliers are the focus of our conference today. The research that we discuss at this conference will delve deeply into the issues faced by this industry. A strong research understanding—along with the insights of industry leaders—can help all of the participants in the private and public sectors to better fashion plans and policies during these challenging times.\n\nThe difficulties of U.S. nameplate automakers and suppliers certainly have been front-page news. The Big Three continue to restructure and cut production capacity amid ongoing losses in market share. Since 1995, the share of the U.S. market held by Chrysler, Ford, and GM has declined from 72 to 56 percent, dropping 7 percentage points over the past 5 years alone. GM reported 2005 losses of $10.6 billion, and the debt of both Ford and GM has been downgraded substantially below investment grade status.\n\nBankruptcy has become a reality for a number of auto suppliers—more than 20 of the largest 150 have filed for Chapter 11 since 1999, including some of the largest and best known: Delphi, Dana, Tower, and Collins & Aikman.\n\nThese bankruptcies reflect a confluence of factors that has created a difficult business environment for many parts suppliers. Such factors include the rising costs of inputs, restructuring of the traditional assembler-supplier relationships, a shrinking customer base, high labor costs, and heightened import competition.\n\nThe first of these factors is the large increases we have seen over the past several years in the costs of inputs such as steel, resins, and energy. A good deal of these higher costs reflects the general rise in global demand for industrial commodities. Suppliers' profits suffered to the degree that they were unable to offset cost increases with productivity enhancements or pass them through as higher prices to their customers.\n\nThe second factor is that traditional carmaker-supplier relationships are rapidly changing. Today, assembly companies are requiring more from their primary suppliers in terms of product design, engineering, and cost. But some assemblers and suppliers are finding it difficult to achieve the cooperative relationships now required to produce popular, high-quality vehicles.\n\nA third factor is that many suppliers, particularly in the Midwest, are losing business because their Big Three customers continue to lose market share to foreign nameplate manufacturers located in other regions of the United States. The flipside to this, of course, is the opportunity for suppliers to increase sales to the foreign manufacturers who are producing an ever higher number of vehicles in the U.S. But the transition to new customers may be a formidable challenge for many suppliers. New customer relationships take a long time to build, and the costs of relocating operations closer to new customers or servicing these customers from distant production facilities are significant.\n\nThe fourth and fifth factors behind the difficult business environment are related. We are all familiar with the issues regarding wage, benefit, and legacy costs in the industry. In turn, these labor costs have contributed to heightened competition from cheaper imported parts. Indeed, direct imports to the U.S. of motor vehicle parts have more than doubled since 1995, increasing from $37 billion to $84 billion in 2005.\n\nAnd so today we can see with greater clarity that many of the challenges in the auto sector are profound and fundamental, affecting the viability of the manufacturers and parts suppliers as well as the hundreds of thousands of workers employed in the industry.\n\nTo be sure, a number of factors affect employment in the industry. Productivity gains in the motor vehicle industry have been strong and steady over the past 20 years. These gains have lowered production costs, which have in turn been passed on as lower vehicle prices to consumers. Productivity gains are also evident from trends in automotive jobs and output. Domestic production of light vehicles changed little between 2001 and 2005, whereas domestic employment declined by 10 percent at final assemblers and by 13 percent—almost 100,000 jobs—at parts suppliers.\n\nIn many instances, the structural changes in the motor vehicle industry are affecting the Midwest differently than other auto-producing areas of the country. In response to their large declines in market share, the Big Three have significantly scaled back their operations during the last five years. The Big Three have been modernizing and replacing some of their existing plants in the Midwest, but they have not sited any new ones. In contrast, since 1990, there have been eight new assembly plants built or announced in the U.S. excluding those replacing older facilities in the same metropolitan area. All eight have been built by foreign nameplates, and seven of them are in the South.\n\nThe geographic shift in assembly plants impacts parts operations. Parts suppliers tend to concentrate near assembly plants. Prior to 1980, only one out of five supplier plant openings were located in the South. That ratio has now increased to one out of three.\n\nIn light of these changes, uncertainty about the automotive industry's future is foremost on the minds of many in the Midwest. As a group, the traditional auto states of Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio have lost 17 percent of their jobs in the motor vehicle and parts industries since 2001. Michigan, the most auto-dependent state in the nation, has lost over 22 percent of its automotive jobs in this period, and its unemployment rate has been among the highest in the country for the past three years. In contrast, outside of these three states, the rest of the country has lost only 6.8 percent of its auto industry jobs.\n\nAs these developments play out, the industry and its traditional core region face a painful adjustment. At this conference, we intend to address five important questions that stem from this changing landscape.\n\nFirst, what is the likelihood of a turnaround for the Big Three assembly companies and their suppliers? While these companies face significant challenges, in earlier periods many troubled firms in the industry have been able to improve productivity and develop new products. And as a nation the U.S. has a long history of refashioning industries with new capital, new organization, and new ideas.\n\nSecond, what would be the impact of continued Big Three market losses to the region's automotive parts industry? Can the Midwest automotive parts companies adapt to new customers and markets, and if so, would they move or stay in the Midwest?\n\nThird, how are auto parts companies restructuring their organizational and production processes to put themselves on firmer footing going forward? We have seen and experienced major restructuring in Midwest industries such as steel and machinery. How might the automotive parts industry restructure, and what might it look like after it does?\n\nFourth, what role will changing management-labor relations, employment costs, and working conditions play in the reconfigured auto parts industry?\n\nAnd finally, how will all of these changes in the motor vehicle industry affect the Midwest workforce and its communities?\n\nWe are going to talk about all of these issues over the next two days. The program is organized in two major sessions. This afternoon we will explore the varied and evolving producer-supplier relationships. We will hear viewpoints from both carmakers and suppliers. Tomorrow our focus will turn to regional developments as they relate to structural changes in this industry. An important component of this discussion is the status of management and labor relations in this industry.\n\n*The views presented here are my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "Thank you for inviting me to speak here today. I'd first like to discuss economic conditions in Iowa, the Midwest, and the U.S. I'll then turn to a topic that you have asked me to address and one that I think is key to ensuring the high quality of our future workforce: reforms that improve the quality of our education system. I understand that this is a topic of much discussion here in Iowa right now.\n\nAs you know, Iowa is a part of the Seventh Federal Reserve District, the region that we cover at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. The Seventh District also includes most of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin. While other states in the District are heavily dependent on manufacturing, Iowa is more diversified, with a relatively larger share of its workers employed in agriculture and financial services. In recent years, Iowa has been one of the strong performers in our region. Iowa has kept pace with the rest of the nation in terms of income growth, and its unemployment rate at 4.4 percent in February is below the national average. In contrast, other portions of the District have not performed as well; the most notable soft patch has been in Michigan, which is suffering from the problems of the Big Three automakers.\n\nLooking beyond the Seventh District, overall, the national economy is doing well. The slow growth in GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005 appears to have been temporary, and output currently looks to be rebounding smartly. Notably, job growth has been strong in recent months, and consumer and business spending are growing at solid rates. More broadly, the economic growth we have experienced over the past few years has reduced the unemployment rate to 4.7 percent and raised manufacturing capacity utilization to a bit above its long-run average. So the bulk of our productive resources that were underutilized following the 2001 recession are now back at work. At the same time, core inflation remains contained.\n\nAnd looking beyond the near-term, I'd say that the outlook is good: Sound underlying economic fundamentals are supporting self-sustaining economic growth. Importantly, the fourth quarter aside, the underlying trends in productivity are quite solid.\n\nWe at the Chicago Fed think that after a strong rebound in the first quarter of 2006, real GDP growth will average somewhat above three percent over the next couple of years. We expect that the unemployment rate will change little from its current level and that inflation will remain contained. However, inflation currently is near the upper end of the range that I feel is consistent with price stability. As such, I believe monetary policy must be vigilant. We need to make sure that increases in resource utilization or prices of energy and other commodities do not add to inflationary pressures or increase inflation expectations.\n\nOf course, there are always uncertainties to an economic outlook. One we currently face concerns housing markets. There has been a good deal of discussion about froth in housing prices, and most forecasts of GDP that you see factor in some moderation in home price appreciation and residential investment. Indeed, the slowdown in housing should be an important factor in bringing growth back to potential. So far, housing has been moderating in a way that is broadly consistent with these forecasts. But if housing markets soften more appreciably, we could see a more significant negative effect on overall spending.\n\nThere could be upside surprises to growth as well. For example, we could see higher demand for U.S. exports due to stronger growth in foreign economies. And if growth in the U.S. was indeed much more robust, we would need to be watchful for an increase in inflationary pressures.\n\nI'm sure you have also heard concerns expressed about our sizable fiscal and current account deficits. These are sources of uncertainty, not so much to the outlook over the next couple of years but to longer-term economic prospects. Our current account deficit means that, as a nation, consumers, firms, and governments are spending more than the total income that we earn from production in the U.S. and on net investment returns from abroad. In doing so, we are increasing our debt to foreigners. Currently, we have no difficulty servicing this debt. But to keep foreigners willing to lend to us and our debt service manageable, we eventually will have to reduce the current account deficit. Most likely, the adjustment process will be smooth, but we must be watchful for circumstances that would result in a more abrupt adjustment.\n\nOur fiscal deficits—how much government spending exceeds tax revenues—are a concern because growing medical costs and rapidly changing demographics will at some point put an enormous strain on our ability to fund our entitlement programs. We will eventually be forced to make some tough decisions on how we'll operate and pay for these programs. A large and growing public debt could also eventually put upward pressure on interest rates and crowd out private investment.\n\nStill, while these factors add uncertainty to the outlook, they do not change the overall picture that the prospects for the U.S. economy over the next couple of years are good. But they also highlight that, over the longer-term, if we want to keep improving our standard of living, we must make sure that productivity growth remains robust. Faster productivity growth generates faster GDP growth. This boosts our well-being. It also helps make the adjustments to the current account and fiscal deficits a much smoother process than if we were facing them from a base of lower GDP growth.\n\nAn important factor driving productivity growth is worker quality, which includes the education and the experience of the workforce. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, improvements in worker skills were adding four-tenths of a percentage point per year to the growth of output. By the end of the 1990s, this had fallen to less than two-tenths of a percentage point. And we could see a decline to one-twentieth of a percentage point by 2010, as the highly experienced workers of the baby boom generation retire in increasing numbers. Gains in education and other workforce skills by new entrants, and skill improvements by remaining workers, could offset much of this decline. But if we consider recent education trends, I'd say we have our work cut out for us on this.\n\nIn the quarter century after World War II, the expansion of secondary and postsecondary education caused labor quality growth to average nearly 1 percent per year, as younger, more highly educated workers replaced retirees with less educational attainment. But since that time, the educational attainment of retirees and new entrants has converged.\n\nFor postsecondary education, the picture is more promising. College graduation rates are growing, as families have noted the very high and climbing economic returns to education. The unemployment rate for college graduates is currently under 2.5 percent, but it's about 7 percent for high school dropouts. Furthermore, the gap in wages between educated and less-educated workers in the U.S. economy has widened dramatically since the late 1970s. Research shows that each additional year of education tends to raise hourly earnings by about 10 percent. And these are only the returns that go directly to the individual. Researchers are finding that the increased skills of educated workers also raise the productivity of their coworkers. Furthermore, communities with highly educated citizens experience lower crime and more public involvement in civic activities and the political process.\n\nOur investment in education is already enormous. We currently spend almost one-half trillion dollars on elementary and secondary schools in the public sector, or about 4 percent of GDP. The United States has nearly the highest spending per pupil in the world. Yet there is a great deal of dissatisfaction with the results. This is not only true in the outcomes generated by many of our big city schools, but it also extends to suburban and rural schools. There is a growing recognition that we must spend the money more wisely and achieve a substantially greater return on our investment.\n\nThis has driven the spate of interest in experimentation and systemic reform to improve our schools, especially for those students from disadvantaged backgrounds who have limited choices and opportunities in our current system. Many school reforms have been tried in the Midwest—from Milwaukee's full-fledged voucher program, to the extensive charter program in Michigan, to Chicago's central authority with the mayor having substantial executive power. And Iowa has a long history of leadership in public education.\n\nPersonally, I believe that the consumers of education—parents and students—have a good idea of what they want from their schools. Given a choice, they will gravitate to those schools that provide it. And when that choice is available, market mechanisms work relentlessly in most instances to deliver the right services to customers. So I think that choice and competition should be considered carefully in these reform efforts.\n\nImproving Teaching Effectiveness\nWhen discussing reform in education, a good place to start is where the \"rubber meets the road,\" that is, where our teachers interact and deliver services to their students.\n\nNow, teaching is a very difficult job. I know—having been a high school English and history teacher myself many years ago. Our schools are extremely fortunate to have many excellent and dedicated teachers. But we clearly need more. Teacher quality matters greatly for student achievement. Several carefully designed research studies from across the country show that teacher quality varies significantly, even within the same school. To give you some idea of the magnitude, Dan Aaronson and Lisa Barrow of our staff found that the test score gains for an average student in the Chicago Public Schools would increase by at least 20 percent if that student were reassigned from a classroom with an average quality math teacher to a classroom in the same school with a math teacher ranked at the 95th percentile of their quality distribution.\n\nSo what can we do to improve our teacher corps? One approach is to identify those teachers who are ineffective and replace them with more productive ones. We know that it's possible to identify ineffective teachers. However, in our current system it's not easy to make them better or to replace them.\n\nSurprisingly, Aaronson and Barrow also found that the typical credentials that determine compensation in our schools today—advanced degrees in education, certification, years of teaching experience—do not help much in identifying effective teachers. Their research shows that these factors account for only about 3 percent of the variation in teacher quality.\n\nCan we substantially improve the effectiveness of our teachers through enhanced training? While we know that teachers matter, we know less about programs that could improve the quality of our teachers. Research shows that having a math or science degree is helpful for teaching those subjects. Specific skills do matter. But since the general education credentials seem to matter little, traditional teacher training programs—including those college curriculums specializing in education—apparently don't do the job. There are, however, heroic efforts and exemplary program models underway to improve teacher preparation throughout the nation. These include better recruiting strategies, mentoring, and enhanced training academies. In many cases, these programs have been generously funded by the business and philanthropic community. Still, they do not reach the majority of our teaching corps.\n\nOf course, teacher pay is an important element of the reform process. In my opinion, we must be careful about simply raising teacher salaries across the board. This would attract and keep better teachers, but it would also encourage many poorly performing teachers to remain on the job even longer—in other words, such a policy would be a slow and expensive way to raise average teacher quality. And even with higher overall salaries, excellent teachers will find themselves tied to rigid pay scales that do not compensate them for their excellence. Nor will they be able to advance their careers without leaving the classroom. So I believe that merit-based pay incentives deserve full consideration. And I'm glad to see such proposals gaining visibility, such as the Hamilton Project that is being led by former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and economists Thomas Kane from Harvard and Douglas Staiger from Dartmouth.\n\nIndeed, one important finding from studies of teacher quality and student outcomes is that high-quality teacher performance tends to persist from year to year. This means that we can predict good teachers from their past performance. So through observation and timely assessment of data on student achievement, a motivated and empowered school principal could accurately identify high-quality teachers and reward them accordingly.\n\nTherefore, a number of efforts geared toward building a higher quality teacher workforce are possible. These would include more selective hiring, a lengthy apprenticeship with comprehensive evaluation, and regular, rigorous personnel evaluations with pay-for-performance rewards. In addition, in subject areas where it is more difficult to find qualified instructors, such as math and science, it would make sense to increase teacher pay.\n\nSo far, so good. But what kind of systemic changes can actually bring about such personnel policies—indeed, ones that are taken for granted in many other professions and businesses? Unfortunately, public education has many elements of a monopoly—a publicly owned and operated monopoly. And consumers are served far better in just about any market when there is competition by many as opposed to having just one provider.\n\nSo I believe that systemic change in public education would be encouraged and accelerated by the infusion of market incentives. Choice and competition have the power to lead us to better educational outcomes by spurring both new and existing schools to innovate, keep costs low, and better serve the students.\n\nIn competitive environments, successful firms and organizations discover their customers' needs. They make strong and innovative efforts to tailor their services to meet those needs at a reasonable cost. When doing so, they adopt pay for performance and other types of personnel and compensation practices that we should be aspiring to in the education profession.\n\nChicago's Reform Efforts\nIn Chicago, the business community has a long tradition of working with the city and civic institutions on important policy issues. As a member of that community, I have witnessed the many attempts to improve elementary and secondary education at the Chicago Public Schools. CPS is an example of a school system that has taken a series of steps that are beginning to bring about a modest amount of choice and competition. It has, however, been a winding path, preceded by several other attempted reforms.\n\nI want to emphasize at the outset that Chicago's efforts have been targeted specifically to address the problems in Chicago, which has a very large school system with over 600 schools and 425,000 students. Conditions in school districts obviously vary widely, and what is needed in Chicago may not necessarily be appropriate in other districts.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the then secretary of education William Bennett called the Chicago public school system the worst in the nation. Correct or not, Chicago's school system was characteristic of older large city school systems across the Northeast and Midwest. Flight from the city in both its economic base and middle-class population during the 1960s and 1970s left behind a school system that was poorly suited for the daunting job of ameliorating poverty.\n\nA series of reforms began in 1988, when the state legislature passed a bill to diminish the authority of the Chicago Board of Education and push some decision making down to local school councils at the individual school and community level. Initial hopes were high, and many neighborhoods effectively managed and improved their local schools. Many continue to do so today. At too many school sites, however, the local school councils could not effectively grapple with the entrenched power of the system, the political influence of the teacher's union, and the vagaries of community politics. Some councils were never able to organize effectively to make the necessary improvements.\n\nBy 1995, Chicago school reform shifted toward a different approach: strong central control vested in the office of the mayor. The Illinois state legislature passed a new education reform bill that generally redistributed power from local school councils to the city government. This new strong central authority has been modestly effective in raising student performance. As measured by the state's school achievement test, both reading and math scores have risen at the 3rd, 5th, and 8th grade levels since 1999. These gains have been realized in high-poverty schools as well as selective-enrollment schools.\n\nHowever, holding on to these gains in the high school years has proven to be more difficult. In fact, we have not seen gains in test scores at the high school level. And even for the lower grades, achievement gains have tapered off over the last couple of years.\n\nIt is perhaps for these reasons that the mayor, the public schools, the business leadership, and community groups have come to the realization that further reforms are necessary. New and superior schools, employing innovation and creativity, must be created to replace nonfunctional schools in high poverty neighborhoods.\n\nRenaissance 2010 is a recent product of this effort. This bold program aims to create 100 excellent new schools—charter schools, contract schools, and performance schools—with more independent and entrepreneurial leadership. These schools have more freedom to innovate because they are less encumbered by the historical layers of rules and procedures. In some instances, schools will exercise greater latitude to recruit and choose their own staff and to evaluate and reward their performance. Such an environment should attract teachers with desire, drive, talent, and commitment.\n\nAs they have elsewhere, charter schools are an important part of education reform in Illinois. The majority of the new Renaissance 2010 schools this year and those planned for next year are charters.\n\nAt the beginning of this academic year, eighteen Renaissance 2010 schools were opened to replace schools that were closed due to declining enrollment and deteriorating facilities. Thirteen additional Renaissance 2010 schools are slated to start operating this fall. The business community and family foundations provided start-up funds for these new schools. The objective, of course, is not only to improve the education of the students enrolled in the new schools but also to provide incentives for traditional public schools to improve.\n\nRenaissance 2010 schools will stay in operation only as long as they \"deliver the goods\" to their deserving customers. They will be held accountable in two ways. First, Renaissance schools can expect close scrutiny and rigid assessment by the Chicago Public Schools administration—not of their pedagogy and procedures, but of how well their students perform. Second, parents will be able to review their options and, if they choose, move their children to another school—just as many suburban parents now do when selecting the community in which to live.\n\nLooking forward, the problems inherent in raising educational attainment for our most disadvantaged students are not easy. Too often, the hurdles to student achievement involve family background, resources, neighborhood, and environment. To overcome these obstacles, the local school cannot be \"average\" in performance or design. Rather, it must be highly innovative and focused on the particular circumstances that hold back disadvantaged children.\n\nSuch innovation tends to arise in other environments characterized by choice and competition. Competition makes service providers attentive to the particular needs of their customers. In the case of education, this can help generate a sense of understanding and mutual responsibility between the schools and the families they serve.\n\nIn bringing about needed changes in Chicago, we have found that partnerships and persistence can make a difference. The disadvantages that many of our students face were not created overnight—nor were the institutions and governance structures that we are attempting to refashion. And determined resistance to reforms, such as those inherent in Renaissance 2010, continues every step of the way. But change is coming, even if it is not coming about through sudden upheaval. Gains are not coming in profound leaps, but real gains are being achieved.\n\nExcellence in public education has always been high on the agenda in Iowa, and you now have a number of reform proposals under consideration. We all wish you well in these efforts. The experience in other parts of the Midwest, some of which I described today, may or may not be relevant to Iowa. Only you can make that decision. But we all recognize the need to have a well-educated citizenry and productive workforce. Not only does it raise our standard of living, but it provides us with well-informed, active participants in our communities and the democratic process. Thank you.\n\n*The views presented here are my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "Today I'm going to begin by briefly discussing the U.S. economic outlook, and then I'll look more closely at an issue that has garnered a lot of attention lately—the large and growing U.S. current account deficit. As a member of the Fed's monetary policy-making body, the FOMC, my job is to help formulate monetary policy. In the U.S., monetary policy has two statutory objectives: price stability and maximum sustainable economic growth. Now, Milton Friedman has said that monetary policy making is complex and treacherous. In his judgment, simple policies might be better than complicated ones. At one point, he said that monetary policy makers should just increase the money supply by a small percentage each year and leave well enough alone. I would certainly like to be able to do this—it would give me and my staff a lot more time to play golf. But I don't take this view; in practice, we work hard to overcome the difficulties that Friedman pointed out.\n\nIn particular, policy makers need to understand a host of factors that may influence their ability to achieve price stability and maximum sustainable growth over the long run. Some developments, such as the degree of resource pressures, are almost always at the fore of policy discussions. But others, though less pressing in the short run, are important to analyze because they have the potential to influence prices and output in the medium and long run. The current account deficit falls into the latter category.\n\nSo today I'm going to talk about the U.S. current account deficit and some of its implications for U.S. monetary policy. Of course, some of these issues may apply to the United Kingdom as well. And let me emphasize that these are only my views and not necessarily those of the Chicago Fed or the FOMC.\n\nBut first, let me talk a bit about the U.S. economic outlook. The latest economic data have been quite positive. Job growth has been solid in recent months. The unemployment rate has fallen to 4.8 percent, and manufacturing capacity utilization has risen to a bit above its long-run average. So the bulk of our productive resources that were underutilized following the 2001 recession are now back at work. At the same time, core inflation remains contained.\n\nOf course, there is one notable exception to the good news: the low 1.7 percent figure for real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2005. Much of this decline, however, reflects fluctuations in government spending, imports, and motor vehicle output that look to have been temporary. Indeed, the most recent monthly indicators of activity have been quite favorable, and we think that growth in output is rebounding smartly from the low fourth-quarter number.\n\nAnd looking beyond the near-term fluctuations, I'd say that the outlook is good: Sound underlying economic fundamentals appear to be supporting self-sustaining economic growth. Importantly, the fourth quarter aside, the underlying trends in productivity are quite solid.\n\nIn February the Federal Reserve Governors and Reserve Bank Presidents released our projections for the economy in the semiannual monetary report to Congress. The central tendency of these forecasts had real GDP increasing about 3-1/2 percent in 2006 and in the 3 to 3-1/2 percent range in 2007—close to many recent estimates for potential. The unemployment rate was expected to be in the 4-3/4 to 5 percent range in both years. With regard to inflation, the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy was expected to increase about 2 percent this year and between 1-3/4 and 2 percent in 2007.\n\nThere are, of course, uncertainties to this outlook. One concerns housing, which has both upside and downside risks. There has been a good deal of discussion about froth in U.S. housing prices, and most forecasts of GDP that you see factor in some moderation in home price appreciation and residential investment. Indeed, the slowdown in housing should be an important factor in bringing growth back to potential. So far, housing has been moderating in a way that is broadly consistent with these forecasts. But if housing markets soften more appreciably, we could see a more significant negative effect on overall spending. There is also the possibility, however, that housing markets will remain solid—for example, because of support from the continued low level of long-term interest rates. This would then heighten the risk of above-trend GDP growth and the further development of pressures on resources.\n\nStill, while housing and other factors add uncertainty to the outlook, they do not change the overall picture that the prospects for the U.S. economy over the next couple of years are good. But, as I mentioned, there are longer-term issues, and our current account deficit is one of them.\n\nA current account deficit, as you know, means that a country is spending more than it is earning. To be more precise, the consumers, firms, and government of a country are collectively spending more than the total income that they are earning from domestic production and earnings on net investment returns from abroad. In 2005, the U.S. current account deficit reached $805 billion, or 6.4 percent of GDP. This deficit has been growing rapidly since 1997, when it stood at just 1.7 percent of GDP. These persistent and widening deficits have translated into a large increase in the U.S. net foreign debt position. Prior to 1986, the U.S. was a net creditor to the rest of the world. During the early 1990s, the net foreign debt position stayed in a narrow range of 5 to 6 percent of GDP. Since then, however, it has widened steadily and currently stands at 21 percent of GDP.\n\nThe current account deficit can also be thought of as the extent to which national investment exceeds national saving. The 2005 U.S. current account deficit of 6.4 percent of GDP reflects a national saving rate of 13.6 percent and a national investment rate of just over 20 percent. The changes in the current account deficit over the past 10 years largely reflect a steady decline in the national saving rate; the investment share of GDP has fluctuated quite a bit, but on net it has risen only a couple of percentage points.\n\nIn order for the U.S. to run a current account deficit with the rest of the world, the rest of the world has to run a current account surplus with the U.S. This parallel accounting identity means that the combined national saving for the rest of the world has exceeded its combined national investment. This rising net saving has been financing our widening current account deficit. The key sources of this rising saving have been Japan; the developing countries of East Asia, including China; and the major oil-exporting nations.\n\nSo far, all I've talked about is accounting. But what are the fundamental economic factors underlying the large U.S. current account deficits? There are a number of overlapping questions that we need to answer. Why has the desired net saving rate in the U.S. decreased? Why has the desired net saving rate in the rest of the world increased? And why have the net savers in the world decided to invest so much of their surplus in the United States, as opposed to elsewhere? Understanding these questions is important for thinking about the implications of possible changes in the current account for future U.S. macroeconomic performance and hence for monetary policy.\n\nLet me begin with developments in the U.S. domestic economy that may have affected our desired saving and investment. There are three sources of national saving: households, businesses, and governments. So an obvious candidate to explain the falling U.S. saving rate would be the large shift in the U.S. fiscal balance. From 1998 to 2001, U.S. governments—federal, state and local—ran fiscal surpluses of 1 to 2-1/2 percent of GDP. Since 2002, however, they have been running fiscal deficits in the range of 2-3/4 to 3-3/4 percent of GDP.\n\nCan these fiscal deficits explain the current account deficit? It is true that if we hold private investment and saving constant, higher fiscal deficits imply higher current account deficits as a matter of accounting. In practice, however, investment and private savings are not constant, so the historical relationship between the fiscal deficit and the current account deficit has not been one-to-one. Just look back again at the late-1990s, when the U.S. was running large current account deficits despite the fiscal surpluses. Research by economists at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors suggests that an exogenous $1 reduction in the U.S. fiscal deficit would cause the current account deficit to decline by less than 20 cents. So, this evidence suggests the growing fiscal imbalances do not explain the bulk of the change in U.S. net saving or the current account.\n\nOf course, that doesn't lessen the importance from the point of view of U.S. public policy of reducing these large fiscal deficits. Growing medical costs and rapidly changing demographics will at some point put an enormous strain on our ability to fund our entitlement programs. A large and growing public debt could also eventually put upward pressure on interest rates and crowd out private investment.\n\nAnother factor that may help explain the drop in net saving in the U.S. is the persistent rise in productivity growth rates that began in the mid-1990s. Higher productivity has three related effects, all of which serve to widen the gap between saving and investment. First, it raises the demand for investment because it increases the rate of return on capital. Second, higher productivity also increases households' permanent income. This means that households are willing to temporarily reduce saving out of current income in order to consume more today. Indeed, they know they can afford to do so because the higher return from a dollar's worth of investment will boost income in the future. And third, higher productivity attracts foreign saving. The increased GDP growth and higher risk-adjusted rates of return on capital enhance the attractiveness of investment opportunities in U.S. markets relative to those in slower-growing industrial countries, such as Europe and Japan. Furthermore, with the persistence of solid productivity growth and its relatively younger labor force, the U.S. could continue to experience relatively higher GDP growth and thus continue to attract foreign capital and retain domestic capital for some years to come.\n\nAs I just mentioned, economic theory suggests that a persistent increase in the level of productivity for an open economy initially causes households to increase consumption relative to current income, thereby lowering the saving rate. But over time, as higher productivity and capital accumulation boost income, the saving rate will move back up. And because of the higher income growth, this increased saving rate can be achieved while maintaining the higher levels of consumption. So how far along are we in this process? Well, it's not clear. The U.S. national saving rate has been constant over the last 4 years, so perhaps we are at the turning point, and the saving rate is about to start to rise back up to its long-term level. But it's too early to tell.\n\nThe next place to look to help explain the U.S. current account deficit is the increase in desired net saving by the rest of the world. Most of the countries or regions that have witnessed the largest increases in their net saving rates are in Asia: China, Japan, and the developing East Asian nations. The oil exporters have also greatly increased their net saving rates recently. This is a diverse group of countries, and they have increased their net national saving for a number of different reasons.\n\nLet's start with the developing East Asian countries. A large part of their higher net saving rates likely are a response to the financial crises that occurred in 1997. These crises induced rapid capital outflows, large currency depreciations, sharp declines in domestic asset prices, weakened banking systems, and significant declines in domestic output. As a result, these countries had to switch from being net importers to net exporters in order to meet their foreign obligations. And to protect their currencies from further depreciation, they began rapidly accumulating larger reserves of foreign currency as an insurance buffer against future financial crises. Some believe that these countries will continue to accumulate reserves for some time.\n\nThe story is different in China. Their increase in net saving can probably be explained by the way they are pursuing an export-led growth strategy. The Chinese have utilized their abundant supply of labor to produce low-cost goods to export. At the same time, opportunities for domestic investment are limited by frictions in Chinese financial markets and domestic political considerations. As a result there has been a steady increase in the public sector saving rate, leading to a widening Chinese current account surplus.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the other growth miracle in Asia, namely India, has not pursued an export-led strategy that involves running large current account surpluses. India has grown at a robust pace while their current account has moved from a small surplus to a moderate deficit. Indeed, for many economists, the Indian example is more natural, since it involves capital flowing to, rather than away from, a developing country with abundant investment opportunities.\n\nThe major oil exporting nations are another story. They have experienced sizable oil profits, yet appear to have limited domestic spending. To a degree, some countries may be salting away what they feel may be relatively short-term windfalls. As a result, they have invested a good deal of money abroad.\n\nFinally, we have Japan. Japan has a disproportionately large share of older workers compared to other industrialized nations and soon will have to pay for their retirement. Furthermore, the birth rate in Japan is very low, so the need for capital accumulation is less pressing. Accordingly, the Japanese have increased net saving, not so much by saving more, but by reducing capital investment at home, The foreign assets they are then accumulating can go toward financing their upcoming large wave of retirements.\n\nWith so many developments influencing the desired saving and investment decisions of the U.S. and the rest of the world, it's difficult to quantify the effect of any one factor as being more important than the others. However, the low real interest rates throughout the world over the last several years suggest that the most important factors underlying the recent increase in the U.S. current account deficits have been shifts in the desired net savings by the rest of the world. Reductions in desired U.S. net saving may have played a role as well. But if a fall in U.S. desired saving was dominant, interest rates would have risen, not fallen.\n\nDespite the large U.S. current account deficit, U.S. GDP growth and overall economic conditions generally have been good over the past decade. And the open capital markets that make such current account deficits possible have obvious economic benefits. Without them, it would have been much harder for the U.S. to accumulate the additional capital needed to exploit the increase in productivity. Instead of borrowing cheaply from abroad, the U.S. would have had to sacrifice a significant amount of current consumption in order to finance the necessary investment.\n\nBut an economy the size of the U.S. cannot run large current account deficits indefinitely. For it to do so, the rest of the world would have to run persistently high net saving rates. Eventually, these countries' portfolios will reach their desired allocations of U.S. assets. They will then want to consume or invest more in their own countries. With fewer funds available, the U.S. current account deficit would fall. So, when will we begin to see forces coming into play that result in this adjustment process? And once it does adjust, how will the situation unwind, and at what pace will it occur?\n\nNo one can say when this adjustment away from such high current account deficits will begin. But I expect that when it does, the adjustment will be gradual, without a major disruption to U.S. economic performance. One reason is that many of the forces driving investment and saving in the U.S. and the rest of the world are long-lived developments driven by fundamental economic factors. Furthermore, our debt service is low: The rates of return that foreign investors earn in the U.S. are low relative to the rates of return that we earn on our investments abroad. So with our relatively high pace of GDP growth, we will be able to service our debt largely out of growth rather than by a substantial reduction in the level of consumption. Finally, our large creditors likely would prefer a gradual adjustment of the U.S. external debt because they would undoubtedly suffer large capital losses in the event that there was a rapid unwinding of portfolio positions.\n\nBut proper risk management requires us to think about even very low probability events. And there is the possibility, however remote, that current account imbalances could unwind in a disruptive way. For example, political considerations may be more important to some countries' investment and saving strategies than classic portfolio optimization. Economic fundamentals would then have little to say about how these might change over time and how they might affect the pace at which the current account imbalance unwinds.\n\nHow might monetary policy respond to a rapid adjustment in the current account deficit? The answer to this question depends on how such an adjustment would affect the Federal Reserve's mandates to achieve price stability and maximum sustainable growth.\n\nWhat factors might be in play? Let me sketch out one scenario. An adjustment in world saving will affect U.S. growth and inflation through its influence on interest rates and exchange rates. First, a drop in world saving would increase world real interest rates. These higher interest rates would lower U.S. domestic demand because they would reduce interest-sensitive spending. The potential growth rate of the economy could also fall because of the drop in capital investment. Second, a rapid decline in the net world saving invested in the U.S. would likely cause a drop in the exchange value of the U.S. dollar. The lower dollar would boost U.S. net exports. It would also cause a rise in the prices paid for imported goods and services. Putting all of this together, with regard to growth, many analysts believe that interest rate effects would dominate and U.S. output would fall. This decline would probably be associated with some increase in resource gaps, although not as much as some might think because of the reduction in potential output. With regard to inflation, most think that the net effect would be an increase in inflationary pressure from the higher import prices.\n\nClearly, though, there are a lot of moving parts in play, and it is difficult to know how events would transpire. So the monetary policy decision cannot be mapped out ahead of time; it will depend on how the confluence of numerous factors influences the outlook for maximum sustainable growth and price stability. Our policy would respond to meet these goals.\n\nBut, as I said earlier, the most likely scenario is for a slow decline in the net saving rate by the rest of the world that would induce a gradual contraction in the U.S. current account deficit. This probably would not have a major impact on U.S. price pressures or growth, so there is little reason to think that monetary policy would need to react significantly.\n\nAs an aside, however, I am deeply concerned about one possible fallout from the large and persistent U.S. current account deficit. This is the possibility of protectionist legislation in the U.S. Such barriers to the trade of goods and services and restrictions on international investment in the U.S. would result in a substantial welfare loss, both for the U.S. and for other countries as well.\n\nAs I mentioned at the outset, issues such as the current account deficit are not always on the fore of our policy discussions. But they are an important factor in our analysis of the medium- and long-run prospects for the economy. And I want to conclude by noting that my discussion today reinforces an important principle of monetary policy.\n\nSome people argue that, at times, policy should be adjusted with the aim of changing the value of the current account, the dollar, or certain asset prices. But such variables should not be \"targets\" of monetary policy. Clearly, we need to consider these important economic factors, but we should do so by evaluating how they influence the achievement of our ultimate goals of maximum sustainable growth and price stability. And as many of us on the FOMC have said, we view price stability as a prerequisite for maximum sustainable growth. So, in the end, no matter what path the current account eventually takes, the Federal Reserve will respond to the adjustment process in a manner that is consistent with our ultimate policy goals.\n\n*The views presented here are my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today to discuss some important issues related to central counterparty clearing. On behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, I want to thank our host and cosponsor of this conference, the European Central Bank. This has been a wonderful opportunity for us to discuss these issues with experts from around the world, and I hope that the participants here today have found these discussions helpful. The ECB and the Chicago Fed have worked together closely to plan the conference and agenda, and it has been a very good partnership.\n  Today, I'd like to share with you my thoughts about the important role clearing and settlement institutions play in supporting financial markets. In particular, my remarks today will revolve around four key questions related to central counterparty clearing. First, what economic functions do central counterparties, or CCPs, perform in the clearing and settlement of financial transactions? Second, what alternative institutions can perform the same or economically equivalent functions? Third, what are the costs and benefits of using CCPs as compared with alternative clearing institutions. And fourth, what do these costs and benefits tell us about public policy decisions that should be made concerning CCPs and alternative institutions?\n  I do not expect to give definitive answers to these questions today. We just don't know enough to provide such answers. But I think that careful consideration of these issues is essential to formulating good public policy. The wide variation in financial market structures and the fast pace of financial and technical innovation means there may not be a single, \"first-best\" clearing solution that meets the needs of all markets. So, as a practical matter, it is not possible to formulate public policy without facing fundamental and unavoidable tradeoffs when comparing alternative structures for the clearing and settlement of financial transactions. I'll elaborate on this theme in the course of my discussion.\n  Post-trade clearing and settlement are sometimes referred to as the \"plumbing\" of the financial system. This term may suggest that clearing and settlement systems are of secondary importance. In fact, however, they are more like the \"central nervous system\" of the financial system.1 Clearing and settlement systems provide vital linkages among components of the system, enabling them to work together smoothly. As such, clearing and settlement systems are critical for the performance of the economy. A key role then for public policy is to ensure that these systems function well when confronted by a variety of stresses.\n  Centralized clearing arrangements utilizing CCPs have become more widespread in recent years, both for exchange-traded and over-the-counter markets. This is no surprise, since they are extraordinarily good at what they do. As a consequence of this growth in CCP usage, central banks, securities regulators, and other financial market policy makers have cooperated in recent years to establish appropriate standards for the design, operation, and oversight of CCPs. This effort recently culminated in the G-10 and IOSCO Recommendations for Central Counterparties.2 The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago actively participated in the consultative process leading to the adoption of the Recommendations and related financial stability initiatives.3\n  In the U.S., the regulatory structure has evolved toward supporting a \"hybrid\" system of clearing and settlement. For securities transactions, Congress has mandated a \"national market system\" and the Securities and Exchange Commission has favored centralized clearing and settlement arrangements. But there is no such policy mandate for the derivatives industry. The U.S. thus provides a mixed example of the policy approach that I plan to focus on today.\nCentral counterparty clearing issues also are of keen interest to public policy makers here in Europe, particularly because of the ongoing European financial and economic integration. So the issues being discussed at this conference are both timely and of first-order importance.\n  As you undoubtedly know, Chicago is home to some of the world's most active exchanges. Chicago is also home to three major clearinghouses: the Clearing House Division of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange; the Clearing Corporation, which you may recognize under its former name, the Board of Trade Clearing Corporation, or BOTCC; and the Options Clearing Corporation. Together these institutions represent what is sometimes called \"Chicago model\" of centralized clearing and settlement. This model is characterized by counterparty substitution. That is, the clearinghouse becomes the legally substituted buyer to all sellers and the seller to all buyers in the markets they serve. This typically occurs through a legal process known as \"novation.\" Over the past few decades, this model has been extended to securities markets around the world. The fact that the Chicago model has been so widely emulated is evidence that it is a robust and effective way to operate a clearing and settlement system.\n  However, this model was not developed in a monolithic way, which is not surprising when you think about the historical development of CCPs. This history demonstrates that risk management is not the only factor motivating the development of clearing structures.4 In fact, the first Chicago clearinghouse, BOTCC, was founded after the enactment of the Grain Futures Act of 1922. With the passage of this law, CBOT members faced a choice of alternatives for keeping trading records, reporting open positions to federal regulators, and paying stamp taxes. They could remain in a principal-to-principal relationship with their counterparties and thus keep their records, make their reports, and pay stamp taxes on their gross transactions. Or they could clear their transactions through the clearinghouse and perform those functions on a multilateral net basis. Clearly, the multilateral approach saved both recordkeeping costs and taxes.\n  There are additional lessons to learn from the evolution of the Chicago markets. Early on, each Chicago clearinghouse was associated with a single exchange. While BOTCC was formed as a separate legal entity, it only cleared trades from the Board of Trade. The clearinghouse of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange was and continues to be a division of its parent exchange. Both clearinghouses, however, functioned effectively as CCPs. This one-to-one association of clearinghouse with exchange changed with the advent of exchange demutualization. This forced exchanges to decide whether they wished to be in the trade intermediation business, the clearing and settlement business, or both. Indeed, the separation of ownership and governance of BOTCC from that of the Board of Trade led, in recent years, to a situation where these two institutions pursued somewhat different business objectives. Ultimately, this led to the termination of the longstanding relationship between the two. The Board of Trade then took the remarkable step of outsourcing its clearing operations to its cross-town rival, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange!\n  Another historical example that illustrates the possibility of de-linking the clearinghouse from the exchange comes from the rice futures market of Osaka, Japan, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. There were many different institutions serving that market that we might recognize today as clearinghouses, perhaps as many as sixty at one point.5 This allowed for trader choice in the selection of a clearinghouse and, presumably, competition among clearinghouses.\nThese examples also demonstrate a more fundamental point: Exchanges and clearinghouses are in very different, but interrelated, lines of business and serve very different economic functions. To see this, let's look at the core functions performed by CCPs. I think most analysts would include at least five core functions. All play a role in managing risk in the markets served by the CCP. The first core function is multilateral netting of open positions and payments. The second is calculation, collection, and custodial management of margin and collateral payments. The third is the adoption of procedures, such as \"delivery versus payment,\" that mitigate settlement risk. The fourth is mutualization of all or part of the risk of default. And finally, the fifth core function is to respond to crisis situations in the interest of the entire community of participants in the clearinghouse, not just the interest of a single trader. While other features can be identified, I believe these five adequately describe the core economic functions CCPs typically perform.\n  Let's consider each of these functions to see whether the use of a CCP is necessary to perform them, starting with netting. Following counterparty substitution in a CCP arrangement, a single multilaterally netted position exists between the clearinghouse and each market participant. Thus, a \"many-to-many\" chain of credit is replaced by a \"one-to-many\" arrangement, with the CCP at the center of the arrangement. The gross obligations of the initial counterparties are, as a result, converted to net obligations with respect to a single, substituted counterparty, the CCP. This has the potential to reduce counterparty risk exposures dramatically and reduce operational costs.\n  Multilateral netting of obligations is, by definition, one of the results of counterparty substitution. Thus, CCPs are a convenient mechanism for obtaining the risk management and operational benefits of netting. But is this the only institutional arrangement that can support netting? The answer is no. First take the case of payment netting. CHIPS, the privately owned and operated U.S. dollar payment system based in New York, conducts continuous netting of dollar payments on both a bilateral and multilateral basis without becoming the substituted counterparty to the underlying payment obligations. Similarly, the CLS Bank provides a hybrid clearing arrangement for foreign exchange transactions, which results in multilateral netting of the funding requirements of settlement members. At no point does the CLS Bank become a substituted counterparty to the underlying payment transactions.\n  What about netting of open positions? This is a more complex case than simple payment netting, because open positions involve forward obligations that may be discharged at a future date. Is counterparty substitution necessary for multilateral netting of these types of obligations? Here again, the answer is no, at least under U.S. law. The calculation of a multilateral net amount is simple arithmetic. As long as the participants in a financial market agree to conduct transactions or make payments on a multilateral net basis, and that contract is enforceable under applicable law, counterparty substitution is not necessary.\n  Now let's consider the second role CCPs typically perform, the management of margin and collateral requirements, such as \"mark-to-market\" payments.\n  Derivatives transactions, such as swaps, futures, and short options, require discharge of the underlying obligations at some time in the future. Because of the potential for price fluctuations between the time derivatives obligations are undertaken and the time they are discharged, participants face exposure to forward or \"replacement cost\" risk. To mitigate that risk, clearing arrangements for forward transactions typically impose \"variation margin\" requirements on their clearing members. These payments are based upon a daily or even more frequent marking to market. As a result, traders are forced to realize their net profits and losses on a regular basis.\n  Is counterparty substitution necessary to mitigate replacement cost risk? The answer is no, again under U.S. law. For example, participants in the OTC swaps market often collateralize their bilateral net mark-to-market exposures without the substitution of a central counterparty. Such collateral requirements, however, can be multilaterally netted without counterparty substitution. In fact, in the 1990s the Chicago Mercantile Exchange proposed to establish a facility to do precisely this. That proposal did not involve the legal substitution of the CME Clearing House or any other CCP as counterparty to the underlying swaps transactions. As it happens, that facility never went into operation, but that was for reasons other than its ability to perform this underlying economic function.\n  Now let's consider the last three roles of CCPs: the adoption of procedures to mitigate settlement risk (such as delivery versus payment), loss mutualization, and centralized crisis management procedures.\n  Delivery versus payment, or DVP, is a means of assuring that related transactions, such as the delivery of securities and the corresponding payment, are coordinated, and that neither party is exposed to settlement risk. Counterparty substitution is not necessary to the implementation of such procedures, which are common in payment and securities settlement systems. For example, the Federal Reserve's own system for transferring U.S. government securities operates on a DVP basis. Yet at no time does the Fed become a substituted counterparty to the transaction. Similarly, the CLS Bank operates on a \"payment versus payment,\" or PVP, basis, again without counterparty substitution. Regardless of whether you call these processes DVP or PVP, the result is the same: settlement risk mitigation without the use of a CCP.\n  Loss mutualization has the effect of spreading losses across some or all nondefaulting traders. This frequently was a feature of clearinghouses for exchanges that were owned by their members. Today, however, participants in a market who wish to spread the risk of loss resulting from default can purchase insurance or equivalent risk-shifting protection. As long as they agree to purchase insurance or otherwise spread the risk of loss, there is no need for counterparty substitution. Nor is there any need for counterparty substitution for a centralized institution, such as a clearinghouse, to be given authority to respond to market crises. Bank clearinghouses, for example, have historically exercised such power on behalf of their members.\n  So it's clear that the core economic functions performed by CCPs can be provided by a variety of alternative institutions. So how should public policy respond to this multiplicity of possible clearing arrangements? Even though other institutions can perform these functions, it may be the case that CCPs dominate other clearing arrangements from a social welfare perspective. If so, then there would be an argument for public policy to explicitly encourage or even mandate CCPs for all markets. It might also make sense to consolidate CCPs from different markets into a common institution. But if CCPs or consolidation do not dominate on a cost-benefit basis, then public policy should accommodate a wide range of clearing arrangements.\n  Like all the institutional arrangements I've discussed, centralized clearing arrangements have both costs and benefits. On the benefit side, it's been widely noted that CCPs can reduce significantly the risks to market participants and enhance the liquidity of the market.6 This is because CCPs benefit from economies of scale and scope, compared to more decentralized arrangements. But on the cost side, a CCP also concentrates risks and responsibility for risk management,7 making it a potential single point of failure. Concentration carries with it systemic implications, since the failure of a CCP would be, by definition, a major systemic event.8 This potential risk would only be exacerbated by a policy that mandated the consolidation of all CCPs into a single institution. A more decentralized clearing arrangement would disperse responsibilities for risk management across multiple institutions. This would serve to reduce the possibility that a single institution's failure might have a catastrophic impact.\n  But this discussion omits perhaps the most important advantage from allowing a broader array of clearing and settlement arrangements: the benefits of competition. Indeed, it is the competition for better ideas, superior risk-management procedures, and new products that best leads to market innovation in these areas. The welfare implications of such innovations can be very large. If CCPs were to be mandated as the only acceptable clearing and settlement arrangement, I fear that a good deal of financial market innovation would be stifled, with corresponding losses in economic welfare.\n  Take, for example, the market for credit derivatives.9 I think most people would agree that there are real economic benefits generated by these instruments. At present, credit derivatives are not centrally cleared. This market may not have developed as rapidly as it has if it had been required to utilize a central counterparty arrangement. Alternatively, the imposition of centralized clearing might have caused the market to develop in a different form, perhaps in \"offshore\" jurisdictions, outside the reach of regulations mandating the adoption of a CCP. This is not merely a speculative concern. When interest rate swaps were evolving in the 1980s, U.S. law required \"futures\" to be traded on exchanges and, by implication, centrally cleared. As a result of this requirement, the interest rate swaps market largely moved offshore. The U.S. swaps market only recovered when the so-called \"swaps exemption\" freed this market to develop its own trading and clearing arrangements. More generally, the imposition of constraints or restrictions on markets can have a significant effect on firm behavior, again with corresponding welfare implications.\n  Of course, customized financial instruments such as credit derivatives often become more standardized over time, lending themselves more easily to centralized clearing and settlement facilities. We may have reached that point with respect to credit derivatives, and I am aware of some efforts in this direction. It seems to me that the best policy prescription is to allow the market to adopt whatever clearing arrangement meets its own idiosyncratic needs while still satisfying public policy objectives.\n  New clearing arrangements are emerging all the time. Such arrangements may provide a wide range of risk management and operational functions, either with or without counterparty substitution.10 I expect that such arrangements will continue to evolve as financial innovation, supported by advances in computing and communications technology, continues unabated. I view these developments favorably, as they have the potential to create even greater efficiency in the clearing and settlement of financial transactions. I remain a bit wary, however, that efforts to make CCPs the preferred clearing and settlement mechanism or force different markets to share the same CCP may suppress a good deal of this beneficial development.\n  As a longtime Chicagoan, I certainly would not want to imply any general criticism of CCPs. Properly structured, they do an excellent job of executing critical risk management imperatives. I do see value, however, in policy environments that allow multiple clearing and settlement arrangements to emerge. And in that context, regulation should be flexible, nonprescriptive, and risk-based to avoid thwarting market innovation. Indeed, that is precisely what the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago recommended to the CPSS and IOSCO in the formulation of prudential standards for centralized clearing arrangements.\n  Once again, thank you for joining us at this conference and we look forward to your continued involvement in these important policy issues.\n\n1 Robert E.

            "content": "Thank you for this wonderful honor. I am proud to accept this award on behalf of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. Many people at the Chicago Fed are doing important work in this area, and I'm pleased to recognize their contribution.\n\nReceiving a lifetime achievement award allows me the opportunity to step back and assess both what we've learned about the growth and development of minority- and women-owned businesses and the challenges ahead. We're at an interesting crossroads in how we address this issue.\n\nAs I mentioned at last year's event, the Fed has an ongoing interest in the vitality of small businesses, both as a regulator of financial institutions and as part of our mandate to maintain maximum sustainable growth and price stability.\n\nFor more than a decade, minorities have been starting businesses at a much faster rate than nonminorities. Recent studies show that the number of minority-owned businesses grew by almost 35 percent from 1997 to 2002, as opposed to only 10 percent for U.S. businesses overall—though this still leaves minorities underrepresented among those who own businesses.\n\nThere are 21.5 million small companies that employ 5 or fewer people—called microenterprises—that account for 28 million jobs. Sixty percent of these microenterprises are owned by women and 53 percent are owned by minorities. We know that almost 50 percent of them continue in business for at least 5 years. However, the number of minority-owned firms with sales of $1 million dollars or more has remained stubbornly unchanged at approximately 85,000 for more than a decade. In fact, minorities consistently trail nonminorities in many business performance outcomes, including sales, profits, employment, and firm survival rates.\n\nAlthough there is still much to be learned about the interplay of race and ethnicity on the one hand and business success on the other, three factors—assets, experience, and education—emerge as particularly important in explaining this gap. First, low levels of personal assets have historically inhibited minorities' ability to start businesses and constrained the growth of minority-owned firms. Second, a lack of experience in family-owned businesses is correlated with minority-owned business failures, perhaps reflecting a lack of access to professional, financial, and social networks, where business opportunities are identified and developed. And finally, education and prior employment in related fields are also associated with business success.\n\nUnderstanding and closing the gap in minority business outcomes could go a long way to support the long-term economic health of our local communities, so I'd like to talk a little bit about how the theory and practice of business development initiatives have evolved. In 1994, the year that I became president of the Chicago Fed, business assistance policy and practice focused almost exclusively on access to credit for start-ups and very-early-stage businesses, just as it had in the 1960s and 1970s. Discussions about financial assistance for small businesses focused on the need for small loans for start-up companies and the need to be vigilant against race and gender biases or discrimination in the small business credit market. Technical assistance provided to businesses focused on educating individuals about how to write a business plan, the difference between balance sheets and profit and loss statements, and other business basics.\n\nOver the 11-1/2 years that I have been with the Fed, we've learned some important lessons. Our research has shown that entrepreneurs from diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds gain access to small business financing in different ways. Entrepreneurs, across all categories, find creative—and sometimes expensive—ways to finance their businesses, including credit cards, trade credit, personal savings, and money from family and friends. But in comparing access to start-up and early-stage credit and capital for black- and Hispanic-owned businesses, those companies started by blacks use only about one-half as much start-up capital as comparable Hispanic businesses, which are more likely to use supplier-provided trade credit.\n\nIn 1999, the Chicago Fed convened the Small Enterprise Capital Access Partnership (SECAP) to examine the issues of small business development and access to credit and capital in historically underserved areas of Chicago. SECAP participants, while recognizing the credit and other needs of start-ups, also emphasized the demand for \"patient capital\" to grow businesses and a more sophisticated and comprehensive small business counseling infrastructure. Staff from the Chicago Fed and SECAP partners developed a publication, called TAP Basics, that is designed to improve the consistency and quality of technical assistance provided to small businesses. The SECAP partners also noted that financial institutions should continue to strive to expand their small business lending to underserved areas.\n\nRecent studies also note the critical role of community banks in lending to this market segment, and by all accounts, commercial lending will remain one of the most important sources of financing for young firms. And private equity investments, such as venture capital, angel investments, and targeted equity pools, are forms of early-stage investment that can nurture the most promising minority entrepreneurs. But to expand the supply of \"patient capital\" that young minority-owned firms need will require additional sources of funds that recognize the financial opportunities from funding minority-owned emerging companies. Such specialized sources include other types of private equity investment, which I understand you'll be discussing later today.\n\nWhile we have learned a lot about how to lend to and assist small businesses in general, and minority- and women-owned businesses specifically, there is still much that we do not know. For instance, we don't know what is inhibiting those minority-owned businesses from growing to be larger firms.\n\nSome businesses, I'm sure, are started and not expanded beyond a certain size because the owners want to have manageable firms that avoid the complications of larger enterprises. They have found a profitable niche to fill and are comfortable at that level. Some minority-owned businesses—we don't know how many—may be successful enough to grow through the addition of venture capital partners. But if those venture capital partners are not minorities, then the companies would no longer be classified as minority-owned businesses or included in the data. So we clearly need to learn more about the impediments to growth for minority-owned companies.\n\nSome approaches to these issues that I think are worth watching closely over the next decade are greater corporate involvement, new financing methods, and financial and technical assistance at every stage of growth.\n\nFirst, let me discuss how greater corporate involvement in these initiatives is making a difference. Last summer, the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago and Boston partnered with the Business Roundtable to host a national conference on corporate engagement in minority supplier development. Participants articulated several obstacles to more widespread adoption of best practices in minority supplier development by American corporations. But a highlight from the conference was a keynote address from Bill Davis, retired CEO of R.R. Donnelly. Bill made the case for his peers to become fully engaged in these issues, both because there are competitive advantages for the corporations involved and because our communities need it.\n\nI also recently heard a presentation by a division of Milwaukee-based Johnson Controls, one of the 145 Fortune 500 companies headquartered in the five states that comprise the Chicago Federal Reserve District. Johnson Controls is a member of the \"Billion Dollar Roundtable\"—a group of 14 U.S. corporations that annually purchase at least $1 billion in goods and services from minority suppliers. Its Automotive Division is a national leader in minority supplier development through its history of responding to the requirements of the automakers for minority content in their contracts.\n\nThe Controls Division identified its future growth opportunities as being in the 50 largest metropolitan areas of the country. Recognizing the impact of demographic changes in those metro areas, it adopted a new strategy of engaging directly in the creation and development of minority-owned contractors and suppliers through mentoring relationships, partnerships, and, where appropriate, direct investment. This \"Metro Strategy\" also responds to the needs of the communities where it operates by getting directly involved in issues of community revitalization, education, and workforce development.\n\nThe second approach is the use of new financing methods. Community Development Financial Institutions are an example. CDFIs are private financial entities whose primary mission is to provide loans to or investment in underserved communities. The specific and unique nature of their mission puts CDFIs in a position to address the issue of access to credit in the areas they serve.\n\nThere are 70 CDFIs certified in the Chicago Federal Reserve District, including 38 in Illinois. Many of these CDFIs offer small business loan products, such as subordinated loans and credit to purchase franchise operations, and other support services. A few even offer equity capital. One CDFI that is headquartered here in Chicago has invested $2.5 billion directly in underserved communities throughout the country, including more than $30 million in equity funds to support small businesses.\n\nCDFIs are also a principal conduit of the federal New Markets Tax Credit program, which supports small business development in low-income communities. In the last three years, over $2 billion in equity has been invested in low-income communities through these credits. The federal CDFI fund currently has $3.5 billion in tax credits to award, though they have received $28 billion in new requests for funding. The annual award decisions are expected this spring.\n\nA final approach that I'd like to discuss is the use of financial and technical assistance at every stage of business growth. There are many organizations providing financial and technical assistance, but I would like to highlight a new model of such assistance created by a small group of local leaders in Milwaukee. This model is designed to develop a network of technical assistance providers that can counsel growing companies at any stage of development. It was recently designated as an Urban Entrepreneur Partnership by the White House National Economic Council. The Urban Entrepreneur Partnership is a national initiative of the White House, the National Urban League, the Kauffman Foundation, and the Business Roundtable to promote minority business ownership.\n\nOne unique aspect of the Milwaukee partnership specifically targets corporations in a strategy that actively seeks opportunities to spin off corporate divestitures to qualified, well-financed minority entrepreneurs. The corporate divestitures are not subsidized. They are existing business opportunities that are provided to entrepreneurs at fair market value. But the commitment of corporate CEOs from the divesting firms to the strategy and the financial and technical assistance of the Urban Entrepreneur Partnership reduce the risk of failure for these entrepreneurs. Importantly, the Urban Entrepreneur Partnership includes specific requirements to measure the impact of minority business development over time. This kind of quantitative and qualitative assessment has been lacking in traditional business assistance programs.\n\nIn a another effort closer to home, the Chicago Fed is assisting Chicago United's efforts to promote the use of minority-owned professional services firms by large corporations and other institutions and the analysis of that program. That analysis will be conducted at the Center for Urban Economic Development at the University of Illinois-Chicago.\n\nThese are just a few examples of important new efforts to catalyze minority business development efforts. These efforts move away from highly subsidized, government-directed strategies toward locally led, public-private initiatives that leverage resources from multiple sources and emphasize both creativity and accountability to address the issue.\n\nIn closing, there is much that we have left to learn about successful minority business development initiatives, but I am encouraged by the many innovative approaches that have evolved and the specific efforts to accurately assess their outcomes. Based on these new initiatives, it is my hope that, ten years from now, we will be able to talk about the answers more than the questions and point specifically to the successes of the people in this room.\n\nThank you again for this honor.\n\n*The views presented here are my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "The latest economic headlines have generally been quite positive. Job growth has been solid in recent months. The unemployment rate has fallen to 4.7 percent, and manufacturing capacity utilization has risen a bit above its long-run average, so the bulk of our productive resources that were underutilized following the 2001 recession are now back at work. At the same time, core inflation remains contained.\n\nOf course, there is one notable exception to the good news: low real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2005. Today, I will talk about what we at the Chicago Fed think these and other developments mean for the outlook for economic growth, inflation, and monetary policy in the U.S. I will also discuss a long-run issue facing policy makers: Should the Fed adopt explicit numerical inflation guidelines to help govern the conduct of monetary policy?\n\nOutlook for economic growth\nLet's start by reviewing recent developments. Typically, real GDP growth fluctuates a good deal from quarter to quarter. But the numbers we had seen since the last quarter of 2003 were all between 3.3 and 4.3 percent—what could be described as \"shockingly boring.\" Well, things got interesting last quarter: Real GDP growth was a surprisingly weak 1.6 percent. Much of this decline, however, reflects fluctuations in government spending, imports, and motor vehicle output that look to be temporary. Indeed, the most recent indicators are pretty positive: orders for nondefense capital equipment excluding aircraft surged in December and remained high in January; consumer spending has posted solid gains since October; and the data from the labor market have been strong. So I think that growth in output is rebounding from the low fourth-quarter number.\n\nAnd looking beyond the near term fluctuations, I'd say that the outlook is good: Sound underlying economic fundamentals appear to be supporting self-sustaining economic growth. Importantly, the fourth quarter aside, the underlying trends in productivity—the ability of the economy to turn the hours that we work into the output that we produce—are quite solid.\n\nLast month, the Federal Reserve Governors and Reserve Bank Presidents released their projections for the economy in our semiannual monetary policy report to Congress. The central tendency of these forecasts had real GDP increasing about 3-1/2 percent in 2006 and in the 3 to 3-1/2 percent range in 2007—close to many recent estimates for potential. The unemployment rate was expected to be in the 4-3/4 to 5 percent range in both years. With regard to inflation, the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy was expected to increase about 2 percent this year and between 1-3/4 and 2 percent in 2007. Overall, this is a very favorable outlook, but of course, there are some risks.\n\nOne relates to home prices. Housing has been an area of strength throughout this business cycle, and we've seen strong increases in home prices. These higher valuations have increased homeowners' wealth, helping to facilitate more robust spending growth.\n\nBut many analysts warn that housing is overvalued. One way we can judge this is by looking at the price-to-rental ratio for housing; this is similar to using the price-dividend ratio to evaluate stocks. Nationally, the price-to-rental ratio has been rising sharply since the mid-1990s and currently is at its highest level ever. However, the price-to-rental ratio has risen only modestly in Chicago and most Midwestern cities; the largest increases have occurred in cities such as Miami, Phoenix, San Francisco, and Las Vegas. These differences highlight the local nature of housing markets. Indeed, even if there were large price declines in some cities, there probably would be little spillover to a more general drop in prices nationwide.\n\nFurthermore, it's far from certain what will happen to home prices. Some of the increase in the price-to-rental ratio likely reflects real changes that have made housing more valuable relative to other investments. Financial innovations have improved the liquidity of housing investments, and the tax code has tilted even more favorably towards housing.\n\nThat said, we are seeing some softening in housing markets and more reports that home prices are increasing at a slower rate.\n\nIf housing does prove to be overvalued and home prices fall, residential construction would be adversely affected. Indeed, most forecasts for GDP that you currently see factor in some moderation in home price appreciation and residential investment. But history suggests that the impact on overall consumer spending would be more modest. Moreover, the changes in wealth and any related spending adjustments likely would be gradual. Depending on the configuration of other economic factors, such gradual changes would allow time for any appropriate recalibration of policy—if in fact one is needed.\n\nAnother risk to the outlook relates to energy prices. Crude oil prices have more than doubled since 2002. At the consumer level, not only are gasoline prices much higher than they were two or three years ago, but natural gas and home heating oil prices have also risen significantly. Given the large amount we spend on imported energy, oil and gas price increases represent a sizable transfer of income from U.S. consumers to foreign producers and can negatively affect economic growth.\n\nSo why haven't we seen a slowdown in U.S. economic growth over the past couple of years? First, solid productivity growth and accommodative monetary policy have offset some of the negative effect of rising oil prices. Second, the U.S. economy is less dependent on oil today. Twenty-five years ago, it took more than 15,000 BTUs of energy to produce one real dollar of GDP; in 2004, it took about 9,200 BTUs. And third, the increase in crude prices, after adjusting for inflation, is smaller than during the 1970s, and the level remains well below the peak reached in 1980 of $86 per barrel in 2005 dollars. Of course, if prices move back up again noticeably, we could see some more troublesome effects on growth.\n\nOutlook for inflation\nIn addition to being a risk to growth, rising energy prices are a risk to the outlook for inflation. When economists think about inflation, we like to look at so-called \"core\" measures, which strip out volatile food and energy prices. The readings on the core price index for personal consumer expenditures, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, have stayed relatively low in recent months. Nonetheless, for most of the past year core PCE inflation has been running close to 2 percent, which is about the upper end of the range that I feel is consistent with price stability.\n  Even though core inflation does not include energy prices directly, businesses may pass through higher energy costs to the prices of their products, thus raising core inflation. Higher oil prices find their way into many products, some that you might not think of. To give one example, I've heard from a furniture manufacturer that increases in petrochemical prices have raised the cost of polyfoam used in sofas and chairs. He said, \"This is the first time in 30 years that the stuffing costs more than the fabric.\"\n  However, suppose energy costs stabilize. Once businesses adjust their own prices to cover the higher costs, prices should not have to rise further, and inflation should return to its earlier rate. Thus, the energy price increases we have seen to date should just result in a one-time increase in prices and a temporary rise in the core inflation rate, not a sustained higher rate of core inflation. Indeed, this pattern can be seen in the slightly lower range for the FOMC's core PCE forecast in 2007 compared to 2006.\n  There are other concerns, however. First, with the unemployment rate currently at 4.7 percent and capacity utilization near its long-run average, it is important to ask how much slack remains in the economy. Many estimates place the natural rate of unemployment around 5 percent. While there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding these estimates, an unemployment rate of 4.7 percent likely indicates a vibrant labor market in which more firms may begin to bid up wages to attract and retain workers.\n  Long periods of high resource utilization are often associated with rising costs and prices. For example, as recently as 2000, the unemployment rate fell to 4 percent and \"Help Wanted\" signs were everywhere. Businesses offered attractive wages to many workers, and these costs were passed along in the form of higher core consumer price inflation. We are not at that point yet. Increases in compensation have been relatively moderate, and strong trends in productivity have held back the rise in overall unit labor costs. Furthermore, manufacturers often tell me they have a great deal of flexibility to produce without generating cost pressures.\n  Still, given that the economy is operating close to potential, we need to be careful to monitor for the emergence of any economy-wide strains on resource utilization. Such strains would have the potential to increase inflationary pressures.\n  A second concern is if—for whatever reason—we indeed start to see a string of higher inflation numbers, then people may begin to expect permanently higher inflation. Such expectations could become self-fulfilling if businesses and households factor them into their spending and investing decisions. We could then have a sustained, higher rate of inflation. And this would have adverse effects on longer term economic performance. Fortunately, current financial market data and consumer surveys suggest that long-run inflation expectations remain contained. But, like resource utilization, these expectations warrant careful monitoring.\n\nPolicy discussion\nIn any event, it will take appropriate monetary policy to keep inflation and inflation expectations contained. As many of us on the FOMC have discussed, future policy action will depend on economic conditions and the outlook.\n  When the funds rate was very low, it was clear that the FOMC would need to remove the excess monetary policy accommodation at some point. The rate was far below any reasonable estimate of neutrality.\n  Conceptually, it's easiest to think about the neutral—or equilibrium—rate as being the rate consistent with an economy growing steadily along its potential growth path over a long period of time. One can make rough estimates of the neutral real rate by using historical averages of the real federal funds rates from comparable periods. To get a neutral nominal rate, you then add in a forecast of inflation. One can produce a range of estimates for the neutral nominal rate depending on the historical periods you choose and your inflation forecast. By such measures, we're currently in this neutral range.\n  Of course, we have to recognize that many factors can cause differences between the longer-run concept and what may be neutral policy over the short or medium term. For example, all else equal, stronger trends in productivity would raise the equilibrium real rate; in contrast, the increased willingness of foreigners to invest their savings in the U.S. would lower the rate.\n  But there is another very important point to emphasize. Even with the funds rate in the range of neutral, further changes in policy may be appropriate. The central tendency of the forecasts by FOMC members is that inflation will likely remain contained, and this is my view as well. Importantly, solid underlying trends in productivity should keep overall production costs in check. But, as I mentioned earlier, there are risks to the inflation outlook—namely, the potential for energy cost pass-through, pressures from increases in resource utilization, and rising inflationary expectations. And with inflation near the upper end of my comfort zone, an unexpected increase in inflation would be a serious concern, while a decline in inflation would be beneficial.\n  My views about policy will depend importantly on how various factors play out and affect the outlook for inflation and growth. In other words, monetary policy is conditional. As we've said many times, the FOMC will react to changes in economic prospects. Future policy is not predetermined, nor will it be a mechanical reaction to the next number on inflation or employment. Indeed, the next policy decision is much less certain now than it was when rates clearly were well below neutral. This increases the importance of economic conditionality in the policy decision.\n  As I've mentioned, a key factor we monitor closely is inflation expectations. If these expectations were to rise persistently, then policy clearly would have to be tightened further. Of course, other events could transpire that result in prospects for inflation expectations that would be consistent with a less-firm policy stance.\nIn the long term, inflation expectations are a function first and foremost of Fed credibility. Does the public believe that we will act to fulfill our commitment to achieving price stability? If this belief is widely held, then long-run inflationary expectations will be well anchored.\n\nQuestions regarding explicit numerical guidelines\nMany commentators have argued that credibility can be enhanced if the central bank formally commits to pursue an explicit numerical guideline for inflation. Some say it's the best way to anchor inflationary expectations and to reduce policy uncertainty and risk premia to their appropriate levels.\n  In my remaining time I'd like to discuss this important question in some detail. Ben Bernanke, the new Chairman of the Federal Reserve, has long been a proponent of more explicit inflation guidelines. The FOMC clearly will be discussing this further, since there currently is no consensus within the Committee on the issue.\nI am going to talk about some of the questions that I feel need studying before making a final determination.\n  The first issue is deciding what the number should be. Former Chairman Greenspan offered a nonexplicit definition of price stability: when businesses and households are not taking inflation into account in their economic decisions. How do we put a number on that? Recent history tells us this can be problematic. For example, in 1994, core CPI inflation was 2.8 percent. According to the minutes and transcripts, inflation was generally heading higher than most FOMC participants wanted. But that view was not universal. Many commentators thought an inflation rate of 3 percent was satisfactory and argued that the Fed shouldn't try to bring inflation down further.1 Today I doubt many people would find 3 percent to be an acceptable point estimate for an inflation guideline, but there was a debate back then.\n  Even before we can give a number, we need to decide on a measure of inflation. And there are many of them to choose from: the consumer price index, the personal consumption expenditures index, and the GDP price index, to name only a few.2\n  When inflation rates are high, it typically doesn't matter which index is selected for the guideline, because all measures of inflation will be high and above the guideline. But when inflation is in the range of price stability, the choice of the index could matter. Seemingly small differences in measurement methods in principle mean that different indexes could send mixed signals to policy makers about the appropriate direction policy should take.\n  Also, as I mentioned earlier, the Fed thinks that the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy is the best measure of underlying trends in consumer inflation. But does that mean it's the best index for a guideline? For example, the total CPI is used in many private contracts as well as the inflation adjustments in many tax and transfer programs. So should we be concerned about the CPI as well?\n  Another set of issues centers on the best way to specify the numerical guideline. Should it be a single hard number or should it be a range of inflation outcomes? The problem is to come up with something practical, yet still informative.\n  The advantage of a single number is that it's precise, so there is no question of how far you are from the guideline. Of course, actual inflation will inevitably fluctuate, and it's extremely unlikely that at any point in time inflation will be precisely at the guideline. So some proponents of inflation targeting prefer to specify a range of acceptable inflation outcomes. It's more feasible to achieve inflation rates within a range. Of course, this depends on how wide the range is. An incredibly wide one would be uninformative, so it's a nonstarter.\n  Under both systems, however, there are difficulties in communicating policy. In the first instance, it's communicating what kinds of small deviations from the single number we would be willing to ignore. In the second case, it's communicating what kinds of deviations within the range we would have to react to. We don't want to leave the public with the impression that there necessarily is a \"zone of indifference\" about inflation whenever it's in the guideline range. In either case, the difficult communications task would be to explain the role of economic conditions in determining why sometimes you act and other times you don't. I am sure that we will continue to be dealing with this in the coming months, even though we don't have an explicit guideline right now.\n  Furthermore, the policy prescription needs to include a time period for evaluating the inflation outcome against the inflation guideline. Empirical evidence indicates that monetary policy does not affect the trajectory of inflation before 1 year or, more likely, 2 years. So it's impractical to specify too short of a time period to reach the guideline. But if you pick a very long time period, say 10 to 20 years, it's doubtful that businesses and households would find it very useful for their financial planning. Many central banks that have guidelines refer to the time frame with the qualitative phrase: \"over the medium term.\" But it is difficult to say precisely what this means—is it three years, or five, or ten? And is it even a constant time period?\nThere also is the issue of how our growth mandate interacts with a numerical guideline for inflation. As you may know, the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate: to foster not just price stability, but also maximum employment, which I associate with maximum sustainable growth. Now these are not independent: price stability is a prerequisite for achieving long-run sustainable growth. Structural features of the economy dictate the sustainable growth rate of GDP and the associated natural rate of unemployment. Some of these features include demographics and trends in productivity. The effects of these factors on sustainable growth and employment are difficult to measure accurately, can change over time, and, importantly, are not under the control of monetary policy. In the long run, inflation is a monetary phenomenon, but monetary policy cannot alter the natural rate of unemployment, and any influence that it has on the rate of sustainable growth is at most second order.\n  Still, monetary policy does influence the real economy in the short run, and the dual mandate puts equal weight on price stability and maximum employment. So how should policy act when there are short-run conflicts between the two goals? For example, suppose output is well below potential but inflation is high. Do we ease policy to stimulate growth or tighten policy to reduce inflation? And how long can we defer achieving one guideline at the expense of the other?\n  Finally, suppose a central bank successfully adopted a formal inflation guideline that respects the dual mandate, say by flexibly adjusting the time horizons for achieving the different guidelines. Would this policy look any different from current Fed policy?\n  Some academics who study inflation targeting central banks say no.3 They say that, effectively, the Federal Reserve does engage in a flexible version of inflation targeting. This is a bit puzzling since there are no announced explicit guidelines. Still, financial markets and the public do not seem to be bothered by the lack of an explicit number for future inflationary expectations, and at the present time, inflationary expectations are well anchored. So our actual policy has successfully obtained one of the most important benefits ascribed to a regime based on formal guidelines.\n  Then what is it that distinguishes current policy from simple discretionary ones that have the potential to produce large inflations, like those in the 1970s? I think it's the fact that central bankers now know that, even without rigid rules or numerical guidelines, their actual approach to policy must be aimed at keeping inflation expectations anchored at a low level. As I noted, they see this as a prerequisite to achieving maximum sustainable growth over the long run. Central bankers also know that anchoring inflationary expectations sometimes requires preemptive policy tightening before the actual inflation numbers start to rise—moves that may prove unpopular with the public, but are necessary to keep inflation in check.\n\nConclusion\nI've raised a lot of questions today concerning inflation guidelines. But a final point that I want to make is that this debate is going to be a healthy process. No matter what answers we come up with, we are going to learn more about the best ways to conduct monetary policy in our complicated and ever-changing economy. And as Chairman Bernanke has said, these discussions will take place with full consideration given to formulating such guidelines in the context of maintaining policy flexibility and respecting the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. He also said that he will propose further action only if a consensus can be developed among the members of the FOMC. Such consensus building is a hallmark—and, I think, a strength—of the Federal Reserve.\n  So, while I've heard people express concern about the changing of the guard at the Fed, I'm not concerned. I have very high regard for Ben Bernanke. And he is taking over a very strong institution. In the eleven years that I've been in the Federal Reserve System, the two things that strike me the most are the quality of the people and the collegial nature of the institution. This leads to sound economic analysis, healthy policy discussions, and well-thought-out decisions. I see no reason why that won't be the case in the future.\n\n1 A sophisticated expression of this view was offered by George A. Akerlof, William T. Dickens, and George L. Perry, \"The Macroeconomics of Low Inflation,\" Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, no. 1 (1996). It is based on the hypothesis that even though real wages determine purchasing power, workers have an extra aversion to seeing real wages lowered through a reduction in nominal wages. This results in nominal wages being sticky on the downside. These authors calibrate a model in which an inflation rate of 3 percent allows most realignments of real wages to occur without reducing nominal wages.\n  2 Most central banks that have targets use a consumer or retail index, and this has some grounding in economic theory since it is ultimately the well-being of consumers that matters for utility theory. For example, good business decisions among intermediate goods producers ultimately benefit consumers through their effect on final products and returns to investors who are also consumers.\n  3 See, for example, Marvin Goodfriend, \"Inflation Targeting in the United States,\" NBER Working Paper no. 9981, September 2003.\n\n*The views presented here are my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "For many, the issue of public pensions is a rather arcane subject best understood by actuaries and public finance experts. It is my hunch that few in the general public are aware of the structure of public pensions or the magnitude of the growing funding gap. This is in many ways unfortunate. Public pension obligations are growing rapidly and beginning to reduce the ability of governments at all levels to fund other public programs. Consider just some of the following statistics:\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, major public pension programs paid out $78.5 billion in the 12 months that ended in September 2000. By the same period in 2004, pension payouts had grown by 50 percent to $118 billion.\nState and local governments currently employ 14 million people, with an additional 6 million retirees. It is estimated that these workers and retirees are owed $2.37 trillion by more than 2000 different state and municipal government entities.\nIn 2003, states and municipalities contributed $46.3 billion to pension plans, which was a 19 percent increase over 2002 levels. Pension funding has increased from 2.15 percent of all state and local spending in 2002 to 2.44 percent in 2003.\nPublished government estimates suggest that the largest state and local pension funds faced a funding gap of $278 billion in 2003. An analysis by Barclays Global Investors places the gap at closer to $700 billion.\nAnd if this weren't enough, fiscal liabilities will balloon when a new Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) regulation is put into effect that will require state and local governments to recognize liabilities related to nonpension retiree expenses such as health care.\n\nHow did we get into such a mess and what can we do about it? To begin with, public pensions are not subject to the same ERISA rules that govern private pensions. This has made it easier to increase pension benefits to public sector retirees without identifying adequate funding. In addition, private pensions have been radically restructured. Only 24 percent of private firms continue to offer defined benefit programs where retirees are guaranteed a monthly income for the rest of their lives. In contrast, nearly 90 percent of public pensions are still defined benefit plans, and many of them include annual cost of living increases that increase liabilities even further.\n\nPrivate firms have moved to defined contribution and 401(k) plans where retirement payouts are based on the employee and company contributions to the plan. This change in private firm behavior was perhaps best exemplified by IBM's announcement in January that it was ending its traditional pension program, which was the third largest among private employers. While the company will suspend contributions to its traditional program, it will offer employees an enhanced 401(k). A key issue to be investigated is whether defined benefit plans are the best mechanisms for providing state and local employee pensions. Do these plans better match the overall compensation structure for state and local government workers, or would a move toward defined contribution plans be appropriate?\n\nTiming has also contributed to the problem. The stock market run-up at the end of the 1990s bolstered the balance sheets of almost all pension programs. In response, government contributions were often reduced or suspended. Swelling pension funds also encouraged governments to enhance employee benefits. With the onset of the 2001 recession, pension assets took a hit. In addition, many plans built in unrealistic investment return assumptions.\n\nPension issues are even more acute in many Midwestern states. In states with high population growth and personal income growth, future increases in tax revenues may help these states catch up on their pension imbalances. In addition, states with favorable demographics and younger state and local government employees will be slower to feel the bite of pension payouts. For most of the Midwest, however, population growth and demographics are not favorable. As a result, state and local pensions in the Midwest are much like the legacy costs that domestic automakers face. They are a financial burden that may hurt the competitiveness of these states and cities in the future.\n\nHow do we solve this problem? First, we need to have a better sense of the size of the pension obligation. More uniform accounting standards are likely needed to evaluate the true health of public sector pensions.\n\nSecond, it is likely that pension plans will need to be structurally changed, which includes identifying new funding sources and restructuring pension payouts. This will be no easy matter given that many state and local government pensions have strong legal protections that make restructuring current plans difficult if not impossible. For states with relatively weak balance sheets and large pension obligations, such as Illinois and Michigan in our district, restructuring could be particularly painful if it requires higher taxes or reductions in other government services to cover shortfalls.\n\nFinally, solving the pension problem is more than an accounting exercise. Pensions must be recognized as part of any employee's total compensation program. Pensions in the private sector have been structured to meet firm and organization goals of retaining key staff members and building a productive workforce. The human resource management dimension is important to consider when redesigning pension programs to be actuarially sound and meet the needs of today's employees. For private firms, the move to defined contribution and 401(k) programs recognizes the increased mobility of today's workforce. Pension portability better meets the needs of many of today's private workers. Pension programs need to reflect the needs of organizations in meeting their human capital requirements. No \"one-size-fits-all\" plan will be appropriate.\n\nI look forward to today's discussion on this important topic. As a follow-up, we will publish a Chicago Fed Letter summarizing the findings and presentations from this forum. Thank you.\n\n*The views presented here are my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "The recent economic headlines have been quite positive. Job growth has been solid in recent months. The unemployment rate has fallen to 4.7 percent and capacity utilization has risen to near its long-run average, so the bulk of our productive resources that were underutilized following the 2001 recession are now back at work. At the same time, core inflation is not overheating. Of course, there is one notable exception to the good news: low real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2005. Today, I will talk about what we at the Chicago Fed think these and other developments mean for the outlook for economic growth, inflation, and monetary policy in the U.S. I will also discuss a long-run issue facing policy makers: Should the Fed adopt explicit numerical inflation guidelines to help govern the conduct of monetary policy?\n\nOutlook for economic growth\nSo let's start with the prospects for economic activity over the next several quarters. Typically, real GDP growth rates fluctuate a good deal from quarter to quarter. But the numbers we had seen since the last quarter of 2003 were all between 3.3 and 4.3 percent—what could be described as \"shockingly boring.\" Well, things got interesting last quarter: Real GDP growth was a surprisingly weak 1.1 percent. Much of this decline, however, reflects fluctuations in government spending, imports, and motor vehicle output that look to be temporary. Indeed, the most recent indicators are pretty positive: Orders for capital equipment and consumer spending posted solid increases in December, and data for January show a further recovery in auto sales and a strong labor market. So I think that growth in output is rebounding from the low fourth-quarter number.\n\nAnd looking beyond the near term fluctuations, I'd say that the outlook is good: Sound underlying economic fundamentals appear to be supporting self-sustaining economic growth. Importantly, the fourth quarter aside, the underlying trends in productivity—the ability of the economy to turn the hours that we work into the output that we produce—are quite solid.\n\nWith regard to consumers, employment has increased, rising home prices and rising equity prices have boosted wealth, and households have had little difficulty servicing debt. Looking ahead, higher home heating bills, the potential for slower home price appreciation, and some possible increase in the personal saving rate from its current low level could moderate consumer spending some. On balance, though, its growth likely will remain solid. For businesses, expanding sales, flush cash positions, low capital costs, and the need to replace and upgrade aging equipment and software imply that capital spending will continue to increase. All of these factors add up to a solid base for demand. This demand supports continued growth in employment, income, and profits, which in turn supports further increases in demand.\n\nAccording to the Blue Chip consensus, real GDP growth is expected to average about 3-1/4 percent over the next two years—close to recent estimates for potential. And the Blue Chip projection looked for the unemployment rate to average a bit below 5 percent through the end of next year.\n\nWith the unemployment rate currently at 4.7 percent, it is important to ask how much slack remains in the economy. Many estimates place the natural rate of unemployment around 5 percent. While there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding these estimates, an unemployment rate of 4.7 percent likely indicates a vibrant labor market in which more firms may begin to bid up wages to attract and retain workers. Long periods of high resource utilization are often associated with rising costs and prices. For example, as recently as 2000, the unemployment rate fell to 4 percent and \"Help Wanted\" signs were everywhere. Businesses offered attractive wages to many workers, and these costs were passed along in the form of higher core consumer price inflation.\n\nThe unemployment rate suggests that there is relatively little slack in the labor market. But capacity utilization rates in manufacturing are still a bit below their historical averages, and manufacturers often tell me they have a great deal of flexibility to produce without generating cost pressures. This suggests that some slack remains in the manufacturing sector. Balancing these and other factors, we think the economy is operating close to potential. In any event, we need to carefully monitor for the emergence of any economy-wide resource pressures.\n\nGiven the fundamentals, I think the Blue Chip forecast is reasonable. But there certainly are some risks. And as you are all aware, it's important to understand the nature of those risks and deal with them appropriately before they turn into actual problems.\n\nOne relates to home prices. Housing has been an area of strength throughout this business cycle, and we've seen strong increases in home prices. These higher valuations have increased homeowners' wealth, helping to facilitate more robust spending growth.\n\nBut many analysts warn that housing is overvalued. One way we can judge this is by looking at the price-to-rental ratio for housing; this is similar to using the price-dividend ratio to evaluate stocks. Nationally, the price-to-rental ratio has been rising sharply since the mid-1990s and currently is at its highest level ever. However, the price-to-rental ratio has risen only modestly in Chicago and most Midwestern cities; the largest increases have occurred in cities such as Miami, Phoenix, San Francisco, and Las Vegas. These differences highlight the local nature of housing markets. Indeed, even if there were large price declines in some cities, there probably would be little spillover to a more general drop in prices nationwide.\n\nFurthermore, it's far from certain what will happen to home prices. Some of the increase in the price-to-rental ratio presumably reflects real changes that have made housing more valuable relative to other investments. Financial innovations have improved the liquidity of housing investments, and the tax code has tilted even more favorably towards housing.\n\nThat said, we are seeing some softening in housing markets and more reports that home prices are increasing at a slower rate. If housing does prove to be overvalued and home prices fall, residential construction would be adversely affected. Current forecasts, including the Blue Chip consensus that I mentioned earlier, already factor in some moderation in residential investment. But history suggests that the impact on overall consumer spending would be more modest. Moreover, the changes in wealth and any related spending adjustments likely would be gradual. Depending on the configuration of other economic factors, such gradual changes would allow time for any appropriate recalibration of policy—if in fact, one is needed.\n\nAnother risk to the outlook relates to energy prices. Crude oil prices have more than doubled since 2002. At the consumer level, not only are gasoline prices much higher than they were two or three years ago, but natural gas and home heating oil prices have also risen significantly. Given the large amount we spend on imported energy, oil and gas price increases represent a sizable transfer of income from U.S. consumers to foreign producers. The price increases act like higher taxes, negatively affecting economic growth.\n\nSo why haven't we seen a slowdown in U.S. economic growth over the past couple of years? First, solid productivity growth and accommodative monetary policy have offset some of the negative effect of rising oil prices. Second, the increase in crude prices, after adjusting for inflation, is smaller than during the 1970s, and the level remains well below the peak reached in 1980 of $86 per barrel in 2005 dollars. And third, the U.S. economy is less dependent on oil today. Twenty-five years ago, it took more than 15,000 BTUs of energy to produce one real dollar of GDP; in 2004, it took about 9,200 BTUs. Of course, if prices move back up again noticeably, we could see some more troublesome effects on growth.\n\nOutlook for inflation\nIn addition to being a risk to growth, rising energy prices are a risk to the outlook for inflation. When economists think about inflation, we like to look at so-called \"core\" measures, which strip out volatile food and energy prices. The readings on the core price index for personal consumer expenditures, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, have stayed relatively low in recent months. Nonetheless, for most of the past year core PCE inflation has been running close to 2 percent, which is about the upper end of the range that I feel is consistent with price stability.\n\nEven though core inflation does not include energy prices directly, businesses may pass through higher energy costs to the prices of their products, thus raising core inflation. Higher oil prices find their way into many products, some that you might not think of. To give one example, I've heard from a furniture manufacturer who says that increases in petrochemical prices have raised the cost of polyfoam used in sofas and chairs. He said, \"This is the first time in 30 years that the stuffing costs more than the fabric.\"\n\nStill, unless energy costs continue to rise, such pass-through would just result in a one-time increase in prices and a temporary spike in the core inflation rate, not a sustained higher rate of core inflation. Once businesses adjust their prices to cover the higher costs, prices should not have to rise further, and inflation should return to its earlier rate. Furthermore, although oil prices are still high, futures markets are not expecting much change in prices going forward.\n\nThere are other concerns, however. First, given the limited resource slack currently in the economy, possible increases in resource utilization have the potential to increase inflationary pressures. Second, if—for whatever reason—we indeed start to see a string of higher inflation numbers, then people may begin to expect permanently higher inflation. Such expectations could become self-fulfilling if businesses and households factor them into their spending and investing decisions. We could then have a sustained, higher rate of inflation. And this would have adverse effects on longer term economic performance. Fortunately, current financial market data and consumer surveys suggest that long-run inflation expectations remain contained.\n\nPolicy discussion\nNonetheless, it will take appropriate monetary policy to keep inflation and inflation expectations contained. For me, the course for future policy action will depend on economic conditions.\n  When the funds rate was very low, it was clear that the FOMC would need to remove the excess monetary policy accommodation at some point. The rate was far below any reasonable estimate of neutrality.\n  Conceptually, it's easiest to think about the neutral—or equilibrium—rate as being the rate consistent with an economy growing steadily along its potential growth path over a long period of time. One can make rough estimates of the neutral real rate by using historical averages of the real federal funds rates from comparable periods. To get a neutral nominal rate, you then add in a forecast of inflation. One can produce a range of estimates for the neutral nominal rate depending on the historical periods you choose and your inflation forecast. By such measures, we're currently in this range.\n  Of course, this is a rough estimation. And we have to recognize that many factors can cause differences between the longer-run concept and what may be neutral policy over the short or medium term. For example, all else equal, stronger trends in productivity would raise the equilibrium real rate; in contrast, increased willingness of foreigners to invest their savings in the U.S. would lower the rate.\n  But there is another very important point to emphasize. Even with the funds rate in the range of neutral, further changes in policy may be appropriate. My view is that inflation will likely remain contained. Futures markets are not looking for energy prices to move appreciably higher. And, importantly, solid underlying trends in productivity should keep overall production costs in check. But, as I mentioned earlier, there are risks to the inflation outlook—namely, the potential for energy cost pass-through, pressures from increases in resource utilization, or rising inflationary expectations. And with inflation near the upper end of my comfort zone, an unexpected increase in inflation would be a serious concern, while a decline in inflation would be beneficial. My views about policy will depend importantly on how various cost factors play out and affect the outlook for inflation. And if inflation or inflation expectations were to rise persistently, then policy clearly would have to be tightened further. Of course, other events could transpire that result in prospects for inflation and growth that would be consistent with a less-firm policy stance.\n  What I've just described is the conditionality of monetary policy. As we've said many times, the FOMC will react to changes in economic prospects. Future policy is not predetermined, nor will it be a mechanical reaction to the next number on inflation or employment. Indeed, the next policy decision is much less certain now than it was when rates clearly were well below neutral. This increases the importance of economic conditionality in the policy decision.\n\nQuestions regarding explicit numerical guidelines\nLet me now shift to a longer-term issue regarding the best way to conduct monetary policy—whether the Fed should commit to an explicit numerical guideline for inflation. Proponents of this approach say it's the best way for a central bank to anchor inflationary expectations and reduce policy and inflation risk premia to their appropriate levels. Ben Bernanke, the new Chairman of the Federal Reserve, is a proponent of more explicit inflation guidelines, and the FOMC clearly will be discussing this issue further, since there currently is no consensus within the FOMC.\n  I think it's plausible that in some form, an explicit numerical guideline may be embraced some day. But I feel that there are many issues that need studying before making a final determination, and I'd like to spend the remainder of my time talking about some of them. And I should emphasize here than I'm only asking questions, and not advancing any particular proposal.\n  The first issue is deciding what the number should be. Former Chairman Greenspan offered a nonexplicit definition of price stability: when businesses and households are not taking inflation into account in their economic decisions. How do we put a number on that? Recent history tells us this can be problematic. For example, in 1994, core CPI inflation was 2.8 percent. According to the minutes and transcripts, inflation was generally heading higher than most FOMC participants wanted. But that view was not universal. Many commentators thought an inflation rate of 3 percent was satisfactory and argued that the Fed shouldn't try to bring inflation down further.1 Today I doubt many people would find 3 percent to be an acceptable point estimate for an inflation guideline, but there was a debate back then.\n  A related question involves a seemingly simple issue: Which index should be selected for the inflation guideline? There are many measures of inflation: the consumer price index, the personal consumption expenditures index, and the GDP price index, to name only a few.2\n  When inflation rates are high, it typically doesn't matter which index is selected for the guideline, because all measures of inflation will be high and above the guideline. But when inflation is in the range of price stability, the choice of the index could matter. Seemingly small differences in measurement methods in principle mean that different indexes could send mixed signals to policy makers about the appropriate direction policy should take.\n  Also, as I mentioned earlier, the Fed thinks that the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy is the best measure of underlying trends in consumer inflation. But does that mean it's the best index for a guideline? For example, the total CPI is used in many private contracts as well as the inflation adjustments in many tax and transfer programs. So should we be concerned about the CPI as well?\n  Another set of issues centers on the best way to specify the numerical guideline. Should it be a single hard number or should it be a range of inflation outcomes? The problem is to come up with something practical, yet still informative.\n  The advantage of a single number is that it's precise, so there is no question how far you are from the guideline. The difficulty is that it's extremely unlikely that inflation at any point in time will be precisely at the guideline. To get around this problem, you could specify a range of acceptable inflation outcomes. It's more feasible to achieve inflation rates within a range. Of course, this depends on how wide the range is. An incredibly wide one would be uninformative, so it's a nonstarter.\n  Under both systems, however, there are difficulties in communicating policy. In the first instance, it's communicating what kinds of small deviations from the single number we would be willing to ignore. In the second case, it's communicating what kinds of deviations within the range we would have to react to. We don't want to leave the public with the impression that there necessarily is a \"zone of indifference\" about inflation whenever it's in the guideline range. In either case, the difficult communications task would be to explain the role of economic conditions in determining why sometimes you act and other times you don't. I am sure that we will continue to be dealing with this in the coming months, even though we don't have an explicit guideline right now.\n  Furthermore, the policy prescription needs to include a time period for evaluating the inflation outcome against the inflation guideline. Empirical evidence indicates that monetary policy does not affect the trajectory of inflation before 1 year or, more likely, 2 years. So it's impractical to specify too short of a time period to reach the guideline. But if you pick a very long time period, say 10 to 20 years, it's doubtful that businesses and households would find it very useful for their financial planning. Many central banks that have guidelines refer to the time frame with the qualitative phrase: \"over the medium term.\" But it is difficult to say precisely what this means—is it three years, or five, or ten? And is it even a constant time period?\nThere also is the issue of how our growth mandate interacts with a numerical guideline for inflation. As you may know, the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate: to foster not just price stability, but also maximum employment, which I associate with maximum sustainable growth. Now these are not independent: price stability is a prerequisite for achieving long-run sustainable growth. Structural features of the economy dictate the sustainable growth rate of GDP and the associated natural rate of unemployment. Some of these features include demographics and trends in productivity. The effects of these factors on sustainable growth and employment are difficult to measure accurately, can change over time, and, importantly, are not under the control of monetary policy. In the long run, inflation is a monetary phenomenon, but monetary policy cannot alter the natural rate of unemployment, and any influence that it has on the rate of sustainable growth is at most second order.\n  Still, monetary policy does influence the real economy in the short run, and the dual mandate puts equal weight on price stability and maximum employment. So how should policy act when there are short-run conflicts between the two goals? For example, suppose output is well below potential but inflation is high. Do we ease policy to stimulate growth or tighten policy to reduce inflation? And how long can we defer achieving one guideline at the expense of the other? In addition, it may be decided that, as a legal matter, the Fed would need Congressional approval to undertake numerical inflation guidelines. In light of the dual mandate, this eventually could lead to adding a numerical unemployment guideline that would prove to be incompatible with the ways monetary policy can and can not influence the economy.\n  Finally, suppose a central bank successfully adopted a formal inflation guideline that respects the dual mandate, say by flexibly adjusting the time horizons for achieving the different guidelines. Would this policy look any different from current Fed policy?\n  Some academics who study inflation targeting central banks say no.3 They say that, effectively, the Federal Reserve does engage in a flexible version of inflation targeting. This is a bit puzzling since there are no announced explicit guidelines. Still, financial markets and the public do not seem to be bothered by the lack of an explicit number for future inflationary expectations, and at the present time, inflationary expectations are well anchored. So our actual policy has successfully obtained one of the most important benefits ascribed to a regime based on formal guidelines.\n  Then what is it that distinguishes current policy from simple discretionary ones that have the potential to produce large inflations, like those in the 1970s? I think it's the fact that central bankers now know that, even without rigid rules or numerical guidelines, their actual approach to policy must be aimed at keeping inflation expectations anchored at a low level. As I noted, they see this as a prerequisite to achieving maximum sustainable growth over the long run. Central bankers also know that anchoring inflationary expectations sometimes requires preemptive policy tightening before the actual inflation numbers start to rise—moves that may prove unpopular with the public, but are necessary to keep inflation in check.\n\nConclusion\nI've raised a lot of questions today concerning inflation guidelines. But a final point that I want to make is that this debate is going to be a healthy process. No matter what answers we come up with, we are going to learn more about the best ways to conduct monetary policy in our complicated and ever-changing economy. And as Chairman Bernanke has said, these discussions will take place with full consideration given to formulating such guidelines in the context of maintaining policy flexibility and respecting the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. He also said that he will propose further action only if a consensus can be developed among the members of the FOMC.\n  I've heard a lot of people express concern about the changing of the guard at the Fed. I'm not concerned. I have high regard for Ben Bernanke. And he is taking over a very strong institution. In the eleven years that I've been in the Federal Reserve System, the two things that strike me the most are the quality of the people and the collegial nature of the institution. This leads to sound economic analysis and healthy policy discussions. We may not always get it exactly right, but we always make well-thought-out decisions. I see no reason why that won't be the case in the future.\n\n1 A sophisticated expression of this view was offered by George A. Akerlof, William T. Dickens, and George L. Perry, \"The Macroeconomics of Low Inflation,\" Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, no. 1 (1996). It is based on the hypothesis that even though real wages determine purchasing power, workers have an extra aversion to seeing real wages lowered through a reduction in nominal wages. This results in nominal wages being sticky on the downside. These authors calibrate a model in which an inflation rate of 3 percent allows most realignments of real wages to occur without reducing nominal wages.\n  2 Most central banks that have targets use a consumer or retail index, and this has some grounding in economic theory since it is ultimately the well-being of consumers that matters for utility theory. For example, good business decisions among intermediate goods producers ultimately benefit consumers through their effect on final products and returns to investors who are also consumers.\n  3 See, for example, Marvin Goodfriend, \"Inflation Targeting in the United States,\" NBER Working Paper no. 9981, September 2003.\n\n*The views presented here are my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "Over the last two years, real gross domestic product has been growing an average of 3.7 percent each year. This is somewhat faster than potential, or the rate of GDP growth that can be sustained without creating inflation pressures. At first, the rapid pace was a natural response to the prior period of weakness. The economy needed to grow faster than potential in order to eliminate the slack labor and capital resources that had built up during the recession in 2001 and the early stage of the recovery, which was sluggish. With inflationary pressures muted, the Federal Open Market Committee adopted a highly accommodative monetary policy stance in order to support that growth.\n\nBut now, the slack has been mostly eliminated. The unemployment rate has fallen to 4.9 percent; at the Chicago Fed, we think that this rate is roughly consistent with an economy operating at potential. In addition, the capacity utilization rate in manufacturing has nearly reached its historical average. This indicates that there may be some slack remaining in manufacturing, but probably not much. Finally, core inflation has changed only modestly in recent months. Currently we're not seeing the kinds of disinflationary forces that would be associated with a substantial degree of resource slack—like we did a couple years ago.\n\nWith economic growth having strengthened, the FOMC began to remove its policy accommodation in June 2004, raising the target for the federal funds rate 3-1/4 percentage points since then. As we move through 2006 and consider the appropriate stance for monetary policy, the FOMC will have to answer some critical questions: Will economic growth settle in at a rate near its potential? Will there be persistent pressures on core inflation? And how should policy respond to changes in economic prospects?\n\nI'll address each of those questions in my speech today, as well as two of the long-term issues—national savings and education—that will determine our economic fortunes in the coming years.\n\nOutlook for economic growth\nSo, let's start with the prospects for economic activity over the next several quarters. I'd say that outlook is good: Sound underlying economic fundamentals appear to be supporting self-sustaining economic growth. On the consumer side, employment has increased, rising home prices and rising equity prices have boosted wealth, and households have had little difficulty servicing debt. Looking ahead, higher home heating bills and the potential for some slower home price appreciation could moderate consumer spending some. On balance, though, its growth likely will remain solid. For businesses, expanding sales, flush cash positions, low capital costs, and the need to replace and upgrade aging equipment and software imply that capital spending will continue to increase. All of these factors add up to a solid base for demand. This demand supports continued growth in employment, income, and profits, which in turn supports further increases in demand.\n\nAccording to the Blue Chip consensus, real GDP growth is expected to average about 3-1/4 percent over the next two years—close to recent estimates for potential. And Blue Chip projects the unemployment rate will stay a bit below 5 percent through the end of next year.\n\nThe unemployment rate deserves a bit of elaboration. Some analysts question whether that rate accurately reflects the \"true\" degree of labor market slack. Their concern is that an unusual number of those who want to work may have become so discouraged about their prospects of finding a job that they have given up looking for work. These discouraged workers are not counted among the unemployed because, in our employment statistics, a person must be actively looking for work to be classified as unemployed.\n\nIndeed, the labor force participation rate, which is the fraction of the population either working or actively looking for work, is well below where it was prior to the 2001 recession. In contrast, 4 years after the 1990-91 recession, the labor force participation rate had returned to its prerecession level.\n\nSo the question is, do we think the participation rate will return to its prerecession level? At the Chicago Fed, we've spent a good deal of time analyzing the long-term demographic trends, and our best judgment is that we will not see a big rebound in participation. This suggests that the current low levels of labor force participation are not indicative of a slack labor market.\n\nFirst, roughly half of the decline in labor force participation since 2000 has been caused by a sharp decline in the percentage of teenagers in the labor force. Given their short work hours and low wages, a decline in participation by teenagers has a smaller effect on the aggregate labor market than a decline in participation by prime-age workers. Moreover, much of the recent drop in teen participation may only be an acceleration of what has been a 25-year trend. That trend is for higher school enrollment and lower labor force participation by young people, a development that likely reflects the increased premium on education in the economy. Therefore, we don't expect to see teenagers flood back into the labor force.\n\nTrends in adult labor force participation are also important. While we have seen large secular increases in women's labor force participation for several decades, this was mostly due to differences in behavior between women born before and after 1960. More recent cohorts of women have not been much more likely to work outside the home than their mothers. So the increase in women's labor force participation appears to have largely run its course. Men's labor force participation, in contrast, has been declining since the 1950s, and we do not see any reason to expect a strong reversal.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, the aging of the baby boomers is putting downward pressure on labor force participation, because it increases the share of the population that is retired.\n\nPutting all these pieces together, I do not expect a large increase in labor force participation. Accordingly, the current unemployment rate is probably close to the level associated with a healthy economy and little labor market slack.\n\nGiven the fundamentals, I think the Blue Chip forecast is reasonable. But there certainly are some risks. One relates to home prices. Housing has been an area of strength throughout this business cycle, and we've seen strong increases in home prices. These higher valuations have increased homeowners' wealth, helping to facilitate more robust spending growth.\n\nNow, many analysts warn that housing is overvalued. One way we can judge this is by looking at the price-to-rental ratio for housing; this is similar to using the price-dividend ratio to evaluate stocks. Nationally, the price-to-rental ratio has been rising sharply since the mid-1990s and currently is at its highest level ever. However, the price-to-rental ratio has risen only modestly in Chicago and most Midwestern cities; the largest increases have occurred in cities such as Miami, San Francisco, and Las Vegas. These differences highlight the local nature of housing markets. Indeed, even if there were large price declines in some cities, there probably would be little spillover to a more general drop in prices nationwide.\n\nFurthermore, it's far from certain what will happen to home prices. Some of the increase in the price-to-rental ratio presumably reflects real changes that have made housing more valuable relative to other investments. Financial innovations have improved the liquidity of housing investments, and the tax code has tilted even more favorably towards housing.\n\nThat said, I am starting to hear more about softening in housing markets, and seeing more reports that home prices are increasing at a slower rate. If housing does prove to be overvalued and home prices fall, residential construction would be adversely affected. But history suggests that the impact on overall consumer spending would be more modest. Moreover, the changes in wealth and any related spending adjustments likely would be gradual. Depending on the configuration of other economic factors, such gradual changes would allow time for any appropriate recalibration of policy—if in fact, one is needed.\n\nAnother risk to the outlook relates to energy prices. Crude oil prices have more than doubled since 2002. At the consumer level, not only are gasoline prices much higher than they were two or three years ago, but natural gas and home heating oil prices have also risen significantly. According to the Department of Energy, the average U.S. household spent $786 to heat its home last winter; this winter, the DOE estimates that if temperatures are normal, homeowners will spend an additional $200.\n\nGiven the large amount we spend on imported energy, oil and gas price increases represent an even larger transfer of income from U.S. consumers to foreign producers. The price increases act like higher taxes, negatively affecting economic growth. So why haven't we seen a slowdown in U.S. economic growth over the past couple of years? First, solid productivity growth and accommodative monetary policy have offset some of the negative effect of rising oil prices. Second, the increase in crude prices, after adjusting for inflation, is smaller than during the 1970s, and the level remains well below the peak reached in 1980 of $86 per barrel in 2005 dollars. And third, the U.S. economy is less dependent on oil today. Twenty-five years ago, it took more than 15,000 BTUs of energy to produce one real dollar of GDP; in 2003, it took just under 9,500 BTUs. Of course, if prices move back up again noticeably, we could see some more troublesome effects on growth.\n\nOutlook for inflation\nIn addition to being a risk to growth, rising energy prices are a risk to the outlook for inflation. When economists think about inflation, we like to look at so-called \"core\" measures, which strip out volatile food and energy prices. The latest readings on the core price index for personal consumer expenditures, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, have been favorable, and as of November, the year-over-year increase in the index was 1.8 percent. Still, for most of this past year, core PCE inflation has been running close to 2 percent, which is at the upper end of the range that I feel is consistent with price stability.\n\nEven though core inflation does not include energy prices directly, businesses may pass through higher energy costs to the prices of their products, thus raising core inflation. Higher oil prices find their way into many products, some that you might not think of. To give one example, I've heard from a furniture manufacturer who says that increases in petrochemical prices have raised the cost of polyfoam used in sofas and chairs. He said, \"This is the first time in 30 years that the stuffing costs more than the fabric.\"\n\nStill, unless energy costs continue to rise, such pass-through would just result in a one-time increase in prices and a temporary spike in the core inflation rate, not a sustained higher rate of core inflation. Once businesses adjust their prices to cover the higher costs, prices should not have to rise further, and inflation should return to its earlier rate. Furthermore, although oil prices are still high, they are down from their hurricane-related spike, and futures markets are not expecting a rebound.\n\nThere are other concerns, however. First, given the limited resource slack currently in the economy, possible increases in resource utilization have the potential to increase inflationary pressures. Second, if—for whatever reason—we indeed start to see a string of higher inflation numbers, then people may begin to expect permanently higher inflation. Such expectations could become self-fulfilling if businesses and households factor them into their spending and investing decisions. We could then have a sustained, higher rate of inflation. And this would have adverse effects on longer term economic performance. Fortunately, current financial market data and consumer surveys suggest that long-run inflation expectations remain contained.\n\nPolicy discussion\nNonetheless, it will take appropriate monetary policy to keep inflation and inflation expectations contained. For me, this likely entails some further policy action. Whatever actions are taken, however, will depend on economic conditions.\n\nWhen the funds rate was very low, it was clear that the FOMC would need to remove the excess monetary policy accommodation at some point. The rate was far below any reasonable estimate of neutrality.\n\nConceptually, it's easiest to think about the neutral—or equilibrium—rate as being the rate consistent with an economy growing steadily along its potential growth path over a long period of time. One can make rough estimates of the neutral real rate by using historical averages of the real federal funds rates from comparable periods. To get a neutral nominal rate, you then add in a forecast of inflation. One can produce a range of estimates for the neutral nominal rate depending on the historical periods you choose and your inflation forecast. By such measures, we're currently in the bottom end of this range.\n\nOf course, this is a rough estimation. And we have to recognize that many factors can cause differences between the longer-run concept of neutral policy and what may be neutral policy over the short or medium term. For example, all else equal, stronger trends in productivity would raise the equilibrium real rate; in contrast, increased willingness of foreigners to invest their savings in the U.S. would lower the rate.\n\nBut there is another very important point to emphasize. Even if the funds rate were at neutral, further changes in policy might be appropriate. My view is that inflation will likely remain contained. Energy prices have come off their highs, and solid underlying trends in productivity should keep overall production costs in check. But, as I mentioned earlier, there are risks to the inflation outlook—namely, the potential for energy cost pass through, pressures from increases in resource utilization, or rising inflationary expectations. And with inflation near the upper end of my comfort zone, an unexpected increase in inflation would be a serious concern, while a decline in inflation would be beneficial. My views about policy will depend importantly on how various cost factors play out and affect the outlook for inflation. In addition, if inflation or inflation expectations were to rise persistently, then policy clearly would have to be tightened further. Of course, other events could transpire that result in prospects for inflation and growth that would be consistent with a less firm policy stance.\n\nWhat I've just described is the conditionality of monetary policy. As we've said many times, the FOMC will react to changes in economic prospects. Future policy will not be a mechanical reaction to the next number on inflation or employment. Indeed, given the reduction in the degree of monetary accommodation over the past 18 months, the policy firming that is likely to be appropriate over the near term is less certain now than it was earlier in the interest rate cycle. This increases the importance of economic conditionality in the policy decision.\n\nLong-term outlook risks\nThe risks I've talked about so far primarily relate to the near-term economic outlook. But in the long term, we face a different set of challenges. In order to support productivity growth and maintain a solid trend in economic growth, we need to continue to invest in physical and human capital at sufficiently high rates.\n\nIn the case of physical investment in plant and equipment, the long-term challenge will be financing. Spending on physical capital must be financed by our national savings—which includes saving by households, businesses, and the government—and capital inflows from abroad. Saving by households is quite low, a fact that gets a lot of attention in the media. And the current federal budget deficit means that government saving is negative. Even when the higher rate of corporate saving is included, overall national saving has fallen in recent years.\n\nFortunately, the rest of the world has viewed the United States as a good place to invest. They have supplied us with enough capital to allow our investment to exceed our own national saving. But this reflects the fact that our current account deficit—mainly, the difference between our imports and exports—has been rising and is now more than 6 percent of GDP.\n\nUnfortunately, such deficits are not sustainable indefinitely. Eventually, our current account deficit must fall and capital inflows will slow. This means that if we are to maintain our current rates of capital investment, national saving will have to rise to make up for this adjustment. This will be happening at the same time that the aging of our population will put increasing pressure on our Social Security and Medicare spending. If, as expected, health care costs continue to outpace inflation, Medicare and Medicaid outlays will account for a rapidly expanding share of the national budget. Without changes in spending or taxes or both, this increased demand for social insurance will further increase government deficits and decrease net national saving.\n\nFinally, another factor that will affect our future economic growth is our ability to improve the quality of our workforce. This requires us to do a better job educating our school age population and providing further opportunities for training and retraining of those already in the workforce. Education has historically been a strength of the United States, but some current trends are worrisome.\n\nWhile measures of primary school achievement have improved over the last thirty years, secondary school achievement levels have not. Test scores (from the National Assessment of Educational Progress) in reading and math for 9- and 13-year-olds are significantly higher now than in the early 1970s, but those for 17-year-olds show no improvement. Even for the younger students, however, recent developments are not encouraging: reading scores for 9- and 13-year-olds have been stagnant or declining over the last three years.\n\nFurthermore, high school dropout rates have declined little since the early 1980s. And even with recent increases in enrollments, the graduation rate from traditional 4-year high schools1 is down nearly 5 percentage points from the late 1960s. It is only when GED holders are included that today's overall graduation rates match those of earlier years. And research shows that when it comes to labor market success, GEDs are not the equivalent of a high school degree. Thus, it seems that many teenagers are not receiving the education they need to be successful in a competitive workplace.\n\nThere also are some troubling developments regarding college education. The percentage of 25- to 29-year-olds who have completed a bachelor's degree or higher increased nearly 18 percentage points between 1960 and 2000. However, this percentage has changed little since then. And foreign students—many of whom stay in the U.S. and enhance our workforce—are having a greater difficulty getting visas to study in our graduate schools. Together, these developments raise the concern that our pool of highly educated individuals in the workforce may not be sufficient in the future. This is especially important since the impending retirement of the baby boomers over the coming years will deplete the workforce of many of its most experienced workers.\n\nGiven that the economy currently looks healthy, now is a good time to attack some of our longer-term challenges. How we generate increases in national savings and improve education are important issues for our nation. It's encouraging that we have started to discuss Social Security reform at the national level, though I am disappointed that the conversation seems to have stalled. I also am glad to see concerted efforts at education reforms, such as Renaissance 2010, a program currently underway in Chicago that aims to create 100 excellent new schools with more independent and entrepreneurial leadership. But we can't just talk about possible reforms or implement a few pilot programs—we must keep attacking these issues in a meaningful way.\n\nConclusion\nThough the answers aren't easy, I think these are solvable problems. For certain, it's going to take some tough decisions, strong leadership at the national, state, and local level, as well as active participation by all of us. But America is resourceful, and so I'm optimistic. Although there certainly will be some obstacles as we address our longer-term challenges, we can lay the foundation now to reach our future potential.\n\n1 Number of diplomas awarded divided by the population of 17-year-olds.\n\n*The views presented here are my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "Introduction\nAt the end of August I will be retiring after 13 years as President of the Chicago Fed and as a member of the Federal Open Market Committee. As much as my retirement is a time to look back on the past 13 years, it is also a time to look forward. During my tenure at the Fed, the FOMC has had to react to a number of important and difficult challenges: the Asian financial crisis, the Russian debt default, major movements in asset prices, Y2K, 9/11, and the risk of deflation.\n\nWe certainly could not have anticipated many of these challenges. Nor can we predict today many of the challenges the Federal Reserve and the FOMC will have to react to in the years ahead. These events are, as we economists like to call them, \"unforeseeable shocks.\" Nonetheless, we still can anticipate some of the issues that that Fed will likely face. Indeed, some of these are issues that we have been dealing with for many years. Some, such as fiscal deficits, the current account deficit, and the increasing complexity of financial markets, affect the underlying economic environment in which we operate. Others, such as how we communicate with the public and how we assess the economy's long-run potential, have more direct implications for the operation of monetary policy.\n\nI want to focus on two of these issues today. The first is the increased complexity of financial markets. This has a direct impact on the Fed's regulatory responsibilities, and could also affect monetary policy through its influence on interest risk premia and other factors affecting the cost of capital. The second is how we judge the economy's long-run maximum sustainable growth rate. This judgment is key to benchmarking the achievement of our dual mandate of maximum sustainable growth and price stability—it thus also has important implications for the near-term policy outlook.\n\nIncreased complexity of financial markets\nLet's begin with the increased complexity of financial markets.\n\nOne way this complexity is manifested is in the array of new and different types of financial instruments that are now available. When I arrived at the Chicago Fed in 1994, derivative contracts were still seen as rather mysterious, and even dangerous. (I remember the cover of an issue of Fortune magazine that illustrated the dangers of derivatives with a picture of a snake about to strike!) There were several episodes that were often cited as evidence of the damage that derivatives could cause. For example, in December 1993 Germany's 14th largest industrial firm, Metallgesellschaft, was brought to the brink of bankruptcy by an unsuccessful hedging strategy involving petroleum derivatives. And barely a year later, Barings Bank, one of Englandâ€™s oldest and most distinguished banking firms, failed when a rogue trader lost over $1 billion on unauthorized equity derivatives trades.\n\nOf course, derivatives can be misused. But they have proven their ability to play an important role in hedging risks. Derivatives contracts now cover economic risks well beyond the traditional risk classes of interest rates, exchange rates, equity prices, and commodity prices. Investors now use derivatives to hedge credit risk, risks in real estate markets, risks associated with macroeconomic data releases, and the weather. Until a week and a half ago, you could even have bought a contract on whether one of the big futures markets based in my hometown, the Chicago Board of Trade, would be acquired by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Intercontinental Exchange!\n\nA second way that the financial services sector has become more complex is the proliferation of nontraditional intermediation; these include the activities of hedge funds, private equity funds, venture capital firms, prime brokers, central clearing institutions, as well as innovative ways of securitizing cash flows. These new forms of intermediation give many more borrowers and investors access to new sources of financing and access to the benefits of new financial instruments and markets.\n\nTogether, the innovations in derivative instruments and financial intermediation allow risks to be sliced, diced, and sold off to those investors most willing and able to bear these risks. In theory, this better allocation of risk should result in a more resilient economy. When negative shocks happen, the adverse consequences should fall principally on the investors who are most capable of withstanding the shocks. They act, literally, as shock absorbers for the economy as a whole. Of course, in good times these investors are amply compensated for serving this role.\n\nThere's some evidence that these shock absorbers are working. For example, a number of large hedge fund have collapsed recently, most notably the $6.5 billion demise of Amaranth, which focused on the natural gas market. Yet the financial markets absorbed these failures with negligible consequences for the broader economy.\n\nThe third way we see greater complexity in financial markets is the accelerating integration of markets throughout the world. For the U.S., this can be seen, most notably, in the huge increase in net capital flows from our trading partners. This is the flip side of the increasing current account deficit that we've seen over the last several years. Last year, these capital flows amounted to more than $800 billion, about 6% of our GDP.\n\nWhat's driving this demand for U.S. assets by our trading partners? In part, it seems to be the high savings rates of China and other emerging economies, as well as the desire of some of these countries to build a cushion of hard currency in order to avoid a repeat of the 1997 Asian crisis. (Reserves in China and other emerging Asian countries now amount to some $2.5 trillion, more than double their size four years ago.) It also reflects the relative attractiveness of real risk adjusted rates of returns in the U.S. resulting from solid trends in real economic activity in the U.S., low and stable inflation expectations, and the fact that our financial markets operate in an environment with a high degree of legal certainty and informational transparency.\n\nThe vast changes in financial markets and capital flows may have had an influence on some important benchmarks, particularly those related to the pricing of risk. Even after the developments of the past few weeks, we see low default spreads, low term spreads, and low implied volatilities relative to historical norms; and many recent leveraged buy-out deals have received funding without the usual set of restrictive covenants, a practice commonly referred to as \"convenant lite.\" All of these factors suggest less concern for the possibility that future adverse shocks could cause defaults.\n\nHow should policymakers interpret this reduced concern about risk? Is it due to better economy-wide risk management and innovations that allow for better allocation of risk? Are these lower risk indicators also a reflection of a fundamentally more benign economic environment? If so, then perhaps policymakers should not be concerned about the reduced risk premia.\n\nHowever, it is also possible that the market may be underpricing risk. The long period of financial stability, may be leading investors to expect a similarly benign environment in the future, and therefore to underestimate the probability of the next major disruption. Indeed, conventional applications of risk management tools such as \"value-at-risk\" typically incorporate only the previous few years of data into their statistical models. A period of sustained stability will cause such models to reduce their estimates of probable losses going forward.\n\nI for one do not think that we have entered a new era of permanent financial moderation. Though our shock absorbers are better, financial volatility has not been abolished. If markets are underpricing risk, then market participants may be too sanguine about their leveraged positions and more vulnerable than they think to the next financial shock. Needless to say, continued vigilance on the part of policymakers and supervisors is needed.\n\nMost central bankers agree that we are not wise enough to detect when risk is underpriced, and so we shouldn't use monetary policy to \"prick the bubble.\" However, when monetary policy is well executed and fosters low and stable inflation and an environment conducive to achieving maximum sustainable growth, it reduces the odds that financial imbalances with the potential to cause systemic macroeconomic disruptions will develop and it adds to asset price transparency.\n\nWith regard to regulatory policy, whenever possible, market discipline should be utilized to achieve regulatory ends. For example, in February this year the President's Working Group on Financial Markets (which is lead by the Treasury Secretary and includes the chairs of the Fed, the SEC, and the CFTC) issued guidelines covering \"private pools of capital,\" including hedge funds, private equity and venture capital. The group strongly recommended the reliance on market discipline to encourage sound risk management practices. For the funds, this requires sufficient transparency to ensure that their stakeholders have the information they need. For counterparties and creditors, sound risk management requires effective due diligence, frequent measurement of credit exposures, stress testing, and prudent credit terms. The major challenge for financial regulators going forward is to design regulatory structures that encourage market discipline and thus utilize the inherent efficiency of decentralized markets. Having said this, our goal remains the same: To foster a stable financial system that efficiently allocates capital and thus supports maximum sustainable economic growth.\n\nMaximum sustainable growth\nThis brings me to the discussion of maximum sustainable growth, which is also referred to as potential output growth. This is the maximum rate of real growth the economy can maintain in the long run without leading to an increase in inflationary pressures. When thinking about the maximum sustainable growth rate of an economy, it's useful to divide it into two components: first, the number of available workers and second, the productivity of those workers. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to estimate the underlying trends in both of these components because they can change over time in ways that are difficult to discern. Accordingly, it is difficult to estimate potential output.\n\nLet's start with the trends in the number of available workers. The working-age population grew rapidly in the 1960s and '70s, averaging two percent per year, as the baby boomers finished school and entered the labor force. But starting in the early 1980s, working-age population growth slowed to a little more than one percent per year. And it's projected to fall a bit further over the next decade, given the size of the younger generation entering the workforce relative to the size of the retiring baby-boom group.\n\nThe labor force participation rate, which is the percentage of the working-age population in the workforce, is also changing. From the early 1960s until around 2000, the labor force participation rate increased steadily, as a rise in the fraction of women who work outside the home offset a slow decline in the fraction of men in the labor force.\n\nBut it now appears that we have entered a period of declining labor force participation. This is mainly due to long-run changes in demographic and cultural trends, some of which likely will continue to lower the participation rate over the coming years.\n\nOne of the demographic trends relates to the aging baby boomers. There's a lot of focus on them approaching the traditional retirement age of 65, but people tend to scale back their participation well before that. Indeed, more and more boomers are past the age at which people are most likely to participate in the workforce.\n\nFurthermore, the increase in female labor force participation seems to have run its course. After decades when each new generation of women were joining the workforce in greater numbers than their predecessors, the current generation of women approaching the working age is no more likely to participate in the workforce than the previous generation.\n\nGiven the population growth and labor force participation rates that prevailed during the 1990s and early 2000s, the monthly job growth that was sufficient to provide jobs for the net number of entrants into the labor force was about 150,000. So this figure was an important benchmark to evaluate whether the economy was growing at a pace sustainable in the long run. The recent changes in population growth and labor force participation imply that we need to change our benchmark for employment growth to something more like 100,000 per month.\n\nI should say, however, that while 100,000 per month appears to be the right benchmark for the next year or two, there is a lot of uncertainty about this benchmark, particularly in the longer run. Some of this uncertainty revolves around the participation of the baby boomers. People are living longer, healthier lives, which may allow baby boomers to work until they are older. Moreover, wages for all workers may change in response to these trends, convincing some to work more, and others to work less, than they would otherwise.\n\nThe growth rate of potential output also depends on labor productivity. From 1973 to 1995, productivity growth averaged 1-1/2 percent per year, but since then it has averaged 2-1/2 percent per year.\n\nThe step up in productivity growth owed a good deal to an increase in investment in computers and other information technology. But there is still a large unexplained component. My personal opinion is that much of this has to do with innovations in management practices. Some of this improvement in management quality takes the form of better human resource practices; some in better logistics; some in more flexible production processes.\n\nProductivity also depends on the quality of the workforce. The high education levels and greater experience of our aging population has contributed to higher productivity rates. But that trend has already started to slow. It is estimated that in the late 1980s and early 1990s, improvements in worker skills were adding four-tenths of a percentage point per year to the growth of output. But it has declined since and could soon be below one-tenth of a percentage point, as the highly experienced workers of the baby boom generation retire in increasing numbers.\n\nIt is important to recognize that gains in education and other workforce skills by new entrants, and skill improvements by remaining workers, could allow us to avoid much of this decline. But if we consider recent education trends, I'd say we have our work cut out for us. Even though college graduation rates are growing, high school completion rates have stalled, and there is a great deal of dissatisfaction with the results of our public elementary and secondary schools, especially given our already enormous investment in education. Clearly, more systemic changes are needed to achieve better educational outcomes and boost the growth in worker skills.\n\nThe strong pace of productivity growth that we have seen since the second half of the 1990s has greatly boosted our living standards. Over the past year or so, however, productivity growth has slowed. If this were the start of a longer-term trend, it would have important implications for potential output. We think most of the recent slowing appears to be a relatively transitory cyclical development. Firms may be finding that some of the very rapid productivity increases they experienced in the earlier years of this decade were simply unsustainable. Output may have been increased at the expense of activities such as maintenance that can be put off for only so long. In addition, given the current difficulty in recruiting qualified workers, firms may be reluctant to significantly slow their pace of hiring, even in the face of somewhat softer demand. Such labor hoarding is often a feature of mature expansions.\n\nPutting together our best estimates of the trends of labor force growth and productivity growth, we at the Chicago Fed think potential GDP growth is lower than it was five years ago, and currently is somewhat below 3 percent.\n\nOf course, there is a good deal of uncertainty around estimates of potential output and so we need to continually monitor developments and update our estimates. This is because our assessment of potential output has implications for the proper stance of monetary policy.\n\nThe late 1990s are an interesting example of these implications. At that time, we were trying to judge if the increase in productivity growth we were observing then was permanent or not. In determining the appropriate stance for monetary policy, the FOMC was well aware of the risks of making a mistake. If we set policy based on the assumption that the productivity surge was permanent, and it turned out to be transitory, we risked providing too much liquidity and generating inflationary pressures. If we instead set policy thinking the increase was temporary, and it turned out to be permanent, we would not have provided adequate liquidity to fund productive investments and hence would have temporarily restrained non-inflationary growth. So it was important to make the best assessment possible. In the end, led by the insights of Chairman Greenspan, we correctly concluded that much of the increase was permanent, and did not pursue an overaggressive tightening of policy.\n\nRecent economic developments\nOur latest estimates of potential output provide a benchmark for the recent economic performance and outlook for growth. Against current estimates, the economy has been operating below its maximum sustainable growth rate—in the past four quarters, real GDP growth has averaged 1.9 percent. Much of the shortfall has been related to the slowdown in housing. Residential investment has subtracted an average of about 1 percentage point from GDP growth during this time; arithmetically, without that drag, the economy would be operating at about potential.\n\nClearly, the housing market remains a risk to the economy. Inventories of unsold new homes remain high. Unless sales rebound dramatically and unexpectedly, construction will be depressed for some time in order to reduce inventories to more desirable levels.\n\nThe recent developments concerning variable-rate subprime mortgages may tend to prolong the declines in housing markets. Foreclosures from failed loans could add to stocks of unsold homes, and potential buyers with spotty credit histories now face higher financing rates, which may price some out of the market. So far, however, the difficulties appear to be confined to a relatively small segment of the market.\n\nAfter considering the various developments, I expect that residential construction will begin to stabilize as we move through the coming quarters. However, it could be a while before we see any noticeable increases in home building.\n\nSo going forward, the direct drag from housing should diminish. Moreover, recent indicators suggest that other factors that had restrained activity around the turn of the year—some inventory adjustment and softness in business spending—are abating. Though there has been concern that the slowdown in housing could spill over to other sectors of the economy, on the whole the rest of the economy appears to be on solid footing. Though we have recently seen a couple of below-trend consumption numbers, going forward consumer spending should be supported by healthy gains in employment and income. Business spending should be bolstered by firms' ample cash balances and generally favorable financing terms. And demand for our exports should be driven by strong economic growth in the rest of the world.\n\nYesterday, the Federal Reserve published our biannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress. In it, the participants on the Federal Open Market Committee gave our forecasts for GDP, unemployment, and inflation. On balance the outlook is for economic activity to expand at a moderate rate in 2007 and for growth to be near-potential in 2008. The central tendency of the growth forecast is for real GDP to increase between 2-1/4 and 2-1/2 percent in 2007 and increase between 2-1/2 and 2-3/4 percent in 2008. We forecast the unemployment rate to be between 4-1/2 and 4-3/4 percent this year and about 4-3/4 percent next year.\n\nTurning to inflation, we expect inflation pressures to continue to moderate over time. The central tendency forecast expects core PCE inflation, that is inflation excluding food and energy, of 2 to 2-1/4 percent for 2007 and 1-3/4 to 2 percent for 2008. If inflation were to come in at the bottom of such ranges, I would see that as good progress toward price stability.\n\nIndeed, recently, we have had some more positive readings on core inflation. However, some of that improvement could reflect transitory influences. And as our last policy statement indicated, \"a sustained moderation in inflationary pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated.\"\n\nFirst, the economy appears to be operating in the neighborhood of its potential level of output. The unemployment rate is low, and growth in compensation per hour has moved up some over the past year. Furthermore, as I just discussed, productivity growth has slowed. The higher compensation and lower productivity numbers translate into an acceleration in unit labor costs. These costs increased nearly 3-1/2 percent in 2006, up from a 1-1/2 percent rise in 2005. Looking ahead, tight labor markets could result in larger increases in compensation. If these exceed productivity gains, then they will generate additional cost pressures. That said, profit margins are relatively high, so some further increases in labor costs could be absorbed by businesses in the form of lower margins. But the situation requires careful monitoring. In addition, as I discussed earlier, estimates of the economy's potential are always subject to substantial uncertainty. Given the recent slowing in productivity growth, there is a risk that the economy has less slack than we think.\n\nSecond, total inflation has been running high for some time, heightening the risk that inflation expectations could become stuck in a range that would not be conducive to price stability.\n\nOver the past five years, the overall PCE price index has increased at an average annual rate of 2.6 percent—that's the highest five-year average since the mid-90s. Of course total inflation has been boosted by large increases in energy prices, which have risen at a 12 percent annual rate over this period. And though total inflation was trending down late last year, it is now back on the upswing, due to renewed increases in energy prices and faster increases in food prices.\n\nIn contrast to the pick-up in total inflation, the latest readings on core inflation—which excluded food and energy prices—have been more favorable; as of May, the year-over-year increase in the core PCE index was down to 1.9 percent. Economists like to look at so-called \"core\" measures of inflation because they have proven useful in forecasting the longer-run trend in total inflation. Food and energy prices are volatile, and ultimately, monetary policy—not changes in energy prices—is responsible for the long-run trend in inflation. For example, businesses may pass through higher energy costs to the prices of their products. If energy prices stabilized, such pass-through could simply result in a one-time increase in prices and a temporary spike in core inflation. However, if firms and workers doubt the Fed's credibility in fighting inflation, then they would expect inflation to be permanently higher. As a result, they will continually increase their own wages and prices, boosting the trend in core inflation.\n\nBut while core inflation has proven to be a useful tool for gauging underlying inflation trends, it is only a tool. The ultimate responsibility of the Federal Reserve is to achieve low and stable total inflation—not core inflation. Total inflation fully reflects how all price changes erode standards of living. So people's judgment of the Fed's commitment to price stability will be reflected in their long-run expectations of total inflation. In turn, these expectations will be based on the persistent movements in all of the components of consumer prices, including food and energy.\n\nIf energy prices level off as currently anticipated by futures markets, overall inflation should slow to a pace close to that of core inflation in coming quarters. This assessment is supported by the fact that to date, long-run inflation expectations appear to be contained; surveys and financial market data suggest that households and businesses view the high total inflation rates of the past few years as temporary. But that is not something we can take for granted. If inflation fails to moderate further, then there is a danger that expectations of future inflation will settle in at levels higher than what I would view as being consistent with price stability.\n\nTaking all of these factors into account, my assessment is that the risk of inflation remaining too high is greater than the risk of growth falling too low. Of course, as the FOMC said last month, whether policy will need to be adjusted and the degree of any adjustment will depend on the data we see in the months to come and how that data influences our forecast of the economy.\n\nConclusion\nIn closing, the increasing complexity of financial markets, changes in the economy's potential output, and other long-term policy issues are sure to be with us for years to come. Undoubtedly, new issues will emerge—both long-run issues and short-term policy challenges. The US economy is a dynamic system, where new innovations can cause financial markets and the real economy to evolve in unpredictable ways. At times these changes may pose challenges to policymakers with regard to how we fulfill our regulatory responsibilities and how we benchmark the economy's performance. But only by making our best assessment on how these changes influence the policymaking environment are we able to effectively foster maximum sustainable growth and price stability.\n\n*The views presented here are my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "Welcoming Remarks\nIt is my pleasure to welcome each of you the Chicago Fed today, and I'd like to thank you for joining us today. I'd also like to thank George Ranney and Metropolis 2020 for co-sponsoring the event with us.\n\nWe're going to spend a lot time today talking about the Who, What, Where, When and How's of transportation pricing, but we shouldn't lose sight of the Why.\n\nGlobalization has brought new opportunities to many cities. Large cities are best suited to perform the advanced business services that global transactions require, such as finance, law, and logistics. However, because our large cities are so complex and diverse, and because their residents live and work so closely together, large cities face intense and competing demands on land use and public services--especially transportation.\n\nObviously, since I live, work, and commute in the Chicago-area, I'm most familiar with why transportation policy is an important issue here. In some ways, the pressures on Chicago's existing transportation capacity are extra-ordinary. To be sure as Chicago's economy shifts toward high-valued service production, the value of Chicago's existing roadways for bringing workers to and from their offices is rising in relation to their value for moving goods around and through the city. Yet, while the Chicago economy has been transforming into one that excels in the information-based services that are critical in the global economy, it still has one very large foot in its previous form--a manufacturing and freight transportation center. And so, in cities such as Chicago and Los Angeles, personal travel must compete with freight traffic in a very big way.\n\nThe rise of IT communication technologies has done little to eliminate the demands for travel to offices and business meetings. Despite having the technical ability to work at home with the Internet and personal computers, skilled workers often find it more productive to continue to commute from home to office to exchange information. As urban economist Ed Glaeser noted during a visit to Chicago earlier this year, in today's information economy, \"who we converse with on the Internet are also those who we find we must meet with face-to-face.\" Technical advances have only magnified the value of face-to-face communication, not diminished the need for it.\n\nWithin the metropolitan area, the distance, structure and direction of such workplace trips have changed mightily. Chicago's employment centers have expanded well beyond our city center, the Loop, and are now widespread. Our transportation system was designed well to move workers from the suburbs to the Loop, but it has been strained as more people find themselves commuting between suburbs: traveling from their home in Naperville to their job in Schaumburg, or leaving their office in Joliet for a meeting in Lake Forest.\n\nTraffic congestion has risen along with these changes in commuting. As we all know, our auto and bus commuting times have increased significantly in recent years--I know my commute takes 10 to 15 minutes longer than it did when I started at the Chicago Fed in the mid-1990s. By one recent study, the average Chicago commuter spends 58 hours per year stuck in rush-hour delays, up from 42 hours in 1990.\n\nThese longer commuting times are a significant cost to the city, in terms of lower productivity. For the city to work well, it requires key infrastructure such as highways and land-use planning that promote the movement of people. Both ground and intercity transportation must be accommodated and eased to facilitate travel for workplace, residential, and recreational wants and needs.\n\nBuilding roadway capacity to serve all possible traffic is not an option. To do so would be too expensive in both construction costs and in taking up limited urban land. Yet given its lagging growth opportunities, the region will want to act to maximize its ability to handle as much freight and human traffic as possible. And so, in addition to some expansion of transportation capacity, the region will need to make difficult and judicious decisions on the most critical infrastructure to repair and build. So too will the region need to decide how to finance the construction of new roads and maintenance of existing ones.\n\nTo be sure, more rational operational and pricing policies, which allocate existing transportation infrastructure, will also need to be adopted. Creative pricing policies can help to more effectively use our limited roadway capacity and allocate it toward its highest-value use. And as we will learn more about this afternoon, electronic payment of tolls helps to speed both cars and trucks through highway toll stations.\n\nAs we do look ahead to new and expanded payment technologies, we should also be expansive and strategic in our thinking. The data collected from an electronic payment system could prove useful for public land use and transportation planning across entire metropolitan areas. And because our travel and general purchases are also varied and geographically broad in scope, we may consider integrating payments systems--after all, we do not want to end up with too many plastic cards and transponders in our overcoats and wallets. In looking for further efficiency improvements in our payments systems, policy makers in the Chicago region and other cities should examine a host of models and experiments from around the world that are now pricing highway driving privileges for trucks and cars.\n\nAnd so we designed this conference to advance the understanding of how pricing strategies, public-private partnerships, and emerging payment mechanisms can be used to address congestion and efficiency in urban commuter networks--and how such policies are being applied around the world. It is a conference that draws on a range of disciplines--payments studies, public finance, urban planning, economics, and others. We're pleased with the turnout and the quality of participants the conference has attracted.\n\nAgain, thank you all for joining us this morning; I look forward to hearing your insights.\n\n*The views presented here are my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "Welcoming Remarks\nIt is my pleasure to welcome each of you the Chicago Fed today, and I'd like to thank you for joining us today for our conference on the state of the auto industry.\n\nWe are especially attentive to the issues facing the industry, because, as you look around the U.S. you won't find any other region that is more tied to the auto industry than our own. In the states of the Seventh District--Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, and Wisconsin--3 percent of workers are directly employed in the motor vehicle and equipment industry, compared to only 1-1/2 percent for the nation. In Michigan and Indiana, the industry's impact is even greater. Moreover, states in the Seventh Federal Reserve District produce more than 40 percent of U.S. motor vehicle and equipment output with only 13 percent of the country's population.\n\nSo for the region, like the auto industry, this has been a time of transition. A decade ago, the state of the Detroit-based automakers was relatively strong. The Big Three had hit a sweet spot in the market. They put themselves at the forefront in developing SUVs and other light trucks, and helped by a period of inexpensive fuel, shoppers could not get enough of them. The strong sales of light trucks helped the Big Three reverse years of market share decline, and by 1996 the Big Three market share had rebounded to just under 75 percent.\n\nHowever, the Big Three's resurgence proved fleeting. Foreign nameplates developed their own SUVs and pick-up trucks to combat the domestics' large market share. As a result, the Big Three's market share has fallen to 53 percent so far this year. Last year, Toyota passed Chrysler in sales, to become the third highest selling automaker in the US. This development led The Automotive News to rechristen the Big Three as the Detroit Three.\n\nThe market share woes of the US automakers have extended to their suppliers. The suppliers are facing shrinking demand at the same time that other developments have squeezed their business. Materials costs have risen sharply, and suppliers' profits have suffered because they have been unable to offset cost increases with productivity enhancements or pass them through as higher prices to their customers. And assembly companies have asked their primary suppliers to share responsibilities such as product design and engineering, which is a significant change in their relationship. But some assemblers and suppliers are finding it difficult to achieve the cooperative relationships now required to produce popular, high-quality vehicles on a mutually profitable basis.\n\nAs a result, bankruptcy has become a reality for some of the largest and best known auto suppliers, including Delphi, Dana, Tower, and Collins & Aikman. More than 20 of the largest 150 have filed for Chapter 11 since 1999.\n\nAnother significant change relates to vehicle production in the US. Foreign automakers' have increased their operations inside the U.S. Only 21 years ago, Honda Motor Company opened its first U.S. car assembly plant in Marysville, Ohio. Now, foreign nameplates produced in the U.S., often called transplants or the new domestics, account for one-third of U.S. vehicle manufacturing capacity.\n\nThe rise of the new domestics has gradually been changing the geography of the industry. Foreign nameplates' domestic production capacity has been slowly expanding the auto corridor into Southern states. Honda opened its first U.S. assembly plant near the heart of the traditional auto corridor. But, more recently, they opened a plant in Alabama, Nissan opened one in Mississippi, and Toyota just opened a truck plant in Texas.\n\nBy extending the corridor further south and west, the newly built assembly plants are shifting the industry's center of gravity further south. This shift could pose a challenge to the continued role of the Midwest as the hub of this industry\n\nDevelopments outside the US are also changing the industry. Though some foreign automakers are producing in the US, imports continue to flow into the market. Imported vehicles accounted for 23 percent of sales so far this year, up from 12 percent in 1996. Imports of parts have increased even more dramatically: direct imports of motor vehicle parts have more than doubled since 1995.\n\nGlobal forces are also changing vehicle demand. Developing markets such as India and China represent significant opportunities for automakers to increase sales.\n\nThe big question is, of course: Where will all this change take us? And that's why we're having this conference--to help us understand the forces behind the changes in the auto industry, which in turn should give us some idea where the industry is heading.\n\nIn organizing this conference we wanted to take a different tack from the typical auto conference. One thing you'll notice about the agenda is that none of the speakers is from the auto industry. Furthermore, we've organized the sessions around specific issues facing the industry--issues which will profoundly shape the industry in the near future.\n\nThe first session today will look at a broad question: What value is the profitability of the industry? Frits Pil from the University of Pittsburgh will present his work on the topic.\n\nThe next session will focus on supply chain issues. Loren Brandt from the University of Toronto will present his work on benchmarking the performance of auto suppliers around the world.\n\nLabor is always a prominent issue in the auto industry--and it certainly will be this year with the UAW contracts up for renegotiation. So we have two sessions on labor topics. One this morning, featuring Susan Helper from Case Western Reserve University, and one this afternoon, with Kristin Dziczek from the Center for Automotive Research.\n\nAnd, we have a distinguished luncheon speaker to give us an overview of the worldwide trends in the industry: Jerry York. As you know, Jerry has been in the middle of a number of recent developments regarding the ownership and control of the Detroit Three, and I'm sure he'll be able to give us some very interesting perspectives into the prospects for the industry in the years ahead.\n\nOf course, the true value of any conference comes not just from the speakers but also the quality of the discussion that follows. We designed this to be an interactive session, including a roundtable discussion at the end. I encourage everyone to take part and make this a lively dialogue on the state of the auto industry.\n\nAgain, thank you all for coming today and I look forward to hearing everyone's insights.\n\n*The views presented here are my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "Welcoming Remarks\nIt's my pleasure to welcome you to our Annual Conference on Bank Structure and Competition. It's the best-attended and longest-running annual conference in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThis will be my last Bank Structure Conference as President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. I take great pride in having been a small part in the robust history of the conference and I wanted my final one to be one of the best of what has been a very impressive run of policy conferences. I think you will agree that we have accomplished that goal. The program features the heads of three federal regulatory agencies, the head of the Bank of Canada, and a former Banking Committee Chairman. I'm certain that you'll find their presentations noteworthy, thought provoking, and entertaining.\n\nOur conference focus this year is \"The Mixing of Banking and Commerce.\" This issue has been in the news a bit recently, after applications from Home Depot and Wal-Mart to form Industrial Loan Corporations (ILC) led to an uproar from community bankers. This prompted the FDIC to initially announce a moratorium on ILC applications, and then extend the moratorium for non-financial firms filing ILC applications and requesting deposit insurance.\n\nOn one side of the debate, there are those who point out the potential benefits of allowing banks to be affiliated with commercial firms. They emphasize the potential efficiencies in the joint financial-commercial firm production process. They argue that the combination would allow for diversification benefits, similar to those Congress was searching for when they allowed the mixing of commercial and investment banking. And they note the potential savings for consumers in terms of \"one-stop-shopping\" and efficiency gains for banks as they obtain the information needed to intermediate and manage risk. Finally, certain commercial firms have established distribution networks, and it is argued that having financial services distributed from them could greatly expand access to financial services.\n\nOn the other side, there are those who are concerned about the potential risks of mixing banking and commerce. They argue that the combination could lead to adverse changes in market power as large firms come to dominate across industries. There are also concerns about distortions to the credit allocation process as banks may assist their commercial affiliates by providing the affiliates with loans at belowâ€“market rates and by denying loans to creditworthy competitors. Not only could the capital allocation process become distorted, but the fear is that this support of the commercial affiliate could adversely affect the financial health of the bank and lead to an expansion of the deposit insurance safety net (and its associated market distortions) outside of the banking sector.\n\nTo discuss these issues, we have gathered some of the most qualified and respected members of the financial community, each with a different perspective. The conference program delivers a broad range of perspectives from executives at large and small banks, securities firm managers, regulatory authorities, industry analysts, and research economists.\n\nAs usual, our conference will also cover more than the special conference theme. This afternoon we have a panel discussion on payday lending. Tomorrow we will have a panel discussion on the current state of Basel II capital regulation. And we will also be discussing the economics of the evolving real estate markets, and issues associated with mortgage markets. The panelists are an impressive group of experts with a wide range of opinions and unique perspectives, and these discussions promise to be both lively and informative.\n\nFinally, the conference features four special keynote addresses. During lunch today, Sheila C. Bair, Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, will address issues associated with the conference theme and the current situation surrounding the moratorium on new ILC applications for deposit insurance.\n\nAt breakfast tomorrow, James A. Leach, Former Chairman of the House Committee on Banking and Financial Services, will open the day with a keynote address.\n\nAt lunch tomorrow, Christopher Cox, Chairman of the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission, will bring a new perspective to the conference in that it is the first time we have been fortunate to have the chairman of the SEC address the conference.\n\nAnd last but not least, there is this morning's keynote speaker: Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke.\n\nWhile we know Ben as a prominent economist, the people of his hometown, Dillon, South Carolina, best remember him as the kid who won the 1965 state spelling bee and who might have been the national champion if he had seen the Sound of Music and learned how to spell edelweiss.\n\nHis career as an economist began when he moved to Massachusetts, where he earned his BA in economics from Harvard and his PhD from MIT, and where he adopted the Red Sox as his favorite baseball team.\n\nAfter graduation, he moved between the coasts with prestigious teaching appointments at MIT, Stanford, and NYU, eventually settling at Princeton and becoming chair of the Econ Department. Ben solidified the department's reputation as one of the nation's best. And although deciding which Nobel Laureate to hire can be difficult, he claims his toughest decision was deciding whether to serve bagels or doughnuts at the faculty coffee hour.\n\nBen later took a leave of absence from Princeton in 2002 to fill a seat on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and he then he served as head of the Council of Economic Advisors in 2005 before returning to the Fed as Chairman, last year.\n\nSince moving to Washington, he has reportedly become a fan of the Washington Nationals. Given their record, I hope this is less a sign of his ability to evaluate baseball teams than a sign of his intention to put down roots in Washington and stay with the Fed for a long time.\n\nThough he's been Chairman for over a year, I'm still surprised to read economists in the Wall Street Journal who refer to him as the \"new guy.\" And everyone still asks me: \"How's the new guy?\"\n\nI'm happy to say the new guy is just fine. I've enjoyed my time with him on the FOMC, admire his strong leadership of the Fed, continuing in the Volcker & Greenspan tradition, and always look forward to hearing his views on a wide range of topics.\n\nThis year is Ben's third appearance at our conference. He addressed us as chairman of Fed last year, and he joined us as an academic fifteen years ago, when he presented a timely paper called \"The Bank Credit Crunch,\" in which he argued that the credit crunch of that period did not necessarily make monetary policy impotent. Today he still has his sense of timing and will discuss subprime mortgages.\n\nIt's my pleasure to welcome back to the conference my friend and colleague, Ben Bernanke.\n\n*The views presented here are my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "Good morning. I'm Michael Moskow, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. I'm pleased to welcome you to our seventh annual payments conference: \"Competitive Forces Shaping the Payments Environment: What's Next?\" The conference will consider the new challenges and opportunities facing our payments system in an increasingly competitive environment. I think you'll find that we have assembled a refreshing and provocative program, and we welcome your active participation. We have a diverse group of participants, with senior representatives of financial institutions, merchants, venture capital firms, payment networks, solution providers, universities, central banks, nonprofit organizations, and government agencies in attendance. I'd like to thank Dick Porter and the payments team from our Research Department for the outstanding job they've done bringing all of you together.\n\nMore than anything, we want this conference to be interactive. In addition to the illustrious group of speakers we have gathered, the strength of this conference in the past has been the high level of expertise and thoughtfulness that you bring as participants. We have scheduled ample time for discussion in order to take advantage of the free exchange of ideas.\n\nOver the past several years, the payments landscape in the United States has undergone significant changes. Consumers, merchants, and financial institutions face a constantly shifting array of payment options. Moreover, the delivery of those payment mechanisms is increasingly driven by a broader variety of firms than in the past. Nonfinancial firms--including merchants, vendors, alternative service providers and others--are increasing their participation in the provision of payments, often competing directly with banks. We'll hear from a group of industry experts tomorrow who will debate the pros and cons of retail firms offering payment products to customers and discuss the factors that contribute to the success or failure of such retail banking partnerships. We will also have a keynote speech about the future role of banks in payments, which is an issue that the Fed follows closely.\n\nWe believe that the increase in the number of players in the payments industry--the rise in competition--has led to new innovations in the provision of payment services. To gain widespread acceptance, successful payment innovations have to present multilateral advantages to a host of parties: payment processors and banks, households and businesses, and in-store merchants. These benefits can include decreased cost, enhanced convenience, expanded access, and improved security.\n\nWhen a payments network grows sufficiently, scale economies lower operating costs and the technology suddenly becomes profitable in new venues. Payment habits typically evolve slowly, especially when individual payment instruments perform well and remain highly convenient. But, ultimately, changing cost structures cause the products that payment networks offer and the products consumers choose to use to shift.\n\nDuring the past dozen years or so, we have witnessed several important milestones in the movement from paper to electronic payments. Check usage within the United States finally began to decline in the mid-1990s. While debit cards were introduced initially in the 1970s to dispense cash from ATM machines, it wasn't until the last decade that debit card use at the checkout register soared. Merchants have become more willing to accept plastic in lieu of cash or checks partly because of the lower costs of placing PIN pads at the checkout counter. These developments have engendered a cultural shift in the U.S. which has transformed many previously cash-only locations. By 2003, electronic payment transactions in the United States exceeded check payments, and after a faltering start, online banking has finally taken hold among American households.\n\nDuring this conference we'll discuss how some previously cash-dominant businesses, such as taxicabs, coffee shops, doctor's offices, fast food restaurants, grocery stores, mass transit systems, and utility companies, have turned to plastic payments. A distinguished group of panelists will highlight the characteristics of cash that are difficult to mimic in other payment forms and discuss the main factors that are driving their industries to offer alternatives to cash. This discussion will help us identify the relative costs and benefits of cash in the face of the availability of electronic payment options.\n\nPayment processors and banks are becoming more and more concerned with how businesses and individuals choose to make payments. What factors lead an employer to continue to disburse paper pay checks or a family to embrace mobile banking? To that end, we have a panel today that focuses on the process that merchants and consumers go through when making payment choices in an extremely diverse and complex environment. The panel will discuss the different ways that payment providers influence consumer and merchant decisions. We will also hear about how consumer demand for payment features and functionality has evolved over time.\n\nIt's clear that individual consumers are increasingly driving payment trends by making concerted efforts to control their payment transactions. These consumers, who are often quite tech-savvy, have a variety of payment options. Households increasingly choose to purchase goods and services online, using existing card and ACH networks. And new payment processors have entered the marketplace to service the ballooning online auction business and consumers who are interested in making person-to-person payments from any place, at any time.\n\nMore recently, the U.S. has begun to catch up with its international peers by offering payment options via mobile phones and contactless cards. Consumers like the ease and convenience of making payments anytime, anywhereâ€”and they also appreciate the ability to access and manage the complex array of information that accompanies payment transactions.\n\nBut these new payment innovations, while promising, highlight important questions related to security, regulation, and relationships between consumers and financial service providers. During our mobile payments panel today, we will hear leaders in the industry discuss the challenges of these payments and the lessons that the U.S. can learn from international providers of mobile payments.\n\nWe can learn much from watching payment trends internationally, and we should be aware of how international trends affect domestic operations. We are now in a truly global market, and consumers and merchants have payment options--and obligations--that regularly cross borders, such as international remittance transfers. It's estimated that global remittance volume reached more than $232 billion in 2005, with very large unquantifiable amounts transmitted through informal channels. Tomorrow we will have an opportunity to delve into this issue more deeply, as we host a panel of industry experts who will talk about using remittances to reach new customers.\n\nOne of the more interesting facets of the new competitive payments landscape is the opportunity that innovation brings for partnerships. We will hear industry leaders discuss how they work with other firms as both collaborators and competitors. This trend has the potential to create a more cooperative payments system in which various players are more aware of issues that affect one another.\n\nAs I said in the beginning, increased competition among providers of existing and emerging payment products is likely to improve the efficiency of the payment system as a whole. But we should not just sit back and watch these changes take place without engaging in a dialogue, such as the one we will have over the next two days, about what these changing trends mean for consumers, businesses, and payment providers. Additionally, during times of transition, policymakers may be compelled to revisit the efficacy of current payment laws and regulations, and we hope to offer an open and honest forum for that conversation to take place.\n\nWith that in mind, it is my distinct pleasure to introduce our first keynote speaker, Randy Kroszner. Randy had a distinguished academic career at the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business and a variety of other posts before catching Potomac Fever during a stint in D.C. a few years ago as a member of the Council of Economic Advisors. In over 200 years the medical profession has been unable to come up with a cure for this fever, which affects many Washington denizens. Since the only known treatment is to go back to the swamp, Randy returned to Washington in 2006 as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. In prior years, Randy has worked with us at the Chicago Fed and we are delighted that he is now a member of the Board of Governors and delighted that he is here today. Please join me in welcoming Randy Kroszner.\n\n*The views presented here are my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "Thank you very much for inviting me to be here and speak to you today. As you mentioned, I am president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, which is part of the Federal Reserve System. In other words, I'm a central banker. Central banks perform a very important role in all economies. Regardless of the structure of the central bank, its most important function is to control the money supply—that is, the supply of currency and credit in the economy.\n\nThe Federal Reserve performs this function under a legislative mandate to foster monetary and financial conditions that help support sustainable economic growth with low and stable inflation. We accomplish this by setting targets for short-term interest rates—specifically, the overnight lending rate banks charge each other to borrow reserves. This is known as the federal funds rate.\n\nSetting the correct target is the key. It must be set to provide enough liquidity for saving and investment. This helps our economy achieve its maximum sustainable growth rate. But there are risks if too much liquidity is created. Too much liquidity means that spending may rise to the point that aggregate demand strains the productive capacity of the economy, increasing the costs of production. This in turn can lead to increases in the prices firms charge for finished goods, generating a spurt of inflation. And if households and businesses begin to expect wages and prices to rise, then inflation can be persistently higher.\n\nPersistent inflation is costly because it prevents prices from guiding the efficient allocation of resources. When these signals are clear, households and businesses do not waste time and resources trying to avoid having inflation eat away at the purchasing power of their income and savings. So it is important that the prices of goods and services in a market economy are stable and believed likely to remain so.\n\nIn addition to monetary policy, the Federal Reserve performs other duties to help achieve our broad mandate of supporting a safe and efficient monetary and financial system. In our market economy, we rely on private banking and financial markets to mobilize and channel savings to productive investments. So we promote public confidence in this system and improve its efficiency through bank supervision and by our active involvement in the operation of our nation's payments system. In our role as a supervisor, we try to identify whether banks have taken on excessive risk without the appropriate internal controls or are undercapitalized. If so, we direct them to take corrective actions. That's not to say that we prevent commercial banks from failing—we do not provide institutions with capital, and if the corrective actions are unsuccessful, the bank could fail. But by promoting sound practices, supervision supports financial stability and allows financial market participants to be more confident of their counterparties' abilities to execute transactions. This enhances the ability of the market to efficiently allocate credit among all participants.\n\nAlso, we have responsibility for insuring that the payments system operates efficiently and effectively. In this regard, we sell financial services like payments processing to commercial banks. Our role in the payments system has helped us meet financial challenges, such as providing liquidity following the tragic terrorist attacks on September 11. Plus, we reach out to the community to promote development, fair access to financial services, financial education and literacy, and research related to consumer issues in order to further support our economic growth objectives.\n\nIt's important to note that, when setting monetary policy, we do not try to target a particular growth rate for the real economy. In the long run, the economy's real performance is determined by such factors as population growth, labor force participation, capital accumulation, the skill of its workers, and improvements in technology. But macroeconomic stability requires sound financial conditions to support the economy's long-run growth prospects, which our monetary policy attempts to accomplish. When we are successful, inflation and long-term interest rates are kept in check, assisting the economy to grow at its potential, or its long-run sustainable rate of growth.\n\nOf course, the art of monetary policy is difficult to master, and what we do today reflects the lessons we have learned through the years. In fact, the Federal Reserve is not even our first attempt at a central bank. It was created in 1913 after 77 years of having no central bank. Our first two attempts, the First and Second Banks of the United States, were created to help finance the federal debt incurred from fighting our War of Independence and the War of 1812. The charter for the Second Bank expired in 1836 and was not renewed. But during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, our nation suffered several financial panics, and so we realized that we needed to make a third attempt at establishing a central bank.\n\nWhat we have now is a unique American institution, improved with the lessons learned from the first two attempts at a central bank. The Federal Reserve System is a central bank with a regional structure. The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 established 12 regional Reserve Banks and a Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. This represents a compromise between having a public, central authority in the Federal Reserve Board in D.C. and the regional and private-sector representation through the 12 quasi-private (though publicly chartered) regional Reserve Banks.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago serves the Seventh Federal Reserve District, which is located in the Midwest. The Chicago Fed [which is what we call the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago for short], like each of the district reserve banks, is overseen by a Board of Directors who are private citizens from banking, business, and the community at large and come from around the district. My district is heavily involved in manufacturing, which makes the region's economy more cyclical than in other regions. I'd also like to note that Chicago is in the process of bidding to host the 2016 Summer Olympic Games, and it's great to see the excitement and anticipation here for Beijing 2008—I certainly hope that Chicago has this type of experience.\n\nAs part of the Federal Reserve System, the individual Federal Reserve District Banks, including the Chicago Fed, help set monetary policy nationwide. As president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, I serve on the Fed's key policymaking group, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, until last year chaired by Alan Greenspan and now chaired by Ben Bernanke. All of the presidents of the regional Reserve Banks participate in the FOMC's discussions—though only 5 of 12 are voting members, on a rotating basis—as do the 7 members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. After the FOMC sets a target federal funds rate, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York then implements this monetary policy decision through the use of \"open market operations,\" which involve the buying and selling of U.S. government securities. Although the Fed affects the supply of credit to banks through the targeting of the federal funds rate, it relies on private market participants to then allocate this credit throughout the financial system. Importantly, we do not loan directly to businesses and households, and we do not instruct banks or other financial intermediaries who to lend to or how much to charge on their loans. They make those decisions on their own—we rely on a competitive financial system to ensure that credit gets allocated efficiently.\n\nThe preparations for each FOMC meeting, like the one we had last week, are extensive. The first step in preparation is gathering nonquantitative and anecdotal information about the economy from a wide network of business and other contacts throughout the region. They provide real-time insights on current and future trends in a wide range of economic indicators—they give us a perspective beyond the numbers. Of course, we study the published data carefully, and economists at the district banks and in Washington, D.C., produce national economic forecasts for the FOMC participants.\n\nAt each FOMC meeting, Committee members discuss the outlook and debate policy options for the national economy. Each bank president gives a statement on economic conditions in their region and in the nation as a whole, and the members of the Board of Governors offer their outlook for the national economy. The Committee then openly discusses the policy options and decides where to set its target for the federal funds rate. When we vote, the District bank presidents decide on the policy that is best for the country as a whole. The United States has a single currency and our financial markets are fluid and highly integrated. So, we must have one monetary policy for the nation and it cannot be used to benefit one region over another.\n\nAlso, not through any specific policy or initiative, but perhaps just by its culture, the Fed has always placed a premium on uniting around the consensus policy action. While some in the FOMC might have expressed a different opinion from the consensus during the policy discussion, most of our votes are unanimous. At other central banks, such as the Bank of England, dissent is much more common, and 5 to 4 votes are not out of the ordinary.\n\nThe FOMC also places a great deal of importance in how it communicates its monetary policy decisions. It wasn't until 1994, shortly before I joined the Chicago Fed, that the FOMC began issuing statements after its meetings to announce its policy decisions. Over time, this statement has evolved into a fuller discussion of the FOMC's evaluation of economic conditions. In 2005, the FOMC took the additional step of releasing the minutes to its meetings in a more timely fashion. So we now give the public a much better idea of the systematic ways in which the FOMC makes judgments regarding economic developments and translates these into the course for monetary policy. When the public and financial markets have a clear understanding of the Fed's goals and the methods used to achieve those goals, consumers and businesses can better plan for future activities.\n\nIt's also important to note that the Fed is independent of political and other influences. So we have an obligation to keep the public well-informed about our objectives and policy actions.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, we have two goals for monetary policy: first, to foster financial conditions that help the overall economy expand at its maximum sustainable pace; and second, to maintain price stability, or low and stable inflation. For the rest of my time today, I'd like to give you my thoughts on the U.S. economic outlook and some risks to that outlook in relation to our policy goals.\n\nIn order to see where the economy is heading, it's important to look back on where it's been. The U.S. economy experienced a mild recession in 2001. In the years after the 2001 recession, the economy grew faster than its long-run average rate of growth, which is typical following a recession. And there was a natural slowing from that faster pace after the bulk of our productive resources that were underutilized following the recession were back at work. More recently, however, the economy weathered some periods of uneven growth and a sharp decline in housing activity. Real gross domestic product, or real GDP—our broadest measure of economic output—increased 3.1 percent last year. Many economists estimate that the economy's potential growth rate—which is a term that we use to mean the rate of growth it can sustain over time, without generating inflationary pressures, given its labor and capital resources—is close to 3 percent. So, on average, the economy expanded near its potential in 2006. However, growth was stronger early in the year and below potential in the second half. Meanwhile, throughout the year firms were hiring workers at an impressive pace, and labor markets continued to tighten; the unemployment rate fell to 4-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter, down from 5 percent at the end of the previous year.\n\nSuch tightening resource pressures, as well as high energy and commodity prices, likely contributed to faster increases in prices. As a result, inflation ran too high. In 2006, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation increased 2.3 percent, up a bit from 2.1 percent in 2005. By contrast, I prefer inflation to be between 1 and 2 percent—that's the range that I consider to be most compatible with the Fed's goal of price stability. The monthly inflation numbers did come in lower toward the end of the year, and I was pleased to see the improvement. But the most recent couple of readings on inflation have been higher. So clearly, it is much too early to say that inflation is no longer a concern.\n\nFor the rest of 2007, I expect the economy to expand at a rate modestly below its long-run potential, and in 2008, at a pace nearer to potential. The brief period of below-potential growth would be consistent with slight increases in the unemployment rate and other measures of resource slack. But the magnitude of the increases would likely be small. Indeed, the FOMC forecasts an unemployment rate of 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent through 2007 and 2008, which would represent little change from its current value.\n\nAmong the greatest risks to this outlook for growth are continued declines in housing. Last year, home sales fell sharply and fewer new homes were built. Residential investment fell 12.6 percent, reducing GDP growth by 3/4 of a percentage point. A key question for the outlook is: What will be the full extent of the housing slowdown?\n\nThe most recent data on housing have been mixed and downside risks remain. The data on housing starts and sales suggest some stabilization, though the adjustment still appears to be ongoing. Indeed, while home builders we talk to report some tentative signs of markets stabilizing, the progress is uneven. So we are uncertain about what we will see in the housing data over the next several months. There are also financial risks associated with the declines in housing markets. For instance, delinquencies are up in the U.S. market for subprime home loans. This could become an issue for the macro outlook if these troubles spilled over to the availability of credit in markets more generally. We don't see this happening yet, however.\n\nThat said, the longer-term fundamentals for housing in the U.S. remain positive. The same factors that supported the housing boom—strong productivity trends and low borrowing rates relative to historical norms—are still in place. These factors likely put a floor under how far housing will decline. So I think home building will stabilize as we move through the year, but I don't expect to see any noticeable increases, either.\n\nThere has also been a concern that the slowdown in housing could spill over into other sectors of the economy, most importantly to consumer spending. Despite these worries, consumer spending has held up well; it grew 3.6 percent in 2006, which is a robust pace by historical standards.\n\nLooking to 2007, consumer spending should continue to be supported by vibrant labor markets, lower energy prices, and solid productivity trends. Importantly, the trends in worker productivity, or output per hour of work, are solid, and they eventually show through to increases in wages, salaries, and benefits. Solid gains in productivity should continue, as technology advances further, workers become more skilled in using technology, and managers find new ways to apply technology to their businesses. However, slower house price appreciation and the past increases in interest rates should boost savings and lower consumption relative to income. Balancing all of these forces, I think we will see solid growth in consumption in line with longer-run trends.\n\nRecently, we have seen some softer data on capital spending by businesses. The same positive productivity trends that we expect to support consumption should also support business spending on plant and equipment. So we are expecting the recent softness to be temporary. Still, we are monitoring developments in investment closely.\n\nTurning to inflation, there is a risk that inflation will stay stubbornly high. First, the economy appears to be operating in the neighborhood of its potential level of output. In this environment, tight labor markets could generate additional cost pressures. That said, profit margins are relatively high, so some further increases in labor costs could be absorbed by businesses in the form of lower margins.\n\nSecond, inflation has run above 2 percent for the past three years. With inflation at such high levels for so long, we have to recognize the risk that inflation expectations could become stuck in a range that would not be conducive to price stability. If firms and workers expect inflation to be high, they will want to keep up with the general increase in prices and costs. As a result, they will set higher prices and wages or build in plans for automatic increases. In this way, higher inflation expectations can become self-fulfilling. That is, they can lead to a persistently higher inflation rate, instead of simply a temporary increase. To date, inflation expectations appear to be contained. Nonetheless, the longer inflation runs above levels consistent with effective price stability, the greater the danger that expectations of future inflation will settle in above those levels as well.\n\nTaking all of these factors into account, my assessment is that the risk of inflation remaining too high is greater than the risk of growth falling too low. Of course, whether policy will need to be adjusted and the degree of any adjustment will depend on the data we see in the months to come and how that data influences our forecast of the economy.\n\nLooking ahead, I am optimistic about the fundamentals of the U.S. economy. We believe in free markets and competition, the use of technology and innovation, and openness to trade. These core principles provide a solid foundation for our economy to weather short-term challenges and expand over time. And the Federal Reserve's commitment to price stability means that we will be achieving this in an environment of low and stable inflation.\n\n*The views presented here are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.",

When we are successful, inflation and long-term interest rates are kept in check, assisting the economy to grow at its potential, or its long-run sustainable rate of growth.\n\nOf course, the art of monetary policy is difficult to master, and what we do today reflects the lessons we have learned through the years. In fact, the Federal Reserve is not even our first attempt at a central bank. It was created in 1913 after 77 years of having no central bank. Our first two attempts, the First and Second Banks of the United States, were created to help finance the federal debt incurred from fighting our War of Independence and the War of 1812. The charter for the Second Bank expired in 1836 and was not renewed. But during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, our nation suffered several financial panics, and so we realized that we needed to make a third attempt at establishing a central bank.\n\nWhat we have now is a unique American institution, improved with the lessons learned from the first two attempts at a central bank. The Federal Reserve System is a central bank with a regional structure. The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 established 12 regional Reserve Banks and a Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. This represents a compromise between having a public, central authority in the Federal Reserve Board in D.C. and the regional and private-sector representation through the 12 quasi-private (though publicly chartered) regional Reserve Banks.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago serves the Seventh Federal Reserve District, which is located in the Midwest. The Chicago Fed [which is what we call the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago for short], like each of the district reserve banks, is overseen by a Board of Directors who are private citizens from banking, business, and the community at large and come from around the district. My district is heavily involved in manufacturing, which makes the region's economy more cyclical than in other regions. I'd also like to note that Chicago is in the process of bidding to host the 2016 Summer Olympic Games, and it's great to see the excitement and anticipation here for Beijing 2008—I certainly hope that Chicago has this type of experience.\n\nAs part of the Federal Reserve System, the individual Federal Reserve District Banks, including the Chicago Fed, help set monetary policy nationwide. As president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, I serve on the Fed's key policymaking group, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, until last year chaired by Alan Greenspan and now chaired by Ben Bernanke. All of the presidents of the regional Reserve Banks participate in the FOMC's discussions—though only 5 of 12 are voting members, on a rotating basis—as do the 7 members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. After the FOMC sets a target federal funds rate, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York then implements this monetary policy decision through the use of \"open market operations,\" which involve the buying and selling of U.S. government securities. Although the Fed affects the supply of credit to banks through the targeting of the federal funds rate, it relies on private market participants to then allocate this credit throughout the financial system. Importantly, we do not loan directly to businesses and households, and we do not instruct banks or other financial intermediaries who to lend to or how much to charge on their loans. They make those decisions on their own—we rely on a competitive financial system to ensure that credit gets allocated efficiently.\n\nThe preparations for each FOMC meeting, like the one we had last week, are extensive. The first step in preparation is gathering nonquantitative and anecdotal information about the economy from a wide network of business and other contacts throughout the region. They provide real-time insights on current and future trends in a wide range of economic indicators—they give us a perspective beyond the numbers. Of course, we study the published data carefully, and economists at the district banks and in Washington, D.C., produce national economic forecasts for the FOMC participants.\n\nAt each FOMC meeting, Committee members discuss the outlook and debate policy options for the national economy. Each bank president gives a statement on economic conditions in their region and in the nation as a whole, and the members of the Board of Governors offer their outlook for the national economy. The Committee then openly discusses the policy options and decides where to set its target for the federal funds rate. When we vote, the District bank presidents decide on the policy that is best for the country as a whole. The United States has a single currency and our financial markets are fluid and highly integrated. So, we must have one monetary policy for the nation and it cannot be used to benefit one region over another.\n\nAlso, not through any specific policy or initiative, but perhaps just by its culture, the Fed has always placed a premium on uniting around the consensus policy action. While some in the FOMC might have expressed a different opinion from the consensus during the policy discussion, most of our votes are unanimous. At other central banks, such as the Bank of England, dissent is much more common, and 5 to 4 votes are not out of the ordinary.\n\nThe FOMC also places a great deal of importance in how it communicates its monetary policy decisions. It wasn't until 1994, shortly before I joined the Chicago Fed, that the FOMC began issuing statements after its meetings to announce its policy decisions. Over time, this statement has evolved into a fuller discussion of the FOMC's evaluation of economic conditions. In 2005, the FOMC took the additional step of releasing the minutes to its meetings in a more timely fashion. So we now give the public a much better idea of the systematic ways in which the FOMC makes judgments regarding economic developments and translates these into the course for monetary policy. When the public and financial markets have a clear understanding of the Fed's goals and the methods used to achieve those goals, consumers and businesses can better plan for future activities.\n\nIt's also important to note that the Fed is independent of political and other influences. So we have an obligation to keep the public well-informed about our objectives and policy actions.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, we have two goals for monetary policy: first, to foster financial conditions that help the overall economy expand at its maximum sustainable pace; and second, to maintain price stability, or low and stable inflation. For the rest of my time today, I'd like to give you my thoughts on the U.S. economic outlook and some risks to that outlook in relation to our policy goals.\n\nIn order to see where the economy is heading, it's important to look back on where it's been. The U.S. economy experienced a mild recession in 2001. In the years after the 2001 recession, the economy grew faster than its long-run average rate of growth, which is typical following a recession. And there was a natural slowing from that faster pace after the bulk of our productive resources that were underutilized following the recession were back at work. More recently, however, the economy weathered some periods of uneven growth and a sharp decline in housing activity. Real gross domestic product, or real GDP—our broadest measure of economic output—increased 3.1 percent last year. Many economists estimate that the economy's potential growth rate—which is a term that we use to mean the rate of growth it can sustain over time, without generating inflationary pressures, given its labor and capital resources—is close to 3 percent. So, on average, the economy expanded near its potential in 2006. However, growth was stronger early in the year and below potential in the second half. Meanwhile, throughout the year firms were hiring workers at an impressive pace, and labor markets continued to tighten; the unemployment rate fell to 4-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter, down from 5 percent at the end of the previous year.\n\nSuch tightening resource pressures, as well as high energy and commodity prices, likely contributed to faster increases in prices. As a result, inflation ran too high. In 2006, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation increased 2.3 percent, up a bit from 2.1 percent in 2005. By contrast, I prefer inflation to be between 1 and 2 percent—that's the range that I consider to be most compatible with the Fed's goal of price stability. The monthly inflation numbers did come in lower toward the end of the year, and I was pleased to see the improvement. But the most recent couple of readings on inflation have been higher. So clearly, it is much too early to say that inflation is no longer a concern.\n\nFor the rest of 2007, I expect the economy to expand at a rate modestly below its long-run potential, and in 2008, at a pace nearer to potential. The brief period of below-potential growth would be consistent with slight increases in the unemployment rate and other measures of resource slack. But the magnitude of the increases would likely be small. Indeed, the FOMC forecasts an unemployment rate of 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent through 2007 and 2008, which would represent little change from its current value.\n\nAmong the greatest risks to this outlook for growth are continued declines in housing. Last year, home sales fell sharply and fewer new homes were built. Residential investment fell 12.6 percent, reducing GDP growth by 3/4 of a percentage point. A key question for the outlook is: What will be the full extent of the housing slowdown?\n\nThe most recent data on housing have been mixed and downside risks remain. The data on housing starts and sales suggest some stabilization, though the adjustment still appears to be ongoing. Indeed, while home builders we talk to report some tentative signs of markets stabilizing, the progress is uneven. So we are uncertain about what we will see in the housing data over the next several months. There are also financial risks associated with the declines in housing markets. For instance, delinquencies are up in the U.S. market for subprime home loans. This could become an issue for the macro outlook if these troubles spilled over to the availability of credit in markets more generally. We don't see this happening yet, however.\n\nThat said, the longer-term fundamentals for housing in the U.S. remain positive. The same factors that supported the housing boom—strong productivity trends and low borrowing rates relative to historical norms—are still in place. These factors likely put a floor under how far housing will decline. So I think home building will stabilize as we move through the year, but I don't expect to see any noticeable increases, either.\n\nThere has also been a concern that the slowdown in housing could spill over into other sectors of the economy, most importantly to consumer spending. Despite these worries, consumer spending has held up well; it grew 3.6 percent in 2006, which is a robust pace by historical standards.\n\nLooking to 2007, consumer spending should continue to be supported by vibrant labor markets, lower energy prices, and solid productivity trends. Importantly, the trends in worker productivity, or output per hour of work, are solid, and they eventually show through to increases in wages, salaries, and benefits. Solid gains in productivity should continue, as technology advances further, workers become more skilled in using technology, and managers find new ways to apply technology to their businesses. However, slower house price appreciation and the past increases in interest rates should boost savings and lower consumption relative to income. Balancing all of these forces, I think we will see solid growth in consumption in line with longer-run trends.\n\nRecently, we have seen some softer data on capital spending by businesses. The same positive productivity trends that we expect to support consumption should also support business spending on plant and equipment. So we are expecting the recent softness to be temporary. Still, we are monitoring developments in investment closely.\n\nTurning to inflation, there is a risk that inflation will stay stubbornly high. First, the economy appears to be operating in the neighborhood of its potential level of output. In this environment, tight labor markets could generate additional cost pressures. That said, profit margins are relatively high, so some further increases in labor costs could be absorbed by businesses in the form of lower margins.\n\nSecond, inflation has run above 2 percent for the past three years. With inflation at such high levels for so long, we have to recognize the risk that inflation expectations could become stuck in a range that would not be conducive to price stability. If firms and workers expect inflation to be high, they will want to keep up with the general increase in prices and costs. As a result, they will set higher prices and wages or build in plans for automatic increases. In this way, higher inflation expectations can become self-fulfilling. That is, they can lead to a persistently higher inflation rate, instead of simply a temporary increase. To date, inflation expectations appear to be contained. Nonetheless, the longer inflation runs above levels consistent with effective price stability, the greater the danger that expectations of future inflation will settle in above those levels as well.\n\nTaking all of these factors into account, my assessment is that the risk of inflation remaining too high is greater than the risk of growth falling too low. Of course, whether policy will need to be adjusted and the degree of any adjustment will depend on the data we see in the months to come and how that data influences our forecast of the economy.\n\nLooking ahead, I am optimistic about the fundamentals of the U.S. economy. We believe in free markets and competition, the use of technology and innovation, and openness to trade. These core principles provide a solid foundation for our economy to weather short-term challenges and expand over time. And the Federal Reserve's commitment to price stability means that we will be achieving this in an environment of low and stable inflation.\n\n*The views presented here are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "Thank you very much for inviting me to be here and speak to you today. As you mentioned, I am president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, which is part of the Federal Reserve System. In other words, I'm a central banker. Central banks perform a very important role in all economies. Regardless of the structure of the central bank, its most important function is to control the money supply—that is, the supply of currency and credit in the economy.\n\nThe Federal Reserve performs this function under a legislative mandate to foster monetary and financial conditions that help support sustainable economic growth with low and stable inflation. We accomplish this by setting targets for short-term interest rates—specifically, the overnight lending rate banks charge each other to borrow reserves. This is known as the federal funds rate.\n\nSetting the correct target is the key. It must be set to provide enough liquidity for saving and investment. This helps our economy achieve its maximum sustainable growth rate. But there are risks if too much liquidity is created. Too much liquidity means that spending may rise to the point that aggregate demand strains the productive capacity of the economy, increasing the costs of production. This in turn can lead to increases in the prices firms charge for finished goods, generating a spurt of inflation. And if households and businesses begin to expect wages and prices to rise, then inflation can be persistently higher.\n\nPersistent inflation is costly because it prevents prices from guiding the efficient allocation of resources. When these signals are clear, households and businesses do not waste time and resources trying to avoid having inflation eat away at the purchasing power of their income and savings. So it is important that the prices of goods and services in a market economy are stable and believed likely to remain so.\n\nIn addition to monetary policy, the Federal Reserve performs other duties to help achieve our broad mandate of supporting a safe and efficient monetary and financial system. In our market economy, we rely on private banking and financial markets to mobilize and channel savings to productive investments. So we promote public confidence in this system and improve its efficiency through bank supervision and by our active involvement in the operation of our nation's payments system. In our role as a supervisor, we try to identify whether banks have taken on excessive risk without the appropriate internal controls or are undercapitalized. If so, we direct them to take corrective actions. That's not to say that we prevent commercial banks from failing—we do not provide institutions with capital, and if the corrective actions are unsuccessful, the bank could fail. But by promoting sound practices, supervision supports financial stability and allows financial market participants to be more confident of their counterparties' abilities to execute transactions. This enhances the ability of the market to efficiently allocate credit among all participants.\n\nAlso, we have responsibility for insuring that the payments system operates efficiently and effectively. In this regard, we sell financial services like payments processing to commercial banks. Our role in the payments system has helped us meet financial challenges, such as providing liquidity following the tragic terrorist attacks on September 11. Plus, we reach out to the community to promote development, fair access to financial services, financial education and literacy, and research related to consumer issues in order to further support our economic growth objectives.\n\nIt's important to note that, when setting monetary policy, we do not try to target a particular growth rate for the real economy. In the long run, the economy's real performance is determined by such factors as population growth, labor force participation, capital accumulation, the skill of its workers, and improvements in technology. But macroeconomic stability requires sound financial conditions to support the economy's long-run growth prospects, which our monetary policy attempts to accomplish. When we are successful, inflation and long-term interest rates are kept in check, assisting the economy to grow at its potential, or its long-run sustainable rate of growth.\n\nOf course, the art of monetary policy is difficult to master, and what we do today reflects the lessons we have learned through the years.

            "content": "Introduction\nAs you may know, the Federal Reserve has two primary goals for monetary policy. One is to foster financial conditions that help the overall economy expand at its maximum sustainable pace. This is no easy task. The economy rarely grows at a steady pace, and it is made up of many diverse parts, which rarely evolve in the same way at the same time. Today, for example, the perspective of an exporter is quite different from the perspective of a home builder or mortgage broker and different still from the perspective of a retailer. The Fed is ill-equipped to and should not try to even out the differences among sectors. But by looking carefully at developments in the various sectors of the economy, we can identify risks to achieving overall sustainable growth.\n\nOur second primary goal is to maintain price stability, or low and stable inflation. We also try to identify risks to this goal. Some are relatively easy to spot, such as cost pressures from a tight labor market, or shocks to energy and commodity prices. Others are more difficult to see, such as changes in consumer and business expectations about inflation.\n\nSo today, I'd like to give you my thoughts on recent developments in each of the sectors of the economy, and I'll discuss how they affect my outlook for growth and inflation in 2007 and 2008.\n\nThe macroeconomy\nIn order to see where the economy is heading, it's important to look back on where it's been. In 2006, the economy weathered some periods of uneven growth and a sharp decline in housing activity. However, the housing slowdown did not spill over to weaker growth in other sectors of the economy. Real gross domestic product, or real GDP—our broadest measure of economic output—increased 3.1 percent last year. Many economists estimate that the economy's potential growth rate—that is, the rate of growth it can sustain over time given its labor and capital resources—is close to 3 percent. So, on average, the economy expanded near its potential in 2006. However, growth was stronger early in the year and below potential in the second half. Meanwhile, throughout the year firms were hiring workers at an impressive pace, and labor markets continued to tighten; the unemployment rate fell to 4-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter, down from 5 percent at the end of the previous year.\n\nSuch tightening resource pressures, as well as high energy and commodity prices, likely contributed to faster increases in prices. As a result, inflation ran too high. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation is the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, also known as core PCE. In 2006, core PCE increased 2.3 percent, up a bit from 2.1 percent in 2005. By contrast, I prefer inflation to be between 1 and 2 percent—that's the range that I consider to be most compatible with the Fed's goal of price stability. The monthly inflation numbers did come in lower toward the end of the year, and I was pleased to see the improvement. However, core PCE moved up in January. Clearly, it is much too early to say that inflation is no longer a concern.\n\nLooking to the outlook for the next couple of years, the Federal Reserve published our biannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress in mid-February. In it, the participants on the Federal Open Market Committee gave forecasts for GDP, unemployment, and inflation. The central tendency of the growth forecast is for real GDP to increase between 2-1/2 and 3 percent in 2007 and for it to increase between 2-3/4 and 3 percent in 2008.\n\nA good deal has happened since these forecasts were prepared. Financial markets have been volatile, which imparts more uncertainty to the outlook. The data we have received on economic activity have been mixed, but on balance have come in on the soft side. Many of our business contacts also have pointed to slower growth early in the year. However, they also gave a number of indications that economic activity has been firming in recent weeks. And I still think that the underlying economic fundamentals are conducive to a pickup in growth as we move through 2007 and 2008. So I am not prepared to significantly change my projections at this time.\n\nHousing\nAmong the individual sectors of the economy, the most significant area of concern has been housing markets. Last year, home sales fell sharply and fewer new homes were built. Residential investment fell 12.6 percent, reducing GDP growth by 3/4 of a percentage point. A key question for the outlook is: What will be the full extent of the housing slowdown?\n\nTo gain some insights into where housing activity may settle out, it's important to think about the factors that led to the housing boom during the first half of this decade. Part of the boom was the result of strong productivity growth, which led to solid income gains that many people spent on bigger and better homes. Additionally, financial innovations helped keep the cost of financing low and improved many people's access to credit—in fact, the housing boom coincided with large improvements in homeownership for people in all income and ethnic groups. A boom in construction was needed to build the new homes that people were demanding. But once these homes were built, construction needed to settle back to more sustainable levels. So some slowdown in construction was to be expected; but the degree and timing of the slowdown were—and still are—uncertain.\n\nThe most recent data on housing have been mixed, but suggest that downside risks remain. Housing starts showed signs of stabilizing when they ticked up toward the end of last year, but they then declined sharply in January. These numbers can be highly volatile—especially during the winter months—so we should be careful not to read too much into the decline. Indeed, permits for home building—which tend to be less susceptible to weather changes—fell by a much smaller amount than starts. Nonetheless, inventories of unsold homes remain much higher than they were a year ago, and it will take some time for the excess inventory of homes to be sold. Home builders we talk to report some tentative signs of markets stabilizing, but the progress is uneven. For example, one national home builder recently told us that it has yet to see any stabilization in some Midwest markets, including Chicago.\n\nThat said, the longer-term fundamentals remain positive. The same factors that supported the housing boom—strong productivity trends, improved access to credit, and low mortgage rates relative to historical norms—are still in place. These factors likely put a floor under how far housing will decline. So I think home building will stabilize as we move through the year, but I don't expect to see any noticeable increases, either.\n\nThere also are financial risks associated with the declines in housing markets. Notably, defaults on subprime mortgages could have a larger-than-expected effect on households and lenders. True, these instruments are riskier than traditional mortgages. Still, to the extent that both borrowers and lenders fully understand the risks involved and markets have priced this risk properly, these instruments can represent a net gain to society by opening up financing to borrowers who previously could not obtain it. Here there is a role for public policy. The Fed, along with the other federal banking agencies, has recently proposed guidance to lenders on subprime mortgages. This guidance recommends sound risk management practices, especially careful evaluation of borrowers' ability to repay loans. It also advises banks to provide consumers with clear and balanced information about the benefits and risks of various types of loans. In addition, the Fed has long been involved in promoting financial literacy efforts for borrowers.\n\nConsumption\nBeyond the issue of housing activity itself, there has been concern that the slowdown in housing could spill over into other sectors of the economy, most importantly to consumer spending.\n\nConsumers adjust their spending patterns based on many factors, including their current income, their expected earnings, and their overall wealth. For most American households, the value of their home accounts for between 1/2 and 2/3 of their total assets. As home prices soared from 2001 to 2005—rising an average of 9 percent per year—the resulting increase in wealth contributed to strong consumer spending. But home price appreciation slowed sharply last year—the gain in home values was about half as fast—leading many to worry that a pullback in consumer spending would soon follow.\n\nDespite these worries, consumer spending has been well maintained; it grew 3.6 percent in 2006, which is a robust pace by historical standards. Spending in January was solid as well. Any drag from slower increases in housing wealth appears to have been more than offset by positive fundamentals underlying consumer demand. Job creation has been continuing at an impressive pace, generating healthy increases in income. The recent decline in energy prices has also been a positive factor. Whereas household budgets were strained by the run-up to $3-per-gallon gas prices, the retreat in gas prices has improved purchasing power.\n\nMoreover, the long-run expected earnings of households—that is, their permanent income—looks good. This reflects trends in productivity. Increases in worker productivity, or output per hour of work, eventually show through to increases in wages, salaries, and benefits. Productivity growth has averaged 2-1/2 percent over the past ten years. Solid gains should continue, as technology advances further, workers become more skilled in using technology, and managers find new ways to apply technology to their businesses.\n\nLooking to 2007, consumer spending should continue to be supported by vibrant labor markets, lower energy prices, and solid productivity trends. However, slower house price appreciation and the past increases in interest rates should boost savings and lower consumption relative to income. Balancing all of these forces, I think we will see solid growth in consumption in line with longer-run trends.\n\nBusiness investment\nLet's now turn to the business sector. Business capital expenditures rose a healthy 6.2 percent in 2006. This covers spending on equipment, software, and commercial and industrial construction that is used to expand productive capacity or retool existing operations.\n\nWe should see continued growth in investment in 2007. The cyclical fundamentals driving investment are somewhat mixed, although on balance positive. On the upside, corporate profits have been strong, and even with the recent increase in risk premia, financing conditions remain quite favorable. But business investment usually lags the economic cycle somewhat, and the softer economic growth recently is likely to restrain investment.\n\nIndeed, some of the recent indicators of investment have been weak. Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft fell 6.3 percent in January, the third decline in four months. But not all of the news has been bad: the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index moved up in February, and most business executives I talk to remain confident in the economy and are not expecting any fundamental pullback in spending.\n\nMoreover, the longer-term fundamentals for investment continue to be strong. Advances in technology are an important driver of spending for equipment and software. Computer makers are always developing new and faster PCs and servers to replace older machines. And technology is embedded in other kinds of equipment that isn't considered high tech. For example, modern machine tools contain a great deal of hardware and software that allow them to precisely cut and mill complex structures. Ongoing improvements in technology should help maintain healthy demand for high-tech equipment and for some kinds of industrial machinery. Of course, spending on equipment is always uneven across sectors. For example, demand for small machines used in residential construction is likely to moderate in line with the trends in the housing market.\n\nThe outlook for business investment in structures is relatively favorable. Growth in construction spending by businesses was particularly strong in 2006. The gains were widespread in such diverse categories as health care facilities, office buildings, retail space, and power generators. And high levels of energy prices spurred ongoing strong growth in mining and drilling activities. But the recent declines in energy prices make it less likely that we will see further large increases in such expenditures going forward. So some slower growth in structures investment may be expected in 2007.\n\nThe last major category of business spending is inventory investment. As we moved through 2006, a few industries found themselves overstocked with materials or products. Many of those manufacturers, such as the domestic automakers and steel producers, are based here in the Midwest. Their subsequent efforts to lower inventories contributed some to the weakness in manufacturing production that we saw in the second half of the year.\n\nBut looking at the economy as a whole, I don't see evidence of widespread inventory overhangs that would lead to significant production cuts. At the same time, inventories are not so lean that I'd expect a burst of stock building that would boost aggregate activity. So while we could see some quarterly volatility, on balance I expect inventory investment to be a relatively neutral factor for growth in 2007.\n\nInternational trade\nThe final piece of the growth picture is international trade. Although the U.S. continues to run a trade deficit, net exports did increase last year, which added about 1/2 of a percentage point to real GDP growth. Many of our trading partners experienced solid economic expansion last year. This helped fuel demand for U.S. products, including many produced by companies headquartered in the Midwest. For example, Caterpillar's sales growth in the fourth quarter was led by foreign demand, and Boeing has a deep backlog of orders from foreign carriers. I was in India recently, and I was amazed to see firsthand the progress and the vigorous expansion in the Indian economy.\n\nToo often commentators bemoan the rise in India, China, and other countries as coming at the expense of the U.S. Certainly, difficult displacements can take place because of international trade, and we should do our best to provide assistance to those affected. But trade is mutually beneficial overall. As countries like India grow, they buy more from us. Indeed, our exports to India have more than doubled in the past three years. Looking ahead, most forecasters expect continued solid growth in the world economy in 2007, which should help sustain growth in our exports. Of course, we'll keep an eye out to see if the recent developments in international capital markets change the outlook for growth of our major trading partners.\n\nInflation\nThe outlook for activity in the U.S. that I have just described is one in which the economy gains momentum and, on average, expands at a rate slightly below its long-run potential in 2007 and at a pace near potential in 2008. The brief period of below-potential growth would be consistent with slight increases in the unemployment rate and other measures of resource slack. But the magnitude of the increases would likely be modest. Indeed, the central tendency of the FOMC forecasts for both 2007 and 2008 is for an unemployment rate of 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent, which would represent little change from its current value.\n\nThese levels of unemployment are relatively low by historical standards, and they raise at least some concern about whether labor market conditions are tighter than can be sustained in the long run. Long periods of low unemployment have often been associated with rising costs and prices. When \"Help Wanted\" signs are everywhere and businesses have trouble filling their job openings, they try to attract and retain workers by offering higher wages that can exceed growth in productivity. These costs must be passed on to someone: either businesses bear the cost through lower profits or consumers pay the cost through higher prices. Many economists estimate that the natural rate of unemployment, or the unemployment rate that can be sustained in the long run, is around 5 percent. While there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding these estimates, unemployment in the range envisioned in the FOMC's outlook likely indicates a vibrant labor market in which an increasing number of firms may begin to bid up wages in excess of productivity.\n\nI don't think we are at that point yet. True, we've heard more than a few stories of shortages of high-skilled workers, and some measures of compensation growth have picked up. However, firms often tell me that new technologies and organizational changes have given them a great deal of flexibility to manage production in ways that mitigate cost pressures. Still, we need to be careful to watch for the emergence of the kind of economy-wide strains on resource utilization that can increase inflationary pressures. Such increases in inflationary pressures would be of concern because, as I noted earlier, I view inflation as already being too high.\n\nIn January, the 12-month change in core PCE was 2.3 percent. The FOMC's central tendency forecast is for inflation to run between 2 and 2-1/4 percent in 2007 and between 1-3/4 and 2 percent for 2008. If inflation were to come in at the middle or bottom of such ranges, that would represent reasonable progress toward price stability.\n\nOne development helping to ease inflationary pressures is the fall in energy prices that has occurred since the middle of 2006. The previous run-up in the price of oil was likely one of the main culprits responsible for boosting core inflation. Even though measures of core inflation do not reflect changes in energy prices directly, businesses often pass through higher energy costs to the prices of products that are included in the core. Increases in fuel costs boosted airfares. Higher shipping costs increased the consumer price of many manufactured goods. And higher prices for plastics and other petrochemicals raised the cost of manufacturing many products. Now, with energy prices having fallen, a reasonable expectation is that consumer prices should not need to increase as rapidly and core inflation should fall.\n\nWhile the progress on inflation envisioned by the FOMC is a likely scenario, there is a risk that inflation will stay stubbornly high. First, the economy appears to be operating in the neighborhood of its potential level of output. Unemployment is below many estimates of its natural rate, and other measures of resource pressures, such as capacity utilization, also suggest that little slack remains. Faster growth in compensation per hour, together with slower growth in productivity, has resulted in an acceleration in unit labor costs in 2006. In this environment, tight labor markets could generate additional cost pressures. That said, profit margins are relatively high, so some further increases in labor costs could be absorbed by businesses in the form of lower margins.\n\nSecond, inflation has run above 2 percent for the past three years. With inflation at such high levels for so long, we have to recognize the risk that inflation expectations could become stuck in a range that would not be conducive to price stability. If firms and workers expect inflation to be high, they will want to keep up with the general increase in prices and costs. As a result, they will set higher prices and wages or build in plans for automatic increases. In this way, higher inflation expectations can become self-fulfilling. That is, they can lead to a persistently higher inflation rate, instead of simply a temporary increase. To date, inflation expectations appear to be contained. Nonetheless, the longer inflation runs above levels consistent with effective price stability, the greater the danger that expectations of future inflation will settle in above those levels as well.\n\nPolicy implications\nIn setting policy, the Federal Reserve needs to be mindful of the risks to the outlook for both growth and inflation. In my judgment, there are some risks to the outlook for growth that remain a concern. There are some uncertainties around the outlook for business spending. Housing likely will still be a negative for growth during the first half of this year, though the degree and timing of its influence are uncertain. However, at this time the risks of housing spilling over to cause substantial weakness in other sectors of the economy do not appear to be unduly large.\n\nOn the inflation front, readings on core inflation have, on balance, been a bit better, and the fall in energy prices should provide some additional help going forward. But as I have noted, I expect the economy to continue to operate at a high level relative to its potential, which could eventually lead to the emergence of increased inflationary pressures. In addition, if actual inflation does not show clear enough signs of returning to the center of the range I associate with price stability, there is a danger that expectations of inflation could run too high, which would likely be a self-fulfilling prophesy.\n\nTaking all of these factors into account, my assessment is that the risk of inflation remaining too high during the forecast period is greater than the risk of growth falling too low. Thus, some additional firming of policy may yet be necessary to address this inflation risk. Of course, whether policy will need to be adjusted and the degree of any adjustment will depend on the data we see in the months to come and how that data influences our forecast of the economy.\n\n*The views presented here are my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "Good evening and thank you to Bruce Gottschall and the great team at NHS of Chicago for inviting me. Some of you may know that I'm retiring from the Fed at the end of August. So this is the last opportunity I will have as president of the Chicago Fed to speak to you at this annual event, and I'm glad I could be here tonight.\n\nWe're here in large part to honor Bruce Paradis, the CEO of Residential Capital Corporation, for his contributions to the Home Ownership Preservation Initiative. HOPI is a partnership of NHS, the city government, and financial institutions to address high foreclosure rates. Bruce's leadership has produced an unprecedented level of involvement by the financial community in addressing foreclosures and their destabilizing impact.\n\nBut before presenting Bruce with the Gale Cincotta Award, I've been asked to share a few reflections on the Chicago Fed's work with NHS and the HOPI initiative and how this relates to our overall mission.\n\nWe all understand how important home ownership is for families and for stable, economically viable communities. So the work by NHS over the years to help more Chicago residents achieve home ownership has had an enormous impact. That impact has much to do with NHS partners such as Mayor Daley and others in city government. It's also a testament to the many active, concerned partners in the financial community, such as Bruce Paradis. Like Mayor Daley, Bruce has built on the success of HOPI to link foreclosure intervention programs nationwide, and he helped establish the Home Ownership Preservation Foundation. This foundation set up a nationwide hotline to help those facing foreclosure and offers special services to military personnel.\n\nThe Chicago Fed is also proud to work with NHS. NHS's first foreclosure intervention program originated from a Fed initiative in the 1990s, and HOPI was launched at the Chicago Fed in September 2003.\n\nPartnerships between nonprofits, government, and financial institutions aren't a new concept. I was an assistant secretary at HUD in the early 70s when we funded Neighborhood Housing Services of America, which helped bring conventional mortgage lending to areas where banks weren't lending. That funding—authorized by an administration seeking market-based alternatives to public housing—reflected an important, enduring public-policy objective: increasing the nation's home-ownership rate. With the help of organizations like NHS, home ownership is now more attainable to lower-income households, and the home ownership rate has grown from roughly 64% in 1994, when I joined the Chicago Fed, to 69% today.\n\nCurrently, however, concern is growing over the increase in foreclosures. In Chicago, the foreclosure rate—after a decline beginning around the inception of HOPI—is now increasing. It's over twice as high as the national rate and well above the Illinois rate.\n\nIn looking for the causes of these recent foreclosures, much of the attention has been focused on nontraditional mortgages. These diverse mortgage options help people manage their finances and allow more people to afford their own homes. But nontraditional mortgages have resulted in increased delinquencies because they have been used by consumers with higher risk profiles who may not fully recognize the risks inherent in these mortgages. Some of the more exotic mortgages, which have payments that start low but can increase sharply in certain situations, may not be suitable for the average borrower. Last September, the Fed and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued joint guidance on nontraditional mortgage origination. Much of this guidance boils down to sound practices: ensuring that customers understand the loan terms and have the capacity to repay, even in the worst-case scenarios. That takes informed consumers and appropriate disclosure on the part of the lenders.\n\nPartnerships such as HOPI can play an important role in identifying ways to avoid foreclosures and educating and counseling consumers at risk. HOPI has clearly evolved, focusing as much on the causes of foreclosure and preventing them as on reducing the effects of foreclosures on communities.\n\nThis brings me back to this year's Gale Cincotta Award winner, Bruce Paradis. Bruce has taken the leading role in the financial community on the HOPI initiative, encouraging a large group of financial institutions to participate in addition to his own. From the earliest stages of his involvement in HOPI, Bruce has been a candid, devoted partner who has made this initiative a part of his overall business plan. Let me explain what I mean. For the last decade, we have repeatedly said, \"There are no winners when a foreclosure occurs.\" Lender, servicer, home owner, investor, community—none of these parties gains anything from a foreclosure. When Bruce spoke at the initial HOPI meeting in 2003, he pointed out that his organization, an issuer of securities backed by mortgages, would lose hundreds of millions of dollars because of foreclosures in that year alone. So he has brought action and energy to this endeavor to impact his bottom line, and he has helped to establish resources around the country for those facing foreclosure.\n\nBruce has furthered all of the objectives of HOPI. He has brought people not just to meetings, but to call centers to work on the front lines. He has also provided critical data, funding, and a willingness to explore creative solutions. It's my great pleasure now to present this year's Gale Cincotta Neighborhood Partnership award to Bruce Paradis.\n\n*The views presented here are my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "Introduction\nAs you may know, the Federal Reserve has two primary goals for monetary policy. One is to foster financial conditions that help the overall economy expand at its maximum sustainable pace. This is no easy task. The economy is made up of many diverse parts, and it rarely expands evenly in all sectors at the same time. Today, for example, the perspective of an exporter is quite different from the perspective of a homebuilder or mortgage broker and different still from the perspective of a retailer. The Fed is ill-equipped to and should not try to even out the differences among sectors. But by looking carefully at developments in the various sectors of the economy, we can identify risks to achieving overall sustainable growth.\n  Our second primary goal is to maintain price stability, or low and stable inflation. We also try to identify risks to this goal. Some are relatively easy to spot, such as cost pressures from a tight labor market, or shocks to energy and commodity prices. Others are more difficult to see, such as changes in consumer and business expectations about inflation.\n  So today, I'd like to give you my thoughts on recent developments in each of the sectors of the economy, and I'll discuss how they affect my outlook for growth and inflation in 2007 and 2008.\n\nThe macroeconomy\nIn order to see where the economy is heading, it's important to look back on where it's been. In 2006, the economy weathered some periods of uneven growth and a sharp decline in housing activity. However, the housing slowdown did not spill over to weaker growth in other sectors of the economy. Real gross domestic product, or real GDP—our broadest measure of economic output—increased 3.4 percent last year as currently estimated. Many economists estimate that the economy's potential growth rate—that is, the rate of growth it can sustain over time given its labor and capital resources—is close to 3 percent. So growth in 2006 was a bit above potential. As a result, firms were hiring workers at an impressive pace, and labor markets continued to tighten; the unemployment rate fell to 4-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter, down from 5 percent at the end of the previous year.\n  Yet as economic activity was proving resilient, inflation was running too high. Tightening resource pressures, as well as high energy and commodity prices, likely contributed to faster increases in prices. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation is the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, also known as core PCE. In 2006, core PCE increased 2.3 percent, up a bit from 2.1 percent in 2005. By contrast, I prefer inflation to be between 1 and 2 percent—that's the range that I consider to be most compatible with the Fed's goal of price stability. The monthly inflation rates did come in lower toward the end of the year, and I was pleased to see the improvement. However, it is much too early to say that inflation is no longer a concern.\n  So as I look ahead to this year, I see the economy with some solid underlying momentum behind it and inflation running too high. This week, the Federal Reserve published our biannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress. In it, the participants on the Federal Open Market Committee gave our forecasts for GDP, unemployment, and inflation. The central tendency of the growth forecast is for real GDP to increase between 2-1/2 and 3 percent in 2007.\n  The overall outlook is down somewhat from our last one, which we made in July. But looking at the performance of the sectors behind these forecasts, the major downside risks to the growth outlook have diminished.\n\nHousing\n The most significant area of concern has been housing markets. Last year, home sales fell sharply and fewer new homes were built. Residential investment fell 13 percent, reducing GDP growth by 3/4 of a percentage point. A key question for the outlook is: What will be the full extent of the housing slowdown?\n  To gain some insights into where housing activity may settle out, it's important to think about the factors that led to the housing boom during the first half of this decade. Part of the boom was the result of strong productivity growth, which led to solid income gains that many people spent on bigger and better homes. Additionally, financial innovations helped keep the cost of financing low and improved many people's access to credit—in fact, the housing boom coincided with large improvements in homeownership for people in all income and ethnic groups. So a boom in construction was needed to build the new homes that people were demanding. But once these homes were built, home building needed to settle back to more sustainable levels.\n  We have seen tentative signs that housing has begun to stabilize. Housing starts ticked up in November and December, new home sales increased in the fourth quarter, and applications for home-purchase mortgages have been running higher than they did last fall. And the same factors that supported the housing boom—strong productivity trends, improved access to credit, and low mortgage rates relative to historical norms—are still in place. These factors likely put a floor under how far housing will decline.\n  But after ticking up in November and December, housing starts declined sharply in January. These numbers can be highly volatile—especially during the winter months. Indeed, permits for home building also fell, but by a much smaller amount. But these data highlight that downside risks remain. Although demand is improving in some parts of the country, the progress is uneven. One national home builder recently reported that it has yet to see any stabilization in some Midwest markets, including Chicago and Detroit. Moreover, nationwide inventories of unsold homes remain much higher than they were a year ago. It will take some time for the excess inventory of homes to be sold. So while I think homebuilding will stabilize as we move through the year, I don't expect to see any noticeable increases, either.\n  There is also a risk that defaults on subprime mortgages could have a larger than expected effect on households and lenders. True, these instruments are riskier than traditional mortgages. Still, to the extent that both borrowers and lenders understand the risks involved and markets have priced this risk properly, these instruments represent a net gain to society by opening up financing to borrowers who previously could not obtain it. Here there is a role for public policy. On the part of the Fed, we are offering guidance to lenders with regard to the disclosure of terms and costs to borrowers and with regard to the risks of carrying such loans on their books. We are also promoting financial literacy efforts for borrowers.\n\nConsumption\nBeyond the issue of housing activity itself, there has been concern that the slowdown in housing could spill over into other sectors of the economy, such as consumer spending.\n  Consumers adjust their spending patterns based on many factors, including their current income, their expected earnings, and their overall wealth. For most American households, the value of their home accounts for between 1/2 and 2/3 of their total assets. As home prices soared from 2001 to 2005—rising an average of 9 percent per year—the resulting increase in wealth contributed to strong consumer spending. But home price appreciation slowed sharply last year—the gain in home values was about half as fast—leading many to worry that a pullback in consumer spending would soon follow.\n  Despite these worries, consumer spending has been well maintained; it grew 3.7 percent in 2006, which is a robust pace by historical standards. Any drag from slower increases in housing wealth has been more than offset by positive fundamentals underlying consumer demand. Job creation has been continuing at an impressive pace, generating solid increases in income. The recent decline in energy prices has also been a positive factor. Whereas household budgets were strained by the run-up to $3-per-gallon gas prices, the retreat in gas prices has improved purchasing power. And the recovery in the stock market helped mitigate the wealth impact of slower home-price appreciation.\n  Moreover, the long-run expected earnings of households—that is, their permanent income—looks good. This reflects trends in productivity. Increases in worker productivity, or output per hour of work, eventually show through to increases in wages, salaries, and benefits. Productivity growth has averaged 2-1/2 percent over the past ten years. Solid gains should continue, as technology advances further, workers become more skilled in using technology, and managers find new ways to apply technology to their businesses.\n  Looking to 2007, consumer spending should continue to be supported by healthy labor markets, lower energy prices, and solid productivity trends. However, slower house price appreciation and the past increases in interest rates should boost savings and lower consumption relative to income. Balancing all of these forces, I think we will see solid growth in consumption in line with longer-run trends.\n\nBusiness investment\nLet's now turn to the business sector. Business capital expenditures—that is, spending on equipment, software, and commercial construction activity—rose a healthy 6-3/4 percent in 2006.\n  We should see continued growth in investment in 2007. The cyclical fundamentals driving investment are somewhat mixed, although on balance positive. On the upside, corporate profits have been strong, and financial conditions are quite favorable for retooling or expanding capacity. But business investment usually lags the economic cycle somewhat, and the slightly softer economic growth recently is likely to restrain investment.\n  The longer-term fundamentals continue to be strong. Advances in technology are an important driver of spending for equipment and software. Computer makers are always developing new and faster PCs and servers to replace older machines. And technology is embedded in other kinds of equipment that isn't considered high tech. For example, modern machine tools contain a great deal of hardware and software that allow them to precisely cut and mill complex structures. Ongoing improvements in technology should help maintain healthy demand for high-tech equipment and for some kinds of industrial machinery. Of course, spending on equipment is always uneven across sectors. Demand for small machines used in residential construction is likely to moderate in line with the trends in the housing market.\n  The outlook for business investment in structures is relatively favorable. Growth in construction spending by businesses was particularly strong in 2006. The gains were widespread in such diverse categories as health care facilities, office buildings, retail space, and power generators. And high levels of energy prices spurred ongoing strong growth in mining and drilling activities. But the recent declines in energy prices make it less likely that we will see further large increases in such expenditures going forward. So some slower growth in structures investment may be expected in 2007.\n  The last major category of business spending is inventory investment. As we moved through 2006, a few industries found themselves overstocked with materials or products. Many of those manufacturers, such as the domestic automakers and steel producers, are based here in the Midwest. Their subsequent efforts to lower inventories contributed some to the weakness in manufacturing production that we saw in the second half of the year.\n  But these are just isolated examples. Looking at the economy as a whole, I don't see evidence of widespread inventory overhangs that would lead to significant production cuts. At the same time, inventories are not so lean that I'd expect a burst of stock building that would boost aggregate activity. So while we could see some quarterly volatility, on balance I expect inventory investment to be a relatively neutral factor for growth in 2007.\n\nInternational trade\nThe final piece of the growth picture is international trade. Although the United States continues to run a trade deficit, trade last year helped our economic growth. The trade deficit shrank, adding about 1/2 of a percentage point to real GDP growth. Solid growth abroad fueled demand for U.S. products, including many from companies headquartered in the Midwest. For example, Caterpillar's sales growth in the fourth quarter was led by foreign demand, and Boeing has a deep backlog of orders from foreign carriers. I was in India recently, and I was amazed to see firsthand the progress and the vigorous expansion in the Indian economy. Too often commentators bemoan the rise in India, China, and other countries as coming at the expense of the U.S. Certainly, difficult displacements can take place because of international trade, and we should do our best to provide assistance to those affected. But trade is mutually beneficial overall. As countries like India grow, they buy more from us. Indeed, our exports to India have more than doubled in the past three years. Looking ahead, most forecasters expect continued solid growth in the world economy in 2007, which should help sustain growth in our exports.\n\nInflation\nThe outlook for growth that I have just described is one in which the economy expands on average at a rate slightly below its long-run potential in 2007. And in 2008 we expect growth to be near potential. The brief period of below-potential growth would be consistent with slight increases in the unemployment rate and other measures of resource slack. But the magnitude of the increases would likely be modest. Indeed, the central tendency of the FOMC forecasts for both 2007 and 2008 is for an unemployment rate of 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent, which would represent little change from its current value.\n  These levels of unemployment are relatively low by historical standards, and they raise at least some concern about whether labor market conditions are tighter than can be sustained in the long run. Long periods of low unemployment are often associated with rising costs and prices. When \"Help Wanted\" signs are everywhere and businesses have trouble filling their job openings, they try to attract and retain workers by offering higher wages that can exceed growth in productivity. These costs must be passed on to someone: either businesses bear the cost through lower profits or consumers pay the cost through higher prices. Many economists estimate that the natural rate of unemployment, or the unemployment rate that can be sustained in the long run, is around 5 percent. While there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding these estimates, unemployment in the range envisioned in the FOMC's outlook likely indicates a vibrant labor market in which an increasing number of firms may begin to bid up wages in excess of productivity.\n  But we are not at that point yet. I've heard more than a few stories of shortages of highly skilled workers, but thus far the increases in overall compensation have been relatively moderate. Furthermore, firms often tell me that productivity gains have given them a great deal of flexibility to produce without generating cost pressures. Still, we need to be careful to watch for the emergence of the kind of economy-wide strains on resource utilization that can increase inflationary pressures. Such increases in inflationary pressures would be of concern because, as I noted earlier, I view inflation as already being too high.\n  The good news is that we've actually seen some improvements in inflation. Just a few months ago, the 12-month change in core PCE was 2.4 percent, but by December it was 2.2 percent. The FOMC outlook anticipates further declines. The central tendency forecast expects inflation of 2 to 2-1/4 percent for 2007 and 1-3/4 to 2 percent for 2008. If inflation were to come in at the middle or bottom of such ranges, that would represent good progress toward price stability.\n  One development helping to ease inflationary pressures is the recent fall in energy prices. The previous run-up in the price of oil was likely one of the main culprits responsible for boosting core inflation. Even though measures of core inflation do not reflect changes in energy prices directly, businesses often pass through higher energy costs to the prices of products that are included in the core. Increases in fuel costs boosted airfares. Higher shipping costs increased the consumer price of many manufactured goods. And higher prices for plastics and other petrochemicals raised the cost of manufacturing many products. Now, with energy prices having fallen, a reasonable expectation is that consumer prices should not need to increase as rapidly and core inflation should fall.\n  While the steady progress on inflation envisioned by the FOMC is the most likely scenario, there is a risk that inflation will stay stubbornly high. First, the economy appears to be operating in the neighborhood of its potential level of output. Unemployment is below many estimates of its natural rate, and other measures of resource pressures, such as capacity utilization, also suggest that little slack remains. Growth in compensation per hour has not moved up much over the past year, but unit labor costs have accelerated because of slower growth in productivity. Although the underlying trend is still solid, productivity growth over the past several quarters has moderated from exceptionally strong rates. In this environment, tight labor markets could generate additional cost pressures. That said, profit margins are relatively high, so some further increases in labor costs could be absorbed by businesses in the form of lower margins.\n  Second, with inflation having run above 2 percent for so long, inflation expectations could become stuck in a range that would not be conducive to price stability. If firms and workers expect inflation to be high, they will want to keep up with the general increase in prices and costs. As a result, they will set higher prices and wages or build in plans for automatic increases. In this way, higher inflation expectations can become self-fulfilling. That is, they can lead to a persistently higher inflation rate, instead of simply a temporary increase. To date, inflation expectations appear to be contained. Nonetheless, the longer inflation runs above levels consistent with effective price stability, the greater the danger that expectations of future inflation will settle in above those levels as well.\n\nPolicy implications\nIn setting policy, the Federal Reserve needs to be mindful of the risks to the outlook for both growth and inflation. In my judgment, while some risks to the outlook for growth remain a concern, these have diminished noticeably in recent months. Housing will likely still be a negative for growth during the first half of this year, but it has shown signs of stabilization. And the risks of spillovers to other parts of the economy do not appear to be unduly large.\n  We have also seen some lessening of inflation risks in recent months. Readings on core inflation have been somewhat better, and the fall in energy prices should provide some additional help going forward. But as I have noted, I expect the economy to continue to operate at a high level relative to its potential, which could eventually lead to the emergence of increased inflationary pressures. In addition, if actual inflation does not show clear enough signs of returning to the center of the range I associate with price stability, there is a danger that expectations of inflation could run too high, which would likely be a self-fulfilling prophesy.\n  Taking all of these factors into account, my assessment is that the risk of inflation remaining too high is greater than the risk of growth falling too low. Thus, some additional firming of policy may yet be necessary to address this inflation risk. Of course, whether policy will need to be adjusted and the degree of any adjustment will depend on the data we see in the months to come and how that data influences our forecast of the economy.\n\n*The views presented here are my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "Globalization has brought new opportunities to large cities such as Chicago. Large cities are best suited to perform the advanced business services that global transactions require, such as finance, law, and logistics. However, because our large cities are so complex and diverse, and because their residents live and work so closely together, large cities face intense and competing demands on land use and public services.\n\nIf Chicago is to continue to stand out as one of the nation's leading cities and continue to expand its global role, it must function efficiently in its internal circulation of ideas, goods, and—the hallmark of great cities—people. In this regard, I would like to put into context how very useful the new CMAP organization can be to the future of Chicago.\n\nWe can begin to understand our current challenges and opportunities by examining our own past development. The emergence of Chicago is a story that combines our city's entrepreneurial spirit with the blessing of geography. Looking back to 1840, Chicago was a humble burg of 4500 people. It was the 92nd largest city in the U.S.; Detroit was twice as big, St. Louis was four times larger, Cincinnati was ten times bigger, and New Orleans had 100,000 more people. But the region surrounding Chicago was poised for growth. The Midwest contained a seemingly boundless and largely untapped wealth of natural resources. It had furs and game, minerals, timber, coal, and the world's richest soils for agricultural and livestock production.\n\nChicago had a great natural location advantage to bring these goods to market. It lay at the intersection of the two great waterways of the interior, the Mississippi Basin and the Great Lakes. Several bold infrastructure initiatives shaped Chicago into the primary vehicle for using the waterways to gather and distribute these commodities. Local projects included opening the harbor mouth of the Chicago River and building the Illinois and Michigan Canal, which linked Chicago to the Mississippi Valley, St. Louis, New Orleans, and the Gulf of Mexico. The construction of the Erie Canal linked Chicago to New York City and the East via the Great Lakes.\n\nLater, as rail supplanted water as the primary transportation method, Chicago-area entrepreneurs funneled the nation's railroad system through the city. This solidified Chicago's position as the primary nexus of midcontinental commodity grading, processing, and transshipment.\n\nAs the center point of commodity transshipment, Chicago had obvious and abundant opportunities to \"make the markets\" in these same commodities and to serve as the headquarters for the emergent companies who were trading, financing, and distributing these goods. Chicago's businessmen capitalized on these opportunities by adapting such innovations as grain elevators and refrigerated freight cars to transport dressed beef to eastern markets. Notably, the city's leaders also advanced public and quasi-public institutions, including membership commodity exchanges, wholesale goods exchanges, trade shows, a world's fair, and permanent merchandise showcase facilities.\n\nNot only could the city move materials in and ship products out, it also could move its residents to work sites. These abilities combined to make Chicago a great manufacturing powerhouse. Chicago's early-20th-century legacy of industries—including steel, meatpacking, clothing, food processing, and machinery—all derived from the city's transportation advantages and location. Both the material- and people-moving requirements of these industries were enormous. Manufacturing operations then were not the sparsely manned operations that we know today. Large numbers of workers were necessary to move and transform material. By 1890, Chicago had welcomed more than a million people into its borders, making it the second-largest city in the country. While the city was relatively efficient at moving all of these people to their jobs and moving all of the goods they produced, the tasks were never easy, and they often resulted in severe strains on the transportation infrastructure and rights of way.\n\nIn other words, from an urban-planning and growth-management perspective, many of the planning and public-service challenges and conflicts of today were already evident early on. The city's transportation network ran through land that was scarce, often swampy, and sometimes disease plagued. And the network was perpetually congested funneling commodities through the city in all directions.\n\nAt the same time, Chicago's commercial district soon housed one of the world's primary office centers, where office workers shared and transmitted business information face-to-face and met together in newly invented skyscraper buildings to discuss and sometimes agree on business and financial deals. And so, office workers commuted over or across the same roads and rights-of-way as freight. Here, innovations such as the elevated rail transit system as well as much planning and public discussion were needed to bring workers from their residences to downtown.\n\nIn looking back on this era, we tend to celebrate Chicago's planning achievements. But at the same time, it is also widely recognized that Chicago was a place ill-prepared to house and serve its in-migration of workers, many of whom were undereducated and, somewhat akin to today, spoke different languages. So too, freight transportation bottlenecks and inefficiencies, and ultimately lost opportunities, were no less prominent. Rapid economic growth in the Midwest and nation at large helped Chicago cover up mistakes and lost opportunities, but the slowing of growth brings them to the fore.\n\nIn looking at today's Chicagoland economy, it seems clear that we are in no position to let opportunities slip by for want of foresight and regionwide initiative. The strong growth environment of the 19th and early-20th century is no longer in force to paper over public-policy mistakes. And in an information-based economy where natural and manmade borders are seemingly insignificant, Chicago can't rely on its location to help attract businesses. As a result, the nature of our planning must be more creative and less reactive than in the past.\n\nOver the past 40 years or more, Chicago's performance has been lagging in relation to surging cities in the South and West, especially metropolitan areas of the Sunbelt and Pacific Northwest. Chicago has surrendered its second-city status to Los Angeles. And while Chicago-area personal incomes have been rising along with the national standard of living, Chicago's relative standard of living has been slipping in comparison to the national average. In 1970, per capita income in Chicago was 20 percent higher than the national average; now it's only 11 percent higher.\n\nChicago's past public policies are not the primary driver for its failure to keep up with these regions, though I think that we could all find some fault in some instances. In particular, as the Chicago Fed concluded in 1997 in our assessment of the Midwest economy, there is no greater determinant of regional growth and prosperity than the education and skills of its people and workforce. Yet today in Chicago and around the Midwest, policy makers still struggle to improve educational outcomes for many inner-city children who are ill-equipped to move into the workforce or on to higher education.\n\nBut the lagging economic performance of the Chicago metropolitan area also largely reflects structural shifts in the nation's economy and in its broad economic geography. The Midwest's natural resources as we knew them were superseded or depleted. In addition, while technological changes fostered rapid growth in the region's capacity to produce both manufactured goods and agricultural crops, technological progress has also meant significant labor savings and relatively less growth in demand for midwestern and Chicago production workers. To be sure, falling prices for midwestern goods have helped lift standards of living for American households. But at the same time, there has been so far insufficient offsetting growth in the demand for midwestern products. As a result, the region has not kept pace with the rest of the country.\n\nIn sum, the Chicago region generally finds itself as the business capital city of a slowly growing region rather than a rapidly growing one. The city continues to function well as the distributor, financier, and business-service provider of the surrounding Midwest, but this has not been sufficient to sustain economic growth at national standards.\n\nThis is not to say the Chicago region is without promising prospects. The region has expanded many of its business lines and become a national and global market maker in several important arenas. Chicago remains a headquarters city for national and global companies, second only to New York. Chicago's tourism trade is on the rise, while the city continues to stand out as a host to business meetings and conventions. Chicago's financial-service industries, especially the risk-market exchanges and clearinghouses, have recently revived and continue to flourish, serving as a key platform for global trading. The city's business-service industries and segments of the legal sector are also prominent. Its premier universities serve a global clientele, as do many of its health professionals, clinics, and hospitals. Perhaps most importantly, Chicago has crafted a diverse and high-quality environment that has the potential to attract many of the world's most creative and entrepreneurial people.\n\nAnd so today, although Chicago has experienced upheaval due to technological change and globalization, it also has significant new opportunities. Depending on its own actions, Chicago can either maintain its limited status and growth as the business capital of the Midwest, or it can adapt to the changing economy and further its global importance. In this, Chicago could become the portal that helps revive the surrounding Midwest.\n\nIn order to help Chicago reach its full potential as a global and national city, I think it's most important to recognize that Chicago's physical needs have changed. How we live and work requires an ever-increasing amount of physical circulation of workers—especially professional and knowledge workers. Skilled workers often find it more productive to continue to commute from home to office to exchange information, despite having the technical ability to work at home with the Internet and personal computers. Such information is often ambiguous, in the sense that it must be interpreted and often creatively advanced through business meetings face-to-face, often in a group setting, and often with rapidly changing groups of people located far and wide. As urban economist Ed Glaeser stated during his recent visit to Chicago, technical advances have only magnified the value of face-to-face communication. In today's information economy and in its advanced information industries, \"who we converse with on the Internet are also those who we find we must meet with face-to-face.\" Accordingly, overland commuting and transport are more important then ever.\n\nAs I'm sure you'll recognize, in many sectors such as high technology, the arts, and finance, these meetings may be casual rather than prearranged. This means that the global city that hosts conventions, conferences, and the trendy arts, café or nightlife scene is even more amenable to value-creating ideas.\n\nIn this information-rich business environment, as Chicago strives to become a city that functions above or in a league with other global cities, the implications for commodious ground transport and residential access for such opportunities are compelling. Within the metropolitan area, the structure and direction of such workplace trips has changed mightily. Chicago's employment centers have expanded well beyond the Loop and are now widespread. Our transportation system was designed well to move workers from the suburbs to the Loop, but it has been strained as more people find themselves commuting from Naperville to Schaumburg, or leaving their office in Palatine for a meeting in Lake Forest. For the city to work well, it requires key infrastructure such as highways and land-use planning that promotes circulation of people in getting around. Both ground and intercity transportation must be accommodated and eased to facilitate travel for workplace, residential, and recreational wants and needs.\n\nIn this, it almost goes without saying that some regionwide planning of infrastructure and land use will be needed for Chicago to reach its potential. To take the case of ground transportation, the metropolitan area's transportation grid functions as a network of interconnected pipes rather than as a set of autonomous parts. A traffic accident or delay on any major artery affects the entire system. While the region's transportation agencies correctly tend to view the Chicago-area transportation grid as an integrated network, local governments sometimes have perspectives that run counter to the needs of the regional transportation grid. A local community may be more interested in providing its residents with easy access to the regional transportation grid than easing egress across its own community. Many of us like to live on suburban cul-de-sacs, for example. But as we all locate our homes on them, we become flustered as we exit our neighborhoods into gridlock traffic congestion.\n\nSo too, overly local land-use decisions for housing can unduly raise living costs. In particular, in their planning and zoning decisions, individual communities sometimes promote the size and type of housing that appears, on the face of it, to maximize local property values. Yet in many instances, local property values and economic growth in the aggregate region can often be enhanced by more-concerted and comprehensive regionwide consideration of access to transportation and jobs. Failure to plan transportation and land use regionwide can impede a critical asset of large cities, the close matching of specialized and skilled workers with the unique labor demands of diverse big-city employers.\n\nBut ready access and ample circulation is no less important for the city's less-skilled workforce. For example, high-income communities in the Chicago area sometimes use local land-use authority to exclude or impede higher density, more-affordable housing, often leading to broad sections of the metropolitan area that become overly segmented by income. In turn, this segmentation burdens the lower-income workers who have to make longer commutes, hurts everyone else due to the increased congestion, and increases the difficulty businesses face in attracting and retaining workers. The overall result is relatively slower growth in the regional economy.\n\nTraffic congestion rises along with longer commuting distances, thereby lowering the city's productivity. And as we all know, our auto and bus commuting times have increased significantly in recent years—I know my commute takes 10 to 15 minutes longer than it did when I started at the Chicago Fed in the mid-1990s. By one recent study, the average Chicago commuter spends 58 hours per year stuck in rush-hour delays, up from 42 hours in 1990. As a result of such disconnects between overly local decision making and the broader regional interests, the successful tables in large metropolitan areas are being set through broad discussions of how local land use affects the whole.\n\nBut for today's city that aspires to be globally successful, the benefits of maximum circulation of people go beyond timely and low-cost access from home to job. Physical access and contact play a large part in bringing about cultural acceptance and hopefully a productive blending of people and ideas in the commercial arena. In science and in commerce, so often the productive breakthrough and value generation comes about from the synthesis of diverse ideas and fields. Accordingly, large diverse cities such as Chicago are potentially advantaged in generating value-added in commerce. But potential will only give way to success if the region can productively bring about the abundant circulation and contact among its diverse peoples and ideas so that the scope of Chicago's innovation network can grow apace. The new ideas that propel today's economy are often borne of diverse viewpoints and cultures.\n\nWhile the Chicago economy has been transforming into a more information-based service economy, its planning challenges are sharpened by its having one large foot in its previous form—manufacturing and freight transportation. Both distribution and wholesaling activities remain outsized in the Chicago area. Recently, with heightened global trade from the Pacific Rim to the U.S., Chicago-area freight transportation has grown rapidly and is projected to continue to do so. And so, new opportunities will emerge as the Panama Canal has reached its maximum capacity, potentially channeling more freight overland across the U.S. and through and around the Chicago area.\n\nChicago's vast capabilities in this arena generate significant local income in its own right. A recent Metropolis 2020 study reports 37,000 jobs in Chicago's railroad freight industry alone. But in addition, Chicago's highly developed distribution system creates many more opportunities for additional manufacturing and distribution activity in both Chicago and the surrounding Midwest. As Chicago's historical development shows, access to freight often goes hand-in-hand with the ability to assemble and further process the content of that freight.\n\nHowever, as Chicago's economy shifts toward high-valued service production and away from freight-laden manufacturing, the value of Chicago's existing roadways to bring workers to and from their offices is rising in relation to their value for moving goods around and through Chicago. With only limited land and infrastructure, can the region realize the full scope of its opportunities?\n\nEven with some concerted and likely expensive actions to expand and reconfigure infrastructure, there does not appear to be room for all roadway and rail traffic. Building roadway capacity to serve all possible traffic is not an option. To do so would be too expensive in both construction costs and in taking up limited urban land. Yet given its lagging growth opportunities, the region will want to act to maximize its ability to handle as much freight and human traffic as possible. And so, in addition to some expansion of transportation capacity, the region will need to make difficult and judicious decisions on the most critical infrastructure to repair and build. So too, the region will need to engage in more efficient planning on the location of housing and commercial activity in order to economize on overall travel demand.\n\nTo be sure, more rational operational and pricing policies, which allocate existing transportation infrastructure, will also need to be adopted. Creative pricing policies that charge freight users for roads and rail can help to more effectively use our limited roadway capacity and allocate it toward its highest-value use. For example, the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority now charges higher road-use fees for trucks during peak traffic times in and around Chicago. At the same time, electronic payment of tolls helps to speed both cars and trucks through highway toll stations, and the CTA/Pace system has also successfully adopted electronic fare cards. Now, if only we could move further along to seamlessly include the Metra rail system in the electronic payments system! And as we do look ahead, to new and expanded payment technologies, we should also be expansive and strategic in our thinking. Because our travel and general purchases are also varied and geographically broad in scope, we do not want to end up with too many plastic cards and transponders in our overcoats and wallets.\n\nIn looking for further efficiency improvements in our payments systems, policy makers in the Chicago region should examine a host of models and experiments from around the world that are now pricing highway driving privileges for trucks and cars, often in combination with privatized ownership or operation of transportation infrastructure. The recently proposed federal budget includes grant funding for local experimentation on congestion pricing. Working with Metropolis 2020, the Chicago Fed will be examining ways to use pricing policies through various personal transit technologies at a conference to be held June 12 here in Chicago.\n\nThe Chicago metropolitan area is in the process of transforming itself from an industrial metropolis and a regional business service center into a global business capital. In this, Chicago cannot afford to lose its legacy of industry and freight, nor can it afford to take its eyes off its narrow path as an emergent city on the global network of information-intensive service industries. Chicago's performance in supporting these industries will depend not only on the quality and extent of its global connections, but also on its \"local\" or \"inside\" performance. That is, how well can the region provide its workers and businesses with opportunities for work, learning, and recreation?\n\nIn raising Chicago's performance to global standards, we come together here today in one of the many conversations that we will be having as a region going forward. With the initial impetus of the Metropolis Project and the recent foresight of the Illinois legislature, CMAP has been created to convene such conversations, collaborative efforts, and the way forward for the Chicago region. CMAP's specific charges are to integrate land use and transportation planning, identify and promote regional priorities, prepare a financial plan for transportation investments, and provide a policy framework for the billions of dollars spent each year on infrastructure and planning in the Chicago region. These are tall orders: to strike the right balance between the valued local autonomy—which helps to makes each of us an active and motivated citizen in our community—with the larger regionwide and global perspectives that make our local decisions truly useful and productive.\n\n*The views presented here are my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "Introduction\nWhen I look at the economy today, I find that many of the issues I was focused on toward the end of 2006 still apply, and my overall outlook is little changed. Continued weakness in the housing sector is holding back economic growth. But the economy outside of housing is on good footing, and I expect the pace of expansion in overall economic activity will move back up to trend. Solid job growth should support consumer spending; ample liquidity and profitable opportunities should sustain business investment; and strong growth outside the US should boost demand for our exports. My predominant concern remains the risks to the inflation outlook. We've seen some welcome easing in inflation in the past couple of months, and I'm hopeful this development will continue. But there is still the risk that resource pressures or other factors, such as elevated inflation expectations, could prevent actual inflation from falling in a timely fashion.\n\nSo today, I'd like to discuss in greater detail why I have these views on the economy.\n\nGrowth outlook\nLet's start with the outlook for overall economic growth. Real GDP—our broadest measure of economic output—increased at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the second quarter of the year and 2.0 percent in the third. We'll get the fourth quarter numbers at end of January—the latest private sector forecasts have GDP increasing at a 2.3 percent rate last quarter. These numbers compare with an average annual growth rate over the prior three years of 3.8 percent. So growth over the past nine months has been a good deal slower than over the previous few years.\n\nThe robust growth in those years in part was making up for ground lost due to the recession of 2001 and the sluggish start to the recovery. That catch-up process has run its course, and some of the slowdown in 2006 is part of the natural process of the economy shifting from a high-growth, recovery mode to one that puts growth on a more sustainable path for the longer run.\n\nLooking ahead, my baseline forecast is that GDP growth will pick up and over the next year or so will average a bit below its potential growth rate—where potential refers to the rate of growth the economy can maintain in the long run without generating increasing inflation pressure. Of course, that's an average—I do expect to see some volatility in the numbers.\n\nA number of factors should support growth. The first is the continued solid underlying trend in overall productivity, or output per hour of work. Productivity growth picked up from a 1-1/4 percent rate over the period between 1973 and 1995 to average about a 2-1/2 percent rate over the past ten years. Productivity gains should continue, as technology advances further, workers become more skilled in using technology, and managers find new ways to apply technology to their businesses. This will support continued growth in real income and profits. Next, the labor market is healthy. And lower prices for energy-related products have boosted the real purchasing power of households and businesses. Current financial conditions also are not particularly restrictive by historical norms; corporate balance sheets are in good shape, and there is ample liquidity in financial markets to support borrowing. Finally, the recent slowdown in GDP growth does not appear to have shaken business confidence, and the majority of the business people that I talk to remain optimistic about the outlook for the economy.\n\nIndeed, many sectors of the economy have been experiencing solid growth. Consumer expenditures—which represent about 2/3 of the spending in the economy—have held up quite well, increasing at an average annual rate of 3.6 percent through November. Though we are expecting more moderate growth ahead, business fixed investment rose at an average rate of 9.3 percent over the first three quarters of 2006, the strongest stretch of growth since before the 2001 recession. And our exports have increased 9 percent over that time, and further solid growth in countries outside the U.S. should continue to boost demand for our products.\n\nResidential investment\nBut the economy rarely expands evenly in all sectors at the same time. Other factors have restrained U.S. economic activity and caused growth to run below potential in recent quarters. The most notable is weakness in the housing sector.\n\nHousing starts had risen to a very high annual rate of 2.1 million units in the last quarter of 2005 but have since declined sharply, falling to a 1.5 million unit pace by the fall of last year. The level of residential investment—which includes both new construction and improvements—fell 7.7 percent over the second and third quarters of last year. In the third quarter alone home construction shaved 1.2 percentage points off of GDP growth. Additionally, home prices have been rising more slowly and by some measures have even declined. These developments raise important questions about the economy's growth prospects. But while I expect to see some further declines in residential construction, I do not think that the developments in housing markets will lead to more general economic weakness. One reason is that a number of positive longer-run fundamentals underpin housing demand and thus put a floor on how far residential construction will decline.\n\nSince the mid-1990s, the housing capital stock—which reflects the number of homes in the U.S. as well as their size and quality—has been growing about 3 percent per year on average. This is a very healthy growth rate by historical standards, particularly given demographics. Over the same time, the homeownership rate in the U.S. has increased from 64 percent to 69 percent in 2005. And homeownership rates are up across nearly all demographic groups and income categories.\n\nAn important factor supporting housing demand and homeownership is the increase in the underlying trend in productivity growth that occurred in the U.S. economy in the mid-1990s. This improved the long-run income prospects for Americans. Many people have put their money into bigger and better homes. Over the past decade, the size of a typical new home increased nearly 20 percent, and many homeowners invested in home improvements and renovations. Many middle-class homes now have bigger kitchens and more bathrooms, and it's not uncommon to see some with state-of-the-art media rooms.\n\nAnother factor supporting housing is that financial innovations have lowered borrowing costs and greatly increased access to credit. These innovations started in the 1980s and their momentum continued to build through the 1990s. Along with changes in the tax code that favored housing relative to other investments, they have increased the attractiveness of housing as an investment.\n\nOne financial innovation is securitization. Most single-family mortgage originations now are bundled together and sold as mortgage-backed securities, diversifying risk by pooling a large number of loans and investors. This lowers the risk premia built into mortgage rates.\n\nOther innovations, such as credit scoring, have increased the efficiency of mortgage origination. Automation also makes the process much less costly. In addition, homebuyers can now easily shop the internet for a wide range of competing mortgage brokers for the lowest interest rates and other terms. These changes have contributed to a drop in initial fees and charges on mortgages from about 2-1/2 percent in the mid-1980s to under 1/2 percent in recent years.\n\nFurther changes broadened the selection of loan types available to homeowners. Subprime mortgages, interest-only loans, and hybrid ARMs have opened up financing to borrowers who previously could not obtain it at all or could not borrow as much as they would like. True, these instruments are riskier than traditional mortgages. Still, to the extent that both borrowers and lenders understand the risks involved and markets have priced this risk properly, these instruments represent a net gain to society. Here there is a role for public policy. On the part of the Fed, we are supervising lenders with regard to the disclosure of terms and costs to borrowers and with regard to the risks of carrying such nonstandard loans on their books. We are also promoting financial literacy efforts for borrowers. At the Chicago Fed, we established Money Smart Week in Chicago, in partnership with local businesses, community groups, and government; and we're expanding the program to other parts of our District, including events in Iowa this year, from April 16 to 21.\n\nFinally, the financial environment underlying today's mortgage market is quite different from previous decades. Contrast today's environment with the 1960s and 1970s, when there were regulatory ceilings on interest rates, or with the early 1990s, when \"financial headwinds\" were restricting the supply of credit. These factors prevented some people from obtaining mortgages regardless of the interest rates they were willing to pay.\n\nThe pickup in productivity and financial innovations represent permanent improvements that support housing demand. Still, it is clear that the large gains in residential investment we experienced in the first half of this decade could not continue indefinitely. In order to satisfy the increased demand for housing, residential investment increased an average of 8-1/2 percent per year between 2001 and 2005. This surge was needed to build the new and bigger homes that people were demanding—that is, to boost the growth rate of the overall housing stock to 3 percent. But now that it has, residential investment growth can adjust back down to rates more in line with the trends in underlying housing demand. Moreover, underlying housing demand may slow to less than 3 percent, as demographic trends point to slower growth in household formation.\n\nIn addition, there is the issue of the large increases in house prices that we have seen over the past five years. In some cities in California, Florida, and Arizona, house price increases seem to have defied gravity. Here in the Midwest, price appreciation was more modest. The factors that caused fundamental increases in the demand for housing should be reflected to some degree in higher home prices. But prices in some locations likely have also been boosted by factors unrelated to longer-run fundamentals.\n\nSo all told, we at the Chicago Fed expect some further weakness in residential construction. But I do not expect a large spillover of the weakness to other sectors of the economy. Importantly, there has been concern that the unwinding of prices in some regions could result in negative wealth effects that would reduce consumption significantly. But we have not seen that—consumer spending has held up quite well.\n\nSustainable job growth\nOne reason that consumer spending has continued to grow at such a healthy rate is that labor markets remain vibrant, generating solid gains in real personal income. Over the past six months, employment has increased by an average of 160,000 per month. During the 1990s and early 2000s, we used to think that the monthly job growth that was sufficient to employ the net number of entrants into the labor force was about 150,000. So by this standard, the recent performance of labor markets has been slightly above average. But recent changes in demographics and cultural trends imply that this benchmark has likely moved down—we at the Chicago Fed think it's now closer to 100,000.\n\nThere are two reasons for this. First, growth in the working-age population has slowed. The working-age population grew rapidly in the 1960s and '70s, averaging 2 percent per year, as the baby boomers finished school and entered the labor force. But starting in the early 1980s, working-age population growth slowed to a little more than 1 percent per year. And it's projected to slow a bit further over the next decade, given the small size of the generation entering the workforce relative to the size of the retiring baby-boom group.\n\nSecond, the percentage of the population in the labor force—the labor force participation rate—has begun to decline. From the early 1960s until around 2000, the labor force participation rate increased steadily. More women chose to work outside the home, offsetting a slow decline in the fraction of men in the labor force. But now the increase in female labor force participation seems to have run its course, and more and more boomers are past the age at which people are most likely to participate in the workforce.\n\nTogether, the changes in population growth and labor force participation imply that about 100,000 new jobs per month are needed to employ new entrants to the labor force. So against this standard, the 160,000 per month job growth over the past six months is quite strong.\n\nNatural rate of unemployment\nLabor markets are also important for our views about inflation. In our dynamic economy, workers constantly move from one employer to another in response to changes in demand and technological innovations. Some of these job changes are voluntary, some are involuntary. Other workers lack the skills demanded by employers in their locales. Unfortunately, because it takes some time for workers to find new jobs, a certain level of unemployment is unavoidable. Economists refer to this level of unemployment as the \"natural rate of unemployment.\" Expansionary monetary policy cannot keep unemployment below this level on a sustained basis. Trying to do so only generates increasing inflationary pressures.\n\nWhen I joined the Chicago Fed in the mid-1990s, conventional thinking was that the natural rate of unemployment was around 6 percent. But since then, the unemployment rate has averaged 5 percent and inflation actually fell, averaging just 1.8 percent (as measured by the core PCE price index). So it is likely that the natural unemployment rate is lower than it was in the early 1990s.\n\nOne reason the natural rate may have fallen is that job search and the process of matching workers with jobs has become more efficient. In the 1990s, the wide use of fax machines and then email reduced the time needed to submit a resume or application to mere minutes. Numerous web sites now allow people to more quickly search and apply for jobs. Similarly, businesses can automatically search large databases of resumes and quickly screen applicants for desired qualifications. Who knows where this is heading? For instance, I read the other day that Google has its job applicants fill out an elaborate online survey, which asks all sorts of odd questions, such as whether you have a neat or messy work space, or even whether you have ever set a record in anything. They then use a complicated algorithm to sort through the answers to determine how well the job applicant would fit into its unique culture.\n\nThe very rapid growth of new employment practices, which some call just-in-time hiring, also likely played a role in lowering the natural rate of unemployment. Thanks to a number of developments, but particularly the rise of temporary help services firms, companies now have greater flexibility to adjust their work forces on short notice. Demographic changes are also in play. As the baby boomers acquired more working experience, their ability to find jobs improved. Experienced workers have more employable skills, know more about what jobs match their skills, and have a broader network to help them conduct a job search. The natural rate of unemployment for the entire economy should be lower because these experienced and relatively employable workers comprise a larger portion of the workforce. Other changes in the workforce, such as higher average education levels, may also have brought the natural rate down.\n\nIt is difficult to quantify the total impact of these demographic changes and the improvements in hiring and job search efficiency. In a recent survey of economists, most estimate that the natural rate of unemployment is between 4-1/2 and 5-1/2 percent—suggesting that it is a full percentage point lower than in the mid-1990s. In December, the unemployment rate was 4-1/2 percent, at the bottom of this range. This suggests that we need to be vigilant for the possibility of increases in inflationary pressures.\n\nInflation outlook\nOn the inflation front, core inflation—as measured by the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy—increased from 1.3 percent in the summer of 2003 to a recent high of 2.4 percent in October. In part, core inflation has been elevated because businesses have raised their prices in response to earlier increases in energy costs. High levels of resource utilization also have added more generally to inflationary pressures.\n  By my standards, inflation has been too high. I prefer to see it between 1 and 2 percent. The most recent news on inflation has been good, with the 12-month change in core PCE coming down from 2.4 percent in October to 2.2 percent in November. Looking ahead, core inflation likely will ease somewhat further. The deceleration in economic growth reduces somewhat the risk of sustained pressures from resource constraints. And the recent period of lower oil prices clearly is a positive factor.\n  Although the recent news has been favorable, risks to the inflation outlook remain. Additional cost shocks at this time would be unwelcome, or we could be wrong about reduced pressures from resource constraints. Long periods of high resource utilization are often associated with rising costs and prices. And today, as I mentioned, the unemployment rate is at the low end of the estimates for the natural rate. Growth in compensation per hour over the past year was not much higher than it was in 2004 and 2005. This measure includes benefits as well as wages and salaries. But unit labor costs have accelerated because of changes in productivity. Although the underlying trend is still solid, productivity growth over the past several quarters has moderated from exceptionally strong rates. And down the road, tight labor markets could generate some larger gains in compensation. However, profit margins are relatively high, so some further increases in labor costs could be absorbed by businesses in the form of lower margins.\n  Another risk to the inflation outlook would be if the recent positive news on inflation turns out to be transitory. Disappointing numbers on actual inflation rates could cause inflation expectations to run too high. If firms and workers expect inflation to be high, they will want to compensate by raising prices and wages or building in plans for automatic increases. In this way, high inflation expectations can lead to persistently high actual inflation.\n  So the summary on inflation is that the recent price data have been consistent with some easing in core inflation. The key going forward is whether that trend can be sustained and how quickly inflation will move back to the range that is commensurate with price stability. And we need to continue to be vigilant in monitoring the risks to the inflation outlook.\n\nConclusion\n In conclusion, I am optimistic about the fundamentals of the U.S. economy. Our nation believes in free markets and competition, is open to trade, and welcomes new technology. These core economic values promote and encourage innovations that create jobs, boost productivity, and raise our standard of living. We have all seen how innovations in technology work this way. But so do innovations in intangibles, such as those which enable us to more efficiently allocate, organize, and manage our productive resources. Not only does the U.S. economy do a good job developing computers, we do a good job in developing these intangible assets.\n  In the near term, we face some challenges from slowing residential investment and elevated inflation rates. But we have the ability to weather these challenges. Together with the Federal Reserve's commitment to its policy goals of sustainable growth and price stability, our nation's core economic values provide a solid foundation for the economy to expand over time.\n\n*The views presented here are my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "Introduction\n Thank you all so much for inviting me to be this year's Distinguished Speaker. It's fitting that I get to speak to you here in Chicago. The first time I spoke at an IRRA meeting, at the end of 1968, the meeting was held here in Chicago. My topic that day was \"Multilateral Bargaining in the Public Sector,\" with an emphasis on public education. It was my first big academic presentation, and Arnie Weber chaired the session. My coauthor, who is in the audience today, was Ken McLennan.\n\nHere we are in Chicago again. I'm happy to say that my background in labor economics has served me well in my current job as president of the Chicago Fed. Prices, wages, and inflation are key concerns for me now, just as they were in earlier periods in my career. In setting monetary policy, the Fed is charged with achieving both maximum sustainable growth and price stability. This is known as our dual mandate. Dual, of course, means two, but the Federal Reserve Act actually tells us to pursue three goals: price stability, maximum employment, and moderate interest rates.\n\nUsing labor market data to benchmark the economy\nAbout two-thirds of household income comes from employment income, and employment expenses make up about two-thirds of business costs. So the analysis of labor markets plays a key role in assessing the spending and growth prospects for the economy as well as cost pressures on inflation. The published labor statistics provide a great deal of information about national labor markets and how various sectors of the economy are performing. In addition, we supplement these published data by gathering an enormous amount of nonquantitative and anecdotal information throughout the country.\n\nOne thing we do is then compare these data to various benchmarks that describe an economy performing in a manner consistent with maximum sustainable growth and price stability. For example, we ask:\nIs employment growing at a pace consistent with maximum sustainable growth?\nIs the unemployment rate roughly in line with long-run sustainable levels?\nAnd are wages growing relative to productivity in a way that is consistent with price stability?\nAn important observation is that labor markets are constantly evolving, which can cause these benchmarks to change. The demographics of the workforce are constantly changing. New labor market institutions have altered the way firms hire, organize, and pay their employees. Monetary policy could go off track if we don't recognize the impact of such structural changes on the economy and the benchmarks we use to evaluate the incoming data. So today I would like to take a more detailed look at a number of these structural changes and how they have influenced some of our important benchmarks. And as I go through them, you'll see a recurring theme: research can provide us insights into the workings of labor markets that can be very valuable in making well-informed monetary policy decisions.\n\nMaximum sustainable growth\nLet's start with maximum sustainable growth, which we also refer to as potential output growth. This is the maximum rate of real growth the economy can maintain in the long run without leading to an increase in inflationary pressures. It reflects the growth in both the number of available workers and the productivity of those workers.\n\nIn order to estimate the number of available workers, we need to understand the underlying trends in population growth and labor force participation. This can be challenging, because these trends can change over time.\n\nFor instance, the working-age population grew rapidly in the 1960s and '70s, averaging two percent per year, as the baby boomers finished school and entered the labor force. But starting in the early 1980s, working-age population growth slowed to a little more than one percent per year. And it's projected to fall a bit further over the next decade, given the size of the younger generation entering the workforce relative to the size of the retiring baby-boom group.\n\nThe labor force participation rate is also changing. From the early 1960s until around 2000, the labor force participation rate increased steadily, as a rise in the fraction of women who work outside the home offset a slow decline in the fraction of men in the labor force.\n\nBut labor force participation declined a good deal during the recession of 2001 and has not returned to its previous levels. The reasons for the decline have been the subject of some debate. Some thought it was a sign of an economy that remained weak long after the official end of the recession. This interpretation assumed that many people who couldn't find work gave up looking and withdrew from the labor force.\n\nBut we at the Chicago Fed along with many other analysts take a different view. We now think that the decline in labor force participation was mainly a manifestation of some long-run changes in demographic and cultural trends.\n\nOne of the demographic trends relates to the aging baby boomers. There's a lot of focus on them approaching the traditional retirement age of 65, but people tend to scale back their participation well before that. Indeed, more and more boomers are past the age at which people are most likely to participate in the workforce.\n\nFurthermore, the increase in female labor force participation seems to have run its course. The women of my generation entered the labor force in greater numbers than the women of my mother's generation. And the women of my daughter's generation participate in greater numbers than the women of my generation. But these increases no longer appear to be occurring. It's likely that the women of my granddaughters' generation will participate at the same high rate as my daughter's generation.\n\nSo our view is that most of the decline in labor force participation that happened after 2000 was not due to a weak economy but instead to these long-run trends. Indeed, it seems very likely that it will continue to fall over the coming years.\n\nHow do these developments affect our benchmarks? Given the population growth and labor force participation rates that prevailed during the 1990s and early 2000s, the monthly job growth that was sufficient to provide jobs for the net number of entrants into the labor force was about 150,000. So this figure was an important benchmark to evaluate whether the economy was growing at a pace sustainable in the long run. The recent changes in population growth and labor force participation imply that we need to change our benchmark for employment growth to something more like 100,000 per month.\n\nThis change in the benchmark has only recently begun to be fully recognized by those who follow the economy on a day-to-day basis. And it has important implications for our view of recent labor market conditions. Job growth has averaged roughly 160,000 over the past six months. By the old standard, that would be just average, but given the current trends in the labor force, we view such growth as quite solid.\n\nI should say, however, that while 100,000 per month appears to be the right benchmark for the next year or two, there is a lot of uncertainty about this mark in the long run. Some of this uncertainty revolves around the future participation of the baby boomers. People are living longer, healthier lives; this may allow them to work until they are older. The women now nearing retirement age are the first generation to have worked outside the home as much as they did. Perhaps they will surprise us again by working longer than we think. Moreover, wages for all workers may change in response to these trends, convincing some to work more, others to work less, than they would otherwise. Of course, the proper benchmark depends on other factors as well, including growth in household wealth, the long-run health of Social Security and Medicare, and trends in fertility, life expectancy, and especially immigration. Major changes in our immigration policy, for instance, could have a big impact on the rate at which the workforce expands and, therefore, the estimate of employment growth consistent with sustainable economic growth. Research by labor economists can be used to improve the estimates of the effects of these factors on the growth in the labor force. This can help us better anticipate changes to our employment benchmarks in the future.\n\nAs I noted previously, the growth rate of potential output also depends on labor productivity. From 1973 to 1995, productivity growth averaged 1-1/2 percent per year, but since then it has averaged 2-1/2 percent per year. It's now evident that a significant pick-up in productivity growth occurred in the mid-'90s, but at the time, it was not clear how long lived the change would be. Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan was one of the first to assert that something long lasting was in train. By recognizing the persistence of the acceleration in productivity, we were able to successfully adjust monetary policy in a way that supported economic growth at a faster pace than many at the time thought was possible without generating higher inflation.\n\nThe step up in productivity growth owed a good deal to an increase in investment in computers and other information technology. But there is still a large unexplained component. My personal opinion is that much of this has to do with innovations in management practices. Part of this is intangible, and I believe that leadership improvements have made a big difference. People matter. But more observable measures of management quality have improved as well, and recent research suggests that these measures are related to higher productivity, profitability, sales growth, and firm survivability. Some of this improvement in management quality takes the form of better human resource practices, such as setting goals for employees that are realistic, transparent, and consistent; tracking and reviewing performance; and using better incentive systems that identify and reward ability and effort. Human resource experts have long studied such practices, and lots of great work has been done already, but even more is needed to understand their importance to the performance of economy-wide productivity.\n\nProductivity also depends on the quality of the workforce. The high education levels and greater experience of our aging population has contributed to our higher productivity rates of late. But that trend has already started to slow. It is estimated that in the late 1980s and early 1990s, improvements in worker skills were adding four-tenths of a percentage point per year to the growth of output. By the end of the 1990s, this had fallen to less than two-tenths of a percentage point, and we could soon see a decline to less than one-tenth of a percentage point, as the highly experienced workers of the baby boom generation retire in increasing numbers. Gains in education and other workforce skills by new entrants, and skill improvements by remaining workers, could allow us to avoid much of this decline. But if we consider recent education trends, I'd say we have our work cut out for us on this. College graduation rates are growing, as families have noted the very high and climbing economic returns to education. But high school completion rates have stalled, and there is a great deal of dissatisfaction with the results in our public elementary and secondary schools, especially given our already enormous investment in education. Clearly, more systemic changes are needed to achieve better educational outcomes and boost the growth in worker skills.\n\nThe slower growth of available workers and the rate at which trends in educational attainment and labor market experience add to those workers' productivity both imply slower growth in potential output. In the case of the former, the swing from an era in which labor force participation was growing around a tenth of a percent per year to one in which it is declining around two tenths percent per year implies a slowing in potential output growth. So do the slower improvements in the educational and experience composition of the labor force. Together, these suggest that the contribution of labor to potential output growth may have declined by a bit more than half a percentage point since the late 1990s.\n\nNatural rate of unemployment\nEmployment and productivity growth are not the only benchmarks we use to assess how the real economy is performing. We also try to gauge how the level of economic activity compares to its potential at any point in time. One way we do this is by comparing measures of resource utilization, such as the unemployment rate, to benchmarks consistent with potential output. We often refer to this unemployment benchmark as the natural rate of unemployment. Such assessments also play a role in our forecasts of inflation. Here, too, we face the challenge that our resource utilization benchmarks have been changing over time.\n\nIn the mid- to late-1990s, when I had been at the Chicago Fed for only a short time, one of the big questions was whether inflation would increase given the tightening labor market. The unemployment rate had fallen from 7-3/4 percent in 1992 to 5-1/2 percent in early 1995. Conventional thinking at the time was that the natural rate of unemployment was around six percent. So when unemployment went below that six percent level, a number of people worried that accelerating inflation was just around the corner. They thought that unless the Fed tightened policy, wages would start to increase at a faster rate than productivity and generate higher inflation.\n\nCertainly the threat to price stability was something the Fed took seriously. But we realized we had to be cautious in interpreting the data. This is because there were powerful undercurrents which could affect the level of unemployment consistent with potential output.\n\nNow it's tempting for me to cite the record since that time and simply claim vindication. The unemployment rate has averaged about five percent and core PCE inflation has averaged 1.8 percent since 1995. Most analysts have since revised their estimates of the natural unemployment rate, putting it in the range of five percent. But we live in an uncertain world, and policy makers always have incomplete information. This was particularly true back in 1995 because of the structural changes taking place. So it's important to revisit these developments, because they help shape our thinking about labor markets today and raise questions that, if answered, could help fine-tune our current estimates of the natural rate and potential output.\n\nOne reason the natural rate may have fallen is that job search and the process of matching workers with jobs has become more efficient. In the 1990s, the dissemination of fax machines and then email allowed a worker to submit a resume or application in minutes, rather than a day or two by mail. This dramatically reduced the time needed to apply for a new job. Numerous web sites now allow people to search for the jobs that meet their criteria and to almost instantaneously apply for multiple jobs; similarly, businesses can automatically search large databases of resumes and quickly screen applicants with the desired qualifications. Who knows where this is heading? For instance, I read the other day that Google has its job applicants fill out an elaborate online survey, which asks all sorts of odd questions, such as whether you have a neat or messy work space, or even whether you have ever set a record in anything. They then use a complicated algorithm to sort through the answers to determine how well the job applicant would fit into its unique culture.\n\nSimilarly, the very rapid growth of new employment practices, which some call just-in-time hiring, likely played a role in lowering the natural rate of unemployment. Thanks to a number of developments, but particularly the rise of temporary help services firms, companies now have greater flexibility to adjust their work forces on short notice. Twenty years ago, the temporary help industry was very small, representing only about one-half percent of nonfarm payroll employment. Since then, it has increased significantly and now is close to two percent of employment. At some firms, the majority of employees are temporary workers. Temps allow firms to easily vary the scale of their operations in response to actual changes in demand, rather than varying their workforce based on what they expect will happen to demand in the future. This could mean less labor hoarding during periods of slow economic activity.\n\nThese just-in-time hiring practices may even be part of the reason why the last two recessions were followed by prolonged periods of slow or nonexistent employment growth—what people have called jobless recoveries. In the early parts of a business expansion, there is typically a lot of uncertainty about its staying power. In such circumstances, firms may be reluctant to hire until they definitely need to. So the knowledge that there are readily available temp workers may have allowed firms to delay hiring longer than usual.\n\nFurthermore, relative to the 1980s, we now see many fewer short-term layoffs of regular workers. It seems pretty likely that some of this reduction is now showing up as variation in the number of temporary workers. Since temp agencies appear to be efficient at finding these workers new assignments, this trend is probably lowering overall unemployment rates.\n\nStill, the sum of these improvements in labor market hiring and job search efficiency continues to be difficult to quantify. One reason is that the U.S. did not have good data on job vacancies until the BLS's Job Openings and Labor Turnover series, or JOLTS, began in 2001. Without historical context, we don't know how to interpret a change in the JOLTS vacancy rate, such as the rise from 2.1 to 3.2 percent that we have seen since 2003. Is this typical for an expansion in which the unemployment rate has declined by 1.5 percentage points? Or is it a slower than usual increase, which would be a sign of increased labor market efficiency? We don't know right now. As we observe these data for a longer period of time, we will be able to use them to address such issues regarding labor market efficiency as well as many other interesting questions.\n\nAnother possible reason why inflation stayed under control in the late 1990s, despite what seemed at the time to be very tight labor markets, is that perhaps \"worker anxiety\" had caused employees to accept lower compensation packages. According to this theory, workers became more concerned about their job security in response to increased reports of layoffs and stories about jobs being eliminated. Former Chairman Greenspan speculated a number of times that this was a factor behind the more modest than expected wage pressures. These theories, which relate to the balance of bargaining power between labor and management, are hard to test. But certainly, the experts in this audience should have some further insights.\n\nThis issue may be pertinent again now. Up until a year or so ago, the increase in unit labor costs was running noticeably lower than in previous economic expansions. Some have speculated that this could be explained by an increase in worries about outsourcing, especially overseas, which has kept workers in a weak bargaining position.\n\nDemographic changes also are a factor in the decline in the natural rate of unemployment. As the baby boom generation acquired more working experience, their ability to find jobs improved. It happens to every generation. Experienced workers have more employable skills, know more about what jobs match their skills, and have built a broader network to help them conduct a job search. Since 1960, the unemployment rate for 25-34 year olds has been about two percentage points higher than the unemployment rate for 45-54 year olds, on average. In the late 1980s, about 15 percent of the labor force was 45-54. This share has since trended up and now appears to be peaking at 23 percent. In turn, the natural rate of unemployment for the entire economy should be lower because of the relatively higher employability of these workers, who now constitute a larger portion of the workforce. Other changes in the workforce, such as higher average education levels, increased incarceration rates, and greater use of the disability insurance program, may also have brought the natural rate down.\n\nWage growth\nOf course, in addressing our price stability mandate, we look carefully at data on labor costs. We monitor compensation trends and compare them against benchmarks. In particular, if wages rise faster than productivity for a prolonged period, the resulting persistent increases in unit labor costs can fuel price inflation. The words \"prolonged\" and \"persistent\" are important here. Real wages and productivity track each other closely over the long term but not necessarily over shorter periods. In other words, swings in the share of national income going to labor can last for a number of years.\n\nOne challenge is understanding what the various different wage measures are telling us about this dynamic process. Over the last several years, changes in compensation practices likely have caused these measures to send conflicting signals about labor costs. For example, the total compensation series, from the BLS's Employment Cost Index, has grown by roughly 3-1/2 percent per year over the last decade. Over the same time, the compensation per hour figure, based on the National Income and Product Accounts and reported in the BLS's productivity report, has grown by just over 4-1/2 percent per year. But in the decade and a half prior to 1996, each grew at nearly identical rates of around four percent per year.\n\nOne reason why the two series may have diverged is that pay practices have changed. The NIPA-based measure includes stock-option realizations and lump-sum bonuses, while the ECI total compensation measure does not. As you know, these and other forms of variable pay now have a more prominent role in compensation. Indeed, recent studies suggest that stock-option realizations account for about one-quarter to one-half of a percentage point per year of the growth in compensation per hour during the late 1990s. Stock-option realizations also add quite a bit of year-to-year variability in compensation that is tied to swings in the equity markets. Such movement might have little to do with labor market conditions at the time the options were granted.\n\nBecause variable pay is easier to change from year to year, it can reduce the degree of downward nominal wage rigidity in the economy. This may lessen inflation persistence by reducing the tendency for current wage increases to become locked in to firms' labor costs. Flexible wages also strengthen the tie between individuals' performance and pay. This can enhance aggregate economic performance by enabling labor markets to achieve a more efficient alignment of labor resources with their most valuable use.\n\nThe effects of new compensation practices are a fertile area for monetary-policy-relevant labor-market research. Knowing how such changes may have altered the relationships among current labor market conditions, compensation, and firms' pricing decisions would be very useful for improving our inflation forecasts. Those forecasts, of course, are key tools in the Federal Reserve's efforts to achieve its price stability mandate.\n\nConclusion\nSo to conclude, the changes we have seen in demographics and labor market institutions over the years mean that we must carefully and continually examine the assumptions that underlie the job-market benchmarks we use to gauge the performance of the economy. The achievement of our goals of sustainable growth and price stability is at stake. So, any help that you can give us in better understanding the dynamics behind employment, productivity, or wages is greatly appreciated. Thank you.\n\n*The views presented here are my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "Introduction\nFor over 50 years, the Futures Industry Association has been at the forefront of developments in derivative markets. And the city of Chicago has long been the global center of exchange-traded derivative activity. We all appreciate the critical role played by derivatives markets in the world economy, especially the use of derivatives to manage financial market risk. Risk management is always important, but that was made abundantly clear by recent developments in financial markets.\nThis is a good opportunity and event to share my thoughts about the role of public policy when faced with the sorts of financial turmoil we've experienced over the last few months. I'll start by discussing the recent market turmoil. I'll then turn to the role that financial innovation plays in such disruptions, and how I interpret these issues as I participate in policy discussions. I'll conclude with some thoughts about the likely future path of the economy, given the uncertainties about financial market developments going forward. My remarks this afternoon represent my own opinions, and do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or those of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nRecent Turmoil in Financial Markets\nThe year 2007 began with financial markets having substantial liquidity. In recent years, investors poured cash into U.S. capital markets and placed an unusually low price on risk. This state of affairs came to an end suddenly this summer. In response to increased default rates on subprime mortgages, risk avoidance rose sharply, and market participants reduced their perceived value of all financial instruments with subprime exposure.\nMarket participants then started to question the value of other complex securities. This could be seen in the market for asset-backed commercial paper—known as ABCP—where rates soared even for paper supported by assets unrelated to subprime mortgages. Many ABCP issuers and other borrowers had to turn to very short-term financing as lenders were unwilling to commit funds at normal terms because of uncertainty over collateral valuation and other counterparty risks. In addition, there were periods in August when markets in certain debt instruments virtually disappeared. Without actual market transactions, it became difficult to assess the fair value of the more complex securities.\n\nThe Link Between Financial Innovation and Financial Turmoil\nEconomic history has much to teach us about financial crises. Banking panics were common in the 19th and early 20th century. The Panic of 1907 was particularly severe, and ultimately led to the establishment of the Federal Reserve System six years later. And more recent episodes include the Penn Central commercial paper default in 1970, the stock market crash of 1987, and the disruption associated with the Russian default in 1998.\nLike the recent turmoil, each of these episodes had unique features. But there is an important common element to them—in each case, the event was associated with a drying up of liquidity. The most liquid assets are those that can be immediately used to discharge indebtedness: cash, bank reserves, and the like. When I say liquidity \"dries up,\" I mean that market participants find it increasingly difficult to convert otherwise sound assets into these more liquid media of exchange. This would be the case if lenders are unwilling to accept the illiquid assets as collateral, or if dealers in these assets substantially widen bid-ask spreads, or if transactions in these securities simply cease to occur.\nWhy do periods of financial stress occur periodically, and why is liquidity an integral part of these events? Surprisingly, innovation in financial markets can play an important role. Continuous innovation is one of the key strengths of our economy. And financial innovation enhances markets' ability to allocate capital and risk. But during periods of rapid financial innovation, it can take time for market participants to learn how these innovative instruments and practices operate, especially in the event of falling asset prices.\nTo elaborate on this theme a bit, think about a financial innovation—say, the development of some new type of derivative contract—that is introduced at a time when markets are expanding. The innovation performs well, and becomes widely used. And market participants look at this record of success when designing risk-management systems. Now suppose that something happens to stress the market. The new contract may interact with market forces in ways that are largely unexpected. The strategies that market participants had used to quantify and manage risk may not adequately encompass the events and interactions that are now taking place, making these risk-management strategies inadequate to address the unexpected developments. A natural response may be to pull back, conserve liquidity, and curtail trading in risky markets until the smoke clears. If market participants were to withdraw from risk-taking in this way, the result would be a liquidity crisis. Interestingly, there's a growing body of academic research that explores precisely this reaction—that when investors can't quantify a particular type of risk, they may respond by avoiding that risk entirely.1 \nRecent financial events seem to fit this narrative in many ways. The innovation behind the recent difficulties relates to the widespread use of the \"originate-to-distribute\" business model, in which mortgages are funded by selling them bundled together in highly structured securities. Of course, mortgages have been securitized for many years. But there are two features of this business model that are relatively new and that are particularly important for the current situation. The first is the extension of the originate-to-distribute model to subprime mortgages. Subprime mortgages represented only 8-1/2 percent of the mortgage-backed securities issued in 2000. By the end of 2006, this fraction had increased to 24 percent. The second feature is the increasing use of multiple layers of structure. For example, a mortgage originator may sell a portfolio of mortgages to an intermediary, which in turn divides the cash flow in different tranches. These tranched securities can be sold directly or can be combined with other securities to back instruments, such as ABCP, and so on. In all, there may be four or five layers between the original mortgage loans and the ultimate providers of funds.\nThe benefit of this complex structuring is that it accommodates different levels of risk tolerance on the part of different investors, thus allowing a wider range of funding sources. However, these multiple layers of structuring can be extremely opaque, making it more difficult for the ultimate providers of funds to assess the true level of risk they are taking on.\nThese innovations in housing finance had never been tested in a period of widespread weakness in housing markets. But during the recent declines in housing prices these structured securities behaved quite differently than they did during better times. For example, many investors assumed that the triple-A tranche of a subprime mortgage-backed security would act like a triple-A corporate bond, which carries little default risk. We now know that actual experiences were different. In fact, these highly rated mortgage-backed securities carry a good deal of risk, and are potentially subject to abrupt and unexpectedly large ratings downgrades. As a result, many market participants started calling into question the safety of whole classes of securities that had been highly rated by such techniques. For example, even the so-called super-senior tranches of collateralized debt obligations, thought to be extremely well insulated from losses, have recently been shunned by investors.\nIn addition, the complexity of the structured credit products used to finance mortgages made it difficult and costly for the ultimate investors to learn about the underwriting standards being applied to the original mortgages. There were few defaults during the long period of rising home prices, and investors paid little attention to the growing evidence of lax underwriting, such as high loan-to-value ratios, negative amortization, and deficient documentation. But when housing markets weakened, the consequences became apparent. Default rates on subprime loans rose far beyond those anticipated by the risk-management models commonly in use.\nHistory provides us with other examples of linkages between financial innovations and liquidity crises, and there are some interesting common elements between them and the current situation.2 Consider the unexpected bankruptcy in 1970 of Penn Central, a major railroad that was an important issuer of commercial paper. The Friday before its collapse, Penn Central was seen to be in financial trouble, but the company was expected to receive a government loan guarantee that would keep it afloat. Over the weekend, it became evident that no government support was forthcoming, and Penn Central declared bankruptcy. Investors woke up Monday morning with commercial paper that was essentially worthless. Penn Central's failure raised doubts about the integrity of the commercial paper market in general. A predictable flight to quality ensued: Treasury yields declined, and corporate debt yields rose.\nThe financial innovation in the Penn Central example was the use of commercial paper to substitute for bank loans. Commercial paper had become an important source of funds for large firms in the 1960s. But risk-management systems for commercial paper remained untested until the recession of 1969–70. The Penn Central bankruptcy was a rude awakening that these systems were inadequate.\nThe stock market crash of October 19, 1987, may also be associated with financial innovation. While there is no universally accepted explanation for the sharp drop, a widely held theory focuses on the innovation of portfolio insurance.3 Portfolio insurance is a form of computerized dynamic hedging that can involve automatic selling after certain market declines. Portfolio insurance implicitly relies on the availability of market liquidity—that is, the ability to sell shares at the prevailing price—when the automatic selling kicks in. Prior to October 1987, this innovation seemed to work well. But on October 19, liquidity was grossly inadequate. It appears that computerized selling into the declining market turned the morning's losses into a wholesale rout that was completely unforeseen by existing risk-management models. As with the Penn Central episode, a flight to quality followed, with Treasury yields falling dramatically.\nA third example is the market crisis in the fall of 1998 that was triggered by the Russian bond default. This shock caused bond spreads to widen in both emerging and developed countries and induced a major liquidity crisis. The financial innovation that magnified this shock was the growth of highly leveraged and opaque hedge funds, including Long Term Capital Management. The possibility that failing hedge funds would respond to falling market prices with a fire sale of available assets led intermediaries to withdraw liquidity from the market and reinforced the initial shock.\nIn each of these cases, markets eventually learned from the crises. This resulted in improved approaches to risk management that could address the new types of market risks. The commercial paper default of Mercury Financing in 1997 was much larger than Penn Central, yet caused virtually no disruption to the markets. Similarly, the 6 percent fall in stock prices that occurred on October 13, 1989, had nowhere near the impact of the market break two years earlier. Finally, the failure of the Amaranth hedge fund in 2006 was twice the size of LTCM's failure, yet this default was absorbed by the markets without turmoil.\nAnd there is reason to believe that market participants will learn from the current situation as well. Financial intermediaries are in the midst of re-evaluating the risk associated with structured securities in their portfolios. And as we have certainly been seeing over the last several weeks, this is not easy to do and will take some time to complete. But I expect that this process will eventually reduce the lack of transparency that lies at the heart of the current liquidity crisis and will lead to more resilient financial markets going forward.\n\nThe Role of the Fed in Response to Financial Disruptions\nUltimately, financial market participants have the strongest incentives to sort things out when a liquidity crisis hits. However, the Fed and other public policy institutions are involved in monitoring and facilitating efficient market functioning. Another role for the Federal Reserve is to foster policies that mitigate the possible fallout from the financial market to the broader macroeconomy. By this I mean that policy should account for how events might affect the attainment of our monetary policy objectives, which are to facilitate financial conditions that help the economy obtain both maximum sustainable growth and price stability.\nThe Fed has a number of tools at its disposal. First, through its authority as a bank supervisor, the Fed sets regulatory standards aimed at fostering the safety and soundness of the banking system. This process serves an important role during times of turmoil because well capitalized banks that have robust risk-management capabilities in place can act as critical bulwarks for financial markets. Second, the Fed operates Fedwire, which is one of the key large-value payment systems supporting financial markets. Periods of financial stress tend to be associated with a spike in payments volume, so ensuring that interbank payments are made in a safe, reliable, and timely fashion removes a potential source of uncertainty. Third, the Federal Reserve Banks work to mitigate the impact of adverse credit conditions in low- and moderate-income communities. In the recent subprime disruption, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago has joined with lenders, community leaders, and government officials to assist at-risk and delinquent borrowers who are confronting foreclosures.\nFinally, our most powerful tool for addressing a liquidity crisis is monetary policy. In setting the stance of monetary policy, the Fed has a dual mandate: to help foster maximum employment and price stability. Monetary policy is concerned with mitigating financial market stress to the extent that the stress impedes fulfillment of this dual mandate. Broadly speaking, I see our response to a financial shock as similar to our approach for responding to other shocks to the economy: We gauge the most likely effects of the shock on the future paths for economic activity and inflation; we discuss less likely but more costly alternative outcomes that we may want to insure against; and, based on this analysis, we adjust policy to best fulfill our dual mandate.\nWith regard to shocks to the financial system, our concern is about the ability of financial markets to carry out their core functions of efficiently allocating capital to its most productive uses and allocating risk to those market participants most willing to bear that risk. Well-functioning financial markets perform these tasks by discovering the valuations consistent with investors' thinking about the fundamental risks and returns to various assets. A widespread shortfall in liquidity could cause assets to trade at prices that do not reflect their fundamental values, impairing the ability of the market mechanism to efficiently allocate capital and risk. And reduced availability of credit could reduce both business investment and the purchases of consumer durables and housing by creditworthy households.\nWe clearly must be vigilant about these risks to economic growth. However, overly accommodative liquidity provision could endanger price stability, which is the second component of the dual mandate. After all, inflation is a monetary phenomenon. Indeed, one of the many reasons for the Fed's commitment to low and stable inflation is that inflation itself can destabilize financial markets. For example, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, high and variable inflation contributed to large fluctuations in both nominal and real interest rates.\nThe Fed has kept these various risks to growth and inflation in mind when responding to the financial turmoil this year. Importantly, we have taken a number of monetary policy actions to insure against the risk of costly contagion from financial markets to the real economy. On August 10, in response to a sharp rise in the demand for liquidity, the Fed injected $38 billion in reserves via open market trading. In one sense, this was a routine action to inject sufficient reserves to maintain the target federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent—the non-routine part was the size of the injection required to do so. (Indeed, this was the largest such injection since 9/11.) On August 16, with conditions having deteriorated further, the Federal Reserve Board, in consultation with the District Reserve Banks, moved to improve the functioning of money markets by cutting the discount rate by 50 basis points and extended the allowable term for discount window loans to 30 days. The Board also reiterated the Fed's policy that high-quality ABCP is acceptable collateral for borrowing at the discount window. At its regular meeting on September 18, the FOMC cut the federal funds rate 50 basis points and then lowered it another 25 basis points at its meeting in October. Related actions by the Board of Governors lowered the discount rate to 5 percent. Finally, just yesterday the Open Market Desk at the New York Fed announced that it will conduct longer-term repurchase agreements extending into January 2008 with an eye toward meeting additional liquidity needs in money markets.\nAfter the October moves, the FOMC press release noted: \"Today's action, combined with the policy action taken in September, should help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and promote moderate growth over time.\" The Committee also assessed that \"the upside risks to inflation roughly balanced the downside risks to growth.\" My reading of the data since then continues to support this risk assessment. As of today, I feel that the stance of monetary policy is consistent with achieving our dual mandate objectives and will help promote well-functioning financial markets. Indeed, the FOMC minutes released on November 20 included new information on economic projections for 2007-10. The committee will release updated projections four times a year. Both the range and central tendencies of these projections envision growth returning to potential in 2009 and 2010, and inflation being within ranges that many members view as consistent with price stability.\n\nThe Outlook Going Forward\nOf course, there is still a good deal of uncertainty over how events will play out over time, and we are monitoring conditions closely for developments that may change our assessments of the risks to growth and inflation. A number of major financial intermediaries have recently announced substantial losses, and housing markets are still weak and will continue to struggle next year. Home sales and new construction fell sharply last quarter, and prices softened. The only data we have on home building for the current quarter are housing starts and permits: These came in well below average in October. But these weak data were not a surprise — our forecast is looking for another large decline in residential construction this quarter.\nOutside of the financial sector and housing, the rest of the economy appears to have weathered the turmoil relatively well. The first estimate of real GDP growth in the third quarter was a quite solid 3.9 percent, and private market economists think the revised number that will be released on Thursday will be close to 5 percent. So the economy entered the fourth quarter with healthy momentum.\nHowever, our forecast is for relatively soft GDP growth in the current quarter. Private sector forecasts seem to be in the 1 to 2 percent range. And, not surprisingly, we have seen some sluggish indicators consistent with this outlook. Our Chicago Fed National Activity Index suggested that growth in October was well below potential. As I just mentioned, the housing numbers point to another large drag from residential investment. Manufacturing output has fallen in two of the past three months. Consumption—by far the largest component of spending—grew at a solid rate in the third quarter, but in October, motor vehicle sales changed little and sales at other retailers also posted pretty flat numbers. Consumer sentiment also is down. But we have also received positive news. Forward-looking indicators point to further increases in business investment and continued strength in exports. Importantly, the job market remains healthy—nonfarm payrolls increased 166,000 in October. Over the past four months, job growth has averaged about 115,000 per month, down from the 150,000 pace over the first half of the year, but still in line with demographic trends and an economy growing at potential. This is a key fundamental supporting the forecast because gains in employment lead to gains in income, which in turn support gains in consumer spending going forward.\nLooking beyond the current quarter, our baseline forecast is for growth recovering as we move through next year. In particular, we expect that later in 2008 economic growth will move close to its current potential, which we at the Chicago Fed see as being slightly above 2-1/2 percent per year. Now this pace for potential output growth is lower than during the 1995-2003 period. But it still includes a healthy trend in productivity growth relative to longer-term historical standards. Of course, productivity growth is a key factor supporting job growth, and with it income creation and increases in household expenditures; it also underlies the profitability of business spending. Solid demand for our exports should continue to be a plus for the economy. And we do not think residential investment will make as large of a negative contribution to overall growth as it did in 2006 and 2007.\nThere is still a good deal of uncertainty about this forecast. We can't rule out the possibility of continued market difficulties. We can't be sure how long it will take for financial intermediaries to complete the process of re-evaluating the risks in their portfolios. And many subprime adjustable rate mortgages will see their rates climb over the next few months—a process that could feed back on to housing and financial markets. But developments could surprise us on the upside as well. The real economy has proven to be resilient to a host of serious shocks over the past twenty years. Indeed, think back to the concerns we had in 1998 about a fallout on the real economy from the financial crisis associated with the Russian default and LTCM. In fact, real GDP grew 4.7 percent in 1999, a pretty strong pace by any standard.\nWith regard to inflation, the latest numbers have been encouraging. The 12-month change in core PCE prices remained at 1-3/4 percent in September. We do not have the PCE index for September yet, but the CPI data for October showed a moderate increase in core prices. Of course, higher food and energy prices have boosted the top-line inflation numbers, and the overall PCE prices have risen nearly 2-1/2 percent over the past year. At present, my outlook is for core PCE inflation to be in the range of 1-1/2 to 2 percent in 2008-09, and for total PCE inflation to come down and be roughly in line with the core rate. Relative to our outlook six months ago, this is a favorable development.\nThere are both upside and downside risks to this inflation forecast. With no appreciable slack in resource markets, cost pressures from higher unit labor costs, energy, or import prices could show through to the top-line inflation numbers. However, weaker economic activity would tend to offset these factors.\n\nConcluding remarks\n Given the uncertainties about how financial conditions might evolve and affect the real economy, policy naturally tends to emphasize risk-management approaches. That is, the Fed must adjust the stance of policy to guard against the risk of events that may have low probability but, if they did occur, would present an especially notable threat to sustainable growth or price stability. Such risk management was an important consideration in the monetary policy reactions to the current financial situation that I talked about a few minutes ago. But while the risk is still present of notably weaker-than-expected overall economic activity, given the policy insurance we have put in place I don't see this as likely. As always, our focus will continue to be to foster maximum sustainable growth while maintaining price stability.\n\nNotes\n1 See Gilboa, I., and D.

            "content": "Introduction\nIt really is a pleasure for me to be here at an event cosponsored by the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business and the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago has benefited greatly from so many of the relationships it has established over the years with the GSB and the Council. Working together with the academic, business, and policy communities of this city, we have been able to address important economic issues at forums like this one. My being here tonight is an excellent example of just that, and I am delighted to have this venue serve as my first public speaking event since becoming President and CEO of the Chicago Fed on September 1.\n\nI would like to emphasize that my comments today are my views and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n  Though I have been President for only two months, I have had the remarkably useful experience of attending FOMC meetings since 1995 — first as a senior staffer and since 2003 as the Bank's Research Director. Over these past 12 years, I have observed the Committee make policy during a variety of interesting and challenging economic and financial periods. And most of my research career has involved studying monetary policy decision-making and its effects on the economy. Indeed, I first met then Professor Ben Bernanke at a research conference where we both presented papers on monetary economics. It shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone that I expect to draw on these experiences in my participation at FOMC meetings.\n  Since this is my first speech as President, I will first take some time to provide background on how I approach the analysis of monetary policy decision-making. I will then discuss current economic conditions.\n\nPutting the Current Policy Decision in a Broader Context\nOver the past 10 years we have witnessed a number of very different kinds of developments and shocks to the economy — the acceleration in worker productivity, the emerging market debt crises in 1997-98, the high-tech boom and bust at the turn of the century, and the tragic events of September 11, to name a few. Seeing the Committee make decisions when faced with such events emphasized to me that no matter how unique or uncertain the situation may seem, it is important to view the current policy decision in the broader context of our efforts to achieve maximum employment and price stability. These, of course, are the dual mandates of the Federal Reserve when conducting monetary policy for the United States.\n  Let me take a few moments to discuss how I go about putting policy decisions into this broader perspective. Specifically, I'd like to talk about three kinds of considerations that I think are always important for coming to a sound policy decision. The first is the most obvious: our need to assess the general condition of the economy—both in terms of its underlying structure and its current cyclical performance. Such an assessment helps us to understand how the particular events we are experiencing will work their way through the economic system to influence growth and inflation over the coming quarters and years. The second set of considerations concerns the stance of monetary policy. Specifically, it's always important to ask where the federal funds rate stands relative to some concept of a neutral rate and how the resulting degree of accommodation or restriction will influence the achievement of our dual mandate. The final category of considerations has to do with the degree of uncertainty that we face with regard to both the state of the economy and the effects of policy. At times we may need to adopt a risk management approach to policy—that is, adjust the stance of policy to guard against the risk of events that may not be in our baseline projection but, if they did occur, would present an especially notable threat to sustainable growth or price stability. Often such policy adjustments can be described as pre-emptive, in the sense that they reduce the odds of the more adverse outcome occurring.\n  1. The Structure of the Economy\n\nThe first issue deals with initial economic conditions and the dynamic structure of the U.S. economy. When the economic climate shifts and policy is adjusted, the ultimate effect on output and inflation depends on how various economic players and markets work and interact with one another, how prices adjust to re-direct resources, the rate at which technology progresses, and a myriad of other structural characteristics of the economy. The influence of an unexpected shock also depends on how shorter-term cyclical conditions compare with our policy goals; that is, how much resource slack is present in the economy and where the outlook for inflation is relative to price stability. Our broader policy analysis has to account for both the structural and cyclical factors.\n  One longer-run structural feature to consider is the fact that since the mid-1980s fluctuations in aggregate output have been a good deal smaller than they were earlier in the post-war period. Recessions have been less severe, there has been less commonality in fluctuations across industries, and inflation has been lower and less volatile. The U.S. has been in what economists refer to as \"The Great Moderation.\" We do not have a complete explanation for what caused the Great Moderation. Some research points to smaller shocks, suggesting the U.S. economy has enjoyed a bit of good fortune. Other studies emphasize improved control over inventories, and some analyses give a role to financial market innovations that allow for more efficient allocation of financing and better risk sharing. These and other such structural developments suggest that the economy's natural shock absorbers may operate better today, supporting the conclusion that the U.S. economy has become more resilient. Accordingly, the outlook on which we base our policy decision should account for the likelihood that a given economic event might result in smaller and less persistent fluctuations in output and inflation.\n  There also is an interplay between the reaction of policy to events, the increased resiliency of the economy, and where we stand relative to our policy goals. Let me give you a couple of historical examples. Think about the oil shocks in the 1970s. These hit when inflation pressures already had been rising. Furthermore, around the same time there had been a decline in the rate of sustainable economic growth.\nThis change and its inflationary implications were not well recognized at the time. Looking back, we think now that part of the slower growth reflected inflexibilities that made it difficult for many industries to adjust to higher energy prices. The ultimate outcome was a deep recession in 1973-75 and soaring inflation. Eventually, the Volcker Fed had to implement highly restrictive and costly policies to bring inflation down. In contrast, when oil prices began increasing in 2004, core PCE inflation was just 1-1/2 percent, the underlying trend in productivity was relatively solid, and the energy efficiency of the economy was much better than during the 1970s. One reason the economy performed better is that the shock was smaller. But it also is the case that the shock hit a more flexible economy that was performing well. Together, these meant that overall growth was better maintained and only a modest policy adjustment was necessary to check the pass-through of energy costs to the trend in inflation.\n  2. Where Policy Stands Relative to a Neutral Rate\n\nNow let's turn to the second issue — assessing the stance of policy. At any particular FOMC meeting, after reviewing the economic and financial situation, the discussion turns to the policy decision. For me, this requires focusing on longer-run benchmarks, in particular, where the current fed funds rate is relative to a conceptual, neutral setting for policy. By a neutral funds rate, I mean the rate that is consistent with an economy operating along its potential growth path and with stable inflation. I will readily admit that there is a great deal of uncertainty about measuring this neutral rate. Still, with appropriate caveats, the neutral fed funds rate is a useful benchmark. One reason why John Taylor's research on monetary policy rules has been so useful is because the Taylor rule casts the prescriptions for the funds rate against such a benchmark. Rates above neutral tend to restrict aggregate demand, and rates below neutral are accommodative. At any point in time, if we simply look at the decision to raise, lower, or leave unchanged the fed funds rate, then we lose perspective on the overall stance of policy. This is a relatively obvious point, but one that bears emphasizing: Hypothetically, when policymakers raise the funds rate and it remains below the neutral rate, then, on net, policy still is accommodative. Indeed, this was the case in late 2004 and 2005.\n  There are a number of determinants of the neutral rate. One important determinant is productivity. With higher productivity growth, the return to investment is higher, and a higher neutral interest rate is necessary to equilibrate capital market flows and aggregate demand and supply. Another key determinant is the expected inflation rate. In order to induce savers to forego consumption, they must be compensated for any loss in purchasing power over time due to rising prices. So a higher expected inflation rate translates into a higher neutral federal funds rate.\n  This brief description is obviously not complete. First, we do not have an exact estimate of the neutral rate. It depends on factors that we cannot observe directly — for example, the structural long-run trend in the rate of productivity growth and inflation expectations. We thus turn to statistical estimates and indirect measures, which by their very nature are imprecise. Second, the neutral rate can change over time as its components change, and it is often difficult to ascertain these movements until well after the fact. Consider, for example, how hard it was to discern the permanence of the productivity increase in the second half of the 1990s. Third, the degree of accommodation represented by the gap between the actual and neutral funds rate is only one factor affecting the amount of liquidity that is ultimately influencing economic activity and inflation. Other financial circumstances can work to offset or exaggerate the impulse from policy, and these can change dramatically over time — as we have witnessed recently with the swing in credit market conditions. And, as if this wasn't tough enough, quantifying the net impact of financial conditions on the economy is technically challenging.\n  3. Acknowledging Uncertainties\n\nThese caveats about the neutral fed funds rate and the stance of policy also relate to the third element of my broader view towards policy; that is, the importance of recognizing and respecting the uncertainty and related risks we face when making policy decisions. This uncertainty is large. Indeed, it is somewhat amusing how often we are tempted to say that things are more uncertain today than they usually are. Well, if we think this so often, it can't be very unusual. A myriad of factors can and do regularly generate substantial uncertainties about the outlook for the economy — think of the list I gave earlier: the productivity acceleration, the emerging market debt crisis, the high-tech boom and bust, and September 11 and its aftermath. So a key aspect of policymaking is understanding when uncertainties are especially large, identifying associated risks to the forecast, and assessing the implications of these risks for achieving price stability and maximum sustainable growth.\n  Some risks relate to possible events or extreme macroeconomic outcomes that are not very likely to occur, but whose cost in terms of output or inflation could be quite large. In such cases, it is prudent to adjust policy to be more or less accommodative than we otherwise would as insurance against the highly adverse outcome. These are the risk management or pre-emptive views of policy I mentioned earlier, and they are a common component in central bankers' strategies. But if the extreme event does not occur or its influence subsides quickly, then it is incumbent upon policymakers to recalibrate policy — and to do so from a baseline that accounts for how the additional insurance put into the system affects the outlook for growth and inflation.\n  A different, and more typical, set of risks relates to where our forecast stands relative to our longer-run policy goals — for example, whether growth will be significantly above or below its sustainable rate and whether inflation will be too high or too low. And it is interesting that we are finally operating in a world with two-sided inflation risks — we thought it was too high in early 2007 at 2-1/2 percent, but that it is was too low in 2003 when, according to the data published at the time, it fell below 1 percent.\n\nBackground for the Current Outlook\nNow that I have provided some background for how I approach monetary policy issues, I will turn to the current outlook and policy situation. In doing so, I will discuss it in terms of the structural and cyclical characteristics of the economy, the stance of policy relative to neutrality, and the uncertainties we are facing in the policy decision.\n  A good place to start the discussion is with the situation at midyear before the recent disruptions in credit markets. At the Chicago Fed, we expected that the contraction in residential construction would likely restrain overall activity for a while longer, but that this restraint would abate as we moved through next year. Indeed, outside of housing, the economy has been performing fairly well: Over the previous year and a half, declines in residential investment reduced real GDP growth by about 3/4 percentage point, but the rest of the economy increased at a solid 3-1/4 percent rate. Overall, we were expecting average GDP growth in the second half of 2007 to be somewhat below potential — which we then thought was just slightly under 3 percent — but that growth would return to potential as we moved through 2008.\n  Our June projection looked for the unemployment rate to rise from 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent by the end of 2008. Of course, 4-3/4 percent is a historically low value for the unemployment rate. This and other evidence suggested some risk of resource pressures showing through to inflation. Indeed, while core inflation had come down from early in the year, we were concerned that some of that drop might prove to be transitory. As a result, our June forecast was for core inflation to run around 2 percent — about the same as its pace over the previous year, but higher than the rate we had seen in the more recent months.\n  At the time, the funds rate was 5-1/4 percent, and market participants were expecting little change in the rate over the projection period. Back in June, a 5-1/4 percent funds rate probably was a bit above what I considered neutral. Although, given the caveats I discussed earlier, there was a healthy dose of uncertainly around this assessment. In my opinion, this restrictive stance for policy attempted to balance several factors. Importantly, financing conditions for most firms were still highly favorable. Notably, most risk premia remained quite low and many buyout deals were being done without typical loan covenants and other forms of credit protection. So there was a risk that these factors made overall financial conditions more accommodative than suggested by the funds rate alone. When combined with the risk to inflation from resource pressures, this suggested to me that a slightly restrictive funds rate was useful to mitigate potential inflationary risks.\n  However, as events unfolded in July, before the August turmoil in the credit markets, new information pointed to a reduction in the neutral fed funds rate, which meant that the stance of policy had become more restrictive.\n  The first factor lowering the equilibrium funds rate had to do with information revealed with the annual revisions to the national income accounts that were released in late July. These revisions included lower estimates for GDP. These helped reduce uncertainty about an important question — namely, the possibility that there had been some decline in the underlying trend growth in productivity since the first half of the decade. This factor also tends to signal higher unit labor costs and inflationary pressures. However, on balance, we in Chicago were impressed that the improvements in core inflation that we had seen earlier in the year seemed to be more persistent than we had initially thought. This caused us to adjust down our forecast for inflation in 2008-09. The lower estimate for trend productivity growth and the lower inflation forecast both pointed to a somewhat lower neutral funds rate. Hence, these factors suggested that the stance of policy was more restrictive than I believed in June.\n\nThe Financial Turmoil of August\nThen came the financial turmoil in August. In light of the substantial increase in default rates on sub-prime mortgages, market participants substantially reduced the perceived value of all kinds of debt instruments backed by subprime mortgages. The resulting losses on balance sheets greatly reduced the amount of leverage that could be supported by these assets, and a period of de-leveraging began. In addition, market participants began to question the value of other complex securities. And, in general, many borrowers had to turn to shorter-term financing as lenders were unwilling to commit funds at term because of uncertainty over the valuation of collateral, potential needs for liquidity, and counterparty risks. Liquidity became scarce — as evidenced, for example, by large increases in spreads between overnight and term financing rates.\nIt is important to remember, however, that many financial markets have continued functioning without any problems. Highly rated corporate borrowers have had little trouble issuing bonds at favorable rates, and banks continue to lend to sound businesses. Indeed, although the cost of funding to some borrowers might be higher, we have not heard widespread reports of businesses being unable to finance working capital or longer-run capital expenditures.\nNevertheless, financial conditions in private credit markets are clearly more restrictive than they were a couple of months ago. In my opinion, it was no longer appropriate for monetary policy to include a slight degree of policy restraint to lean against the risks posed by low risk-pricing in financial markets. Those risks had receded. And, importantly, they had done so against the backdrop of a more favorable inflation outlook and a lower neutral rate.\n\nUncertainty and Risk Management in the Current Environment\nAs I mentioned at the start of my talk, policymakers need to take account of the uncertainty that they face and tailor policy in a way to best manage the risks to sustainable growth and price stability imposed by those uncertainties.\n  The gyrations in financial markets add a number of uncertainties to the outlook. Currently, market participants are in the process of reassessing credit exposures and establishing new risk pricing standards. There is uncertainty regarding how long this process will last and where it might take us. Indeed, developments in the last week reinforce this. Many market participants did not have a good idea of the credit risk associated with the opaque assets that they had purchased. For example, some investors may have assumed that a triple-A tranche of a sub-prime mortgage-backed security carried little default risk. They now know this assumption was wrong. This affects both how investors value their own books and how they assess the repayment abilities of counterparties who have been holding such assets to finance future transactions. So firms must now sift through their books and reassess the risks associated with the securities they are holding. This process is not easy: In some cases the instruments are quite complex, making it hard to identify the riskiness of the actual cash flows supporting the securities.\n  Ultimately, with more diligent and improved risk assessments, price discovery will go forward. The market mechanism will produce new prices at which participants are willing to trade risky assets. Continued improvements in trading will occur, albeit at values that more appropriately reflect the underlying credit and counterparty risks. But what the path to this new risk pricing will look like is still uncertain.\n  Another uncertainty surrounds the impact of the change in credit conditions on real economic activity. Some firms likely are facing higher costs and less favorable terms. At least to date, however, we do not seem to be seeing an impact on capital spending. Similarly, consumer credit conditions have not changed much in response to the financial turmoil. But the demand for housing has been further reduced because the inability to securitize non-conforming mortgages has contributed to a large cutback in such originations, particularly for sub-prime loans.\n  To me, the uncertainties about how financial conditions might evolve and affect the real economy mean that risk management considerations have an important role in the current policy environment. The cutback in nonconforming mortgage originations and the continued high level of inventories of unsold homes will result in further weakness in housing markets. Under one scenario, the effects on overall growth will be fairly isolated to declines in residential construction — similar to our experience in 2006 and early 2007. However, there is a less benign possibility.\n Housing demand and prices could weaken a good deal more than we expect — either because a new shock hits the sector or because we have underestimated the weakness already in train. A more pronounced downturn could weigh more heavily on consumer spending. In addition, further delinquencies and foreclosures could add to the problems with mortgage-backed securities. This, in turn, could generate further adverse effects on financial conditions that support economic activity.\n Together, such events would pose a more serious downside risk to growth.\n  I want to emphasize that I do not see this extreme outcome as likely. But it is one of those high cost outcomes that we should guard against. The challenge is to calibrate the insurance in light of the lower probability of the spillover event occurring. Furthermore, if in fact the more likely scenario unfolds in which conditions improve and risks recede, then policy should be prepared to respond to any developments that threaten the inflation outlook.\n  Indeed, not all of the risks to the economic outlook are on the downside. The effects of financial difficulties on real activity are hard to predict. For example, recall 1998, when concerns about the fallout of the Russian default on other emerging market debt and the difficulties related to LTCM led to a freezing of activity in certain financial markets. Despite all of the concerns about how this might affect economic activity, in 1999 real GDP ended up growing 4.7 percent and significant resource pressures emerged.\n  Returning to the current situation, the process of assessing credit exposure appears to be well underway and a number of large financial institutions already have reported losses on their books. There is also some evidence suggesting that investors are more willing to differentiate between commercial paper issuers based on the quality of the underlying assets. Markets also have become somewhat more receptive to high-yield issues and to term lending. In addition, term premia in markets where liquidity was impaired have come down, though they remain above levels that prevailed in late July. There still is a way to go. Improvements are not uniform, and risks remain. However, markets are functioning better than they were two months ago.\n\nThe Outlook and the Policy Picture Going Forward\nPutting all of this information together, our baseline forecast sees soft economic activity this fall; notably, it is likely that a further sharp decline in residential investment will weigh on the top-line growth numbers. But we see growth recovering next year and moving up to average close to potential later in 2008, which we at the Chicago Fed currently see as being somewhat above 2-1/2 percent. This lower potential number in part reflects an assumed trend in productivity growth that is slower than the trend we experienced over the 1995-2003 period. Nonetheless, the new productivity trend is still a healthy one by longer-term historical standards and, accordingly, should support income creation, job growth, and household and business spending. Solid demand for our exports should also be a plus for growth. Although we expect a small increase in the unemployment rate, labor markets in general should remain healthy.\n  Indeed, on balance, I would characterize the data we have received on the real economy since the last FOMC meeting as supporting our baseline forecast. True, housing markets have tumbled further — sales fell sharply in August, new construction dropped a good deal further in August and September, and prices have softened. But the rest of the economy appears to be moving forward. Sales at automotive dealers and other retailers posted good numbers (in real terms) in August and September, indicators point to further increases in business investment, and industrial production has continued to rise. Importantly, according to the revised data, nonfarm payrolls increased an average of about a 100,000 per month rate in August and September — a pace we think is in line with demographic trends and an economy growing at potential.\n  With regard to inflation, we do not see any large movement one way or the other from current levels of core price inflation. Here the risks seem two-sided. With no appreciable slack in resource markets, cost pressures from higher unit labor costs, energy, or import prices could show through to the top-line inflation numbers. However, weaker economic activity would tend to mitigate the potential for this.\n  The latest numbers on inflation have been positive. The 12-month change in core PCE prices remained at 1-3/4 percent in August. We do not have the PCE index for September yet, but the CPI data for September that were released last week showed a moderate increase in core prices. At present, my outlook is for core PCE inflation to be in the range of 1-1/2 to 2 percent in 2008-09. Relative to our outlook six months ago, this is a favorable development.\n\nConclusion\nLooking ahead, we will need to monitor developments regarding the outlook for both growth and inflation quite carefully. We will have our eyes open for the downside risks that I mentioned earlier. Events also could transpire that cause us to boost our growth projection. In addition, we cannot afford to be lax on the inflation front. Although I am optimistic about the chances for further inflation improvements, I would see any increase in inflation or inflation expectations from their current levels as a serious concern.\n  Over time, the current set of uncertainties and risks will fade. However, others will take their place — some will appear to be new and unique, and some we will have faced before. In any event, my views on monetary policy will depend on my outlook for the economy, the risks and uncertainties embedded in the forecast, and how these relate to the achievement of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate for maximum sustainable growth and price stability.\n\n*The views presented here are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you, Doug [Chaffin, president and CEO of Monroe Bank & Trust] for that introduction. And thanks to the Michigan Bankers Association for inviting me to speak today. I'm delighted to be here to share my thoughts on the economy during this challenging period. I'd like to also say a special thank you to Mike Magee, who unfortunately could not join us today. Mike is a member of the board of directors of the Detroit Branch of the Chicago Fed. As a board member, he provides us with valuable information on the regional business outlook and credit conditions. This information not only helps us gauge the local economies within the Seventh District but also contributes to our understanding of developments in the national economy. As such, it is an important input into my thinking about the course of the economy and the appropriate course for monetary policy.\nToday I will discuss the recent events in financial markets and the Federal Reserve's responses to them. I will also give you my take on the current economic outlook. As always, these are my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nLet me begin with the financial crisis.\n\nEarly Stages of the Financial Crisis\nOver the past year and a half we have witnessed the deteriorating performance of mortgages and a broad array of mortgage-backed securities—some of which, as you know, are highly structured instruments with opaque risk profiles. The problems in mortgages have spilled over to other segments of our financial markets. Market participants have reassessed the risk profiles of other complex securities, and the prices of these assets have declined as well. This cascading process of re-pricing has had a detrimental impact on the liquidity and capital positions of a wide range of financial institutions in the United States and around the world.\nThe resulting disruptions to financial markets have made credit more costly and more difficult to obtain for many households and businesses. Banks are reluctant to lend even to one another because of concerns over counterparty risk, the desire to preserve liquidity, and limited balance sheet capacity. This has resulted in large increases between the London interbank offered rate, or LIBOR, and the federal funds rate. LIBOR, of course, is a common benchmark for the interest rate charged on short-term interbank lending. Many banks set their interest rates on loans to households and businesses as a markup over their cost of funds, as measured by LIBOR. Increases in LIBOR, no doubt, have translated into higher borrowing rates for those of you operating a business today. Before this financial turmoil began, the 30-day LIBOR typically hovered about 10 basis points above the level of the fed funds rate that would be expected to prevail over the term of the loan. Since the summer of 2007 the spread has risen substantially, averaging about 50 basis points between August 2007 and August 2008, with a couple of spikes to about 1 percent.\nStrains on financial institutions have also spilled over to other markets, like that for commercial paper. Because of concerns over their ability to meet future payments, some financial services firms have had difficulty rolling over commercial paper. They have seen their costs of issuing paper rise substantially. These difficulties are also affecting the availability and cost of commercial paper funding to nonfinancial firms. Nonfinancial firms often issue commercial paper to fund regular operations such as meeting payrolls and buying materials. In addition, finance companies issue commercial paper to support leasing and to extend credit to nonfinancial customers, such as in the provision of car loans and the financing of inventories.\nThe tightening of credit conditions has weighed on spending by households and businesses. Their spending capacity was also reduced by the protracted weakness in housing markets, along with earlier increases in prices for energy and other commodities. As a result, aggregate economic activity has deteriorated to the point that the U.S. economy is now in the midst of a substantial downturn.\nOver the past couple of months, we have witnessed another wave of large-scale disruptions to the financial services industry. These recent developments reflect a confluence of factors.\nAs we moved through the summer, the financial system faced increasing difficulties owing to further deterioration of the economy. Consumption began to contract noticeably and labor markets declined at an accelerating pace. The weakness in economic activity intensified the strains on banks, since not only mortgage loans but also business, car, and credit card loans started to exhibit higher default risks. The deteriorating credit risks led banks to hold on to liquid assets even more and to tighten credit standards even further.\nAt the same time that the macroeconomic picture was deteriorating, a number of large financial firms were reporting severe losses. Some institutions—notably Wachovia, Washington Mutual, and Merrill Lynch—appeared unable to survive on their own and were purchased by large banks. However, the losses at Lehman Brothers were especially large, and a buyer could not be found. Consequently, Lehman had to declare bankruptcy. At almost the same time, American International Group (AIG), one of the most important issuers of credit default insurance, found itself unable to meet its liabilities without a loan from the Federal Reserve.\nThese developments dealt a serious blow to market confidence. The problems in these major institutions intensified financial market participants' concerns about the ability of their counterparties to repay debt. This heightened assessment of risk resulted in funding becoming even more difficult and expensive to obtain across a spectrum of markets.\nIn the interbank market, LIBOR spreads spiked up again, jumping briefly as high as 335 basis points. This, of course, made many types of bank loans even more expensive. Banks also further tightened their credit standards for new lending to both businesses and households.\nIn credit markets, concerns about the loss exposure of normally highly rated firms led to a fall in value of a wide range of debt instruments and derivative products. In commercial paper, this was reflected in a spike in rates for many issues, particularly those for asset-backed securities and the paper of lower-rated nonfinancial firms.\nFurthermore, the problems in the commercial paper and other short-term lending markets continued to spread following the initial shock. In part, this reflected a feedback loop between these markets and the money market mutual funds. Money market funds hold commercial paper and engage in repurchase agreements with highly rated firms. Money market mutual funds that held Lehman or other now distressed paper were exposed to potentially significant losses. Indeed, the Reserve Primary Fund, ended up \"breaking the buck,\" meaning its net asset value per share dropped below $1, after suffering losses on its holdings of Lehman debt.\nAs a result of such losses, many investors began redeeming funds from money market accounts or shifting funds into Treasury-only accounts. To meet the redemptions, many money market funds had to liquidate assets into an already depressed market. In addition, other commercial paper was downgraded and became ineligible to be purchased by money market mutual funds, exerting further downward pressure on this market. Furthermore, as perceived price risk and redemption risk increased dramatically, there was a marked reduction in the maturity of commercial paper and other debt being rolled through the markets.\nAs a consequence of these pressures, even some highly rated firms found it more difficult and expensive to obtain short-term financing through the commercial paper and repo markets. Some of these firms have been able to tap bank backup lines of credit. But this substitution just pushes the money market difficulties back into the banking system. The drawdowns of existing bank revolvers and credit lines increase the size of banks' balance sheets at a time when they are trying to reduce leverage. Thus, they potentially squeeze out the ability of banks to make other loans. This is similar to how the redemptions by the money market funds' customers reduced the funds' capacity to invest in commercial paper that nonfinancial firms then use to fund operations.\n\nActions by the Federal Reserve\nThe Fed has implemented a number of policy responses to these extraordinary events, aimed at mitigating the problems in the financial system and their potential fallout on the spending and production capacity of the rest of the economy.\nFirst, the Fed turned to its traditional monetary policy instruments, that is, to reductions in the federal funds rate and the discount rate. In August 2007, the Fed reduced the spread of the discount rate over the federal funds rate from 100 basis points to 50 basis points; and last March it was reduced further to 25 basis points. The first funds rate cut occurred in September 2007. The initial moves during the fall of 2007 were measured, but eventually gave way to more aggressive rate cuts. Today, the funds rate is 1 percent, 425 basis points lower than when we began.\nAlthough the corresponding injections of liquidity into the overnight interbank market have reduced restrictive credit conditions somewhat, it became clear early on that further and alternative extensions of central bank liquidity would be necessary to restore adequate interbank lending at term and further facilitate market functioning.\nEven in normal times, the discount window at the Fed is available to sound depository institutions in order to smooth payment difficulties. Such lending can also help the flow of credit in interbank markets more generally and as early as the fall of 2007, the Fed made a number of substantial changes to the operation of the window to encourage its use. One change was increasing the maximum term of the loans to up to 90 days; traditionally, borrowing at the window was overnight or very short term. And since these changes have been made, we have seen a large increase in lending to depository institutions.\nEarlier this year, new market dysfunctions emerged, such as the collapse of the auction rate security market. And then there was the sudden demise of Bear Stearns last March. These episodes clearly indicated that in this strained environment, financial market participants other than depository institutions might face liquidity shortfalls that could have serious, far-ranging repercussions for the economy. This led the Fed to create a number of facilities to directly provide liquidity to nondepository institutions; the Federal Reserve Act grants us such emergency powers when the economy is faced with \"unusual and exigent circumstances.\"\nAt first, these measures were aimed at lending to broker-dealers who engage in securities transactions with the Fed and who have a large-scale presence in the repo and other short-term funding markets. Most recently, we have introduced new lending facilities to help work through the disruptions in the money market mutual fund and commercial paper markets. These programs provide a liquidity backstop for commercial paper and facilitate the sale in secondary markets of a number of instruments held by money market funds.\nAlthough it is still early, I am hopeful that these programs will have substantial, positive effects on restoring liquidity in the short-term financing market. Indeed, the spreads between commercial paper and the fed funds rate have fallen, retracing most of the run-up that occurred in mid-September.\nOf course, the Federal Reserve has not been alone in dealing with the crisis. The FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) increased deposit insurance limits and put in place special facilities to insure other liabilities of depository institutions. Congress enacted the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which authorized the Treasury Department's Troubled Assets Relief Program, or TARP. Importantly to many of you, this program has so far provided more than $200 billion in capital injections to the banking system to support the lending capacity of banks. And, as you are aware, these capital injections are made through issuance of preferred stock and also include other features that support the prudent stewardship of taxpayer resources.\nMost recently, the Treasury, the FDIC, and the Fed have worked together to avoid further market disruption in a number of ways. In late November we provided guarantees, liquidity access, and additional capital to assist Citigroup through a difficult period.\nIn another joint program, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury are establishing a facility to lend to holders of student, consumer, and small businesses credit, using TARP funds to provide credit protection to the facility.\nFinally, the Fed is also launching a facility that will purchase debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises. The initiative will help support the flow of credit and lower credit in mortgage markets.\nI believe that together the actions by the Fed and the other branches of government will help unlock lending capacity and will move us toward financial stability. It will not be an easy process, and it could take some time before financial markets function in a manner that does not impinge on the activities of businesses and households. But we will continue to use all of our resources to preserve the strength of our banking institutions and promote the process of repair and recovery of our financial markets.\n\nEconomic Outlook\nThat brings me to recent developments in the nonfinancial sectors of the economy, as well as the outlook over the next few years.\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research declared the U.S. economy peaked in December of 2007 and subsequently entered into a recession. Both income and payroll employment started to fall, with the declines accelerating in recent months. Overall gross domestic product (GDP) growth has been choppy, but in the third quarter GDP fell at an annual rate of 0.5 percent and appears to be headed for a much larger decline in the current quarter. Payrolls, which had been declining slowly, fell sharply in September and October, bringing the year-to-date job losses to 1.2 million. October also brought a sharp rise in the unemployment rate to 6.5 percent. Weak labor markets and rising consumer prices have held back growth in real incomes. These, along with the financial strains, have led to marked weakness in business investment, industrial production, and consumer spending. Indeed, the declines in consumer spending over the past few months have been very large—on par with the drops experienced during the 1990 and 1982 recessions.\nAt this time it is very difficult to judge how long the downturn might last and how deep it ultimately will be. As financial markets work through their problems—with important help from government policy—and credit flows improve, we will see a return of growth in spending, production, and employment. But given the magnitude of the problems that we face, we could see activity remaining quite sluggish through much of 2009.\nThis thinking shaped the forecast that I submitted at our most recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on October 28 and 29. At that time, the central tendency of the forecasts of the Governors and Reserve Bank presidents for GDP growth for 2008 as a whole was a range of 0 to 0.3 percent. Given that GDP growth averaged a little under 2 percent in the first half of the year, you can do the math: These forecasts imply a noticeable decline in real GDP in the second half of the year.\nIn explaining their forecasts, many participants noted the weakening data on consumer spending, stock market wealth, consumer confidence, and labor market conditions, as well as the severe dislocations in credit markets. These factors were expected to weigh heavily on household and business spending in 2008 and persist to some degree in 2009. Furthermore, weakness abroad was expected to hold back growth in exports. Accordingly, participants were looking for a relatively gradual recovery, with most of the forecasts for 2009 being somewhere between a one-quarter percent decline and a 1 percent increase in real GDP. The recovery is expected to take hold more firmly in 2010 and 2011.\nIn this growth environment, most forecasts had the unemployment rate rising to between 7.1 and 7.6 percent by the fourth quarter of 2009 before moving down to between 5-1/2 and 6-1/2 percent by the end of 2011. Such unemployment rates would mean that a substantial degree of resource slack would remain in the economy over the next few years. This slack, along with the recent declines in the prices of energy and other commodities, should bring down inflation. Increases in the price index for total personal consumption expenditures were projected to fall from the 2-3/4 to 3 percent range in 2008 to between 1.4 and 1.7 percent in 2011. To me, this outcome would be consistent with price stability.\nWhen submitting these forecasts, the Committee members also noted that the degree of uncertainty about the outlook was unusually high. In large part this reflects the wide range of possible outcomes for the financial crisis and the associated interactions with the real economy.\nPersonally, I thought it was easier to envision the bad outcome scenarios than the good ones. Most of my colleagues agreed, and so viewed the risks to the forecast as being skewed to the downside.\nIndeed, since these projections were made, the incoming data, particularly on consumer spending and labor market conditions, have been weaker than I had expected. As I just mentioned, overall activity appears to be contracting markedly this quarter. That said, not all of the news has been bad. The prices for energy and other commodities have come down further. And, as I mentioned earlier, we have seen some declines in spreads on interbank borrowing rates and in the commercial paper market. I am hopeful that we will see continued improvement in financial market functioning and that this will show through in improved credit terms for households and nonfinancial businesses. But, as I noted earlier, it likely will be a while before markets are functioning in a manner that we would characterize as smooth and efficient.\n\nConclusion\nTo conclude, the U.S. economy continues to face many challenges. The Fed has been proactive in addressing market liquidity stress during the financial crisis—first by using our monetary policy tools and later through our improvised lending facilities in response to financial markets. Moving forward, it is important that we be vigilant in monitoring the risks to growth, as well as any risks to the prospects for obtaining price stability. It is also important for us to continue to collaborate with global policymakers in the pursuit of financial stability worldwide. We likely are in for a protracted period of poor economic performance. But the policy actions taken by the Fed and other governmental agencies over the course of the financial crisis, and the effort of the private sector to work through its difficulties, will eventually help support a recovery in economic growth.\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

            "content": "Introduction\nThanks to the Economic Club of Indiana for inviting me to speak today. I'm delighted to be here to share my thoughts on the economy during this challenging period. I'd like to say a special thank you to Ann Murtlow, who is a member of our Chicago Fed Board of Directors. As a member of the Board, Ann provides us with valuable information on the regional business outlook and credit conditions. This information not only helps us gauge the local economies within the Seventh District, but also contributes to our understanding of developments in the national economy. Ann also supports an important function with respect to monetary and credit policy—the Directors vote on the setting for the Bank's discount rate, which is what we charge banks for borrowing from the Fed. This is, of course, particularly important during the current economic difficulties.\nToday, I will discuss the recent events in financial markets and the Federal Reserve's responses to them. I will also give you my take on the current economic outlook. As always, these are my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nLet me begin with the financial crisis.\n\nEarly Stages of the Financial Crisis\n Over the past year we have witnessed the deteriorating performance of mortgages and a broad array of mortgage-backed securities—some of which, as you know, are highly structured instruments with opaque risk profiles. The problems in mortgages have spilled over to other segments of our financial markets. Market participants have reassessed the risk profiles of other complex securities, and the prices of these assets have declined as well. This cascading process of re-pricing has had a detrimental impact on the liquidity and capital positions of a wide range of financial institutions in the United States and around the world.\nThe resulting disruptions to financial markets have made credit more costly and more difficult to obtain for many households and businesses. Banks are reluctant to lend even to one another because of concerns over counterparty risk, the desire to preserve liquidity, and limited balance sheet capacity. This has resulted in large increases between the London interbank offered rate, or LIBOR, and the federal funds rate. LIBOR, of course, is a common benchmark for the interest rate charged on short-term interbank lending. Many banks set their interest rates on loans to households and businesses as a markup over their cost of funds, as measured by LIBOR. Increases in LIBOR, no doubt, have translated into higher borrowing rates for those of you operating a business today. Before this financial turmoil began, the 30-day LIBOR rate typically hovered about 10 basis points above the level of the fed funds rate that would be expected to prevail over the term of the loan. Since the summer of 2007 the spread has risen substantially, averaging about 50 basis points between August 2007 and August 2008, with a couple of spikes to about 1 percent.\nStrains on financial institutions have also spilled over to other markets, like that for commercial paper. Because of concerns over their ability to meet future payments, some financial services firms have had difficulty rolling over commercial paper or have seen their costs of issuing paper rise substantially. These difficulties are also affecting the availability and cost of commercial paper funding to nonfinancial firms. Nonfinancial firms often issue commercial paper to fund regular operations such as meeting payrolls and buying materials. In addition, finance companies issue commercial paper to support leasing and to extend credit to nonfinancial customers, such as in the provision of car loans and the financing of inventories.\nThe tightening of credit conditions has weighed on spending by households and businesses. Their spending capacity was also reduced by the protracted weakness in housing markets, along with earlier increases in prices for energy and other commodities. As a result, aggregate economic activity edged down in the third quarter and has since deteriorated to the point that the U.S. economy is now clearly in the midst of a substantial downturn.\nOver the past couple of months, we have witnessed another wave of large-scale disruptions to the financial services industry. These recent developments reflect a confluence of factors.\nAs we moved through the summer, the financial system faced increasing difficulties owing to further deterioration of the economy. Consumption began to contract noticeably and labor markets declined at an accelerating pace. The weakness in economic activity intensified the strains on banks since not only mortgage loans, but also business, car, and credit card loans started to exhibit higher default risks. The deteriorating credit risks led banks to hold on to liquid assets even more and to tighten credit standards even further.\nAt the same time that the macroeconomic picture was deteriorating, a number of large financial firms were reporting severe losses. Some institutions—notably Wachovia, Washington Mutual, and Merrill Lynch—appeared unable to survive on their own and were purchased by large banks. However, losses at Lehman Brothers were especially large, a buyer could not be found, and, consequently Lehman had to declare bankruptcy. At almost the same time, American International Group (AIG), one of the most important issuers of credit default insurance, found itself unable to meet its liabilities without a loan from the Federal Reserve.\nThese developments dealt a serious blow to market confidence. The problems in these major institutions intensified financial market participants' concerns about the ability of their counterparties to repay debt. This heightened assessment of risk resulted in funding becoming even more difficult and expensive to obtain across a spectrum of markets.\nIn the interbank market, LIBOR spreads spiked up again, jumping briefly to as high as 335 basis points. This, of course, made many types of bank loans even more expensive. Banks also further tightened their credit standards for new lending to both businesses and households.\nIn credit markets, concerns about the loss exposure of even normally highly rated firms led to a fall in value of a wide range of debt instruments and derivative products. In commercial paper, this was reflected in a spike in rates for many issues, particularly those for asset-backed securities and the paper of lower-rated nonfinancial firms.\nFurthermore, the problems in the commercial paper and other short-term lending markets continued to spread following the initial shock. In part, this reflected a feedback loop between these markets and the money market mutual funds. Money market funds hold commercial paper and repurchase agreements with highly rated firms. Money market mutual funds that held Lehman or other now-distressed paper were exposed to potentially significant losses. Indeed, the Reserve Primary Fund, ended up \"breaking the buck,\" meaning its net asset value per share dropped below $1, after suffering losses on its holdings of Lehman debt.\nAs a result of such losses, many investors began redeeming funds from money market accounts or shifting funds into Treasury-only accounts. To meet the redemptions, many money market funds had to liquidate assets into an already depressed market. In addition, other commercial paper was downgraded and became ineligible to be purchased by money market mutual funds, exerting further downward pressure on this market. Furthermore, as perceived price risk and redemption risk increased dramatically, there was a marked reduction in the maturity of commercial paper and other debt being rolled through the markets.\nAs a consequence of these pressures, even some highly rated firms found it more difficult and expensive to obtain short-term financing through the commercial paper and repo markets. Some of these firms have been able to tap bank back-up lines of credit. But this substitution just pushes the money market difficulties back into the banking system. The drawdowns of existing bank revolvers and credit lines increase the size of banks' balance sheets at a time when they are trying to reduce leverage. Thus, they potentially squeeze out the ability of banks to make other loans. This is similar to how the redemptions by the money market funds' customers reduced the funds' capacity to invest in commercial paper that nonfinancial firms then use to fund operations.\n\nActions by the Federal Reserve\nThe Fed has implemented a number of policy responses to these extraordinary events, aimed at mitigating the problems in the financial system and their potential fallout on the spending and production capacity of the rest of the economy.\nFirst, the Fed turned to its traditional monetary policy instruments, that is, to reductions in the federal funds and the discount rate. In August 2007, the Fed reduced the spread of the discount rate over the federal funds rate from 100 basis points to 50 basis points; and last March it was reduced further to 25 basis points. The first funds rate cut occurred in September 2007. The initial moves during the fall of 2007 were measured, but eventually gave way to more aggressive rate cuts. Today, the funds rate is 1 percent, 425 basis points lower than when we began.\nAlthough the corresponding injections of liquidity into the overnight interbank market have reduced restrictive credit conditions somewhat, it became clear early on that further and alternative extensions of central bank liquidity would be necessary to restore adequate interbank lending at term and further facilitate market functioning.\nEven in normal times, the discount window at the Fed is available to sound depository institutions in order to smooth payment difficulties. Such lending can also help the flow of credit in interbank markets more generally, and as early as the fall of 2007, the Fed made a number of substantial changes to the operation of the window to encourage its use. One change was increasing the maximum term of the loans to up to 90 days; traditionally, borrowing at the window was overnight or very short term. And since these changes have been made, we have seen a large increase in lending to depository institutions.\nEarlier this year, new market dysfunctions emerged, like the collapse of the auction-rate security market. And then the sudden demise of Bear Sterns last March. These episodes clearly indicated that in this strained environment, financial market participants other than depository institutions might face liquidity shortfalls that could have serious, far-ranging repercussions for the economy. This led the Fed to create a number of facilities to directly provide liquidity to non-depository institutions; the Federal Reserve Act grants us such emergency powers when the economy is faced with \"unusual and exigent circumstances.\"\nAt first, these measures were aimed at lending to broker-dealers who engage in securities transactions with the Fed and who have a large-scale presence in the repo and other short-term funding markets. Most recently, we have introduced new lending facilities to help work through the disruptions in the money market mutual fund and commercial paper markets. These programs provide a liquidity backstop for commercial paper and facilitate the sale in secondary markets of a number of instruments held by money market funds. Although it is still early, I am hopeful that these programs will have substantial, positive effects on restoring liquidity in the short-term financing market. Indeed, the spreads between commercial paper and the fed funds rate have fallen, retracing most of the run-up that occurred in mid September.\nOf course, the Federal Reserve has not been dealing with the crisis in a vacuum. Congress also responded by enacting the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. As part of the act, the Treasury has injected significant capital into the banking system. In addition, deposit insurance limits have been increased and the FDIC has put in place special facilities to insure other liabilities of depository institutions.\nI believe that together, the actions by the Fed and the other branches of government will help unlock lending capacity and will move us toward financial stability. But it will not be an easy process, and it could take some time before financial markets function in a manner that does not impinge on the activities of businesses and households.\n\nEconomic Outlook\nThat brings me to recent developments in the nonfinancial sectors of the economy, and the outlook for over the next few years.\nOver the past year, the U.S. economy has been slowing, and in the third quarter, GDP fell at an annual rate of 0.3 percent. Payrolls, which had been declining slowly since December 2007, fell sharply in September and October, bringing the year-to-date job losses to 1.2 million. There also has been a sharp rise in the unemployment rate—in October, it was 6.5 percent. Weak labor markets and rising consumer prices have held back growth in real incomes. These, along with the financial strains, have led to marked weakness in business investment, industrial production, and consumer spending. Indeed, the declines in consumer spending over the past few months have been very large—on par with the drops experienced during the 1990 and 1982 recessions.\nSo, currently, aggregate economic activity is contracting. At this time it is very difficult to judge how long the downturn might last and how deep it ultimately will be. As financial markets work through their problems—with important help from government policy—and credit flows improve, we will see a return of growth in spending, production, and employment. But given the magnitude of the problems that we face, we could see activity remaining quite sluggish through much of 2009.\nThis thinking shaped the forecast that I submitted at our most recent FOMC meeting on October 28th and 29th. At that time the central tendency of the forecasts of the Governors and Reserve Bank Presidents for GDP growth for 2008 as a whole was a range of 0 to 0.3 percent. Given that GDP growth averaged a bit under 2 percent in the first half of the year—well, you can do the math—these forecasts imply a noticeable decline in real GDP in the second half of the year.\nIn explaining their forecasts, many participants noted the weakening data on consumer spending, stock market wealth, consumer confidence, and labor market conditions as well as the severe dislocations in credit markets. These factors were expected to weigh heavily on household and business spending in 2008 and persist to some degree in 2009. Furthermore, weakness abroad was expected to hold back growth in exports. Accordingly, participants were looking for a relatively gradual recovery, with most of the forecasts for 2009 being somewhere between a 1/4 percent decline and a 1 percent increase in real GDP. The recovery is expected to take hold more firmly in 2010 and 2011.\nIn this growth environment, most forecasts had the unemployment rate rising to between 7.1 and 7.6 percent by the fourth quarter of 2009 before moving down to between 5-1/2 and 6-1/2 percent by the end of 2011. Such unemployment rates would mean that a substantial degree of resource slack would remain in the economy over the next few years. This slack, along with the recent declines in the prices of energy and other commodities, should bring down inflation. Increases in the price index for total personal consumption expenditures were projected to fall from the 2-3/4 to 3 percent range in 2008 to between 1.4 and 1.7 percent in 2011. To me, this outcome would be consistent with price stability.\nWhen submitting these forecasts, the Committee members also noted that the degree of uncertainty about the outlook was unusually high. In large part this reflects the wide range of possible outcomes for the financial crisis and the associated interactions with the real economy. Personally, I thought it was easier to envision the bad-outcome scenarios than the good ones. Most of my colleagues agreed, and so viewed the risks to the forecast as being skewed to the downside.\nIndeed, since these projections were made, the incoming data, particularly on consumer spending and labor market conditions, have been weaker than I had expected. That said, not all of the news has been bad. The prices for energy and other commodities have come down further. And, as I mentioned earlier, we have seen some declines in spreads on interbank borrowing rates and the commercial paper market. I am hopeful that we will see continued improvement in financial market functioning and that this will show through in improved credit terms for households and nonfinancial businesses. But, as I noted earlier, it likely will be a while before markets are functioning in a manner that we would characterize as smooth and efficient.\n\nConclusion\nThe U.S. economy continues to face many challenges. The Fed has been proactive in addressing market liquidity stress during the financial crisis—first by using our monetary policy tools and later through our improvised lending facilities in response to financial markets. Moving forward, it is important that we be vigilant in monitoring the risks to growth, as well as any risks to the prospects for obtaining price stability. It is also important for us to continue to collaborate with global policymakers in the pursuit of financial stability worldwide. We likely are in for a protracted period of poor economic performance. But the policy actions taken by the Fed and other governmental agencies over the course of the financial crisis, and the effort of the private sector to work through their difficulties, will eventually help support a recovery in economic growth.\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

            "content": "Introduction\nGood afternoon and thank you for inviting me to speak today. It's always a pleasure to have the opportunity to visit Wisconsin, and I am delighted to be here. Let me start by thanking the Fond du Lac Chamber of Commerce and Mike Burch, of National Exchange Bank and Trust, who helped arrange my visit.\nToday I'd like to share some thoughts on the extraordinary events that have occurred in the financial markets over the past several weeks. I will also discuss the national and regional economies. Before we begin, though, let me note that the views I express today are my own and are not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nTurbulent Times\nOver the past year, we have witnessed the deteriorating performance of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities spill over to other segments of our financial markets. Market participants have reassessed the risk profiles of other similarly structured assets, and prices of these securities have declined as well. This cascading process of re-pricing has had a detrimental impact on liquidity and capital positions in a wide range of financial institutions and markets in the United States and around the world.\nAnd over the past few weeks we have witnessed large-scale disruptions to our financial services industry. Policymakers, financial institutions, and nonfinancial borrowers and lenders are struggling with how best to respond to the stressed markets and support economic growth. We are, undoubtedly, in the midst of extraordinarily turbulent times.\nThe disruptions to financial markets have made credit more costly and more difficult to obtain for many households and businesses. Banks are reluctant to lend to one another because of concerns over counterparty risk and the desire to preserve liquidity. This has resulted in large increases in the London interbank offered rate, or LIBOR—the common benchmark for the interest rate charged on short-term interbank lending. Many banks set their interest charges on loans to households and businesses as a markup over their cost of funds, as measured by LIBOR. Increases in LIBOR, no doubt, have translated into higher bank borrowing rates for those of you operating a business today. Before this financial turmoil began, the 30-day LIBOR rate was typically hovering about 10 basis points above the level of the fed funds rate that would be expected to prevail over the term of the loan. 1 Since the summer of 2007 the spread has risen substantially—and in recent weeks it jumped as high as 300 basis points.\nIn the commercial paper (CP) markets, difficulties over some financial services firms' ability to roll over their CP have also strained the markets for other types of CP. This, of course, is affecting both the availability and cost of funding through the CP market to some nonfinancial firms.\nAs a result of the restrictive lending procedures of banks, and the strains in other credit markets, consumers and businesses have experienced reduced and more costly access to credit. This, in turn, has weighed on overall spending. In addition, the protracted weakness in the housing markets, along with elevated prices for energy and other commodities, continues to be a drag on the economy; these economic conditions have also reduced the spending capacity of households and businesses.\nAnd so, as a consequence of these factors, job creation, consumer spending, and industrial production, have all weakened. Payroll employment declined again in September, bringing the cumulative year-to-date job losses to 760,000. There also has been a sharp rise in the unemployment rate this year—in September it was 6.1 percent, a full percentage point above the level many view as being consistent with \"full employment.\"\nWeak labor markets and high consumer prices have held back growth in real incomes, contributing to marked weakness in consumer spending. The average level of real personal consumption expenditures for goods and services in July and August was down more than 2 percent at an annual rate from the second quarter. And the latest data on retail sales point to another decline in spending on goods in September.\nConditions in labor markets and high consumer prices also have impacted some manufacturing industries. Industrial production has fallen nearly 2 percent since last December. The most recent information indicates a 3 percent drop in production for the month of September as compared to August. And after changing very little for about a year, the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing purchasing managers' index was down sharply last month. One bright spot for the U.S. economy has been exports. In August, real exports were up 10 percent from the previous year. However, the turmoil in global financial markets is reducing the growth of many of our trading partners. So, looking ahead, it may be difficult to maintain the recent pace of export growth.\nWe also are concerned about the increased rate of inflation. Inflation has risen partly because of earlier spikes in commodity prices—particularly energy prices. Another reason has been soaring food prices. Even excluding food and energy, so-called core inflation for personal consumption expenditures was up to 2.6 percent (year-over-year) in August. In my opinion, this rate has been high. Looking ahead, commodity prices have fallen from their peaks. Also, the dollar has regained ground from its previous lows, which should moderate import prices. Furthermore, the increased slack in the economy will likely reduce more general cost and inflationary pressures. This channel definitely seems stronger today. Although some risks to the inflation outlook remain, a forward-looking assessment would put less weight on inflation concerns than earlier this summer.\nWith that in mind, the outlook for real economic activity likely will result in production, spending, and labor markets being very sluggish in the second half of this year and well into 2009. I expect that such activity will then pick up as the housing and financial markets gain headway in working through their problems. Such progress would be signaled by stabilization in construction and improvement in credit flows.\nThere is, of course, a level of cloudiness in any economic forecast. In the current situation, the substantial stress in the financial markets has led to an unusually high degree of uncertainty. This is because it is extremely difficult to assess how the turmoil will influence markets and how policy responses to address the economic unrest will play out over time.\nLast week, after considering all of the issues, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to lower the federal funds rate—the primary instrument of monetary policy—50 basis points to 1-1/2 percent. This brings the cumulative decline in the funds rate since last September 2007 to 375 basis points. We at the Federal Reserve continuously reevaluate the stance of monetary policy in light of current and forecasted conditions, as well as our assessments of the risks to our long-term objectives of maximum sustainable growth and price stability. Currently, these risk assessments must factor in the substantial uncertainties in the outlooks for growth and inflation that I just described. These uncertainties certainly pose difficult challenges for policymakers.\nIn addition to lowering the fed funds rate, we have also implemented a number of policies aimed at supporting the flow of liquidity through the financial system. Our most recent moves have been to institute lending facilities to support money market mutual funds and the commercial paper market. Collectively, these actions are designed to increase market liquidity by lengthening lending terms, reducing the cost of borrowing relative to the fed funds rate, expanding the range of eligible counterparties, and enlarging the pool of eligible collateral. These actions also have targeted liquidity to those systemically important markets that are experiencing large-scale disruptions in their operations.\nOf course, other important policy decisions also are being made. Two weeks ago Congress enacted, and the President signed, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. And earlier this week the Treasury announced details of a plan that would inject significant capital into the banking system. These actions are unprecedented in scope to address the difficulties we face as a nation. I believe they will help unlock lending capacity and will move us toward financial stability. I will be happy to address questions on this topic after my remarks, but let me now turn away from \"breaking news\" and spend a little time on the health of the regional economy and its importance to the national economy.\n\nRegional Economy\nTurning to our region's economic performance, the agriculture and manufacturing sectors are of great importance to us in the Seventh Federal Reserve District. Our District includes Iowa and the larger parts of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin. This region makes up 13 percent of both the U.S. population and our gross domestic product. It produces nearly 30 percent of America's vehicles; more than a third of America's steel; more than half of its farm machinery; and almost half of our corn, soybeans, and pork. So, of course, we at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago closely monitor the agriculture and manufacturing sectors.\nWisconsin is one of the most diverse agricultural production states in the nation, and it's one of the top ten agriculture states. More than half of the land in our five-state region is either cropland or pasture. The agriculture industry in Wisconsin produces nearly $52 billion annually and employs more than 12 percent of the state's labor force. 2\nGiven Wisconsin's strong agricultural tradition, it is not surprising that we at the Chicago Fed are interested in measures of innovation in agriculture that promote increased productivity and an economic boost to the region. Of particular interest are areas that transform agriculture through modern science and significantly improve production operations and overall efficiency.\nOne reason that agriculture has been so successful has been the tremendous growth in productivity in the sector. Research and development activities related to agriculture have led to tremendous output growth. Over the past forty years, corn yields in the District have more than doubled, and milk production per cow has increased almost 150 percent. Continued investment in technological innovations and in research and development will, no doubt, result in further production efficiencies, better products, and higher return on investments for agriculture in the Midwest.\nManufacturing continues to be the bellwether industry for Wisconsin and for much of the Midwest. As measured by personal income, the Midwest economy derives 60 percent more of its annual gross product directly from manufacturing companies as compared with the remainder of the U.S.\nOf course, manufacturing performance varies sharply from sector to sector. Currently, you will not be surprised to hear that production of transportation equipment—which in the Midwest largely means the automotive industry—shows steep declines. In contrast, our machinery sector—which builds a host of capital goods—is holding up much better. By historical standards this deviation is somewhat unusual. It largely reflects strong economic growth by our international trading partners that are demanding items we make, such as tractors, construction equipment, medical devices, generators, and mining equipment.\nDifferences in the concentration in specific industrial sectors have influenced the economic performance among the states in the District. Since 2000, the automotive-intensive states of Indiana and Michigan have experienced deteriorating labor markets relative to the national average. In contrast, several metropolitan areas in Illinois, Wisconsin, and Iowa with machinery-intensive manufacturing operations have held up better than in the past. We have a \"tale of two industries\" within the District, with significant stress in many of our automotive-dominated metropolitan areas, but also continued prosperity in many of our machinery-concentrated areas.\nMuch like the broader region itself, parts of Wisconsin's economy continue to be tied to the automotive industry. The Janesville area has been adversely affected by high gasoline prices and slowing auto sales. This will, undoubtedly, have a downward effect on other Wisconsin companies that supply parts and machinery to the automotive industry. However, in comparison to the manufacturing sectors in Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio, Wisconsin's is more concentrated in capital equipment rather than in motor vehicles. Wisconsin is an important producer of machine tools construction and farm machinery, food processing equipment, electronic control systems, and diagnostic medical systems.\nSales growth in these sectors has been holding up well in recent years, as U.S. manufacturers have expanded markets to both customers across the nation and, increasingly, customers around the world. Over the two-year period ending in 2007, Wisconsin's export goods expanded by over 28 percent, reaching over $19 billion annually as of 2007. Nonelectrical machinery topped the list of export product categories for the state, with over $6 billion (2007), followed by electrical machinery and scientific/medical instruments. Nonelectrical machinery grew at a pace of 10 percent annually from 2005 through 2007; the second highest category of exports, electrical machinery, grew by over 20 percent annually.\nWisconsin's capital goods orientation largely reflects a national restructuring that has seen a steady shift in the specialization of U.S. manufacturers producing goods and services; it also reflects a continued export growth. Today, The U.S. produces more than 20 percent of the world's manufactured goods—the largest output in the world—with less than 5 percent of the global population. In 2007, manufactured exports made up 6.6 percent of the nation's output—and an estimated 8 percent of the output of the Seventh Federal Reserve District.\nWisconsin's long-standing investment in academic excellence is also beginning to spawn new industries. The University of Wisconsin at Madison ranks in the top 20 in receipt of National Institutes of Health funding for health and life sciences research, and the University produces prodigious numbers of graduates in related fields. As a result of this activity, along with close attention to tech transfer and economic development, over 250 biotech, health, agriculture, and life sciences firms are up and running in the footprint of the University around Madison. By their nature, biotech goods and services serve wide national and global markets. While the dollar export levels do not yet approach Wisconsin's mature machinery industries, pharmaceutical products now rank 30th among state export categories, after rising over 3.5 times since 1996.\n\nConclusion\nCurrently, the economy faces serious challenges. The housing market is a continuing strain, and we are experiencing disruptions in worldwide credit markets that are without precedent in the post-World War II era. Such challenges call for innovative and vigorous fiscal and monetary policy responses. In response, the Fed and other central banks have implemented a number of nonstandard facilities for injecting liquidity into strained markets, and they have made a coordinated reduction in their monetary policy interest rate targets. Fiscal authorities also have responded to economic challenges. In the U.S., we enacted the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act and instituted programs to insure some debt of financial institutions. These actions complement efforts by other nations to recapitalize their banking systems and facilitate interbank lending.\nI believe these efforts will be of great help in unlocking lending capacity, enhancing the flow of credit to consumers and businesses, and moving us toward financial stability. But bringing credit markets back into full functionality won't happen overnight. And when normality is ultimately restored, the \"new normal\" will likely operate through different channels and under different constraints than before the financial turmoil. Yet, the \"new normal\" will represent a substantial improvement from where we are today.\nAs credit flows do begin to improve, the risks to growth will diminish, and we will be able to concentrate again on our traditional policy tools, using them in ways that help the economy achieve maximum sustainable growth and price stability.\n\nNotes\n1 The expected fed funds rate can be measured by the overnight index swap (OIS) rate.\n2 Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation, 2008, web site, available online.\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

            "content": "Today I would like to discuss some of the challenges that the recent turmoil in financial markets poses for research in both financial markets and monetary economics. I am sure that many of you, too, have been struggling with the questions and problems that I will be talking about this evening. And, of course, I need to state from the start that the views I will be expressing are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the FOMC or in the Federal Reserve System.\nOver the years, the research community and policymakers have developed a good framework for thinking about monetary policy reactions to real–side shocks. For instance, if we think about the appropriate policy response to an oil shock, there is widespread agreement on the broad outline of models that are useful to answer the question. Typically, we would turn to a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model, (DSGE) model, with both nominal and real rigidities; estimate or calibrate the parameters of the model; and then trace out the responses to the real shock under different policy actions—and perhaps under different policy responses. Certainly many details remain disputed, such as the extent of nominal versus real rigidities, or the appropriate form of adjustment costs; these details are very important, but they do not challenge the basic tools we empirical macroeconomists use for policy analysis.\nHowever, unlike real shocks, we don't, as yet, have such a well-developed toolkit with which to analyze financial shocks. The events of the past year certainly have reminded us of this point. So tonight I would like to discuss some of the difficulties we face in modeling financial shocks, and do so through the prism of the recent turmoil in financial markets.\nLet's step back and think about some of the tough questions I am sure all of us have been grappling with over the past year. Can markets easily work around the disruptions to the credit intermediation process that channels funds from savers to borrowers? Or have we experienced a permanent destruction in something we might want to think about as the financial sector capital stock? If so, does the economy need to develop entirely new infrastructures for some types of intermediation, or perhaps will reviving earlier more traditional approaches suffice once the turmoil has abated? And how will we know when markets settle out to the \"new normal steady state?\" With regard to policy, what—if any—public sector actions can assist this transition? Finally, and most importantly, what are the consequences of this turmoil for the achievement of the Fed's ultimate policy goals—maximum sustainable growth and price stability?\nTo answer these questions and provide a better basis for policy prescriptions, we need to be able to model how various disruptions in financial markets affect credit provision, and how these effects, in turn, impact the real economy. Ideally, we would want to analyze these financial developments using a well-articulated and empirically implementable modeling framework. Executing this program is tricky business. And, as I will discuss, I think we still have some work left to do—first in better understanding the fundamentals underlying the current financial shocks and, once we do, in figuring out how to best adjust our empirical models to measure their influence on the macroeconomy.\n\nCharacterizing Financial Shocks in Theoretical Models\nAt the Chicago Fed, our initial response to the financial turmoil was to try to classify the financial crisis as a shock that could easily be inserted into a standard DSGE model.\nHowever, deciding on the appropriate characterization of the shock has turned out to be a frustrating exercise. Modern macro models have identified and estimated a number of \"standard\" shocks—shocks to total factor productivity (TFP), marginal rates of substitutions, monetary policy, and so on. But less progress has been made with regard to modeling a \"financial infrastructure shock.\"\nNow, a term like \"financial infrastructure shock\" can encompass a large variety of episodes. I will focus on the recent troubles experienced by secondary financial markets, evidenced by the large increase in yield spreads for a wide range of structured securities and even the failure of certain assets to trade at any price. Of course, these started in the market for mortgage-backed and related securities and then spread to other types of structured finance.\nThe first step is to look at abstract theoretical models. These have shown that asymmetric information, moral hazard, and agency issues can generate an important role for liquid assets in channeling credit between lenders and borrowers.\nOne natural starting point is the model of Diamond and Dybvig and the large literature that followed it.1 These papers consider the problems that information asymmetries pose for the functioning of primary credit markets, the role of liquidity in addressing such problems, and the possibility of speculative runs in such environments. While they traditionally have been applied to the banking sector, they can also be used to think about a broader class of intermediaries that borrow short-term funds to finance less liquid, long-term investments; this broad class may include investment banks, broker-dealers, various off-balance-sheet entities such as structured investment vehicles, and even hedge funds. Accordingly, these models are helpful for thinking about the current situation, in which liquidity shortages have caused a number of markets to seize up and have resulted in run-like activity on some non-bank lenders.\nNonetheless, there is a good deal that these models leave unexplained. They simply take as given the illiquidity of long-term investments that are traded in primary capital markets in which borrowers and lenders interact directly. They do not explain illiquidity per se. As such, they fall short in explaining the current turmoil, which in large part reflects the sudden illiquidity of some assets that used to be re-traded in very deep secondary markets. 2\nRecently, Kiyotaki and Moore developed a model in which credit frictions operate not only in the primary market but also in secondary markets. 3 They trace out some implications for consumption when liquidity seizes up, and have some interesting policy prescriptions that I will discuss in a minute. That said, they too take as given the degree of liquidity: The shock to liquidity is a primitive in their model, with no explanation why some assets that previously were very liquid suddenly stop being traded. Without knowing this, it is difficult to think about the full effects of the shock on economic activity or the way central bank policy ought to react.\nNow I think there are some models that give plausible explanations for certain aspects of the current shock to liquidity. One stems from Akerlof's \"lemons\" paper, which studies markets under adverse selection. The way this story plays out in the current turmoil starts with the downturn in housing markets leading to an increase in mortgage defaults and an associated drastic reassessment of the risks of investing in mortgage-backed securities. Valuation has been made even more difficult by the fact that recently issued loans have had significantly different default profiles from previous vintages. As a consequence, assets that were previously considered fairly homogeneous and reasonably straightforward to price suddenly looked much more diverse. As the degree of informational asymmetry was perceived to widen, financial investors became much more concerned about a lemons problem.\nAs Akerlof showed, adverse selection can generate a vicious cycle that could even lead to a complete market shut down: This is because sellers of high-quality securities drop out, and this depresses the market price and leads more sellers to drop out, thus setting off a continuing cycle of price declines and exit of high-quality assets.\nI think this story begins to approximate some of the malfunctions in the mortgage-backed securities market. But it leaves open the question of why liquidity dried up in markets that were not tied to housing. One reason may be that the securitization process was similar across a wide spectrum of financial liabilities. This may have led market participants to worry about the potential for similar lemons problems to emerge among a much broader class of asset-backed paper, generating contagion across financial markets.\nWhile very useful for organizing our thinking, these models provide only highly stylized characterizations of how liquidity problems arise, and they fall short on modeling how they might feed back onto the consumption and investment decisions of households and businesses. So how can we capture the insights from these models and import them to a broader macro setting? And can we incorporate them into models that could be implemented empirically?\n\nEmpirical Implementations\nThe first question to ask is whether we can make some straightforward modifications to an otherwise standard-looking DSGE model and obtain useful policy prescriptions. There have been some important efforts to do so in the literature.\nA financial market shock may have some characteristics of a DSGE TFP shock: The cost of producing an intermediate input—credit intermediation—has become more expensive. This is how the shock is modeled in recent research by Curdia and Woodford. 4 In their analysis, a negative financial shock increases the costs of intermediation between savers and borrowers, and increases the spread between the interest rates faced by the two groups.\nAlternatively, there is a long history of empirical studies of the effects of credit frictions on output and inflation. Here I am thinking about the VAR and other reduced form models meant to capture the influence of the financial accelerator and the credit channel for monetary policy. 5 Subsequently, some attempts have been made to incorporate these effects into more structural models. Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist (BGG) have incorporated credit frictions from an explicit model of asymmetric information into an otherwise standard business-cycle calibration framework; 6 in their model, the borrowers' net worth is an important factor that affects the cost of capital. Christiano, Motto, and Rostagno have enriched Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchirst's setup in a medium-scale macroeconomic model that incorporates more economic variables than BGG and correspondingly includes more shocks. 7 They show that shocks to financial frictions may be very important in explaining the pattern of investment and stock market valuation in the run-up of the late 1990s and the consequent reversal of 2000-02. De Fiore and Tristani also develop a similar model in the paper presented at this conference. 8\nThese studies are very important and provide us with a very useful perspective. Yet they are identifying financial shocks largely in a reduced-form manner—either as an exogenous increase in interest rate spreads or net worth or as a shift in the demand for capital due to tightening of credit market constraints. To capture the current situation, we need to have a better idea of how the events in financial markets map into the parameters and shocks identified in these models. My feeling is that this probably requires embedding a richer specification of the financial intermediation process into these empirical frameworks.\nOne reason is that there are dimensions along which financial capital is not like the typical intermediate input in a DSGE model. In a number of theoretical models, financial inputs can be subject to discontinuities: Seemingly small changes in the borrowers' net worth or perceived risk can bring about radical consequences in market performance. Perhaps the recent events in the mortgage-backed and related structured security markets are an example of such a breakdown—indeed, one that is of macroeconomic importance.\nSuch discontinuities are a challenge for our standard empirical models. These models are typically solved by taking a local approximation around a balanced growth path. This approach is not designed to capture discrete jumps in equilibria. In addition, some of the estimated coefficients in our standard models may not be invariant to the onset of a liquidity crisis. This suggests that a regime-shifting model could be helpful, with a \"normal\" regime alternating with a \"liquidity crisis\" regime. But, still, how should we parameterize the crisis regime? If we observed liquidity crises often, we could estimate these parameters. But we don't experience crises very often, so it's asking a lot of any empirical model to accomplish this identification.\nSo my guess is that we can not gain a good deal of insight into when markets will \"return to normal,\" and what \"normal\" will look like from these models' estimated impulse response functions. Indeed, the rarity of crisis events and changes in the structure of markets makes it difficult to use even simple statistics, such as risk spreads and volatility measures, to gauge the path to the \"new normal.\"\n\nPolicy Issues\nNow let me turn to the policy dimension of the challenges that I have discussed so far. Modern models usually say there is little the public sector can do to offset a cyclical contraction in technology except to offset, to some degree, rigidities that affect the economy's response to the shock. This implication would carry over to financial shocks if we simply chose to model them as a negative cost shock to an intermediate input.\nHowever, there are reasons to believe that financial shocks may be very different when it comes to policy prescriptions. For one thing, the Fed and other financial regulators are themselves part of the intermediation infrastructure. This means that we potentially have a number of alternative policy instruments that might directly affect the way the economy responds to a financial shock.\nSince last August, the FOMC's policy decisions have been calibrated in part to avoid a \"adverse feedback loop\" between disruptions to financial market stability and the real economy. This focus has influenced both the setting of the funds rate and the implementation of a number of new policies.\nIn this context, the Fed has added a number of new lending facilities: the Term Auction Facility, the Term Securities Lending Facility, and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility. These directly impact the intermediation process independently of the federal funds rate—indeed, we have purposefully sterilized the effects of these facilities on the funds rate.\nIn addition, on September 7 the Department of Treasury added a new lending facility for Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs). This is aimed at supporting the flow of credit to mortgage markets and the associated liquidity of mortgage-backed securities.\nSuch policies do have counterparts in some of the work I cited earlier. As an example, in Kiyotaki and Moore's analysis, efficiency may be enhanced if the central bank offers more liquid assets to the private market in exchange for less-liquid ones. This is the case even though the central bank intervention has no effect on the liquidity of each class of assets. However, this strategy is potentially even more important if adverse selection is in play because here the intervention does affect liquidity. By allowing newly illiquid assets to be used as collateral, the central bank may be setting a floor on their value, which may undo—or at least limit—the vicious cycle that I described earlier in the Akerlof model. This could buy time for information to spread among market players and reinvigorate the intermediation process—perhaps in a different form, though, than how it operated in the pre-turmoil period.\nInterestingly, our Term Securities Lending Facility, which the Fed implemented in mid-March, roughly corresponds to the Kiyotaki and Moore recommendations. Our approach with regard to accepting and valuing collateral has been very careful in minimizing the credit risks assumed by the Federal Reserve Banks. Nonetheless, any plan that offers price support, even indirectly, does entail some potential risk to our balance sheet and could have other costs in terms of distorting price signals and moral hazard fallout. Kiyotaki and Moore do not provide any insight into these costs. So, we are left with many questions. How long should the central bank intervention last and how large should it be? What are its effects on the incentives for market participants to acquire information before a crisis unfolds? What markets deserve our attention? After all, Akerlof's original example was about the used car market; I certainly would not want the Fed to start accepting used cars as collateral!\nEven once we answer these questions, we have to address the implications of the new policy tools for our ultimate policy mandates of promoting maximum sustainable growth and price stability. This includes accounting for the interaction between the new tools and our traditional instrument of monetary policy—the short-term interest rate. An important component of this analysis is thinking about the degree to which the impaired assets used to be close substitutes for what some may call \"traditional money.\" If they were good substitutes, does a market breakdown that renders these assets illiquid create a potentially deflationary shock? If not, are there inflationary implications from swapping liquid Treasury securities for less-liquid assets or expanding the direct lending facilities that use such assets as collateral?\nThis question brings us back to the notoriously difficult issue of identifying the channels through which liquid assets generate price pressures, especially in the short run. And, as an empirical question, we are faced with identifying which credit aggregates or interest spreads best capture the relevant degree of substitutability.\n\nConclusion\nTo answer all of these challenging questions, it will be extremely useful to seek a more unified perspective of the role of financial frictions in modern macroeconomic models. In this way, we will be able to identify the independent roles of our traditional monetary policy tools and our new lending facilities, as well as the interaction between the old and new tools. Developing these models is up to the research community—from the research shops at central banks to academic departments to independent think tanks. And we policymakers are eagerly awaiting the results.\n\nNotes\n1 Douglas W. Diamond and Philip H.

            "content": "Introduction\nIt's a pleasure to speak to you today. Let me start by thanking the McLean County Chamber of Commerce for inviting me, and Ryan Whitehouse who helped arrange my visit here today.\nThe U.S. economy currently faces a number of difficult challenges: These include weakness in the housing market, continued financial market turmoil, and the potential for more persistent inflation emanating from the surge in food and commodity prices. The confluence of these and other factors have added layers of complexity to the management of monetary policy. I recently returned from our regular policy meeting in Washington, where, after considering all of the issues, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave the federal funds rate unchanged at 2 percent. Today, I'd like to share with you some of the thinking that shapes my views about policy—namely, my thoughts on the near- and medium-term prospects for growth and inflation, the state of financial markets, and the role of monetary policy in the current environment. Before we begin, though, let me note that the views I express today are my own and are not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nCurrent Economic Situation\nWe are in the midst of a sharp contraction in housing markets that began in 2006. Delinquency rates for residential real estate loans have more than doubled since the troubles began; single-family housing starts are down about two-thirds; and house prices have fallen about 16 percent from their peak, as measured by the Case—Shiller home price index. The inventory of homes for sale remains high. On average, declines in residential investment have subtracted a bit more than 1 percentage point per quarter from real GDP growth over the past two years. Although it is too early to say we are nearing the bottom of the housing cycle, in the most recent quarter residential investment reduced real GDP growth by a smaller magnitude—about two-thirds of a percentage point. As any economist will tell you, \"less bad\" can be a first step toward improvement.\nThe downward adjustment in housing activity has been associated with a doubling in the fraction of nonperforming mortgages since 2006. And over the past year, we have seen the deteriorating performance of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities spill over to other segments of financial markets. Market participants have reassessed the risk profiles of other similarly structured assets, and prices of these securities have declined as well. The re-pricing process has had a significant impact on the liquidity and capital positions of financial institutions. Declines in asset prices and the increase in nonperforming loans have eroded banks' capital positions. In response, many banks have taken steps to raise capital by issuing new equity, reducing dividend payments, and by selling certain assets. But, to the extent that capital ratios have continued to be strained, financial institutions have also restricted lending and worked to reduce the riskiness of their portfolios by tightening credit terms and standards. As a result, credit is now more costly and difficult to obtain for many kinds of household and business borrowing.\nFinancial turmoil and weakening housing markets are not the only factors weighing on economic activity. Over the past year, we also have experienced substantial increases in food and energy prices. These have reduced the purchasing power of households and increased firms' costs of materials, which have also weighed on economic growth. Labor markets have been weak. Payroll employment has declined steadily over the first seven months of this year, with a cumulative loss of over 450 thousand jobs. The largest job losses have been in the construction and manufacturing sectors. Also, the unemployment rate has risen by over a full percentage point during the past year, reaching 5.7 percent in July. Weak labor markets and high consumer prices have held back growth in real income. This, in conjunction with lower housing prices and stock market wealth, has resulted in a noticeable slowing in growth in consumer spending.\nThere are, however, some positive factors that have helped sustain growth. Declines in the dollar and solid growth by many of our trading partners have led to reductions in our trade deficit, adding substantially to real GDP growth in the second quarter. And, importantly, productivity has increased a healthy 2.8 percent over the past year. Productivity measures how much output the nonfarm business sector can produce for each hour of labor input. It is the fundamental determinant of our ability to generate economic well-being. And our workers and businesses have kept productivity on a solid uptrend by continually developing new productive technologies and new ways to use them.\nIndeed, in spite of the economic headwinds we face, real GDP was reported to have increased at an annual rate of 1.9 percent in the second quarter. And recent data suggest that this figure will likely be revised up. However, this did come on the heels of stalled growth at the end of 2007 and a gain of only 0.9 percent in the first quarter of 2008. So, the strong challenges faced by consumers and businesses have reduced growth. But, last January, I was concerned that things could turn out to be much worse.\nIn addition to the challenges regarding growth, we also are dealing with some unfavorable developments with regard to inflation. At the beginning of the year I expected the inflation picture to be better than it is now. The large increases in food and energy prices that I mentioned earlier have contributed to a 4.1 percent increase in the personal consumption expenditures deflator over the past year. Even core inflation, which excludes both food and energy components, is unsettlingly high, growing 2.3 percent over the year ended in June. Indeed, total inflation has exceeded core inflation pretty consistently for over five years, with both measures above 2 percent during much of this time. I view these persistently high rates of overall and core inflation as important concerns for monetary policy.\n\nMonetary Policy\nThis brings me to the discussion of how policy is set against the backdrop of such a challenging economic environment. I will begin with a somewhat general perspective. The Fed functions under a dual mandate to foster financial conditions that promote both maximum employment and price stability. Of course, maximum employment must be sustainable. This is usually interpreted as the level of employment that is consistent with a rate of growth that the real economy can maintain over time without leading to an increase in inflationary pressures. We refer to this rate as potential growth. Price stability, as former Chairman Greenspan often said, occurs when inflation does not significantly distort the economic behavior of households or businesses. Price stability does not mean that individual prices do not change. Inflation, in comparison, entails a widespread increase in prices across a broad spectrum of goods and services. I tend to view price stability as core inflation being in the narrow range of 1-1/2 to 2 percent, and the more volatile overall inflation rate also averaging in this neighborhood over longer periods of time.\nIn practice there are a number of uncertainties and risks that must be carefully weighed when implementing monetary policy. First, policymakers must carefully assess the rate of potential output growth, in large part by estimating the trends in two of its key determinants, productivity and working-age population growth. In recent years, these two factors suggest potential growth is in the range of 2-1/2 to 3 percent. Second, central bankers rely upon data to evaluate where current growth is relative to potential. But the economy is very complex, and we frequently receive conflicting signals. So, it can be difficult to appraise the current situation and project the economy's likely future course. Third, given the assessment of the outlook, the Fed determines if a more accommodative or more restrictive policy is warranted. Evaluating the sources of risk to growth and inflation is also an important part of this decision. Finally, we need to deal with the fact that monetary policy takes time to influence real economic activity and inflation. So, as new information comes in, we are often put in the position of needing to alter course before the full impact of our past policy actions are completely evident.\nThe current monetary policy environment is even more complicated than usual. If we were using battlefield language to describe our situation, this would be a \"three-front conflict.\" Although real activity is weak, we also are simultaneously experiencing bad news on the inflation front in the form of higher energy and commodity prices. This creates the challenge of facilitating the economy's return toward more favorable growth rates without igniting greater inflationary pressures. The financial turmoil and subsequent tightening of credit conditions add another dimension of difficulty to the problem. I will return to this momentarily. But first let me discuss the economic outlook and how it is shaping policy decisions.\n\nEconomic Outlook\nFour times a year FOMC participants provide projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and the inflation rate for the current and following two years. The most recent projections were submitted at the June FOMC meeting. In general, the Committee's opinion was that growth had been somewhat stronger in the first half of the year than had been originally anticipated. Even so, the consensus view was that the economy would expand slowly over the next several quarters. However, participants continued to see significant downside risks to the forecast for growth. The Committee expected higher near-term headline and core inflation, largely due to the effects of recent high prices for energy and other commodities.\nSince these forecasts were made, I think the risks for growth have increased and the risks for inflation remain elevated and a concern. The detail underlying the GDP data and recent numbers for July point to some weakness in growth, particularly after the effects of the recent tax rebates recede. Consumption fell in June after adjusting for inflation. U.S. car and truck production and sales declined significantly further this spring, and the figures for July continued this trend. It is difficult, however, to know how much of the declines reflect cyclical economic weakness and how much are related to structural factors such as higher fuel costs and an unfavorable product mix. Financial markets remain under considerable stress. Labor markets have deteriorated further, and the housing market outlook continues to be uncertain. But inventories are in good shape in most industries. And net exports remain a solid positive, although export growth may taper off some given the softer economic outlook for some of our major trading partners. Despite these risks, as we move forward, I see real GDP growth returning near potential by 2010—somewhere in the range of 2-1/2 to 3 percent.\nWhile energy and commodity prices have moderated somewhat, both headline and core inflation remain high. Some measures of expectations for future inflation remain uncomfortably elevated. As energy prices level out and economic growth remains modest, I think inflation should moderate over the medium term, with PCE headline inflation declining to around 2 percent by 2010. Clearly, this forecast hinges upon developments in energy and commodity prices, as well as containing expectations of future inflation. Both of these present risks to the outlook.\n\nPolicy Setting\nThis environment presents substantial challenges to monetary policy. As you know, since last September, the Fed has lowered the fed funds rate from 5-1/4 to 2 percent. At the time, most forecasters' baseline outlook was for marked sluggishness in real economic activity. But forecasters also recognized the possibility of falling asset prices severely constricting credit and potentially intensifying and spreading the slowdown in the housing market into something much more widespread and acute. The Fed determined it prudent to take preemptive action in response to the unfolding situation. Our 325-basis-point cumulative cut in the funds rate was larger than we otherwise might have done in order to insure against the unlikely event of a severe downturn. That said, even though I think the current 2 percent funds rate is accommodative, it is not especially stimulative. This is because the financial market turmoil has meant that our funds rate reductions have led to less credit expansion to households and businesses than typically would be the case.\nIndeed, it has become increasingly clear to me that the fed funds rate alone is neither an adequate nor even an entirely appropriate tool for addressing instability in the financial markets. Further reductions in the fed funds rate could help provide additional liquidity to financial markets as a whole, but not necessarily to the most distressed portions of the market. And, in principle, if pushed too far, excess policy accommodation over an extended period of time would risk igniting inflation expectations. However, the ongoing challenges in financial markets indicate the continued need for substantial liquidity in order to facilitate their functioning and to ensure adequate funding for creditworthy businesses and households.\nAccordingly, the Federal Reserve has created several special lending facilities aimed at providing financial markets with liquidity and promoting orderly financial adjustments. Since last August, we have introduced the Term Discount Window, the Term Auction Facility, the Term Securities Lending Facility, the Term Options Program, and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility. Collectively these innovations are designed to increase market liquidity by lengthening Federal Reserve lending terms, by reducing the cost of borrowing relative to the fed funds rate, by expanding the range of eligible counterparties, and by enlarging the pool of eligible collateral. I should note that in order to provide the Fed with a cushion against credit risk, the value of collateral backing the loans at these facilities is set at a discount from the latest market prices for the pledged assets. These facilities have helped stabilize short-term credit markets somewhat and have injected much needed liquidity into the financial system. The success of these facilities—which, I would like to emphasize, should be measured against the list of feasible outcomes they can achieve—should help financial markets work through their problems over time.\nAt our meeting this past week the Fed left the benchmark fed funds rate unchanged at 2 percent. Of course, we policymakers must continuously reevaluate our policies to reflect current and forecasted conditions, and to ensure our assessments of risks are aligned to meet our long-term policy objectives. As I just discussed, from the perspective of last January, the real economy has performed better than was predicted. And while the second half of 2008 will likely be extremely sluggish, the risk of a severe slowdown seems less likely today than predicted at the beginning of the year. In addition, as I also noted, there is clearly an increased risk to inflation. Headline inflation has exceeded core inflation for an extended period of time, and even the latter has been above 2 percent for some time.\nIn evaluating inflation risks, we must be concerned about energy and food prices being passed through to core inflation. We run the risk of persistent widespread price increases being built into the expectations of households and businesses, and thus producing persistently higher bases for both inflation measures. Some have taken comfort in the fact that inflation has not yet been built into wage growth as evidence that inflationary expectations have not risen. But I am less sanguine because research indicates that by the time we have statistical confirmation that wages are increasing at rates higher than the rate of growth of productivity, a persistent rise in inflation most likely would already be in train.\nThere are clearly risks to the inflation outlook if expectations do not remain grounded. Any increase in inflation expectations would pose a risk to achieving our dual goals of price stability and maximum sustainable growth.\n\nConclusion\nThe current economic landscape poses a three-front conflict for policymakers: sluggish economic conditions with depressed housing and auto markets, rising inflation risks with high oil and commodity prices, and financial distress that is restraining credit growth. To date, relatively accommodative monetary policy has taken out insurance against downside risks of disorderly financial adjustment turning into a severe economic downturn. But rising inflation risks at a time of economic weakness present some difficult challenges for policy. At this point many financial market liquidity problems are being addressed through our special lending facilities. These additional tools allow our policy actions with regard to the fed funds rate to focus on broader macroeconomic goals—these are our commitment to price stability and sustainable growth.\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

            "content": "Thank you for inviting me to speak today and for that very kind introduction. I'm delighted to be here this morning to share my thoughts on the economy during this challenging period. I'd like to say a special thank you to Maria Coons, a former Chicago Fed employee and member of our extended Fed family. I'd also like to extend my personal thanks to Rita and John Canning. Rita serves as a member of Harper's Board of Trustees and John is the Chairman of our Chicago Fed Board of Directors. Maria, Rita, and John all helped to arrange my visit here today.\nIn the course of my remarks today, I will address the subject of monetary policymaking during times of financial stress. I would like to note that the views discussed today are my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or my other colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nPolicymaking\nThe Federal Reserve has a dual mandate: We are charged with fostering financial conditions that promote both maximum employment and price stability. We attempt to achieve these goals primarily by setting an appropriate target for the federal funds rate. That's the interest rate at which banks make overnight loans to each other. The fed funds rate influences to varying degrees the entire array of market interest rates, including those paid by businesses and consumers.\nUnder normal circumstances, financial markets efficiently channel funds from lenders to borrowers, appropriately supporting the spending capacity of households and businesses. But as we have seen over the past nine months, at times financial disruptions can occur. Such disruptions can hinder the flow of financial capital to creditworthy borrowers and reduce their ability to consume and invest. Accordingly, such situations pose special challenges for policymakers.\nAt this point, a review of the recent market turmoil is probably helpful. After a period of rapid increases, by the summer of 2007 home prices had leveled off and were starting to decline in some markets. Subprime borrowers, who may have been counting on rising home equity, began to default in significant numbers.\nComplicating these developments were the widespread securitization of mortgages and the repackaging of these securities into highly complex financial instruments known as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Securitization and CDOs have turned out to be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, they diversified risk among many lenders. On the other hand, their complexity made it difficult to track losses and properly value the portfolios of many financial institutions. This lack of transparency contributed to the deterioration of financial market conditions, leading to a re-pricing of risk and a widening of credit spreads across a broad spectrum of financial securities. For example, not only did the value of mortgage-backed CDOs fall sharply, but market participants began to question the value of other complex securities, even those with no subprime exposure. Furthermore, many borrowers had to turn to very short-term financing as lenders were unwilling to commit funds at normal terms because of uncertainty over collateral valuation and other counterparty risks.\nIn the banking sector, in addition to suffering losses on subprime-related securities, banks were forced to take additional risky assets back onto their books, which further strained their capital positions. This has made them more reluctant to lend.\nSo, in summary, in both the bank and securities markets, many creditworthy borrowers have found credit much more expensive or sometimes even unavailable at any reasonable price. In turn, this has weighed on real economic activity.\n\nSetting the Stance of Monetary Policy\nI'd like to now turn to how we implement policy. In doing so, I will start by discussing how I evaluate three key factors determining where we set the federal funds rate: These are maximum employment, price stability, and the neutral funds rate. I will then turn to how financial stress impacts our policy decisions.\n\nMaximum Employment\nIn order for the economy to achieve maximum employment over the long run, it needs to grow at its maximum sustainable rate, which is also referred to as the rate of growth of potential output. This is the maximum rate of real growth the economy can maintain in the long run without leading to an increase in inflationary pressures. Sustainable growth is determined by the underlying trends in two factors—first, the availability of labor resources, and second, the productivity of those labor resources. Although these underlying trends are unobservable—and can change over time—at the Chicago Fed, our current analysis of them suggests that sustainable growth currently is somewhere in the range of 2-1/2 percent per year. Most other analysts' estimates fall in the 2-1/4 to 3 percent range.\n\nPrice Stability\nOur other—and equally important policy goal—is price stability. In some sense, price stability is achieved when inflation does not significantly distort the economic behavior of households or businesses. Recently, the FOMC further improved transparency by reporting forecasts more frequently and extending the forecasts' horizon to three years. As stated in the FOMC minutes, participants' forecasts for this third year are \"importantly influenced by their judgments about measured rates of inflation consistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate... and about the time frame over which policy should aim to attain those rates given current economic conditions.\" 1 In January, policymakers' forecasts for 2010 had growth in the range of most economists' views for potential and had inflation—measured by both the total Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE, Price Index and the PCE index excluding food and energy—in the range of 1-1/2 to 2 percent. This suggests that most policymakers view price stability as being somewhere in the neighborhood of 1-1/2 to 2 percent.\n\nNeutral Funds Rate\nBefore we go any further, I'd like to describe you how I think about monetary policy in general terms. To evaluate the stance of policy, I start by focusing on the real fed funds rate—that is, the nominal rate less expected inflation—and where it currently stands relative to a hypothetical longer-run benchmark called the neutral real funds rate. The neutral funds rate is the rate consistent with an economy operating at its potential growth path and with stable inflation. There are many factors and uncertainties involved in assessing the neutral rate. With such caveats in mind, I think the neutral long-run real fed funds rate is somewhere in the neighborhood of 2 to 2-1/2 percent.\nReal rates above this 2 to 2-1/2 percent neutral point tend to restrict aggregate demand, while real rates below this mark are accommodative and boost aggregate spending. Of course, the real fed funds rate is only one factor affecting liquidity and credit conditions. As we have seen recently, other credit market developments can work to offset or exaggerate the impulse from monetary policy.\n\nCurrent Stance of Monetary Policy\nNow that I have provided some background for how I approach monetary policy issues, let's talk about the current situation.\n\nMarket Turmoil\nAs I discussed earlier, the disruptions in financial markets that began last August have greatly restricted the flow and increased the price of credit and liquidity. Clearly, this has complicated policymaking. Usually, when we decrease the fed funds rate, all short-term interest rates fall by a similar amount. These in turn feed through and affect interest rates across all maturities. As rates adjust, private markets also update their views on credit risks, and these show through to changes in risk spreads between private borrowing rates and those on risk-free Treasury debt.\nFinancial stress alters this mechanism: It has boosted the risk premia built into private borrowing rates and substantially increased the demand for liquid assets that can be easily turned into cash and used to pay liabilities. An important example of these effects can be seen in the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, which is a measure of short-term lending rates between banks. LIBOR is important because it is a common benchmark for many other rates, including those on adjustable rate mortgages and auto loans. The 30-day LIBOR is normally only about 10 basis points above the level of the fed funds rate expected to prevail over the term of the loan. 2 However, the recent financial market stress has pushed its average over 60 basis points above the expected funds rate; also, this spread has been highly volatile and at one point was over 100 basis points. Because of this increased spread, many borrowers have paid higher rates than would ordinarily have been the case given the level of the fed funds rate.\n\nNew Lending Facilities\nThe current financial circumstances have added a new dimension to the challenge of monetary policy, and policy has responded in a number of ways. First, we have aggressively reduced the federal funds rate by 325 basis points since September 2007. Second, we have implemented a number of innovative initiatives to increase liquidity in strained financial markets.\nThe new policies include changes to the Federal Reserve's discount window, through which depository institutions have always had access to overnight loans. Since 2002, the rate of interest we charge borrowers, the primary credit rate, had been set 100 basis points higher than the target federal funds rate. However, while we don't view use of the window negatively, historically banks have been reluctant to use the facility for fear that it would signal weakness or some operational miscalculation. To encourage use of the window, we reduced the wedge between the primary credit rate and the funds rate and allowed borrowing for terms of up to 90 days. We also instituted the new Term Auction Facility, which is an alternative market-based auction system for depositories to borrow at term from the window.\nThe recent disruptions in financial markets also have caused serious liquidity problems for another important conduit for channeling credit, the primary security dealers, which include several major investment banks. To address these problems, the Fed established the Term Securities Lending Facility and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility to lend to them. Since the dealers are nondepository institutions, these loans required the Fed to invoke its authority to lend to nonbanks under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. Under this act, such lending is only permissible under \"unusual and exigent circumstances.\" Such loans are the first extensions of credit by the Federal Reserve to nondepository institutions since the 1930s. Our recent actions regarding Bear Stearns were also authorized by this act.\nFinally, we have consulted closely with foreign central banks during this period. In particular, we instituted swap arrangements with both the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank to help provide dollar-denominated liquidity to European banks.\nTogether, all of these initiatives have lowered short-term market interest rates, reduced the cost and lengthened the maximum term of banks' borrowing directly from the Fed, broadened eligible collateral, and expanded lending to nondepository institutions.\n\nImplications for Traditional Monetary Policy\nSo how does all of this affect policy? I think it is helpful at this point to note some similarities to the period following the recession of late 1990 and early 1991. You might recall that after the deregulation of the Savings and Loan industry, many S&Ls made imprudent real estate loans. The ensuing losses substantially reduced the lending capacity of the industry as insolvent S&Ls went out of business and others were forced to recapitalize. In addition, banks were reluctant to lend as they struggled to bring their capital in line with the then new risk-based standards set by the Basel I Accords. These restructurings created financial headwinds that made the recovery from recession frustratingly slow. In fact this period was later characterized as a \"jobless recovery.\"\nToday, banks again are recapitalizing after making imprudent loans; and again, they are doing so in the face of a sluggish economy. However, one key difference is that today much more overall lending activity is securitized. This has spread losses among a wider swath of financial institutions and has made it more difficult to quantify losses. As a result, we have seen a broader disruption of credit flows, even than those of the early 1990s. This suggests we may again be in for a period of weak growth.\nNow let's consider the stance of policy. Today, the nominal funds rate is at 2 percent. In January, projections FOMC members made for PCE inflation in the medium term were in the range of 1-3/4 to 2-1/4 percent. This means the real fed funds rate is close to zero or perhaps slightly negative. Looking back at the early 1990s, the nominal funds rate bottomed out at 3 percent in 1992. Given the higher inflation expectations at the time, this also translated into a real funds rate that probably was close to zero—just like today.\nIn normal times, a real funds rate near or below zero would be considered highly accommodative. However, then, as now, the boost to aggregate demand from the accommodative funds rate was offset to some degree by financial market turmoil. Because we think the disruptions today are more significant than in the early 1990s, this offset also is larger today. In contrast, today we have in place the various additional measures that provide extra liquidity. No such facilities were in place in the early 1990s. It is difficult to weigh the various factors. But with this difficulty in mind, and given my reading today of economic prospects, my judgment is that the current net stance of monetary policy is accommodative—and this is appropriate in order to address the way we currently see the sluggish economy unfolding in 2008. I also believe that the current stance roughly balances out substantial risks to the outlooks for both growth and inflation—which I see as being to the downside for growth and to the upside for inflation.\n\nEconomic Outlook\nLet's now turn to the outlook for growth and inflation.\n\nCurrent Economic Situation\nAs you may know, real gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of just 0.6 percent in the first quarter of the year. This was the same sluggish rate as in the fourth quarter of 2007. Not surprisingly much of this weakness stemmed from the household sector, as residential investment declined at an annual rate of almost 27 percent and personal consumption grew well below its long-run average. Slower income growth, falling consumer sentiment, higher food and energy prices, lower housing and equity wealth, and tighter credit conditions are all restraining household spending, and are likely to do so in the near term. And, importantly, the labor market has softened. Nonfarm payroll employment fell an average of 80,000 jobs per month in the first quarter and dropped an additional 20,000 in April. And these losses came on the heels of a steady decline in job growth over the course of 2007.\nIn the business sector, spending on equipment, software, and structures declined at a 2-1/2 percent rate in the first quarter, reflecting tighter credit conditions and less need to expand capacity in a slower economic environment. One bright spot has been net exports. The weaker dollar, which is down around 25 percent since 2002, as well as continued growth abroad, has kept exports rising at a solid rate; last quarter, they grew 5.5 percent.\nInflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in core PCE prices, was 2 percent in the first quarter of 2008. But once we include the volatile food and energy components, total PCE inflation was 3.4 percent.\n\nFuture Economic Outlook\nLooking ahead, our outlook at the Chicago Fed is for continued weakness in real GDP over the near term. Activity is likely to remain weak for a number of reasons. Strains on intermediation and financial balance sheets mean that credit conditions will likely continue to restrict spending for some time. Businesses and consumers could limit their discretionary expenditures because of caution over the economic environment. And housing continues to be a downside factor. The unsold inventory of homes will continue to restrain residential investment, and it will take time for this overhang to unwind.\nHowever, eventually the cumulative adjustments in house prices will bring more buyers into the market and activity will stabilize. While we don't expect any significant contributions to growth from residential construction for some time, the drag from the sector ought to at least diminish as we move through the rest of this year and next. Similarly, as financial market participants revalue portfolios and repair their balance sheets, the drag from credit conditions ought to diminish over time. Furthermore, even given the financial turmoil, the stance of monetary policy is accommodative and supportive of growth. Productivity growth, although below the lofty rates enjoyed in the late 1990s and earlier this decade, is still solid. Finally, the effects of the fiscal stimulus bill are likely to boost spending in 2008.\nSumming all of these factors, we think conditions will improve in the second half of this year, but not enough to prevent economic activity from still running at a relatively sluggish pace. We expect real GDP growth will return close to potential as we move through 2009.\nRegarding the outlook for inflation, we project improvement over the medium term, with core inflation in the range of 1-1/2 to 2 percent by 2010. This forecast assumes that the resource slack being generated by the current weakness in the real economy will work to offset the cost pressures from higher energy and commodity prices. Productivity also is a plus in holding down costs. For example, although compensation increased 3.4 percent over the past year, overall unit labor costs changed very little because workers were quite productive. Productivity, which is the amount of output per hour worked, grew at a quite healthy 3.2 percent rate.\nOur forecast also assumes—in line with current readings from futures markets—that energy and commodity prices will stabilize some time over the medium term. Clearly, there are risks to the inflation outlook if this stabilization does not occur. We also could be adversely affected by higher prices for imported goods. Finally, although the persistently high readings of commodity, food, and energy prices do not appear to have had a major impact on longer-run inflation expectations, we have to be mindful of their potential to do so. Any increase in inflation expectations would pose an important risk to the achievement of price stability.\n\nConclusion\nTo conclude, the U.S. economy has experienced some very large shocks since mid-2007, and economic policy, including monetary, fiscal, and financial, has responded aggressively to address the strains in the economy and financial markets. In my opinion, monetary policy is accommodative and appropriately situated to address the substantial risks that remain both for sluggish economic activity as well as unwelcome inflationary pressures.\nIt is important to recognize that monetary policy influences economic activity and inflation with a lag. Furthermore, given the challenging financial circumstances, it seems likely that credit conditions will also require adjustment time, as financial institutions reevaluate their portfolios and capital needs. As a result, the level of uncertainty regarding future developments continues to be high and the path forward may be uneven. We must keep this in mind as we evaluate the outlook. I am confident that policymakers will continue to respond to future unexpected changes in the environment for growth and inflation as needed in order to promote sustainable growth and price stability.\n\nNotes\n1 Summary of Economic Projections in the Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, January 29–30, 2008, page 5.\n2 The expected fed funds rate can be measured by the overnight index swap (OIS) rate.\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you for inviting me to share my thoughts about the economy and the financial circumstances we are currently facing. About a month ago I was in New York to discuss monetary policy in light of financial market conditions. As part of a very lively discussion, the group addressed the question of whether the Federal Reserve had appropriate tools to address financial market disruptions. Since that time, we have seen ongoing turmoil in financial markets as well as indicators of weakening real activity, and the Fed has responded by lowering the fed funds rate and by taking a number of innovative steps to target liquidity conditions in financial markets.\nIn the course of my remarks today, I will address how I have approached policymaking in this challenging environment. I will then go on to discuss current economic conditions and our expectations for future developments in light of the policies that we have implemented since August. As always, these are my own views and not those of the FOMC or my other colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nDuring both normal times and periods of financial stress, monetary policy decisions depend on the prospects for our mandated policy goals of stable prices and maximum employment. Fortunately, periods of financial stress are relatively rare in economies with strong commitments to price stability and low variability in economic activity. During normal times, the conduct of monetary policy will account for financial conditions as part of our standard evaluation of macroeconomic prospects, and the usual approaches to policy generally serve us quite well. However, during the rare periods of emerging or even actual financial stress, policy actions that are more directly related to the changing circumstances in financial markets may need to be taken. Even in such cases, monetary policy must focus on our macroeconomic goals over the medium term. But now the weighing of risks to growth and inflation must also carefully account for the risk that poorly functioning financial markets will disrupt real economic activity.\nWhen thinking about policy adjustments during normal times, a useful benchmark is the line of research on policy rules pioneered by John Taylor. This research indicates that most historical policy actions have been systematic responses to changes in the prospects for our goal variables of output growth, employment, and inflation. The main ideas are the systematic response component, and that particular rules are benchmarks for typical policy. Financial developments typically play a role in these systematic responses through the normal effects of changes in the funds rate on other credit conditions that affect the real economy.\nOf course, even Taylor's research points out that periods of financial stress may require policy responses that differ from the usual prescriptions. It's not that we downgrade our focus on the policy goals. It is that during these times we often are highly uncertain about how unusual financial market conditions will influence inflation and economic activity. In some cases, the baseline outlook may be only modestly affected by these conditions, but there may be risks of substantial spillovers that could lead to persistent declines in credit intermediation capacity or large declines in wealth. These in turn would reduce business and household spending. In such cases, policy may take out insurance against these adverse risks and move the policy rate more than the usual prescriptions of the Taylor Rule. If the downside spillovers do materialize, then policy may have to be recalibrated further.\nPart of our job as a central bank is to properly price these insurance premiums against the achievement of maximum employment and price stability over the medium term. And if further policy adjustments become necessary, they need to take into account the insurance that is already in place. In addition, when risks subside, promptly moving policy to appropriate levels will reiterate and reinforce our commitment to our fundamental policy goals.\nNow, let me discuss how I see financial markets and financial stability fitting into our policy goals. There is no analogy in financial markets to macroeconomic price stability. The prices of financial products may change quite substantially when new information arrives. Indeed, one of the most important activities of financial markets is price discovery—the efficient assimilation of all available information into asset values. This promotes the appropriate allocation of capital among competing demands and supports maximum sustainable growth. And it is this efficient functioning of markets that is our concern with regard to financial stability.\nMost of the time, monetary policy and financial markets intersect directly at our primary policy tool, the federal funds rate. To alter the trajectory of inflation and economic growth toward their goals, changes in the federal funds rate directly alter short-term risk-free rates of interest. Perceptions of our willingness and ability to adjust future policy then may also alter risk premiums in fixed-income markets and result in a change in the cost of financial credit to numerous other borrowers.\nWhen the economy is weak and we lower rates to stimulate activity, projects that previously had too much risk relative to their expected return become more attractive for two reasons: The future returns may look better, and the financing costs are lower. And this may be a good thing if, for example, it can help stimulate an economy that is mired in a situation where overcautious businesses or households are holding back on investment and spending.\nAs an aside, gauging the appropriate level of caution by businesses and households at any given time is difficult. Simply observing decisions and investments as they are made is not enough. For example, in an environment where uncertainty is high and market liquidity is low, only investment projects that reduce the overall risk profile of the firm or that have a very high probability of success may seem worthwhile. Of course, in the end, the investment strategy may turn out to be more cautious than had been understood ex ante. The greater caution could be due to overly negative assessments of the size of the investment payoffs, or the level of diversification achieved by the portfolio as the returns to the various investments turn out to be less correlated than had been feared and market conditions normalize.\nNow, let me return to how policy can deal with financial disruptions. At times, adjusting the federal funds rate may not be enough to address the special circumstances we face in financial markets, particularly with regard to liquidity and the smooth functioning of markets. When markets are illiquid, uncertainty about asset values is large. In these circumstances, lenders are often unwilling to accept hard-to-value and illiquid assets as collateral, and as a result, market participants find it increasingly difficult to convert these illiquid, but otherwise sound, assets into cash or cash-like instruments. This in turn complicates the process of price discovery, increases uncertainty, and poses additional risks to real economic activity. Our recent policy innovations have been designed to address these effects of illiquidity directly.\nWe have several ways to add liquidity to the economy in addition to normal open market operations: the discount window, extended to term borrowing, and the new and now expanded Term Auction Facility, as well as foreign exchange swaps to help enhance liquidity abroad. In these operations, we accept collateral others see as less readily marketable. I should note that we apply the standard discount window \"haircuts\" in our treatment of the collateral.\nMore recently, the establishment of the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) extended the term of the existing dealer securities lending program from overnight to 28 days and expanded the set of acceptable collateral. On March 16, we created a lending facility to extend overnight credit directly to primary dealers. This facility, known as the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, or PDCF, will be in place for at least six months and may be renewed as conditions warrant. These loans would be collateralized by a broad range of investment-grade debt securities, again with appropriate \"haircuts.\" Since the primary dealers include some nondepository institutions, the PDCF required the Fed to invoke its authority under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act to lend to nonbanks in \"unusual and exigent circumstances,\" when the borrower is not able to \"secure adequate credit accommodations from other banking institutions.\" The Fed's policy actions in mid-March represented the first invocation of this authority since the Great Depression.\nTogether these policy actions expand our role by providing liquidity in exchange for sound but less liquid securities. These policy innovations share important features of increasing both the term and the quantity of our lending and making additional quantities of highly liquid Treasury securities available to financial intermediaries. This is intended to reduce uncertainty among financial institutions and allow them to meet the liquidity needs of their clients.\nWhile these policy actions represent major innovations in practice, they are in the spirit of the oldest traditions of central banking. As described by Walter Bagehot in his 1873 treatise Lombard Street, the job of the central bank is to \"lend freely, against good collateral\" whenever there is a shortage of liquidity in markets.\n\nReview of the Current Economic Situation\nLet me now turn to our assessment of the current economic situation and how the policy actions I've been discussing could impact the outlook going forward.\nIn assessing the extent of the current slowdown, I find it useful to look at an index we developed at the Chicago Fed several years ago to summarize the information in a large number of monthly indicators of economic activity. The index is the Chicago Fed National Activity Index, or CFNAI. An index value of zero is consistent with trend growth in overall GDP. The three-month moving average of the CFNAI was -0.87 in February, suggesting little or no economic growth over the last few months.\nThese challenges are evident in other recent indicators as well. The labor market, for example, weakened substantially in February with overall nonfarm payroll employment dropping 63,000 and private employment falling by 101,000. The unemployment rate edged down to 4.8 percent, but this was due to a drop in the labor force.\nConsumption growth is also below its long-run average, growing at an annual rate of 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007 and softening further early this year. Slower income growth, falling consumer sentiment, high food and energy prices, lower housing and equity wealth, and tighter credit conditions are all restraining consumer activity and are likely to do so for at least the near term.\nGrowth in business investment likely is moderating as well, reflecting tighter credit conditions and less need to expand capacity in a slower economic environment. However, some impetus to demand should come from advances in high-tech equipment. One plus for recovery is that inventory-sales ratios remain low. This suggests that any inventory corrections may be limited.\nAnd a bright spot has been net exports. The weaker dollar (down 30 percent since 2002) and continued growth abroad has kept exports growing at a healthy rate. We have seen notable contributions to growth from the declining trade deficit in 2007, and prospects are good for additional contributions as we move through 2008.\nTaking all of this into consideration, our outlook at the Chicago Fed is for weakness in real GDP this year, particularly in the first half of the year. However, we think conditions will improve in the second half of the year.\nA number of factors will likely hold back activity for some time. The strains on credit intermediation and financial balance sheets mean that credit conditions will likely restrict spending. The large overhang of unsold homes will continue to restrain residential investment. Greater caution on the part of businesses and consumers will likely limit increases in their discretionary expenditures as well. Because financial issues are being worked out against the backdrop of a soft economy, we also have to recognize the risk that interactions between the two might reinforce the weakness in the economy.\nNonetheless, other factors point to improvement later in the year. We have lowered the federal funds rate by 300 basis points since September. At 2.25 percent, the current federal funds rate is accommodative and should support stronger growth. Indeed, because monetary policy works with a lag, the effects of last fall's rate cuts are probably just beginning to be felt, and the cumulative declines should do more to promote growth going forward.\nThe effects of the fiscal stimulus bill also are likely to boost spending in the second and third quarters of 2008.\nIn addition, there is productivity. Productivity is the fundamental determinant of growth in the longer run—it determines how we can turn labor and capital inputs into the goods and services we consume and invest. The good news here is that, while it is not as robust as it was in the late 1990s and early this decade, the underlying trend in productivity in the U.S. economy is still solid. This trend provides a sound base for production and income generation to move forward over the longer haul.\nThe economy's inherent resiliency and internal adjustment mechanisms will also work to support growth. One part of the internal adjustment process centers on housing. As house prices fall, more buyers will find it worthwhile to enter the market. Eventually, price adjustments will stabilize supply and demand, and the drag from residential construction on the economy will subside. In the current situation, another important part of the internal adjustment process is the work the financial sector is doing in \"price discovery,\" that is, the process of determining the proper valuation of assets in light of changes in their expected cash flows and risks to these flows. In addition, intermediaries will do more work in restoring their balance sheets. Together, these activities will eventually reduce strains on the real economy from financial conditions. While there are ongoing challenges, this process has and will be facilitated by our recent initiatives to bolster liquidity and promote orderly market functioning.\nAlthough most of the recent concern about the U.S. economy has been focused on growth, we must also be mindful of inflationary pressures. The news here has been somewhat disappointing. We have experienced large increases in food and energy prices, and other commodity prices are high. In addition, we are hearing numerous anecdotes of firms passing on cost increases to their downstream customers, and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen. The recent numbers on core inflation—that is, inflation excluding food and energy—have also moved up some over the past several months. Core PCE inflation is now at 2.2 percent—a higher rate than I would like to see in the long run.\nI want to emphasize here that, while we often talk about inflation in terms of the core measure, we are concerned about maintaining the purchasing power over all of the goods and services consumed by households. Accordingly, our goal of price stability must be defined in terms of total inflation. Traditionally, we have found it useful to concentrate on the core measure because it gave us a less noisy reading of longer-run trends in inflation; in turn, this reflected the tendency for food and energy prices to be volatile in the short run, but to generally average out to the same as core over the medium term. However, if outsized increases in food and energy prices persist, then core becomes a less useful medium-term guide to inflation trends. Furthermore, persistent food and energy price increases will find their way into inflation expectations, which in turn would boost core measures. So the recent developments in food and energy prices are a concern that deserves careful monitoring.\nThat said, our forecast is for inflation to moderate over the next two years with a leveling out of energy and commodity prices and an easing of pressures on resource utilization due to the slower pace of economic activity. Still, our uncertainty about the inflation outlook has increased, and we will continue to monitor inflation developments very carefully.\nTo conclude, it is important to remember that the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate—working to foster financial conditions that help the economy obtain maximum sustainable employment and price stability. As the Committee noted in the policy statement following the March FOMC meeting, though downside risks to growth remain, the policy actions taken in March, in combination with earlier moves, should help to promote moderate growth over time and moderate the risks to economic activity. Looking ahead, my policy views will depend on the evolution of these risks, as well as how developments influence the price stability component of our dual mandate over the medium term.\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

            "content": "I would like to compliment the organizers for posing a very challenging set of questions for the panel to address. Although you will quickly notice that I am not going to respond to each question explicitly, I will address what I think are the key issues. And in doing so, I think you will see how I have approached monetary policy decision-making during the challenging environment that has inspired these questions. As always, these are my own views and not those of the FOMC or my other colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe four questions for the panel can be boiled down to two broad issues:\nWhen and how does excessive risk-taking lead to a degree of financial instability that substantially complicates the conduct of monetary policy?\nAre current policy tools adequate to deal with this instability?\nLet me start by summarizing my views. First, because periods of financial stress are relatively rare in economies with strong commitments to price stability and low variability in economic activity, the normal approaches to monetary policy—as summarized by the Taylor Rule—generally serve us quite well. Second, during periods of nascent or even actual financial stress, it is appropriate for policy to maintain its focus on obtaining its macroeconomic goals over the medium term. Third, timely access to substantive information about financial market participants' activities is a critical aid to policymakers when assessing disruptions to the credit intermediation process that could adversely affect the real economy. In the United States, the Fed's supervisory responsibilities have been a helpful tool in obtaining such information.\nBefore I go on, allow me to quibble with the term \"excessive risk-taking.\" As we all know, it is difficult to define what \"excessive\" is.\nWe need to bear in mind that risk-taking is an important ingredient in economic growth and the efficient allocation of resources. Developing new technologies and their applications requires creativity and a willingness to take risks. Some innovators will succeed and invent great things, and some will fail. Resources will flow to the successful innovators, which boosts productivity and economic growth. Workers also take risks, choosing new careers and job opportunities to improve their standard of living. Clearly risk-taking is an important ingredient in well-functioning competitive economies, and living standards are enhanced by such activities.\nBut when is this risk-taking \"excessive\" and when could it have large downside economic effects? This is difficult to know simply by observing the decisions and investments as they are made. For example, a large investment project may appear to be relatively safe when the probability of its success is judged to be high. In addition, the investment might be part of a larger diversified strategy designed to reduce the overall risk profile of the firm. Of course, in the end the investment strategy may turn out to be more risky than understood ex ante. The greater risk could be due to overly optimistic assessments of the likelihood of the investment payoffs or the lack of diversification achieved by the portfolio as the returns to the various investments turn out to be more correlated than had been anticipated.\nThe financial developments that spawned some of last summer's turmoil in subprime mortgage markets have some of these properties. The extent to which risk-taking was excessive at the outset remains unclear. But the important question for today is whether our policy responses to these events in themselves will lead to further excesses at some point in the future. There is no way to answer this question for sure. But I think that we can minimize the potential for problems if monetary policy focuses clearly on our legislative mandate to facilitate financial conditions that promote effectively the goals of maximum employment and price stability.\nNow, let me discuss how I see financial markets and financial stability fitting into our policy objectives. There is no analogy in financial markets to macroeconomic price stability. The prices of financial products may change quite substantially when new information arrives. Indeed, one of the most important activities of financial markets is price discovery—the efficient assimilation of all available information into asset values. This promotes the appropriate allocation of capital among competing demands and supports maximum sustainable growth. And it is this efficient functioning of markets that is our concern with regard to financial stability.\nMost of the time, monetary policy intersects financial markets directly at our primary policy tool—the federal funds rate. To alter the trajectory of inflation and economic growth towards their goals, changes in the federal funds rate directly alter short-term risk-free rates of interest. Perceptions of our willingness and ability to adjust future policy then may also alter risk premiums in fixed-income markets and result in a change in the cost of financial credit to numerous other borrowers.\nWhen the economy is weak and we lower rates to stimulate activity, we encourage risk-taking. This is a natural consequence of lowering rates. At the margin, projects which previously had too much risk relative to their expected return become more attractive for two reasons: The future returns may look better and the financing costs are lower. And this may be a good thing, for example, if it can help stimulate an economy that is mired in a situation where overcautious businesses or households are holding back on investment and spending. These actions would further reduce macroeconomic risk.\nHowever, in principle, these effects could go too far and encourage too much risk–taking. How would we know? In my mind, we would begin to see imbalances emerge that would put our policy goals at risk over the medium term. For example, in the late 1990s, we felt that the increases in household wealth—much of it related to the booming stock market—were causing spending to outstrip the economy's productive capacity at that time and posing a threat to price stability.\nWhen thinking about policy adjustments, a useful benchmark is the line of research on policy rules pioneered by John Taylor. This research indicates that most historical policy actions have been systematic responses to changes in the prospects for our goal variables of output growth, employment, and inflation. The main ideas are the systematic response component, and that particular rules are benchmarks for typical policy. Financial developments play a role in these systematic responses through the normal effects of changes in the funds rate on other credit conditions that affect the real economy. So policy responds to economic developments that affect the achievement of its goals. As long as the goals themselves are compatible with the structure of the economy, it is hard to see how the normal conduct of policy would generate excessive risk-taking.\nOf course, even Taylor's research points out that periods of financial stress may require policy responses that differ from the usual prescriptions. It's not that we downgrade our focus on the policy goals. It is that during these times we often are highly uncertain about how unusual financial market conditions will influence inflation and economic activity. The baseline outlook may be only modestly affected by the conditions, but there may be risks of substantial spillovers that could lead to persistent declines in credit intermediation capacity or large declines in wealth. These in turn would reduce business and household spending. In such cases, policy may take out insurance against these adverse risks and move the policy rate more than the usual prescriptions of the Taylor Rule.\nNow if we took out such insurance too liberally or too often, then private sector markets would change their views regarding policy and alter their base level of risk-taking. But in doing so, we likely would observe inflationary imbalances emerging or unusual volatility in output. So part of our job as a central bank is to properly price these insurance premiums against the achievement of maximum employment and price stability over the medium term. Importantly, when insurance proves to be no longer necessary, removing it promptly and recalibrating policy to appropriate levels will reiterate and reinforce our commitment to these fundamental policy goals. And if we are transparent so that markets understand that we will adhere to this strategy, such insurance-based monetary policy will not encourage excessive risk-taking.\nWe also must remember that we can't eliminate risk and uncertainty completely; nor would it be a good idea to do so. But by the same token, we don't want to add to uncertainty. The literature on asset bubble pricking is related to this discussion of excess risk-taking: Should a policymaker deflate a bubble before it becomes problematic? I am skeptical that we can identify bubbles with enough accuracy and know enough about how to act to say that we wouldn't have more failures than successes. Remember that in 1996, many commented that the stock market might be overvalued; however, the then unappreciated acceleration in productivity eventually justified even higher valuations. Furthermore, as former Chairman Greenspan [2004] noted, in order to make sure you burst a bubble, you have to attack it aggressively, because if your attack fails, it just gets bigger. And there are big risks to the real economy of making such large moves.\nI would now like to say a few words about the adequacy of our toolkit during periods of financial disruptions. We have several ways to add liquidity to the economy in addition to the normal open market operations: the discount window—extended to term borrowing and the new Term Auction Facility—and foreign exchange swaps to help enhance liquidity abroad. In these operations we accept as collateral assets that others see as less readily marketable. I do not think this adds undue risk since we only lend to qualified solvent institutions and the collateralization rates include appropriate haircuts on riskier assets. In addition, we sterilize the effects of the borrowings on aggregate reserves, so that the liquidity injections are done while maintaining the fed funds rate target. This keeps the funds rate at a level we see as consistent with achieving our announced policy goals.\nAnother tool we have is the ability to obtain timely information directly from financial market participants that can help us gauge the extent and potential fallouts of financial disruptions. One way we do so is through our role as a supervisor: Our experience here has given us a good base of understanding and timely access to a wide range of information regarding financial intermediaries' activities. This is important, since most financial crises involve developments in new or unusual products that affect the income flows and balance sheets of these institutions. There seem to be synergies from the knowledge we gain through supervision and the policy questions we are faced with during periods of unusual financial stress. In addition to information from banking entities, it is important to have information flows from other financial sector participants.\nThanks and I look forward to a lively discussion.\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

            "content": "Introduction\nI am delighted to be here today to share my thoughts about the economy and the financial circumstances we are currently facing.\nThough I have been president for only six months, I have had the extremely useful experience of attending Federal Open Market Committee meetings since 1995 — first, as a senior staffer, and since 2003, as the Bank's research director. Last September, as a newly installed Fed president, I was certainly looking forward with great anticipation to contributing to the discussion of monetary policy at the FOMC meetings. Considering everything that has happened since last summer, the safest comment I can make about this experience is, it's been everything I expected — and more.\nToday, I would like to share my thoughts on the state of the economy and the uncertainties over the outlook. I will be giving particular attention to the effects that a number of unusual and complex asset valuation issues may be having on the financial conditions faced by households and firms. As always, my remarks this afternoon represent my own opinions, and do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or those of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nReview of the Current Economic Situation\nOverall, the U.S. economy grew at a solid pace in 2006 and over the first three quarters of 2007. Real GDP rose at an average annual rate of 2-3/4 percent over this period — which is a bit above my assessment of the economy's long-run sustainable rate of growth. This gain was achieved despite a plunge in residential construction, which reduced growth by an average of 0.8 percentage points over this period. Overall GDP growth remained healthy because the rest of the economy was performing quite well: Business fixed investment and household consumption rose at solid rates, and the trade deficit fell, led by robust increases in exports.\nThis resilience of overall economic growth in the face of significant sectoral challenges is part of a long-running story. Since the mid-1980s, the U.S. has been in the midst of what economists call the Great Moderation, in which fluctuations in overall GDP and inflation have been smaller than they were over the previous 40 years. Improvements in productivity, better policy, and some good luck appear to have made aggregate activity more resilient to the shocks that have hit individual sectors of the economy.\nBut that resilience continues to be challenged by new developments. Today we are faced with the challenges presented by the recent turmoil in financial markets. By now, this story is familiar to most in the room, but it bears repeating because of its importance.\nThe underpinnings for this shock began to form earlier in this decade with the rapid expansion of the subprime mortgage market. Most of these mortgages were sold by their originators to financial entities that bundled them together in mortgage-backed securities. In turn, these securities were restructured into a variety of new securities or used as collateral for other financial instruments. At their most complex levels, the income flows from monthly subprime mortgage payments supported many layers of highly structured securities that were held by a wide range of investors. Of course, such complex financial engineering was not limited to subprime mortgages, but was used to securitize a wide range of lending activities.\nHistorically, subprime mortgages had experienced relatively modest default rates, even during the 2001 recession. However, by mid-decade we now know that underwriting standards had become lax and that originations had expanded significantly. Then, in 2006 and 2007, housing markets began to deteriorate and delinquencies and defaults on subprime mortgages increased substantially. As this continued, it became clear that the payment flows on these mortgages would be insufficient to meet obligations to the owners of some bonds and downstream structured securities. Even the highly rated tranches of subprime-related securities turned out to be riskier than investors had thought at the time they were issued.\nIn the summer of 2007, a growing number of market participants began to realize the negative implications that these defaults had for the value of subprime-backed debt instruments. Many investors also began to question if they had underestimated the risk of other complex securities, whether they contained subprime-related debt or not. This situation was complicated by the fact that many of these securities had been purchased by special purpose financial institutions that had raised the necessary funds through short-term borrowing in the commercial paper market. These institutions had difficulty rolling over this paper at existing terms. Investors demanded shorter maturities and higher risk premiums to compensate for uncertainty over the valuation of collateral, potential needs for liquidity, and counterparty risks. Liquidity became scarce — as evidenced, for example, by large increases in spreads between overnight and term financing rates.\nThese financial challenges began to weigh noticeably on the economy as we went through the fourth quarter. A number of monthly indicators pointed to a slowdown in the pace of growth. Notably, housing fell sharply further in November and December. In part, this reflected fallout from the financial turmoil: Lenders shied away almost completely from originating subprime mortgages; markets also backed off securitizing any mortgage other than those eligible for issuance by government-sponsored agencies. This raised the relative costs of obtaining a jumbo mortgage, even for well-qualified buyers. In addition, labor markets softened — hiring slowed and the unemployment rate rose. Labor income is the most important factor supporting household consumption, and while the level of consumer spending did increase last quarter, it did so at a relatively modest pace.\nIn assessing the extent of the current slowdown, I find it useful to look at an index we developed at the Chicago Fed in 2000 to summarize the information in a large number of monthly indicators of economic activity. The index is the Chicago Fed National Activity Index, or CFNAI. An index value of zero is consistent with trend growth in overall GDP. The three-month moving average of the CFNAI fell to -0.67 in December. A study I did back in 2002 suggests that readings like this indicate a greater than 50 percent probability that the economy is in a recession. Although there are reasons to discount this likelihood somewhat, it is clear that the U.S. economy currently faces substantial headwinds.\nIn spite of these headwinds, the economy did record positive but very low growth in the fourth quarter of 2007. Real GDP inched up at a 0.6 percent annual rate. For the first quarter of 2008, we have only limited data in hand, but much of these data have been disappointing. Payroll employment edged down in January, motor vehicle sales fell, and some measures of business activity were quite weak. However, some indicators have been a touch more positive. For example, retail sales posted a modest increase in January, and the forward-looking data on orders for capital goods ended last year on a positive note.\nIn financial markets, the unusual liquidity pressures have receded some since the turn of the year. Some of the earlier pressure reflected financial firms' desire to show very liquid balance sheets on their end-of-year financial statements. In addition, central banks made special efforts to provide liquidity to the financial system. On the Fed's part, we cut the federal funds rate, our principal policy tool, and also lowered the cost and lengthened the maturity at which banks can borrow from us at the discount window. Furthermore, we instituted a new Term Auction Credit Facility to augment regular borrowing at the discount window. However, despite the improvement in liquidity, overall credit conditions are still strained, and the lending environment is much less receptive to risk-taking than it was prior to last August.\nSo we are in the midst of a period of soft economic activity. We also are in a period of heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook.\n\nThe Role of Credit Intermediation\nThis uncertainty stems from the inherent difficulty in gauging the effects of adjustments in the financial sector on the spending capacity of households and firms. One reason it is so difficult is that the degree of financial turmoil we have experienced over the past few months is a relatively rare occurrence in the modern U.S. economy. We just do not have much historical precedent to go on. Nevertheless, we do know that when financial stress emerges, we must think more thoroughly about the role of credit intermediation in the economy.\nAs a general principle, difficulties in the credit intermediation process can arise from several sources. I first want to focus on a source that is a particularly relevant issue for the situation today — that is, the effects of an erosion in the value of assets. Asset devaluation reduces both the ease with which borrowers can borrow and the capacity of lenders to lend. In turn, this can decrease the flow of credit from savers to spenders, resulting in a reduction in economic activity.\nThe first assets to consider are houses. The declines in house prices we have experienced reduce housing equity and erode the collateral value of a home against the original loan. Housing-backed loans are now riskier, and so the costs and terms of such borrowing have become more restrictive.\nA number of asset valuation issues weigh on the financial sectors' lending capacity. The lower income flows and the drop in valuations for subprime-related securities reduce the ability of such assets to service existing structured debt securities or to support new liabilities aimed at expanding lending capacity. In addition, both for regulatory reasons and to signal their soundness to investors, lenders seek to maintain a certain minimum ratio of capital to assets. These ratios have been under stress for a number of reasons. Losses on subprime-related assets and other securities directly reduce equity capital. In addition, for legal or reputational purposes, some banks were forced to take assets held by stressed special purpose vehicles back onto their balance sheets at a loss. They also found themselves holding loans associated with leveraged buyouts that they were unable to sell.\nRestoring capital ratios requires that lenders either raise new equity, sell assets, or cut back on new lending. Selling assets or reducing lending could have adverse effects on the real economy. Fortunately, a number of large banks have successfully raised new capital, with some of the most publicized deals involving investments from sovereign wealth funds. These infusions will help buffer the impact of balance-sheet adjustments on bank lending.\nFurthermore, the reduced availability of bank loans may be at least partially offset by increased financing from nonbank lenders, such as insurance companies, hedge funds, and private equity funds. And some high-quality nonfinancial firms have raised substantial funds on the corporate bond market. Indeed, in the recent survey of purchasing managers in nonmanufacturing business, despite a very weak reading on overall activity, only 15 percent of the respondents thought that financial turmoil was hampering their ability to obtain financing.\nA second intermediation-related issue revolves around how much the cost of credit has increased. One fallout we have seen from the credit difficulties is a reduced appetite for funding risky investment projects. Lenders are demanding greater compensation for risk, and this has resulted in an increase in the price of credit to many households and nonfinancial businesses. For example, in the Fed's January survey of senior loan officers, there was a notable increase in the number of banks reporting tighter standards and increased spreads on loans to both households and businesses. Risk premiums on corporate bonds, particularly those below investment grade, have increased noticeably, and issuance of high-yield bonds is down a good deal. Similar increases in risk premiums have been seen in the secondary markets for higher-risk bank loans and commercial mortgage-backed real estate.\nTo be sure, some of the increase in risk spreads and tighter lending terms represents a typical response to heightened concerns over the macroeconomy as opposed to atypical effects from the intermediation problems. And some of the increase is likely a healthy return to more prudent risk-pricing.\nIn addition, the cost of funds has fallen for many low-risk borrowers owing to interest rate declines since August. Monetary policy actions have lowered the federal funds rate 225 basis points; the 30-year conforming mortgage rate has dropped about 100 basis points to 5.7 percent; and rates on investment grade corporate bonds also are down.\nA third issue is the potential for asset-related credit intermediation problems to generate a self-reinforcing dynamic that harms the economy. The process of selling assets — whether those repossessed in defaults or those that a financial institution sells to restore its capital position — increases the supply of such assets on the market. This can lead to additional erosion of asset values, further cutbacks in borrowing and lending capacity, and broader softness in spending by households and businesses. Such a downward spiral could have a serious impact on the macroeconomy.\n\nThe FRB-Chicago Outlook\nTaking all of this into consideration, our outlook at the Chicago Fed is for real GDP to increase in the first half of the year, but at a very sluggish rate. However, we expect growth will pick up to near potential by late in the year and continue at or a bit above this pace in 2009.\nThis outlook takes into account a large number of unusual factors holding back activity. The large overhang of unsold homes will continue to restrain residential investment. Greater caution on the part of businesses and consumers will likely limit increases in their discretionary expenditures. And the strains on credit intermediation and financial balance sheets will likely hold down growth to a degree for some time. Since these financial issues are being worked out against the backdrop of a soft economy, we also have to recognize the risk that interactions between the two might reinforce the weakness in the economy.\nIn response to these downside influences, and with inflation expectations contained, I believe a relatively accommodative monetary policy is appropriate. At 3 percent, the current federal funds rate is relatively accommodative and should support stronger growth. Indeed, because monetary policy works with a lag, the effects of last fall's rate cuts are probably just being felt, while the cumulative declines should do more to promote growth as we move through the year.\nIn addition, the fiscal stimulus bill the President signed yesterday will likely boost spending in the second half of the year.\nThe economy's inherent resiliency and internal adjustment mechanisms also will work to support growth. In the current situation, this adjustment importantly includes the work the financial sector is doing in \"price discovery,\" that is, the process of determining the proper valuation of the assets they hold in light of reevaluations of their expected cash flows and risks to these flows. In addition, intermediaries will do more work in restoring their balance sheets. Together, these activities will eventually reduce the drag from the lending and credit channels on the real economy.\nAnother part of the internal adjustment process centers on housing. As house prices fall, more buyers will find it worthwhile to enter the market. Eventually, price adjustments will stabilize supply and demand, and the drag from residential construction on the economy will subside.\nFinally, there is productivity. Productivity is the fundamental determinant to growth in the longer run — it determines how we can turn labor and capital inputs into the goods and services we consume and invest. The good news here is that, while it is not as robust as it was in the late 1990s and early this decade, the underlying trend in productivity in the U.S. economy is still solid. This trend provides a sound base for production and income generation to move forward over the longer haul.\nAlthough most of the recent concern about the U.S. economy has been focused on growth, we must also be mindful of inflationary pressures. The recent news here has been somewhat disappointing. We have experienced large increases in food and energy prices, and other commodity prices are high; in addition, we are hearing numerous anecdotes of firms passing on cost increases to their downstream customers. The recent numbers on core inflation — that is, inflation excluding food and energy — also have moved up some over the past several months. Core PCE inflation is now at 2.2 percent, a higher rate than I would like to see in the long run.\nI want to emphasize here that, while we often talk about inflation in terms of the core measure, we are concerned about maintaining purchasing power over all of the goods and services consumed by households. Accordingly, our goal of price stability must be defined in terms of total inflation. Traditionally, we have found it useful to concentrate on the core measure because it gave us a less noisy reading of longer-run trends in inflation; in turn, this reflected the tendency for food and energy prices to be volatile in the short run, but to generally average out to the same as core over the medium term. However, if outsized increases in food and energy prices persist, then core becomes a less useful medium-term guide to inflation trends. Furthermore, persistent food and energy price increases will find their way into inflation expectations, which in turn would boost core measures. So the recent developments in food and energy prices are a concern that deserve careful monitoring.\nThat said, our forecast is for inflation to moderate over the next two years. Slower growth in 2008 will limit price increases somewhat. Furthermore, futures markets point to a peaking of energy and commodity prices. However, they have pointed to lower energy prices for some time now, so we do not want to take too much comfort in their current predictions. Importantly, inflation expectations appear to be contained. If households and businesses expect inflation to be very low over the longer run, they will not build automatic wage and price increases into their plans, helping to keep actual increases in check.\n\nConclusion\n To conclude, I think it is important to remember that the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate — working to foster financial conditions that help the economy obtain maximum sustainable employment and price stability. As the Committee noted in the policy statement following the January FOMC meeting, though downside risks to growth remain, we think the policy actions taken in January, in combination with earlier moves, should help promote moderate growth over time and mitigate the risks to economic activity. We also expect that inflation will moderate over time. Looking ahead, my policy views will depend on the evolution of these risks, as well as how developments influence the price stability component of our dual mandate over the medium term.\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

            "content": "I would like to thank Deputy Governor Jean Pierre Landau, Benoit Mojon, and the Banque de France for organizing this timely conference on asset price bubbles and monetary policy. And I would like to thank two of our Chicago Fed staffers—Jonas Fisher and Gadi Barlevy—who helped Benoit put together such an interesting program. It's been a pleasure for me to be in the audience, and now, I will share my thoughts with you on this important topic.\nLet me emphasize that the views that I am presenting today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or my other colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe financial crisis we have experienced during the past two years has challenged the conventional view on how monetary policy should respond to asset price movements. Before the crisis, the common view was that a central bank should not react to asset price movements, except to the extent that they affect forecasts for inflation and the output gap. A central bank would instead stand ready to respond if and when a collapse in the prices of some assets threatened its ability to meet its policy mandates. Now, in the aftermath of the crisis, there are increasing calls for central banks to be more proactive in responding to signs that an asset bubble may have emerged. This notion is often described as an imperative to \"lean against a bubble,\" meaning that the central bank should act to lower asset prices that, by historical standards, seem unusually high.\nToday, I would like to offer my position on this question. I agree that the severity of the recent crisis argues against simply waiting and mopping up after the fact if and when the prices of some assets do collapse. But the type of proactive response by a central bank that I envision is not well captured by the expression \"leaning against a bubble.\" I prefer to see policy reacting to apparent exuberance in asset markets and the problematic risk exposure this could create, rather than initiating action out of a strong conviction that these particular assets are overvalued. In addition, the expression \"leaning against a bubble\" evokes polices that are aimed at achieving some targeted decline in asset prices. In contrast, I view the goal of intervention as insuring that exuberance in asset markets does not ultimately threaten the financial system or contribute to financial distress.\nLet me elaborate. This will help explain why the conventional view of how policy ought to respond to bubbles has changed in the wake of the financial crisis. The original case for why central banks should not respond to bubbles relies on two arguments. The first holds that it is virtually impossible to determine whether an asset is trading above its fundamental value, certainly not in real time and often not even after the fact.1 The second argument holds that monetary policy as a tool is too blunt to prick bubbles effectively. This is because monetary policy cannot be targeted precisely, and will affect other financial and macroeconomic variables beyond just the set of asset prices in question. In addition, the typical changes in interest rates that a central bank might contemplate are likely to be too small to produce big changes in asset prices.2\nDoes the recent crisis justify revising this view? On the one hand, the crisis has certainly taught us a great deal about asset price booms and busts. We've learned, for example, that we must be attuned to the warning signs that might indicate potential dangers in housing markets.3 But does this mean we should be more confident in our ability to easily and definitively sort out in real time whether a rapid increase in asset prices is associated with overvaluation? I am skeptical. Each new episode is likely to involve its own idiosyncratic features—enough to bring a new chorus proclaiming that \"this time it is different\" and arguing that we are not in fact facing a bubble. As Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff remind us in their recent book, this pattern has been going on for at least eight centuries.4 As for the bluntness of monetary policy tools, I don't think the crisis has demonstrated that the typical levers of monetary policy are any less blunt than we used to think.\nInstead, it seems it is the severity of the crisis, and the desire to not let one like it reoccur, that has encouraged people to contemplate alternative policy responses. Certainly, the crisis ought to have sobered us to the thought that asset price collapses are always sufficiently manageable after the fact. But if the ultimate desire is to reduce the likelihood of such crises, our policy response should focus on achieving financial stability rather than on identifying and purging asset bubbles per se. An appropriate policy response may entail responding to bubbles, but I would argue that this should only be a means to achieving the broader goal of financial stability, rather than an end in and of itself. Indeed, I am concerned that some policies may not receive enough attention if we frame the lessons from the recent crisis too narrowly in terms of leaning against a bubble.\nSo what steps should we take to reduce the chances of another financial crisis? Part of the answer lies in structural prescriptions. The formulation of such frameworks will not be easy, and would greatly benefit from further research on how financial markets interact with real economic activity. Researchers in both macroeconomics and finance have a good deal of work to do on this score. But I am hopeful that this research can help identify which environments might best reduce the chance that financial markets trigger ruinous crises, as well as determine what policy instruments we should add to our toolkit.\nAt this point, I think that regulatory policy provides the most promise. For one, it is important to improve resolution procedures for financial institutions in the event of insolvency. This includes requiring firms to formulate contingency plans that would be used in the event of their failure. Doing so should reduce the chances that the collapse of a particular institution will threaten the broader financial system. Just as importantly, these plans also would improve discussions between supervisors and institutions. This would facilitate horizontal reviews and in so doing help first identify and then reduce potential systemic risk exposures.\nAt the same time, maintaining financial stability is also likely to involve more-proactive, state-contingent measures, that is, policies that vary with economic conditions. For example, when faced by several indications that asset markets may be exuberant, we might consider increasing capital requirements. This might be either for financial institutions as a whole or for specific institutions that choose to hold assets for which there is concern of a price collapse. These requirements should serve as a cushion if purchases of these assets result in losses. They may also end up putting downward pressure on asset prices and, at some point, even eliminate speculative excesses. Here I have in mind theories of bubbles that are due to so-called agency problems, where those who trade assets are acting as agents on behalf of others and cannot be perfectly monitored. These models, such as the models in the papers presented at the conference by Gadi Barlevy and Xavier Ragot, suggest that forcing agents to stake more of their own resources could provide a strong disincentive for market participants to purchase overvalued assets, possibly deflating a bubble that has already emerged.5\nThat said, it is important to stress that lowering asset prices would not be the direct intent of these policies and, therefore, not the way we should judge their success. We should consider an intervention successful if it helps to safeguard financial institutions and the real economy in the event that asset prices collapse, not if it manages to lower asset prices to better reflect the true worth of the underlying assets. In fact, we are unlikely to ever know if we accomplished the latter.\nOne advantage of using financial stability as our metric is that it does not require a central bank to take a stand on whether the assets in question are overvalued. Rather, the responses would be implemented whenever there are concerns that asset prices may experience a sharp decline in the future, regardless of whether this decline is driven by fundamentals or by the bursting of an asset bubble.\nI should note that some policymakers have recently expressed openness to the notion of leaning against bubbles. The proposals I just outlined are not out of scope with some of their thinking. This is because they, too, often give regulatory policy a prominent role.6 Thus, while I might motivate and describe the appropriate policy response somewhat differently, my recommendation does not represent a radical departure from what others have argued.\nIn closing, let me return to the broader themes of the conference. In the past, economists used to debate whether bubbles were even possible. The research discussed here shows that there are conditions under which bubbles can unequivocally occur, even among fully rational market participants, and that in some cases it might be desirable to burst them. But what these papers do not show is how central banks can reliably identify bubbles. The best they can offer are useful warning signs, such as those in the paper that Carsten Detken will present tomorrow.7 As long as we can't detect bubbles with great confidence, it seems unwise to adopt fighting them as a policy objective, even if only sparingly. Instead, it seems better to commit to what central banks are already mandated to do: preserve the safety and soundness of the financial system at all times, including when there is apparent exuberance in asset markets.\n\nI would like to acknowledge the help of the following Chicago Fed staff in preparing these remarks: Dan Sullivan, Spencer Krane, and Gadi Barlevy.\n\n1 For example, in Peter M. Garber, 2000, Famous First Bubbles: The Fundamentals of Early Manias, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, the author revisits three historical episodes that are commonly described as bubbles. Garber concludes that in all three, price movements can be explained by changes in the expectations of fundamentals by market participants. Ellen McGrattan and Edward Prescott similarly argue that the rise in the stock market prior to the 1929 crash was not a bubble; see Ellen McGrattan and Edward Prescott, 2003, \"Testing for stock market overvaluation/undervaluation,\" in Asset Price Bubbles: The Implications for Monetary, Regulatory, and International Policies, William C. Hunter, George G. Kaufman, and Michael Pomerleano (eds.), Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, pp. 271–276.\n2 The notion of a policy being too blunt because it can affect many variables in addition to asset prices is usually attributed to Bernanke and Gertler; see Ben Bernanke and Mark Gertler, 1999, \"Monetary policy and asset price volatility,\" Economic Review, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Fourth Quarter, pp. 17–51. The notion of a policy being too blunt because it is ineffective has been raised by Greenspan; see Alan Greenspan, 2002, \"Central bank perspectives on stabilization policy—Articles from the bank's Economic Policy Symposium, ‘Rethinking Stabilization Policy,’\" Economic Review, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Fourth Quarter, pp. 5–12. See also Frederic S. Mishkin, 2008, \"How should we respond to asset price bubbles?,\" speech at the Wharton Financial Institutions Center and Oliver Wyman Institute's Annual Financial Risk Roundtable, Philadelphia, May 15.\n3 In a November 2008 speech, Don Kohn offers an insightful discussion of how his view of asset bubbles was informed by the crisis, including whether we can have advance warning that certain markets are subject to bubbles before the prices of these assets decline; see Donald L. Kohn, 2008, \"Monetary policy and asset prices revisited,\" speech at the Cato Institute's 26th Annual Monetary Policy Conference, Washington, DC, November 19.\n4 Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff, 2009, This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly, Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. Reinhart and Rogoff go on to argue that since these episodes are so similar, contrarian claims should be refutable with evidence from various advance indicators of such crises. By contrast, Caballero and Kurlat argue that crises are nearly impossible to predict; see Ricardo J. Caballero and Pablo Kurlat, 2009, \"The ‘surprising’ origin and nature of financial crises: A macroeconomic policy proposal,\" paper at the Economic Policy Symposium, Financial Stability and Macroeconomic Policy, Jackson Hole, WY, August 20–22. This debate underscores the point I wish to make: that making the case that we are facing a bubble is likely to be difficult, since it will always be possible to argue about the relevance of indicators that predicted crises in the past.\n5 Gadi Barlevy, 2009, \"A leverage–based model of speculative bubbles,\" paper at Banque de France and Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago conference, Asset Price Bubbles and Monetary Policy, Paris, November 13; and Simon Dubecq, Benoit Mojon, and Xavier Ragot, 2009, \"Risk shifting, fuzzy capital requirements and the build up of financial fragility,\" paper at Banque de France and Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago conference, Asset Price Bubbles and Monetary Policy, Paris, November 13. The original work on bubbles and agency problems was done by Franklin Allen and Gary Gorton, 1993, \"Churning bubbles,\" Review of Economic Studies, Vol. 60, No. 4, pp. 813–836, and Franklin Allen and Douglas Gale, 2000, \"Bubbles and crises,\" Economic Journal, Vol. 110, No. 460, pp 236–255; however, they do not emphasize the role of capital requirements in avoiding bubbles in these papers.\n6 See William Dudley 2009, \"Lessons learned from the financial crisis,\" remarks at the Eighth Annual BIS conference, Basel, Switzerland; Gary H.

            "content": "Thank you, Justin. I'm Charlie Evans, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. On behalf of the World Bank and everyone here at the Chicago Fed, it's my pleasure to welcome you to the 12th annual International Banking Conference. Over the years, this conference has served as a valuable forum for the discussion of current issues affecting global financial markets, such as international regulatory structures, the globalization of financial markets, systemic risk, and the problems involved with the resolution of large, globally active banks. Also, we have been fortunate to have leading academics, regulators, and industry executives participate in the various venues—providing valuable perspectives and enriching the discussions on the issues.\nThis year's theme is the international financial crisis. If you look back at the past conferences, you will see that the most common theme over the years deals with various aspects of financial crises. After looking over this year's program, I want to compliment the organizers from both the World Bank and the Chicago Fed for putting together a very impressive group of experts in the current debate on how best to reduce the probability of another financial crisis, and, if one should occur, how to respond. I look forward to the next two days and believe you will find the discussion cutting edge and useful for deciding how we as a global financial community should move forward. Again, on behalf of the World Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, enjoy the 12th annual International Banking Conference.\nBefore I turn the podium over to Doug, I'd like to offer a few remarks on the theme of this year's conference—financial crisis—with an emphasis on the oversight of financial markets. I should note that my remarks reflect my own views and are not those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.\nWhen thinking about the events of the past couple of years, what comes to mind most often, or the big \"take away\" from all of this, is that we don't ever want to find ourselves in this situation again.\nIf we are committed to that outcome, we should ask ourselves, first, how can policies be changed so that in the future, it will be much less likely that systemically important financial institutions will find themselves in crisis situations? And, second, if such crises do occur, how can we best contain them, preventing them from having a major impact on the rest of the economy as in the recent crisis? Surely, prevention should form our first and strongest line of defense and remedial, or containment, policies should form the second.\nI recently gave a speech to the European Economic and Financial Center on the issues associated with too-big-to-fail. I argued that in the current regulatory environment it is unrealistic to expect that regulators would allow the uncontrolled failure of a large, complicated, and interconnected financial institution—certainly not if they had the ability to avoid it and if there were systemic ramifications to the failure. If you accept this premise, and I believe the failure of Lehman Brothers is the counterexample that proves it, then it becomes imperative to construct an environment that prevents our economic and financial system from again reaching the crisis state we have seen over this past year.\nIn my earlier speech I stressed the need for policy reforms, such as the introduction of an orderly and efficient failure resolution process that would create a credible regulatory environment in which firms and their creditors would not expect rescues or bailouts. This would reduce the moral hazard issues associated with the too-big-to-fail perception. It also would better align the incentives of the stakeholders of financial firms with those of society at large. In addition it would allow a larger role for financial markets to oversee and regulate firm behavior. However, even though I think we can significantly strengthen the role of market discipline, regulation will continue to play a very important role in ensuring financial stability.\nThe kinds of events that lead to our recent interventions inevitably occur during periods of financial exuberance. One way or another, asset prices rise beyond conservative fundamental valuations and risk premiums fall well below appropriate compensation levels. We typically use the loose term \"asset price bubble\" to describe such situations. Although I will continue that tradition, we should keep in mind that not all increases in asset prices represent departures from fundamentals, and not all asset bubbles need be disruptive.1 Definitions aside, it seems clear that we need to find a way to deal with potential exuberance in financial markets if we want to ensure financial stability.\nSome seven years ago, at an earlier International Banking Conference, which was also cosponsored by the World Bank, we discussed the implications of asset bubbles.2 The typical view expressed at the conference, which aligned well with much of the research literature at the time, was that central banks should not use monetary policy tools to \"manage\" or lean against the inflated prices associated with asset bubbles. In the event of a sudden collapse in asset prices, central banks were expected to respond with their standard policy tools to address any adverse impact on real economic activity. In other words, monetary policy should be prepared to \"clean up\" ex post rather than try to prevent ex ante a run-up in asset prices.3 \nHowever, given the enormous costs of the recent financial crisis, as well as new research suggesting an increase in the frequency and amplitude of asset price cycles,4 many commentators are reassessing the proper role of the central bank in monitoring and trying to deflate rising asset prices.\nIn reevaluating the effectiveness of monetary policy for this purpose, two approaches are typically considered. One is for the central bank to take an activist role and directly incorporate asset price fluctuations into its monetary policy deliberations—that is, explicitly putting asset prices into the policy response function and \"leaning against the wind.\" As an alternative, policymakers could incorporate asset prices into the price indexes used in determining the future direction of monetary policy.\nWhile recent events have indeed imposed significant costs on society, I fear that monetary policy tools may be too blunt for such a fine-tuning policy.5 Central bankers have imperfect information, and for many asset classes, sudden price declines may have minimal impact on the real economy.6 So, my concern is that using monetary policy to \"lean against bubbles\" could end up causing more harm to the economy than good.\nTo elaborate a bit, taking an activist role would likely have policy aim at explicitly hitting some target range for asset prices or risk premiums. So, we would first have to determine those target ranges. I don't know of any economic theory or empirical evidence we currently have in hand that would give us adequate guidance here. In addition, there is the \"bluntness\" of monetary policy. Using wide-reaching monetary policy to slow the growth of certain asset prices could have significant adverse effects on other sectors of the economy. In normal times, we use our policy instrument, the short-term federal funds rate, to try to achieve our dual mandate goals of maximum sustainable employment and price stability. Adding a third target—asset prices—would likely mean we couldn't do as well on the other two.\nThe desirability of incorporating asset prices into the inflation measures targeted by central banks is also not obvious. Some claim that standard consumer price indexes do not adequately incorporate inflationary expectations; rather, they only account for past price adjustments. Certain asset prices, for example, those of equities or real estate, may better incorporate such expectations. Thus, some argue that to the extent these asset prices are predictors of future price changes, including them in the target price indexes provides a reasonable operating procedure that leans against rising asset prices and adds an automatic stabilizer to monetary policy.\nOne potential issue with this argument is whether real estate or equity market prices accurately forecast future inflation rates. A bigger question, however, is how to operationalize such an index. What weights should be assigned to asset prices in the aggregate indexes? Index number theory provides the conceptual linkage between utility maximization and the expenditure weights used to construct consumer price indexes. I have not yet seen the theoretical work that says how to include asset prices in an aggregate index. I am open-minded to new research making the case for using monetary policy to address asset inflation. But as of now, I am skeptical.7 \nFortunately, monetary policy is not the only tool that central banks have to deal with asset price swings and their potentially disruptive consequences. In my view, redesigning regulations and improving market infrastructure offer more promising paths to increased financial stability. This is the \"prevention\" that forms the first line of defense in our efforts to never be in this position again. Regulation may or may not be sufficient to avoid all of the market events that help to create excessive exuberance, but it should play a very large role in controlling the existence, size, and consequences of any bubble. For example, research suggests that a crisis caused by sudden declines in asset prices is less disruptive to markets when financial systems and individual bank balance sheets are in sound condition before the crisis.8 Better supervision and a sound regulatory infrastructure can increase the resiliency of markets and institutions, enabling them to better withstand adverse shocks.\nHow do we promote such increased resiliency? First, we can make more effective use of our existing regulatory structure, tools, and authority. And second, a number of reforms of our current infrastructure—both market and regulatory—may help us to better address the type of problems we saw emerge during the recent crisis.\nWithin the existing structure, regulators have the ability to promote better, more resilient financial markets, either through rule-making or by serving as a coordinator of private initiatives.9 They can also encourage more and better disclosure of information—a key element of effective risk management.\nRegulators and supervisors are also often in positions to foresee emerging problems before they grow into crises. Along these lines, supervisors can do more \"horizontal supervision,\" similar to the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) that was designed for the largest 19 U.S. banks. Using procedures similar to those in SCAP, the likely performance of banks can be evaluated on a consistent basis under alternative stress scenarios. In addition to evaluating resiliency to future conditions, this type of \"stress test\" also enables supervisors to identify best practices in risk management and to push banks with weak risk management to improve.10 \nWhen emerging issues or practices that could lead to disruptions are identified, regulators can more effectively use tools such as memorandums of understanding or supervisory directives to dampen the adverse impact of a variety of financial shocks.11 Indeed, we probably should have been more aggressive in utilizing this supervisory power during the period leading up to the recent crisis. It can be an effective and powerful tool.\nAlthough I believe we can use existing regulatory tools more effectively, we may also need to address the shortcomings of current regulations. Already policymakers in the U.S. and elsewhere are exploring a variety of reforms.12 \nIntroducing a systemic regulator who can identify, monitor, and collate information on industry practices across various institutions tops most of the reform agendas. While plans for systemic regulation vary in the structures they propose—for example, a single regulator versus a committee of regulators—they all envision macroprudential supervision and regulation as the key mandate of the new regulator. This would be a major component of what I called our first line of defense.\nReform proposals also typically include ways in which we can make capital requirements more dynamic and tailor them to the type of risks an institution poses for the financial system. Varying capital requirements and loan loss provisions over the cycle are examples of these proposals. History shows that during boom times, when financial institutions are perhaps in an exuberant state, they may not price risks fully in their underwriting and risk-management decisions. During downturns, faced with eroding capital cushions, increased uncertainty, and binding capital constraints, some institutions may become overcautious and excessively tighten lending standards. Both behaviors tend to amplify the business cycle. Allowing the required capital ratio to vary over the cycle could serve to offset some of this volatility and to partially offset the boom–bust trends we have seen in the past.\nVarying loan loss provisions over the cycle is an alternative or complementary way to better cushion firms against sudden declines in asset prices.\nCapital requirements also could be adjusted by extending risk-based weighting schemes to account for institutions' contributions to systemic risk. This could involve higher risk weights based on factors such as institution size and the extent of off-balance-sheet activities. It might also include some assessment of the degree to which the institution was interconnected with others. Such adjustments to capital requirements would make the decisions of financial institutions more closely reflect their impact on society. The information needed to account for the new risk factors—for example, the degree of interconnectedness—fits well within the framework of information that would be required by a new systemic regulator, and is now being considered in regulatory reform proposals in the U.S.\nSo, in order to fortify our first line of defense, we must make more effective use of the existing regulatory structure and tools, introduce a systemic risk regulator, and reform capital requirements to make them more dynamic and tailored to systemic risks. But adjustments to the current regulations and infrastructure alone are probably not enough. We also need to fortify our second line of defense—containing the disruptive spillovers that result from the failure of systemically important institutions without resorting to bailouts or ad hoc rescues. A necessary element of this is having a mechanism for resolving the failure of a systemically important institution. This is something we currently lack in many cases, though there are proposals now under discussion that would provide this resolution power.13 \nAnother reform proposal that I think can play an important role in the resolution process of systemically important institutions is what is typically referred to as a \"shelf bankruptcy\" plan. Under this proposal, systemically important institutions would be required to provide the information necessary to determine how their failures could be handled in a relatively short period of time, as well as to design a plan to efficiently implement such a resolution.14 I see a number of ways these plans can fortify both our first and second lines of defense.\nRequiring systemically important institutions to identify and think through their organizational structure and interactions with various parties can improve the risk-management practices of their institutions. By developing plans to address systemic problem areas ex ante, the need for an ex post \"too-big-to-fail\" action could be reduced.\nIn addition, should the first line of defense fail, these plans could provide an initial blueprint for the resolution of large interconnected institutions and, in so doing, improve our second line of defense. Currently, individual institutions may not have an incentive to make such plans—after all, they would bear the costs of the planning and see little of the benefits.15 But, society as a whole would benefit from such contingency planning. Another way to cushion financial firms against sudden asset price declines would be to require them to hold contingent capital.16 Under these proposals, systemically important banks would be required to issue \"contingent capital certificates.\" These would be issued as debt securities that would be converted into equity shares if some predetermined threshold was breached.17 It would provide firms with an additional equity injection at the very time that equity would be difficult to issue, thus enabling firms to better withstand sudden shocks and potential spillover effects.\nThese new policy options, while not easy to implement, would enhance the ability of banks and other financial intermediaries to survive shocks—whether from a sudden fall in asset prices or from some other source. I am fully aware that the challenges in reforming regulatory structures and practices are not insignificant. But, given the magnitude of the cost incurred in the wake of the recent crisis and the possible benefits that would arise from making our economy more resilient to such events, it is imperative that we take on these challenges.\nThus, I think we need to strengthen our existing regulatory infrastructure and give strong consideration to making the adjustments that could reduce the likelihood of a crisis similar in magnitude to the one we have seen over the past two years. We also need to devise mechanisms to dampen the adverse effects of any disruption that might occur.\nThis year, as in others, this conference invites us to examine and discuss financial crises and asks whether the rules of finance have changed. I've argued that in order to avoid a situation like the one we have faced in the past two years; we need to fortify our regulatory lines of defense. We need to have the rules of regulation change. Not necessarily through more regulation, but through better regulation that is more efficient and effective in its design and implementation. I hope this conference serves as a platform to inform your thinking and stimulate good debate about the issues I've laid out.\nThank you.\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

Hunter, George G. Kaufman, and Michael Pomerleano (eds.), Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.\n2 See William C. Hunter, George G. Kaufman, and Michael Pomerleano (eds.), 2003, Asset Price Bubbles: The Implications for Monetary, Regulatory, and International Policies, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press (hereafter HKP).\n3 See Ben Bernanke and Mark Gertler, 2001, \"Should central banks respond to movements in asset prices?,\" American Economic Review, Vol. 91, No. 2, May, pp. 253–257; Ben Bernanke, Mark Gertler, and Simon Gilchrist, 1999, \"The financial accelerator in a quantitative business cycle framework,\" in Handbook of Macroeconomics, Vol.1C, John Taylor and Michael Woodford (eds.), New York: Elsevier Science-North Holland, pp. 1341–1393. A quick aside, it should be emphasized that policymakers do currently take asset bubbles into account to the extent that they affect the real sector of the economy. Thus, it is not a question of whether policymakers address bubbles. At issue is whether they should or can address asset price increases ex ante to avoid a resulting sudden decline in prices that more adversely affects the real economy than would have occurred without the bubble.\n4 For example, see Randall Kroszner, 2003, \"Asset price bubbles, information, and public policy,\" in HKP, pp. 3–12; and Claudio Borio and Philip Lowe, 2003, \"Imbalances or bubbles? Implications for monetary and financial stability,\" in HKP, pp. 247–263.\n5 There is broad literature on this issue. See: Friedman, Goodfriend, Meltzer, Mishkin and White, Mussa, and Trichet, in HKP (2003); Kroszner (2003) previously cited in footnote 4; Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist (1999); Bernanke and Gertler (2001) previously cited in footnote 3; Frederic S.

Minsky Conference on the State of the U.S. and World Economies—\"Meeting the Challenges of the Financial Crisis,\" Bard College, New York City, April 16.\n6 See Mishkin in footnote 5. Mishkin makes the argument that not all bubbles have the same impact on the real economy. In particular, he argues that bubbles associated with credit booms are more dangerous because they put the financial system at risk and may result in negative spillover effects for the real economy. Thus, these bubbles may deserve a more activist approach.\n7 For an alternative discussion of potential problems, see Trichet (2003) in footnote 5.\n8 See Frederic Mishkin and Eugene White, 2003, \"U.S. stock market crashes and their aftermath: Implications for monetary policy,\" in HKP, pp. 53–76.\n9 An example here would be the central bank serving a coordinative role encouraging banks to address operational risks associated with back-office operations in credit default swap contracts.\n10 For a further discussion of SCAP, see Daniel K. Tarullo, 2009, \"Bank supervision,\" testimony before the U.S. Senate, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Washington, DC, August 4.\n11 For example, memorandums could have addressed the rising role of commercial real estate in bank portfolios, or they could have addressed practices in mortgage lending that may have contributed to poor underwriting.\n12 See U.S. Department of the Treasury, 2009, \"Financial regulatory reform—A new foundation: Rebuilding financial supervision and regulation,\" proposal, Washington, DC, June 17, available online. I have previously discussed these policy issues in somewhat more detail: see Charles Evans, 2009, \"Too-big-to-fail: A problem too big to ignore,\" speech to the European Economics and Financial Center, London, July 1. Also see the Squam Lake Working Group proposals, available at Squam Lake Working Group proposals.\n13 See U.S. Department of the Treasury (2009).\n14 See Raghuram Rajan, 2009, \"Too systemic to fail: Consequences and potential remedies,\" presented at the Proceedings of a Conference on Bank Structure and Competition, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, May; and see the Squam Lake Working Group proposals, available at Squam Lake Working Group proposals.\n15 Not only would the banks not see the benefits of disclosing this information, they could actually benefit from keeping this information from the supervisors. The more opaque the operations and risk of institutions, the more likely they could be considered too-big-to-fail if they encounter difficulties. Thus, the \"shelf plan\" could force these issues to be on the table for discussion.\n16 See Mark Flannery, 2005, \"No pain, no gain? Effecting market discipline via reverse convertible debentures,\" in Capital Adequacy Beyond Basel: Banking, Securities, and Insurance, Hal S. Scott (ed.), Oxford: Oxford University Press, chapter 5; see also the Squam Lake Working Group on Financial Regulation, Squam Lake Working Group proposals, available at Squam Lake Working Group on Financial Regulation.\n17 This would be somewhat similar to previous proposals to require banks to hold subordinated debt to better discipline bank behavior and to be able to absorb losses when difficulties are encountered. See Douglas Evanoff and Larry Wall, 2000, \"Subordinated debt as bank capital: A proposal for regulatory reform,\" Economic Perspectives, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Vol. 24, No, 2, Second Quarter, pp. 40–53. However, the convertibility of the new instrument would most likely occur when the bank is better capitalized, thus augmenting equity capital and providing an earlier cushion against losses. The trigger to convert the debt would most likely also be supervisory instead of market induced.",

            "content": "Introduction\nGood morning. I'm Charlie Evans, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and it's my pleasure to welcome you to today's conference. I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to discuss the importance of financial education, a topic that is particularly relevant in light of the subprime crisis and the struggles that many families are facing to stay in their homes.\nThis morning I would like to offer some observations on the importance of financial education, which is of particular concern to those of us at the Federal Reserve. I will also discuss the origins of Fed engagement in financial education and some similarities that I see between the economic and political climate that prompted the Fed to ramp up its financial education efforts in the 1970s and where we are today. I will close with some thoughts about the particular strengths that the Fed brings to the financial education arena.\n\nThe Importance of Financial Education\nRecent research shows that American consumers have relatively low rates of financial literacy. For example, two-thirds of older Americans do not have a clear understanding of financial concepts like compound interest and inflation.1 Financial illiteracy is particularly acute among specific demographic groups, including those with low education, women, African-Americans, and Hispanics.\nIt is perhaps useful to consider why we think it is important for individuals to be financially literate. To my mind there are (at least) two key reasons. First, if individuals are financially literate, then they will be able to make better financial decisions for themselves and for their families when it comes to budgeting and buying, financing a home, or planning for retirement, for example. Second, when individuals have a better understanding of financial and economic concepts, it is easier for them to appreciate the role of the Federal Reserve and the benefits of the Fed's independence when it comes to monetary policy. When you don't understand what inflation is or the risk that it presents to your financial well-being, then it is difficult to appreciate the importance of a Federal Reserve that can take politically unpopular steps to combat inflation.\nSince the 1970s the Federal Reserve has been actively involved in a variety of financial education programs. Of course, it is desirable to know how helpful this instruction is, so we can assess whether programs are cost-effective and perhaps even worthy of being replicated broadly. However, evaluating financial education programs is far from a straightforward task—simply looking at the outcomes of program participants can be misleading, because individuals choose whether or not to participate. For example, enrollees in credit counseling programs might make better mortgage contract choices. But the fact that they choose to enroll reveals their interest in making good decisions about their personal finances. Thus, those particular individuals might have made good choices even without attending a program.\nThe gold standard for dealing with such problems is randomized assignment, which ensures that individuals selected for programs do not differ systematically from the target population. There are important examples of this type of work within the Federal Reserve, for example assessments of home ownership education and counseling at the Philadelphia Fed and other research that will be highlighted in the second panel. But randomized assignment evaluations are usually quite costly. They require very careful design, the ability to replicate that design, the political fortitude to exclude populations from treatment, and extensive follow-up. Moreover, most financial literacy programs—for instance, 2 hour credit counseling—offer small treatments that are likely to produce small effects. Detecting such effects requires studying large populations, raising the cost of evaluations even further. So, for some financial literacy programs, such rigorous assessment may simply be impractical. One thing I hope we will get from this conference is a better sense of how we should approach the evaluation of such programs.\n\nOrigins of the Fed's Engagement in Financial Education\nI date the beginning of the Fed's engagement in economic and financial education to the mid-1970s.\nSo, what did the economic landscape of the mid-1970s look like? The economy had just gone through a severe recession, during which output, income, and employment fell sharply and the unemployment rate rose to 9 percent. At the same time, inflation had been around 3 to 4 percent earlier in the decade, and then soared to more than 10 percent in 1975. The oil export embargo by Arab states and President Nixon's wage and price controls combined to create long lines at the gas pump and restrictions on gas purchases. The oil price shock exacerbated a buildup of inflation and inflation expectations, which was further worsened by rapidly rising prices of agricultural products and other commodities.\nDuring this period, there were several Congressional attempts to curtail the Federal Reserve's independence. Sound familiar?\nIt was in this environment that the Federal Reserve grew increasingly concerned that the American public was uninformed about the Federal Reserve's statutory responsibilities, especially its monetary policy role. By 1976, a consensus had developed within the Federal Reserve System that an expanded public information program was needed to reach a broader segment of the American public and to dispel misconceptions about the Federal Reserve. This led the Fed to create a more professionally organized public information program at the Board and within the 12 Regional Reserve Banks. The recommended programs were designed to move the Fed from a \"passive\" information stance to a more active posture by expanding the dissemination of information to as wide an audience as possible.\nThe education efforts focused initially on improving public understanding of the Federal Reserve's purposes and functions and informing consumers of their rights and lenders of their responsibilities. Documents from the Fed at that time list several diverse groups who would benefit from the Fed's public information and education efforts, including: bankers, members of Congress, representatives of electronic and print media, consumer advocates, educators, students, representatives of organized labor, and the general public.2 Then as now, the audience was broad and diverse.\nAn expansion of public information programs, including economic education programs, began in earnest in the 1980s. During this period, Reserve Banks across the country undertook a burgeoning array of initiatives and activities to facilitate public understanding of the Federal Reserve and developed greater coordination and information exchange throughout the System.\nEconomic education also became a specialty within public information programs, supporting the development of publications, curricular materials, programs and Reserve Bank staff activities targeting K-12 educators and students.\nOver the past decade, the Fed's education initiatives have broadened to include an additional focus on financial education and literacy. These initiatives concentrate on practical issues, such as: financial skill-building, economics education, bank account ownership, financial planning, wealth accumulation, consumer protection, and foreclosures—issues that affect many people at different stages of their lives.\nAs I'm sure you've noticed, there are some similarities between today and the environment of the mid-1970s. While we are tentatively emerging from a severe recession, unemployment remains high; thankfully, inflation and inflation expectations are under control However, there is a similar lack of understanding of the role of the Federal Reserve, threats to its independence and various proposals that would change its functions.\nIn some respects, confusion over the Fed's role is quite understandable, given the unconventional steps we have taken over the past two years to ensure liquidity flows in the wake of the financial crisis and the non-traditional monetary policy environment that we are in. At the same time, we have an important responsibility to explain our policy actions to a broad and diverse public. Today, as in the past, the better the public understands the work of the Fed, the easier it will be for us to achieve our mission.\n\nWhat You Will to Get Out of this Conference\nToday's conference provides a timely and important opportunity to discuss what the regional Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors are doing to ensure that the public understands the role of the Fed. The conference also offers an occasion for a discussion of what the Federal Reserve System is doing to provide opportunities for consumers to become better prepared to make complicated financial decisions. During the course of the conference, you will have the opportunity to share strategies for designing successful programs and partnerships in financial education, to learn how regional Feds make the most of scarce resources, to hear about research on the effectiveness of various financial education efforts, as well as some of the challenges involved in measuring the impact of financial education programs generally. In addition, you will have the chance to learn from partners and potential partners about strengths and areas for improvement in the Fed's financial education efforts.\n\nOur Comparative Advantages\nLet me conclude my remarks by briefly highlighting why I think that the Federal Reserve has a critical and ongoing role to play in the field of financial education. First, as I've mentioned, the Fed has two very important reasons for working to increase financial literacy: wanting consumers to have the information and knowledge necessary to make good financial decisions and wanting the public to have a better appreciation of the role of the Fed.\nIn addition, the structure of the Federal Reserve—with the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors—allows us to work effectively on both the regional and national levels. The regional Feds are ideally positioned to develop financial education programs that take into account the needs of their regions. For example, they can respond to variations in state education standards and to regional economic conditions. In addition, they are adept at identifying strong partners in their communities.\nAt the same time, by working together with one another and with the Board of Governors, the regional Feds and the Federal Reserve System can impact financial education at a national level. The Federal Reserve System provides an important independent and unbiased source of financial and economic information, as well as a wide variety of opportunities for individuals to build their financial literacy.\nLet me now turn the podium over to my colleague here in Chicago, Doug Tillett, who directs our Public Information and Economic Education efforts and is moderating the opening panel of the conference.\nThank you again for coming to this timely and important conference. I hope you enjoy the conference and your stay in Chicago.\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

            "content": "Thanks for inviting me and thanks for that kind introduction. You'll note that I became president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago exactly two years ago. While I can assure you there's no correlation, this period has been among the most interesting and extraordinary in the history of the Federal Reserve System. So much of what the Fed has done in the last two years has been under scrutiny from the government, the media, the general public and various others. And while the debate has been loud and at times far ranging, our mandate from Congress has remained quite clear: the goal of the Fed and its monetary policy arm, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), is to promote monetary and financial conditions that facilitate the attainment of maximum employment and price stability. For about the last 30 years, there has typically been no conflict in pursuing each of these goals with a single tool—the short-term interest rate. This is because rising inflationary pressures are often accompanied by unsustainably high growth, and economic slowdowns are typically associated with disinflationary pressures.\nNevertheless, this simple description of the way monetary policy responds to growth and inflation prospects belies the fact that discussions within the FOMC often touch on a wide range of drivers for inflationary pressures. A small set of relevant factors should include money growth, resource slack, inflationary expectations, energy and commodity price shocks, and assessments of the credibility of future policy commitments. And there is a surprising amount of disagreement and uncertainty over the exact roles forces play. I'm not talking out of school on this issue: A careful reading of FOMC transcripts over the last 20 years will reveal many different views on inflation. Perhaps this is not surprising. The economics community itself continues to debate strongly the importance of different transmission channels for inflation. Policymakers who are informed by these developments—and, in many cases, have contributed to the scholarly research in this area—continue to have a healthy discourse over the issues and facts.\nDuring normal times, inflation evolves gradually, and this debate rarely spills over into major disagreements about policy. But, today, we are not in normal times. The inflation debate on the determinants of inflation has broken out on the front pages of newspapers, with major disagreements among distinguished experts. For example, in recent New York Times op-eds Paul Krugman said that large resource gaps have made him worried about deflation, while Allan Meltzer said that massive growth in the monetary base has made him worried about inflation.1\nCertainly, the stakes could not be higher. We have ample evidence of the harm that deflation can cause. The history of the U.S. economy in the 1930s is a case in point, where the price level fell by over 25 percent,2 contributing to the severity of the Great Depression. But, history also shows us the damage that high inflation can wreak on the U.S. economy. From 1965 to 1980, inflation rose from about 1-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent.3 Many economists refer to this period as the \"Great Inflation.\" The costly process of breaking the Great Inflation and then, subsequently, the achievement of price stability took the better part of the next 17 years.4 So it is quite disconcerting when highly regarded analysts talk about the possibility of another debilitating deflation while others—just as highly regarded—suggest that even though we have avoided the Great Depression 2.0, the U.S. economy may be facing the Great Inflation 2.0.\nThis morning, I would like to frame these two extreme views on inflation risks within the language economists and policymakers use to discuss these issues. After highlighting the terms of these disagreements, I will provide some commentary on the \"lessons learned\" from the historical record on inflation. In brief, I think neither a harmful deflationary episode nor a repetition of the Great Inflation is very likely. Stimulative policies combined with the economy's resilient market forces will, over time, reduce resource gaps. Deflation has been averted. And as the economy continues to improve, and when we see rising inflation pressures, Fed policy will respond aggressively. Having said this, the main threat to these outcomes would be if clear danger signals were ignored or if central bank independence were compromised.\nAs always, my remarks today reflect my own views and do not reflect those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or the views of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nTwo articles of faith\nIt is natural to start by considering the factors that affect inflation. What do economists say? Well, macroeconomists are a contentious bunch. The most accomplished scholars in this field share two overpowering attributes. First, they are highly intelligent; and, second, when the subject is monetary policy and inflation, they appear to agree on very little. Nevertheless, I think that there are two strongly held articles of faith that are, in fact, shared by the vast majority of macroeconomists.\nFirst, large, sustained and explosive growth in money is associated with high and variable rates of inflation. The logic and evidence are overwhelming. Economies that are running the printing presses on overdrive, usually to finance unsustainable fiscal deficits, generate great instability in prices and high inflation. We saw this in post-WW1 hyperinflations in Germany and Austria, and, more recently, in high-inflation episodes in Portugal, Italy, and Argentina. In addition, numerous studies have documented that when sustained over long periods of time, even moderately high rates of money growth are often associated with significant inflation. However, it's important to note that over shorter time frames, and at lower rates of money growth, other factors can intervene to significantly weaken the strong positive relationship between money and prices that we see in the high inflation examples and in long run studies.5\nThe second article of faith is that high unemployment rates and slack capacity utilization—which we refer to as resource gaps—are often associated with falling inflation. A prime example of this is the 1981-82 recession, when unemployment rose to nearly 11 percent as the Volcker-led Fed broke the Great Inflation. But, similar to money growth, the evidence regarding the influence of resource gaps on inflation is strongest when considering extreme economic conditions—when there is either a large degree of slack or, on the flip side, an excessive strain on productive capacity.\nClearly, these two articles of faith can help frame the current discussion of inflation risks. On the one hand, the explosion of the Federal Reserve balance sheet has led to an enormous increase in bank reserves and the monetary base. Left unchecked, these monetary facts seem to scream \"inflation risks.\" On the other hand, the unemployment rate is 9.7 percent, and manufacturing capacity utilization is currently only 65 percent, which is the lowest level since this statistic started to be computed in 1948.6 These resource gaps suggest that disinflationary winds are blowing with gale-force effect.\nIn trying to assess inflation risks from monetary conditions and resource slack, we must remember that these factors are strong predictors only in relatively extreme cases. So it is the fact that we currently find ourselves in a situation with competing extreme cases—both large resource gaps and big expansions in the monetary base—that leads to today's Great Inflation 2.0 debate.\nIn a few minutes I'll return to how I see this conflict turning out. But these two articles of faith provide only a partial understanding of the factors that determine inflation during more usual times. So it is useful to first describe a relatively mainstream view on how inflationary pressures emerge under more typical circumstances.\n\nFirst-order forces of inflation determination\nAlthough inflation is ultimately a monetary phenomenon, many factors come in to play when thinking about its evolution over the medium term. The most important ones are: changes in resource costs, wage and price setting behaviors, and inflation expectations.7 As we'll see, these forces are related to both articles of faith that I just discussed. However, there are disagreements over how much weight to place on each factor, and also how to interpret the fundamentals underlying each of them.\nLet me begin with resource costs. When firms set prices for the products they sell, they pass along current and expected future changes in input costs, including labor costs. As a result, market prices and inflation move in the same direction as these resource costs. Resource costs, in turn, move with changes in demand and supply. And everything else equal, expansionary monetary policy will increase demand.\nIt's natural to use movements in measures of aggregate resource utilization, such as unemployment and capacity utilization, to capture changes in the supply-demand balance. In this way, resource costs are linked to resource gaps, which was the focus of our second \"article of faith\" about inflation determination. Unfortunately, for a host of theoretical and statistical reasons, these measures of resource utilization are imperfect proxies for supply and demand pressures, and as such, have an uncertain relationship with price determination. As a result, economists will disagree on the importance of these measures for inflation determination at a given point in time. I will return to these uncertainties in a few minutes.\nAnother factor affecting inflation is inertia in wage and price setting behavior. Businesses, workers, and households typically make changes to their wages and prices in an orderly fashion. For example, firms tend to stick to their pricing plans, and workers' wages are typically revisited only on an annual basis. This sort of pricing behavior makes inflation inertial. However, these behavioral regularities are not always well understood and we don't really know whether this sort of inertia will continue to characterize inflation in all future economic conditions.\nIn addition to direct cost pressures, price setting is influenced by expectations of future underlying inflation. Many things can influence peoples' expectations about the future path of inflation—it is a veritable kitchen sink. In addition to the resource costs I just talked about, other important influences are: changes in money growth, fiscal factors, and central bank credibility and independence. Higher money growth today may lead people to conclude that inflation will increase in the future.\nUnchecked fiscal imbalances can also lead to higher expected inflation if the public believes that at least some of the fiscal deficit will be paid off by printing money. And inflation expectations can increase if everyone believes that a central bank will refrain from increasing policy rates for political reasons, even in the face of inflationary pressures.\nExpectations are clearly a powerful determinant of inflation, but they are inherently unobservable. Expectations reflect a confluence of both objective market data and subjective beliefs of market participants. Similar to other important economic forces—like the output gap—the lack of observability and difficulty in measuring inflation expectations represent a powerful challenge for monetary policymakers. Here is how I approach the issue. Initially, we can attempt to directly assess each important force for future inflationary pressures. This approach could construct a risk assessment for inflation pressure indicators and would include all of the factors cited above, at a minimum, along with an assessment (or weighting) of their importance.8 Although there will be disagreements, I find this constructive approach facilitates rigorous and robust debate.\nAn alternative approach is to be agnostic about the factors that influence how inflation expectations are formed. Instead, we would simply try to infer expectations from surveys and financial market data. Although this is intriguing, there are limitations in using this approach to the exclusion of more direct measures of inflationary forces. In particular, if monetary policy is so fully credible that everyone believes inflation will not deviate from its goal, inflation expectations will not respond to changes in the economic environment. For example, many believe that the European Central Bank's commitment to price stability over the medium term is so strong that measures of euro-zone inflation expectations rarely move. But this sort of stability in expected inflation does not mean that the central bank can relax its vigilance against inflationary forces. On the contrary, this stability is a consequence of that very vigilance. We cannot rely solely on direct measures of expected inflation without some sort of risk assessment that monitors indicators of inflation pressures. Fortunately, these two approaches for assessing inflation expectations are not mutually exclusive; indeed, they are complementary.\nOne of the big questions, however, is to ask what the historical record says about the importance of these different factors. So now would be a good time to turn to a couple of quite salient historical examples.\n\nThe Great Inflation 1.0: 1965-82\nThe Great Inflation in the U.S. from 1965 to 1982 provides a good example of how a long, sustained increase in money growth tends to increase both contemporaneous inflation and expectations of future inflation. Over this period the price level more than tripled, with the inflation rate peaking at over 11 percent in 1980. This rise in the price level was accompanied by strong growth in both narrow and broad monetary aggregates. The monetary base, like the price level, more than tripled over this period, with a growth rate peaking at nearly 10 percent.9 M2, which is a broader measure of transaction money, more than quadrupled during this period, and its growth rate topped 11 percent.10 It is important to note that this broader measure of money, M2, largely consists of the liabilities of the private banking sector, so an expansion of broad money can be triggered by an increase in base money only if there's an associated growth in bank credit provision. Increased bank lending was a key factor in broad money growth and the Great Inflation.\nTo see how this works, note that an expansion of base money implies an increase in both a bank's deposit liabilities and—at least for the moment—its excess reserves at the central bank. Banks may choose to put these excess reserves to work by making loans, which will further increase the aggregate balance sheet of the commercial banking sector through the standard money multiplier story. This increase in broad money, in turn, can increase inflation.\nDuring normal times, an increase in the monetary base results in an increase in broad money because banks generally lend out almost all of their excess reserves. But if, for some reason they choose not to do so, then broad money will not increase as fast as the monetary base, and the likelihood of an increase in inflation is greatly diminished. An example of this occurred during the early part of the Great Depression, when base money grew significantly but the broad money stock actually fell by a third.11 We also find a disconnect today between the monetary base and broad money. Over the past year, the monetary base has nearly doubled as the Fed has rapidly expanded its balance sheet. But, given the sluggish growth in bank credit, broader money has risen much less—by only around 8 percent. So, we'll need to see much more expansive bank lending if the monetary base expansion is to trigger an inflation response. And we have yet to see this happen in the current economic downturn.\n1979 to 1982 provides a different example of the tenuous link between money and inflation. Between 1980 and 1982 the inflation rate declined from its peak at 11.6 percent to 4.8 percent.12 Yet this disinflation was accompanied by an increase in broad money growth, with M2 growth rising from 7.8 to 8.8 percent.13 It is noteworthy that a decline in money growth was not essential for reducing inflation. The explanation is that this was a period of restrictive credit, with real interest rates soaring to over 10 percent. Partly as a result of this tight credit environment, economic activity weakened considerably, generating substantial resource gaps. Restrictive credit conditions and resource gaps dominated the influence of relatively high rates of money growth. This episode constitutes a caveat for the monetary explanation of inflation pressures: you need to consider both demand and supply pressures for money—you can't ignore the prices of liquidity and credit. Indeed, empirical research has found that outside of extreme cases money growth generally does not have much predictive power for inflation over the short and medium runs.14\n\nMeasures of resource slack may be misleading\nHistory also cautions us about relying purely on resource slack as the sole guide to inflation pressures. For example, although high rates of unemployment are typically viewed as disinflationary, the stagflation of the 1970s serves as a counterexample. A problem here is that measures of resource slack can be misleading. One popular measure of resource slack is the output gap, which is the difference between actual and potential output. Here, potential output is defined as the maximum level of output that can be produced without generating inflationary resource cost pressures. The problem is that potential output changes over time. Furthermore, it is not directly observable and must be estimated. If our estimate for potential output is off, then so is our measure of the output gap. This mismeasurement could confound policy. Athanasios Orphanides argues that something of the sort happened in the 1970s.15 \nAccording to his story, economic weakness was interpreted by the Fed as evidence of a substantial output gap. This apparent gap prompted the Fed to expand monetary policy in an effort to attain maximum sustainable growth. But this period of economic weakness coincided with a major structural slowdown in productivity growth and rising structural unemployment. So the sluggish economy represented not so much an output gap as a slowdown in the growth rate of potential output. In effect, the resource and output gaps were overestimated, leading to an overly accommodative monetary policy.\nIs this sort of dynamic likely to be a factor in the current situation? Although some of these forces may be present, I am skeptical of their quantitative significance. Recent studies done at the Chicago and San Francisco Feds find little evidence that sectoral reallocation or other factors are increasing the unemployment rate or reducing measured output gaps on a very large scale.16 So I believe that resource gaps remain substantial today. That's a significant mitigating factor against inflation pressures.\n\nFiscal deficits and weak central banks\nBefore concluding, let me turn to the relationship between central bank independence, fiscal policy, and inflation outcomes. Independence of the central bank is always important. Periodically, the central bank at times must take tough actions that are needed for future and medium-term prosperity, even though these actions are painful in the immediate short-term. The classic example is the need to increase policy rates on early signs that inflation could be rising substantially even though the real economy remains weak. In this situation, there may be pressure for the central bank to inappropriately re-weight its dual mandate objectives and postpone the monetary tightening until matters in the real economy improve further. A central bank that lacks independence and therefore opts to postpone tightening policy has effectively abandoned its low inflation goal. As a result, both expected and actual inflation can increase.\nFiscal pressures can also pose problems for central bank independence if large deficits are expected into the foreseeable future. Even if the central bank pursues a tight monetary policy, both current and expected future inflation can still increase if the public believes that the central bank will be forced to monetize the government debt sometime in the future. Tom Sargent and Neal Wallace coined the term \"Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic\" for this process.17 In principle, very large debt levels could compromise the independence of even the strongest central bank if the choice is between monetizing the debt or, inducing a costly monetary contraction.\nHere again, the historical link between fiscal pressures and very high inflation is clear. As I noted earlier, the major hyper-inflations in Austria, Hungary, Germany and Poland during the inter-war years, and more recent high-inflation episodes in Argentina, Portugal and Italy, all involved to varying degrees large structural fiscal imbalances combined with some lack of central bank independence. The key take-away is that rising, unsustainable fiscal deficits can derail the low inflation plans of a weak central bank, and can test the souls of the strongest central bankers. Unpleasant monetarist arithmetic argues that fiscal discipline is a necessary component for favorable inflation outcomes. There is no reason to think that this conclusion does not apply to the U.S. While significant fiscal stimulus was an appropriate response to a very large recession, it is essential that the nation show that it has a plan for restoring long-run fiscal balance.\n\nPolicy conclusions\nI started today by describing two extreme views for the future of inflation. One view, motivated by the expanding Fed balance sheet, has inflation greatly increasing in the future, while the other view, motivated by a sluggish economy and large resource gaps, has strong disinflationary forces. My view is that large resource gaps have been met by a large growth in reserves: In an effort to prevent a repeat of the Great Depression, the Fed acted quickly and decisively over the past year to provide liquidity to markets and to prevent systemically important institutions from failing. These are things that the 1930s Fed did not do. It is precisely these actions that have greatly expanded our balance sheet. So, the co-existence of the motivating observations for the two extreme inflation views is not very surprising.\nNow for the hard part: Just as the Fed acted responsibly to prevent a potential deflation, it will do so to prevent a future increase in inflation above our price stability objective. Unfortunately, this sounds too much like, \"just trust us to do the right thing.\" This is uncomfortable for everyone, but it is a natural dilemma at this point in the economic cycle when it is yet too soon to actually begin removing policy accommodation.\nI am confident that the Federal Reserve will achieve the price stability component of our mandate. Our response will embody three principles; prepare, monitor, and act. Chairman Bernanke recently testified on the tremendous preparations that the FOMC is undertaking in order to be sure our balance sheet can be reduced and that appropriately restrictive monetary policies can be implemented when necessary. And the FOMC is monitoring economic and inflation conditions for the signs that adjustments in policy are needed. I hope my comments on inflation expectations and direct assessments of inflationary pressures have been helpful in this regard. Finally, the Fed will act in a timely and appropriate manner to achieve our dual mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L. Evans and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI would like to acknowledge the help of the following Chicago Fed staff in preparing these remarks: Dan Sullivan, Spencer Krane, Hesna Genay and David Marshall and Ed Nosal.\n\n1 See Krugman (2008, 2009) and Meltzer (2009).\n2 According to Friedman and Schwartz (1963), the implicit price deflator level fell by about 25 percent between 1929 and 1933.\n3 The PCE (personal consumption expenditures) chain price index increased 1.7 percent between December 1964 and December 1965 and 10.5 percent between December 1979 and December 1980.\n4 Year-over-year PCE inflation did not consistently fall below 2 percent until May 1997. It remained below 2 percent until December 1999.\n5 See, McCandless and Weber (1995), Fischer et al (2002), and Stock and Watson (1999, 2003).\n6 Manufacturing capacity utilization was 65.4 percent in July 2009, which is the lowest reading since January 1967 when the NAICS-based capacity utilization series start. (NAICS is North American Industry Classification System.) Before 1967, capacity utilization is available on an SIC (Standard Industry Classification) basis; at no time between then and its first reading in January 1948 does this measure fall below 70 percent.\n7 These ideas are embodied in macroeconomic analyses from Friedman (1968) and Lucas (1972) to current generations of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models like Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005).\n8 These weights could be informed by the performance of formal statistical inflation forecasting models that use these indicators.\n9 Between 1971 and 1980, the monetary base grew, on average, about 8 percent per year.\n10 Growth in seasonally adjusted M0 from Jan 1965-Dec. 1982 = 238.67 percent; growth in SA M1 over the same period = 195.46 percent; growth in SA M2 over the same period = 346.62 percent.\n11 Friedman and Schwartz (1963), p. 299, also Table B-3.\n12 These are December-to-December changes in the PCE chain price index.\n13 Year-over-year growth in M2 was 8.0 percent in October 1979 and 8.8 percent in October 1982.\n14 See Stock and Watson (1999, 2003).\n15 See Orphanides and van Norden (2002) and Orphanides (2004).\n16 See Valletta and Cleary (2008), Fernald and Matoba (2009), and Rissman (2009). In contrast, Weidner and Williams (2009) estimate a large decline in potential output during the current recession.\n17 See Sargent and Wallace (1981).\n\nReferences\nChristiano, Lawrence J., Martin Eichenbaum, and Charles L.

            "content": "Introduction\nGood afternoon and thank you, Mark [(Dobson), president and CEO of the Chamber] for that introduction. And thanks to the Chamber of Commerce of St. Joseph County for inviting me this afternoon to share my thoughts on nontraditional monetary policies and the economic outlook.\nFollowing the worst financial crisis of the past 70 years, we are currently experiencing a recession that will likely match or surpass those of the 1970s and 1980s in depth and severity. Much like the rest of Indiana and surrounding states, the South Bend—Mishawaka area has been hit hard by the national recession.\nWhile the area's outsized education and health services sectors have buffered overall job loss to some extent, this buffer has been undone by the region's outsized concentration in manufacturing and distribution.\nThese exceptional circumstances have posed great challenges for both the economy and policymakers. For us at the Fed, the response has been to pursue a variety of aggressive and innovative approaches that differ significantly from the standard policies of the past. The programs we have put in place are designed specifically for these exceptional circumstances. As such, they will have to be unwound as our financial system returns to normal and the economy is more clearly headed toward sustainable growth and price stability. Today I would like to discuss the precepts that underlie these nontraditional policies, provide my outlook for the economy, and conclude with thoughts on some of the tactical issues we must consider when unwinding the programs. I should note that these are my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nNontraditional policies\nIn the current crisis, traditional monetary policy has reached its limits in two ways. One obvious way is that the federal funds target rate, which is the Fed's traditional policy instrument, has been lowered to essentially zero. This target cannot be reduced below zero even when further accommodation is warranted. The second limit of traditional policy has to do with the functioning of financial markets. Under normal circumstances, participants seeking profit opportunities tend to align risk-adjusted returns across all markets. This allows a change in the federal funds rate to flow through to other interest rates across the entire range of maturity and risk structures. But during the crisis, disparities in rates across markets have indicated that arbitrage was not taking place as usual. Thus, even before our target was constrained by zero, we found that we could not affect the interest rates that matter to consumers and businesses to stimulate aggregate demand as much as was necessary.\nBecause of these limitations, the Fed has turned to nontraditional monetary policies. These can be broadly categorized in three groups. The first group expands on something that has always been a part of our policy toolkit, namely, discount window lending through which the Federal Reserve Banks make short-term loans to depository institutions against adequate collateral. Since August 2007, the Fed has taken steps to encourage the use of the discount window as a source of liquidity, including reducing the discount rate and lengthening the terms of the loans. The second group of policies consists of opening new lending facilities to a wide array of participants in financial markets. One can think of it as a sort of discount window for financial participants that are not depository institutions. The third group of policies consists of large-scale purchases of government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) debt, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and Treasury securities. This can be seen as an extension of traditional open-market operations. The Fed still exchanges reserves for bonds, but on a vastly different scale.\nTaken as a whole, our nontraditional monetary policies might look like a vast array of acronyms—the famous \"alphabet soup\" (TSLF, PDCF, etc.). But there is a method to the madness, and I will highlight three precepts that guide our thinking. The first is insurance: Don't put all your eggs in one acronym. The second is innovation: This is not your grandfather's Fed. And the third is size: In an environment of great uncertainty, as we like to say in Chicago, \"make no little plans.\" I will discuss each of these precepts before addressing some tactical issues we must consider in unwinding the programs and returning to more traditional policies.\n\nInsurance\nTo understand the first precept, we have to remember the diversity of risks and related uncertainties that emerged in the past two years and the speed at which they transpired. Each risk was a challenge to our mandate of fostering a sound financial system, stable growth, and price stability. We saw failures in parts of the financial system, but did not know how serious they were and how they would affect the rest of the economy. We also saw economic activity begin to deteriorate significantly, but were uncertain how deep the downturn would be. Finally, price levels declined for the first time in decades, but we did not know if we would slide into an extended period of deflation.\nThe diagnosis of our problems was surrounded with much uncertainty and included some dire scenarios. But the remedies that we considered brought their own measure of uncertainty as well. By definition, we had little experience with these new policies and were unsure how effective they would be and which could be implemented in a timely fashion given the practical and legal constraints we were facing.\nThe Fed decided to adopt an approach that would be robust to these multiple dimensions of uncertainty. Rather than rely on any single tool lest it prove inadequate, we have put in place a number of different remedies in quick succession, in the hope that we may learn which ones work best without losing valuable time.\n\nInnovation\nI won't retrace the complete list of new programs, as these have been covered extensively in other speeches. But I will discuss one program because it demonstrates our second precept, which is the need to innovate as quickly as circumstances change. Let's look at the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF.\nAfter the failure of Lehman Brothers, the markets for asset-backed securities (ABS) effectively shut down in October 2008. The ABS markets play a vital role in providing funds that support loans to consumers and small businesses. In response the Fed announced the formation of TALF in November 2008. With backing from the Treasury, TALF is aimed at revitalizing the ABS markets by providing loans to investors to finance their purchases of certain highly rated asset-backed securities, with the securities themselves as collateral for the loans.\nThe first markets targeted by the facility were relatively simple assets—auto, student, credit card, and Small Business Administration (SBA) loans. These securities were familiar to market participants, and their pricing was relatively straightforward. Since then we have moved on to more complex and long-lived instruments, including legacy assets.\nTALF has generated two opposite concerns: One is that our credit requirements are too conservative and unlikely to fund large volumes; the other is that the central bank is taking too much credit risk on its balance sheet. I think we have struck a good balance between these concerns. We have taken appropriate action to limit our exposure to credit risk through stringent credit quality requirements on the assets, substantial haircuts, and the direct support of the Treasury. Importantly, TALF is not intended to substitute for the ABS markets as they existed before the crisis, nor is it intended to revive them to their former level of activity solely on the back of the Federal Reserve System. The goal is to boost private sector credit flows in support of the economy by mitigating some of the stresses in these markets. In turn, this should allow the markets to reach their appropriate size in a less disruptive fashion. At this point we see evidence that TALF is working as intended. Spreads on asset-backed securities have come down. And while much of the recent ABS issuance has been supported by TALF loans, some institutional investors are re-entering these markets without that support.\n\nRightsizing\nThe third precept relates to size. Until recently, monetary policy tended to change in small steps, a behavior that some have labeled \"policy gradualism.\" Our response to the present crisis has moved beyond gradualism. Our rapid January 2008 cuts in the federal funds rate were one indication, and the size of our nontraditional policies is another.\nNotably, in March we announced a considerable increase in our large-scale asset purchase program, in which we buy GSE agency debt and MBS and long-term Treasury notes. We made this aggressive move to substantially increase monetary accommodation in light of the considerable risks that the real economy faced at that time. As a consequence, however, there was another large increase in the size of our balance sheet, and it is now well above what it has typically been.\nWe moved swiftly to launch nontraditional policies, but some of them have taken time to implement because their proper design required great care. And just as traditional policy is well known to act with long lags, nontraditional policies also take time to affect economic activity. Weak economic news by itself would not imply that we have misjudged the size of our latest actions. In my view, it would take a significant deterioration relative to our outlook for me to view our current policies as inadequate.\n\nEconomic Outlook\nTurning now to the economic outlook, the U.S. economy has contracted sharply since the middle of last year, with real gross domestic product (GDP) having dropped at an average annual rate of about 4.1 percent from the third quarter of 2008 to the first quarter of this year. Employment has fallen by more than 5-1/2 million since then. The downturn in activity has been widespread across the economy, with significant declines in consumer spending, residential investment, and business investment.\nHowever, there have been some favorable developments of late, and the possibility that the economy is closer to a turning point is stronger now than just three months ago. Although the data have been uneven, our reading of the recent indicators is that the pace of contraction is slowing and that activity is bottoming out. We expect modest increases in output in the second half of this year followed by somewhat stronger growth in 2010.\nSo what are these signs of improvement that underlie this forecast? First, financial market conditions have improved, with credit spreads and other measures of market stress much lower than they were in late 2008 and early 2009.\nConsumer spending, which had dropped sharply since the second half of last year, has been roughly flat so far in 2009. Housing markets, after more than three years of decline, have also shown some signs of stabilizing. Sales of both new and existing homes have appeared to flatten out in recent months, though both remain at very low levels. Meanwhile, homebuilders have reduced their backlog of unsold new homes—a precondition for any recovery in homebuilding. But the backlog of unsold existing homes remains high, and delinquency and foreclosure rates continue to be a substantial risk to the housing market recovery.\nLabor markets remain weak, but there has been a (somewhat uneven) decline in the pace of job losses. The May and June average of monthly declines in employment was about half the rate of contraction as the beginning of this year, and newly filed jobless claims seem to have peaked in late March. However, firms are still reluctant to hire, and the unemployment rate reached 9-1/2 percent in June and will likely further increase through the remainder of the year before it flattens out in 2010.\nThe industrial side of the economy has been especially hard hit this year, but there are signs that the worst of the decline in the sector is in the past. Business fixed investment remains weak, but the decline is getting shallower. Steep inventory liquidations made significant negative contributions to output growth in late 2008 and early 2009. But this means that inventories are in better alignment with sales, so we expect to see less dramatic liquidation in the months ahead. In turn, the smaller declines translate into a net positive for GDP growth. Finally, in the coming months, the fiscal stimulus will continue to have positive influences on the economy.\nForecasting inflation is never easy, but these are particularly difficult times for this exercise. All one has to do is look at the remarkable lack of consensus among professional forecasters. The spread between the lowest and the highest inflation forecast for 2010 reported by Blue Chip Economic Indicators is more than twice what it was a year ago for inflation in 2009. Two conflicting forces could come into play to explain such a wide range of opinions. A high unemployment rate and low rates of capacity usage, such as we now have, normally place strong downward pressure on costs and tend to lower inflation. Indeed, some statistical models have pointed to possible deflation risks in the quarters ahead. But inflation has not fallen to the extent we might have feared; and there is another factor that could come into play, namely, consumers' and businesses' expectations of future inflation. So far, expectations as measured by surveys have remained relatively stable, which is a bit of a surprise considering that the severity of the downturn might have worked to lower them. And as economic conditions improve, consumers and businesses might expect upward pressure on inflation; and experience shows that a rise in inflation expectations, once solidified, becomes embedded in many economic decisions and makes inflation harder to control.\nCurrently, core inflation is near 2 percent, a level I generally find acceptable. In the near term, I think the downward forces on inflation will be greater than the upward forces, and we could see some declines in core inflation. But over the medium term I see the risks to the inflation forecast as being more balanced.\n\nBack to normal\nOver time, as the economy is more clearly headed toward sustainable growth and stable prices, the challenge for the Fed will be the unwinding of our nontraditional programs. As this happens, the Fed will progressively return to its traditional policies—that is, setting the federal funds rate—and will reduce its balance sheet in an orderly way.\nHow will it do so? Partly on its own. Many of our liquidity programs provide short-term loans, so as these programs come to an end, the loans will mature fairly quickly and our balance sheet will shrink. Also, the pricing of our programs is designed to be unattractive in normal times. As they cease to be useful, they will cease to be used. Indeed, some programs are already being used less, and we should see that trend continue as conditions in financial markets improve further.\nNonetheless, a significant portion of our balance sheet may not shrink on its own or at the appropriate rate. We need tools to manage it actively so that monetary policy can be more easily recalibrated. In this respect, we can be as creative on the way out as we were on the way in; or, put another way, we can be creative with our liabilities the way we have been creative with our assets.\nOne way to manage our balance sheet is to sell the assets. They can be sold outright, or they can be leased through reverse repurchase transactions. Another tool is the payment of interest on reserves, which we began last fall. Without interest on reserves, rates are raised only by restraining the quantity of reserves available to the market, and reaching our target could require sharp reductions in our balance sheet. With interest on reserves, we can raise the interest paid on reserves in tandem with our target rate. This will raise the opportunity cost of banks' lending and keep the federal funds rate near the target.\nWhat circumstances might require us to use the tools we have, and those we may have in the future, to reduce our balance sheet aggressively? One clear concern is price stability. Our balance sheet grew very fast and remains large. There are historical precedents for large increases in central bank balance sheets to result in broader credit expansion and to be subsequently associated with inflation. But I want to emphasize the middle link in this chain: Inflationary pressures will not arise without broader credit expansion, and there is no evidence for that at present.\nNevertheless, these precedents explain why there is concern on this point and why we look after our ability to reverse the growth in our balance sheet.\nRight now, in the absence of unexpected shocks and changes, I don't foresee the need for any major changes to the policy parameters of the programs, and I view us in a wait and see mode.\n\nConclusion\nThese have been challenging times, and the Fed has met the challenge with an array of innovative programs that depart from traditional policy. We have pursued this approach in a manner that is both commensurate to the size and robust to the variety of risks we have faced. The multiplicity of programs should not obscure the fact that, although the means are many, the ends remain unchanged. Both traditional and nontraditional policies are aimed at fostering a stable financial system, sustainable growth, and price stability. As economic conditions continue to improve and we lay the groundwork for an orderly reduction in our balance sheet, these ends remain uppermost in our minds.\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

            "content": "Introduction\n Good evening and thank you for the opportunity to address this distinguished group in such an important time for the global economy. The European Economics and Financial Center (EEFC) has a history of engaging practitioners and theorists in the healthy exchange of ideas, promoting closer links between the two groups. Indeed, the type of research and advisory work performed by the EEFC is even more important when policy is addressing interconnected global issues.\nAs we all are too well aware, these are turbulent times in financial markets. We are in the midst of the worst financial crisis since the 1930s. Numerous important financial institutions have either disappeared or survived only with substantial government assistance. Even among those escaping such fates, many have seen their balance sheets significantly damaged by poor risk management over the last decade. As these institutions have deleveraged and recapitalized, there have been substantial disruptions in credit flows, and economic activity around the world has suffered significantly.\nThis crisis has revealed some major weaknesses in our financial regulatory framework. If we truly hope to be able to say \"never again,\" we need to act aggressively to address these weaknesses. All around the world, there is a healthy debate currently under way over how best to do this. I believe this debate is valuable. As we adopt new public policies in response to the crisis, we need to be confident in our evaluations of the lessons we've learned and understand how regulatory changes will affect the efficiency of the financial services sector going forward. Here in the UK, you have responded to the turmoil with the passage of the Banking Act of 2009. In the U.S., the Obama administration has just unveiled a plan for financial regulatory reform and sent it to Congress for review. 1\nAll the major proposals seek to impose greater discipline on the industry. Such discipline, both from the market and from regulators, should lead to changes in behavior that reduce the likelihood that firms will find themselves on the brink of failure. In practice this is likely to mean new requirements on capital structure, enhanced liquidity management, and perhaps some restrictions on activities. But, no matter how well crafted such policies are, we also have to recognize the risk that financial institutions still may fail. Thus, there appears to be broad agreement on the need for reforms in how we deal with the possible failure of systemically important financial institutions—what people often call the too-big-to-fail (TBTF) problem. That is my topic for this evening.\nFor good reason, the development of an orderly process for resolving distressed institutions is a common element of both your Banking Act and the Obama administration's new proposal. I'll argue that having such a mechanism is important not just because some institutions will inevitably fail and thus need resolution, but because without it, market discipline is significantly compromised. For market discipline to be effective, failure has to be a real possibility for all institutions. Meltzer once said: \"Capitalism without failure is like religion without sin.\" And given the events of the last two years, market participants would be justified in at least having some doubts about whether certain firms would be allowed to fail in future crises. Thus, in order to create effective market discipline, we need a regime shift that removes such doubt.\nAs I'll discuss, TBTF is a very important, but difficult problem. And one for which important details all too often get overlooked or ignored. However, it is the details that will determine the success of policy in this area. Additionally, there is probably no single adjustment that would resolve the problems associated with TBTF.\nRather, it will likely take a multifaceted solution. Tonight, I want to give you my take on some issues related to too-big-to-fail, as well as stress the importance of some of the details and the reasons for a multifaceted approach to the problem. I should note that these are my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhat is the too-big-to-fail problem?\nThe TBTF problem is the perception—and perhaps the reality—that the failure of some institutions would have such large spillovers to other parts of the financial system, and such significant repercussions for the economy, that regulators would need to step in to prevent failure. These interventions could insulate creditors, counterparties, and perhaps even shareholders from losses. Left unchecked, this introduces a classic moral hazard problem: Financial institutions will have incentives to grow too large, to take on too much risk, and to be too slow to recapitalize when they encounter difficulties.\nIn the U.S., the TBTF problem first came to prominence with the 1984 failure of Continental Illinois Bank—a bank located directly across the street from the Chicago Fed. In the resolution process, equity holders were wiped out, but there were concerns about the potential spillovers if debt holders were required to take losses. Thus, Continental was deemed TBTF and debt holders were rescued.2 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) took temporary ownership of the bank and did not relinquish it until later in the decade.\nAfter the failure of Continental and the heavy losses associated with the thrift industry in the late 1980s, the U.S. Congress was very critical of bank supervisory forbearance. It enacted legislation that dictated \"prompt corrective action,\" or PCA. When a troubled bank's capital falls below successive capital thresholds, it must raise additional capital, restrict activities, restrict interest payments and asset growth, cease payment of dividends, and limit senior executive compensation.3 With the same legislation, an explicit policy on TBTF was codified in the systemic risk exception to the 1990 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA). The goal was to explicitly minimize the use of TBTF by making the process very public and requiring sign-off by leading regulators and senior officials, including the U.S. President.\nWhile PCA worked fairly well in the recent financial crisis, some large commercial banks failed and were liquidated. Others were purchased, some with support from regulatory authorities and some without support. There were, however, some perceived inconsistencies and concerns about ad hoc procedures in certain situations. Two notable cases were the sale of Wachovia Corporation—which, by the way, was the first time the systemic risk exception to FDICIA was ever deployed—and when the FDIC took over management of the day-to-day operations of IndyMac Federal Bank after it was unable to find a buyer.\nThe recent financial crisis also revealed new dimensions of the TBTF problem. The systemic risk exception applies only to commercial banks. But recently there have been significant issues regarding the systemic implications from the failure of large nonbank financial firms. Significant problems in the U.S. have occurred surrounding investment banks, and similar concerns are being expressed about insurance companies and hedge funds. There are also issues regarding the relationships between banks and their parent holding companies. For example, significant losses have been imposed on stakeholders of bank holding companies—although the stakeholders were not always clear on whether they owned claims on the bank or on the holding company. More generally, the complicated interconnections between the bank and its holding company have made the resolution of the bank more difficult and costly.4 \nThese nonbank financial institutions are organizations for which no formal systemic risk exception exists; their resolution is handled through standard bankruptcy proceedings.5 Such proceedings do not bring any extra resources to bear to deal with potential spillover effects to other market participants and the real economy. Although the societal costs from such spillovers are difficult to quantify, at times they could be substantial. Concerns about the disruptive aspects of putting a systemically important nonbank through the bankruptcy process has made regulators and others rethink the regulatory infrastructure covering these institutions in a number of ways.\n\nCan regulators \"just say no\"?\nLet's discuss some of the means people have suggested to address TBTF problems. One view is rather simple: Let the market work. This view holds that TBTF problems arise only because regulators lack sufficient backbone to let large firms fail. If the authorities would just commit to not undertaking bailouts and let existing financial and bankruptcy laws operate, the resolution process would proceed with losses being allocated according to predetermined priorities. There may be temporary market disruptions, but the claim is that the disruptions will be manageable.\nAdvocates of such a hands-off policy argue that the main problems resulting from TBTF are moral hazard and the long-run distortions and inefficiencies associated with it. In this view, problems arise when authorities deviate from a policy of nonintervention, sending mixed signals and confusing markets. This weakens the incentives of firms and their creditors to exercise prudent judgment. If there were no expectation of a government intervention, financial institutions would be compelled to choose a capital structure to withstand market forces, prudently manage risk, and, as a result, lower the probability of a large bank failure.\nThe logic of market discipline is certainly compelling. Given adequate transparency, the market has substantial potential to monitor firm behavior, perhaps more closely than a small number of regulators. And in my view, enhanced market discipline is almost certainly an important part of the solution to our regulatory problems. But the shift to a policy of increased reliance on market discipline is not a simple process. Regulators cannot simply decide to \"just say no\" going forward. Their commitment to avoid intervention must be credible, and must be perceived to be credible by the markets. Credibility can take years to develop and can be destroyed quickly by just one instance of forbearance or the provision of exceptional assistance.\nPlus there is another issue: It is not obvious that the optimal choice in dealing with the potential failure of a systematically important financial institution is always to \"just say no.\" Let's think about the underlying the decision to let such an institution fail or to provide it with exceptional support.\nThe costs of providing exceptional support are increased future risk-taking by other large or highly interconnected (TBTF) institutions without inducing corresponding increases in risk management. Such increased risk-taking would lead to distortions in both the levels and allocation of credit, possibly inducing excessive investment in higher-risk projects or sectors of the economy. This would adversely affect real macroeconomic performance.\nAlternatively, the costs of letting a large institution fail in a disorderly way are the macroeconomic consequences of resulting disruptions in financial markets. Creditworthy households and businesses may not be able to fund their ongoing activities. Furthermore, investment in plant and equipment would be distorted, which could also have long-run implications resulting from a suboptimal capital stock.\nThe cold calculus of this decision would involve comparing the two costs. This is very difficult to do and intelligent individuals can reasonably disagree on the two magnitudes. Proponents of the \"just say no\" policy will argue that in the moment of crisis, regulators overestimate the cost from current market distortions and discount the future benefits from imposing market discipline. That is human nature. As a result, regulators may occasionally err on the side of providing exceptional assistance.6 Perhaps. However, it is not at all clear that this has been the case in recent situations.\nConsider one of the more prominent episodes during the course of the current crisis. In March of last year, the Federal Reserve provided extraordinary assistance to facilitate the sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase. Proponents of the \"just say no\" position argue that this was a mistake.7 Bear should have been allowed to fail, they argue, with debt holders and counterparties taking appropriate losses. This, in their view, would have sent a clear message that government assistance would not be forthcoming in the future. They claim the consequences for the economy would have been relatively modest and worth the long-term benefits. I disagree.\nLet's think about the counterfactual question of what would have happened if we had simply let Bear fail at the outset of the crisis. While it is impossible to know for sure how events would have turned out, I think that it is quite likely that we would have seen markets seize up sooner than they actually did. My thinking is influenced by the events following the failure of Lehman Brothers, when investors became extraordinarily risk averse and withdrew liquidity funding. I think a Bear Stearns failure would have almost surely led to similar risk aversion. For instance, Bear also was prominent in the tri-party repo market, which serves as an important source of short-term funding for large financial institutions. Upon failure, Bear's counterparties would have received collateral, which they either could not or would not want to hold. This could have lead to a dumping of certain asset classes on the market at fire-sale prices and, most likely a general aversion to counterparty risk. Similarly, just like the Reserve Fund held too much of Lehman Brothers' commercial paper when it failed, other mutual funds were likely overexposed to the paper of Bear Stearns. Thus, a Bear failure might also have generated at the time a run on money market mutual funds and commercial paper markets.\nFurthermore, the problems in financial markets were already largely in place by the spring of 2008. Losses related to mortgage portfolios were going to be incurred by someone. The credit default swap (CDS) exposure of AIG (American International Group Inc.) had been put in place years before and losses from that exposure were not a result of poor risk management following the demise of Bear Stearns, on March 17. In retrospect, given the massive mortgage-related losses, the downgrade of AIG was likely inevitable based on its investment strategy. The calls for additional CDS collateral were going to be triggered regardless of the decisions on Bear Stearns or Lehman Brothers, resulting in the type of liquidity crisis that necessitated loans from the central bank.\nIn my view, the conclusion to be drawn from this hypothetical is that not providing exceptional assistance to Bear would have resulted in financial distress and a stock market implosion in March of last year rather than in September. While one cannot say for sure whether the situation would have been worse, I personally doubt it would have been better. Without assistance, the potential for even more widespread disruption seems more plausible to me. A fundamental observation is that large mortgage losses had to be allocated among leveraged investors. This set in motion a scramble to avoid taking losses.\nNevertheless, the argument can be made that by letting Bear Stearns enter bankruptcy during a period of financial distress, financial institutions would have realized that they would be subject to market discipline in the future, which would induce more prudent behavior. However, I think it is more likely that we would have seen exactly the opposite reaction. Given the likely severe fallout, regulators would have been sharply criticized. This could have generated a perception that regulators would never again allow such a calamity to occur. Thus the commitment to \"just say no\" would no longer be credible. The market would perceive the potential for using TBTF to actually be greater than before, not less. Indeed, this is the lesson that some draw from the failure of Lehman Brothers and the resulting financial upheaval.\nThese concerns about the role of market discipline and its limitations are strongest during times of crisis. The decisions regarding the failure of a single large bank during a more tranquil time could be very different. But the cost–benefit calculus could also be made significantly different, even during times of crisis, if a better infrastructure was in place to resolve problem institutions in a less disruptive manner. We would all prefer such a tilting away from forbearance and public assistance. However, to assume you could \"just say no\" in the environment of March 2008 with the existing infrastructure is somewhat idealistic in my view and overlooks a number of details involved with the resolution process.\nTo position ourselves to better utilize market discipline, we need a better resolution process that will address the new dimensions of the TBTF problem. I believe an effective resolution process requires two elements:\nAn entity must be responsible for overseeing systemically important financial institutions (micro-prudential regulation). In order to reduce the chances that the systemically important institutions get into financial difficulties, that entity would need the power to gather necessary data and to restrict the behavior of these institutions. The entity would also need to evaluate the interconnectedness of institutions and to address potential problems for markets as a result of spillover effects (macro-prudential regulation).\nThere should be a well-defined resolution process that limits market disruption and avoids the problems associated with a financial institution going through the standard bankruptcy process. Regulators have been criticized too often for addressing each failure in an ad hoc manner, as if there were no lessons from history. The need for an advance plan is imperative.8 \nThe Obama administration's reform plan provides useful proposals for these concerns. Yet even under the best plan that meets these elements, getting the details right is crucial. Who will decide when the resolution process begins? What should the trigger be? Should prompt corrective action begin at higher levels of capitalization than the current triggers for banks? Is temporary nationalization a necessary component? Will allowing for this potential lead to excessive use of this option? How will a multinational presence complicate the policy alternatives and how can that best be addressed? Details matter, and by getting the details correct, we can hopefully minimize the TBTF problem going forward.\n\nLimiting size and complexity\nSome recommendations to address TBTF involve limiting the ability or incentive of financial institutions to become particularly large or complex, thus lessening the odds of adverse spillovers. In other words, to keep institutions from becoming too big to fail, keep them from becoming too big, period.9 In the U.S., one could possibly achieve this by strictly enforcing national deposit share limits and perhaps tightening those limits over time. One could even consider the breaking up of firms in a manner similar to how Standard Oil was broken up in the U.S. in the early twentieth century. But size is not the only factor that would need to be considered. There would also have to be limits on \"interconnectedness\" and on product complexity. Additionally, there are probably other time-varying dimensions that may prove to be significant. The dynamic and evolutionary features of systemic importance will require continual monitoring.\nI'd like to make two points about these policy alternatives. First, one would assume that financial institutions increase their size, develop new financial products, and become interconnected with other firms because doing so creates real economic value. It may be that this went somewhat beyond socially optimal levels in recent years. But at a basic level, growth, new products, and activities that increase interconnectedness can improve welfare. Thus, one needs to be careful to not overly constrain such activities.10 \nA second issue involves the market response to regulatory constraints. If we constrain certain behavior, firms will likely develop alternative means to accomplish the same ends.11One can argue that many of the off-balance-sheet items and special-purpose vehicles that were created in recent years were at least in part attempts to get around regulatory constraints. This so-called regulatory arbitrage also likely increased the role of the shadow financial sector.12Thus, while constraints sound straightforward and simple to implement, they may require significant resources to effectively enforce and may be less effective than expected as firms attempt to get around them.\nWhile severe limits on the size and scope of financial institutions may be neither feasible nor desirable, if such activities result in risk to the financial system it may be appropriate to impose special requirements on them. Thus, an alternative proposal to address TBTF is to expand the risk-based capital requirements to explicitly account for contributions to systemic risks. This could involve larger weights on factors associated with systemic risk, such as institution size, off-balance-sheet activities, and the degree of interconnectedness with other institutions. Adjusting capital requirements for these and other systemic factors would make the decisions of financial institutions more closely reflect their impact on society rather than just themselves. This idea of forcing financial institutions to account for the impact of their actions on others is also addressed in the Obama administration's proposal. This approach could fit within our existing Basel capital requirements, as regulators could expand the risk factors to account for systemic risk. Of course, we would still encounter regulatory avoidance. And it also could be particularly difficult to decide on the variables and weights to include in the risk-based capital calculations.\nThis incorporation of systemic risk factors would require supervisors to obtain improved measures of interconnectedness and systemic importance. Along these lines, the Squam Lake Working Group on Financial Regulation13has recommended the development of a new comprehensive database to be managed by supervisors. All larger institutions would be required to provide systemic-risk-related data at regular time intervals—say, on a quarterly basis—into the central system, as would financial institutions of any size deemed to have operations that would lead to significant spillover effects. One could easily envision this including a broad array of financial institutions (banks, thrifts, insurance companies, hedge funds, government-sponsored enterprises, etc.) and possibly entities outside of the financial sector.\nThe goal is to allow regulators and, potentially, the market to better understand the fault lines in financial markets and to more clearly understand the impact of systemic risk. The Squam Lake Working Group stresses the need to share the information among regulatory agencies and to provide it to the private markets, perhaps with a lag, to enable the marketplace to detect trends and tendencies that may otherwise be overlooked.14\nIn addition to modifying the risk weights, there have also been proposals to introduce countercyclical capital requirements. It is typically during boom times that excessive risk taking occurs, as firms get caught up in the good times and seem to assume they will continue forever. Countercyclical capital requirements would tend to lean against the wind to combat this. For example, just to fix ideas for the discussion, to be considered adequately capitalized, tier 1 plus tier 2 capital requirements could be changed from 8 percent across the entire business cycle to perhaps 10 percent during \"good times\" and 7 percent during \"problem times.\" Time-varying requirements would serve as a governor to excessive growth and would allow for the generation of an additional capital cushion that could be utilized when the economy slows. Although this would induce credit restraint if imposed in the middle of a cycle, sufficient planning and credibility would ultimately lead institutions to adopt more risk-prudent capital structures.\nWhile I believe there is a place for such revisions to capital requirements, again, the details are crucial. Attempting to force firms to hold capital to reflect the systemic risks they pose is easy to defend in principle, but very difficult to adequately implement. Liquidity problems were a major concern during the recent crisis. How would liquidity be incorporated into changes in capital requirements? Recall that the Basel capital requirements generated concerns about banks gaming imperfections in the relative capital requirements across asset risk categories. Imposing capital requirements on systemic-risk-related factors and weights that vary across the business cycle would be significantly more difficult and would induce a response by the affected firms. Thus, regulators would need to anticipate and react to that response in setting policy. As such, properly setting capital requirements will likely be an ongoing, iterative process.\n\nContingent capital and self-created bankruptcy plans\nThe idea of supplementing bank capital during \"good\" times has been taken further by Mark Flannery and members of the Squam Lake Working Group. Fundamentally, the argument is that banks need to hold more capital and they tend to resist holding higher levels because it is expensive. Similarly, existing shareholders are not in favor of issuing new capital because of the associated dilutive effects. To address this problem, the Squam Lake Working Group proposes that systemically important banks should be required to issue new \"contingent capital certificates.\" These securities would be sold as debt liabilities that make standard tax-deductible interest payments. However, unlike conventional debt obligations, they would be converted into equity shares if some predetermined threshold was breached.15 The triggering mechanism could be based on a number of things including existing capital levels, equity share prices, declaration by the regulators that conditions of systemic stress exist, or a violation of covenants in the debt contract. Conversion would not be optional; rather it would be mandatory once triggered by one of these mechanisms. If all goes well, the bonds are retired with typical cash payments to the debt holders. However, if the bank's position deteriorates, the debt converts into new equity shares, diluting the existing shares and serving to cushion losses. To avoid reaching this point of conversion the bank would likely be more willing to promptly issue new equity when difficulties are encountered. Thus, the new debt instruments could improve risk-taking incentives and provide an additional capital cushion to insulate taxpayers and the deposit insurance fund from costly interventions. Another problem might occur if the supply of funds to these convertible investments is small, and hence, the debt would be expensive. Well, if more capital was in place, the convertible debt would be less likely to convert; hence, it would be less risky and presumably cheaper. For safety and soundness reasons, a better capital structure is a key objective, and these forces help to improve the capital structure.\nA related alternative involves enhancing capital cushions by requiring systemically important firms to purchase contingent capital in the form of capital insurance.16 The general purpose is the same as that for using contingent capital certificates—that is, to provide a source of additional capital during crisis periods. With this proposal it is imperative that the insurance be fail-proof; thus, proposals typically require that the insurance funds be placed in a segregated lock box—perhaps in Treasuries.17 Targeted issuers of the insurance could include sovereign wealth funds or private equity. The trigger for the insurance payment could be based on the condition of the individual firm or on the condition of the financial industry. Again, the purpose of the insurance is to address catastrophes; thus it would be more commonly associated with deteriorating industry conditions.\nA final reform proposal requires that systemically important financial institutions help plan their own resolution process. The idea is to have a \"shelf bankruptcy\" plan that has already considered and addressed problem resolution areas. This may sound somewhat odd, but the firm itself must be in a preferred position to be aware of potential impediments to resolution.18 Supervisors would require firms to address potential resolution problem areas, such as the transfer of the derivatives book or resolution of foreign subsidiaries. One can envision this plan being stress tested as part of the regular examination process. Such a discussion would yield risk-management benefits for the firms and the supervisor. Requiring such a plan could also somewhat constrain firms from taking on higher-risk activities during boom times and would force them to think about contingent plans and develop them even when financial difficulties seem far removed. Again, the plan sets up ex ante procedures to help avoid conditions that require consideration of TBTF.\nAs interesting as these new proposals are, they also have potential implementation problems. Again, details count. For contingent capital there is the matter of deciding on the appropriate conversion trigger. For the \"shelf bankruptcy\" plan, there are potential issues of regulatory avoidance and attempting to hide relevant information. There is also the issue of deciding whether the information should be made public. All these issues need to be carefully evaluated. The quality of the decisions on these details will determine the effectiveness of the new program.\n\nClosing comments\nSo where do I come out on these issues? I do believe that we can do a much better job of preventing (albeit, not entirely avoiding) crisis situations and I believe we can be better prepared to address them when they do occur. Much of the current policy discussion on the need for some form of a systemic risk regulator and improved resolution process is most appropriate and should be thoroughly vetted. Both ideas are included in President Obama's regulatory reform proposal that was recently sent to Congress. Obviously, there are a number of details to be addressed, but I hope we can grasp the moment and not let the opportunity to implement meaningful reform pass.\nI believe that such policies aimed at influencing the ex ante behavior of the firm are likely to be effective at avoiding crisis situations in the first place. The reinforcement or backup capital created through the contingent capital or catastrophe insurance requirements would better enable firms to ride out the turbulent times. The countercyclical capital requirements and/or the self-created \"shelf bankruptcy\" plan could serve as a governor on risk-taking during boom times, again, serving to decrease the potential for encountering financial crises. It could also lead to a more efficient and effective failure resolution process. I believe these proposals merit careful consideration.\nFor a number of reasons, I think it is important to create \"regime-shifting\" reforms. Here, the reform proposals could also be useful in that they announce to the industry that a new regulatory environment exists. Procedures would be in place to dampen the potential need for TBTF policies. There would be fewer costs involved from letting relatively complex firms be resolved without social assistance. Thus, there would be fewer incentives to protect the troubled financial firm. Realizing this, it would be in the financial firm's best interest to more prudently manage risk. Less emphasis would be placed on regulatory experiences from the past. Moral hazard would be reduced.\nFinally, while I find a number of these proposals to be interesting, I don't see how any in isolation would fully address all the associated problems. It seems that there is a need for a systemic regulator and a fully developed failure resolution plan for systemically important firms. While these changes are necessary, additional tools are required to alter firm behavior to lower the potential for encountering problems and to make the resolution go smoothly once it becomes necessary. I believe a number of the proposals discussed could serve that purpose, and they would be complementary instead of substitutes. They warrant serious consideration if we are to adequately address the issues associated with TBTF.\n\nNotes\n1 See The Banking Act of 2009, available online; and U.S. Department of the Treasury, 2009, Financial Regulatory Reform, A New Foundation: Rebuilding Financial Supervision and Regulation, Washington, DC, June 17, available online.\n2 While Continental Illinois is often associated with the first use of the TBTF policy in the U.S., many of the characteristics of the resolution were not unique and had been utilized before. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) had provided assistance in the form of a $325 million loan to First Pennsylvania only four years earlier. Similarly, the FDIC had guaranteed all deposits just two years earlier in the case of Greenwich Savings Bank. However, the FDIC's involvement as a primary shareholder was unique.

Evanoff, 1990, \"An empirical examination of bank reserve management behavior,\" Journal of Banking and Finance, Vol. 14, No. 1, March, pp. 131–143.\n13 The Squam Lake Working Group on Financial Regulation is a nonpartisan, nonaffiliated group of fifteen academics who have come together to offer guidance on the reform of financial regulation. Policy positions of the group can be found at www.squamlakeworkinggroup.org.\n14 The Squam Lake Working Group recognizes the potential for window dressing, which could limit the usefulness of the data. While this is a problem with all mandated data, it may be less of a problem than usual in this case. For complicated portfolio or off-balance-sheet strategies with significant term and liquidity risk, unwinding positions regularly for window-dressing purposes is probably difficult and costly.\n15 Alternative triggering mechanisms could be utilized.

            "content": "Introduction\nGood morning and thank you, Diane for that kind introduction. And thanks to Kaarina of the Executives' Club of Chicago for inviting me to speak today. I'm delighted to be here to share my thoughts on non–traditional monetary policies.\nFollowing the worst financial crisis of the past 70 years, we are currently experiencing a recession that will likely match or surpass those of the 1970s and 1980s in depth and severity. These exceptional circumstances have posed great challenges for policymakers. For us at the Fed, the response has been to pursue a variety of aggressive and innovative approaches that differ significantly from the standard policies of the past. The programs we have put in place are designed specifically for these exceptional circumstances. As such, they will have to be unwound as our financial system returns to normal and the economy is more clearly headed toward sustainable growth and price stability. This morning I would like to discuss the precepts that underlie these nontraditional policies and some tactical issues we must address in unwinding them. I should note that these are my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nNontraditional policies\nIn the current crisis, traditional monetary policy has reached its limits in two ways. One obvious way is that the federal funds target rate, which had been the Fed's traditional policy instrument, has been lowered to essentially zero. This target cannot be reduced below zero even when further accommodation is warranted. The second limit of traditional policy has to do with the functioning of financial markets. Under normal circumstances, participants seeking profit opportunities tend to align risk-adjusted returns across all markets. This allows a change in the Federal funds rate to flow through to other interest rates across the entire range of maturity and risk structures. But during the crisis, disparities in rates across markets have indicated that arbitrage was not taking place as usual. Thus, even before our target was constrained by zero, we found that we could not affect the interest rates that matter to consumers and businesses to stimulate aggregate demand as much as was necessary.\nBecause of these limitations, the Fed has turned to nontraditional policies. These can be broadly categorized in three groups. The first group expands on something that has always been a part of our policy toolkit, namely discount window lending through which the Federal Reserve Banks make short-term loans to depository institutions against adequate collateral. Since August 2007, the Fed has taken steps to encourage the use of the discount window as a source of liquidity, including reducing the discount rate and lengthening the terms of the loans. The second group of policies consists of opening new lending facilities to a wide array of participants in financial markets. One can think of it as a sort of discount window for financial actors who are not depository institutions. The third group of policies consists of large-scale purchases of GSE notes. This can be seen as an extension of traditional open-market operations: the Fed still exchanges reserves for bonds, but on a vastly different scale.\nWithin these groups, there are a number of particular programs or facilities, each with its own terms and conditions. Taken as a whole, our nontraditional policies might look like a vast array of acronyms—the famous \"alphabet soup\" (TSLF, PDCF, etc.). But there is a method to the madness, and I will highlight three precepts that guide our thinking. The first is insurance: Don't put all your eggs in one acronym. The second is innovation: This is not your grandfather's Fed. And the third is size: In an environment of great uncertainty, as we like to say in Chicago, \"make no little plans.\" I will discuss each of these precepts in turn, before concluding with some thoughts about the return to traditional policies.\n\nInsurance\nTo understand the first precept, we have to remember the diversity of risks that emerged in the past two years and the speed at which they emerged. Each risk was a challenge to our mandate of fostering a sound financial system, stable growth, and price stability; and diagnosing each risk raised difficult questions. We saw failures in parts of the financial system. How serious were they, and how would they affect the rest of the economy? We also saw economic activity begin to deteriorate significantly, with month–to–month job losses and sales declines as steep as any in recent memory. Finally, prices declined for the first time in decades. Were we about to slide into an extended period of deflation?\nThe diagnosis was surrounded with much uncertainty and included some dire scenarios. But the remedies that we considered brought their own measure of uncertainty as well. By definition, we had little experience with these new policies. Which treatment was appropriate and could be implemented in a timely fashion, particularly given the practical and legal constraints we were facing? Under what circumstances and for how long should it be applied? How should the treatment be scaled back as conditions improve?\nThe Fed decided to adopt an approach that would be robust to these multiple dimensions of uncertainty. Rather than rely on any single tool lest it prove inadequate, we have put in place a number of different remedies in quick succession, in the hope that we may learn which ones work best without losing valuable time.\n\nInnovation\nI won't retrace the complete list of new programs, as these have been covered extensively in other speeches. But I will discuss one program because it demonstrates our second precept, which is the need to innovate as quickly as circumstances change. Let us look at the Term Asset–Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF.\nThe market for asset–backed securities has long played a vital role in funding loans to consumers and small businesses. This market effectively shut down in October 2008 after the failure of Lehman Brothers. In response the Fed announced the formation of TALF in November 2008. With backing from the Treasury, TALF provides loans to investors to finance their purchases of certain highly–rated asset–backed securities, with the securities themselves as collateral for the loans.\nAs conditions evolved we modified the facility along multiple dimensions, even before it began its operations at the beginning of April. The first markets targeted by the facility were those for securities backed by relatively simple assets. These securities were familiar to market participants and their pricing was relatively straightforward. Then we moved on to more complex and long–lived instruments.\nInitially the only eligible securities were those backed by newly and recently originated auto, credit card, and student loans, and small business loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. In April, other securities were made eligible, namely, loans backed by mortgage servicing advances, leases of business equipment or vehicle fleets, and dealer inventories. This month, eligibility was broadened to commercial mortgage–backed securities.\nWe changed the acceptable origination date as well. Initially, securities were eligible for TALF only if they were backed by new or recently issued loans. The intent was to bring the asset–backed market back to life by directly financing investors willing to purchase the securities, and therefore indirectly funding the loans that backed them. In March 2009, the Fed signaled that TALF could be extended to legacy assets, with the intention of stimulating the extension of new credit generally by easing balance sheet pressures on potential lenders.\nFinally, the maximum maturity of TALF loans has been extended from three years to five, and in February the maximum size of the operation was increased from $200 billion to $1 trillion to match the growing list of eligible securities.\nAdmittedly TALF has generated two opposite concerns: one is that our credit requirements are too conservative and unlikely to fund large volumes; the other is that the central bank is taking too much credit risk on its balance sheet. I think we have struck a good balance between these concerns. We have taken appropriate action to limit our exposure to credit risk through stringent credit quality requirements on the assets, substantial haircuts, and the direct support of the Treasury. Importantly, TALF is not intended to substitute for the ABS markets as they existed before the crisis, nor is it intended to revive them to their former level of activity solely on the back of the Federal Reserve System. The goal rather is to jump–start these markets back to life by mitigating some of the stresses they are experiencing. In turn, this should allow them to reach their appropriate size in a less disruptive fashion. At this point we see evidence that TALF is working as intended. Spreads on asset–backed securities have come down. And while much of the recent ABS issuance has been supported by TALF loans, some institutional investors are re–entering these markets without that support.\n\nRightsizing\n The third precept relates to size. Until recently, monetary policy tended to change in small steps, a behavior that some have labeled \"policy gradualism.\" Our response to the present crisis has moved beyond gradualism. Our rapid January 2008 cuts in the Fed funds rate were one indication, and the size of our nontraditional policies is another.\nLast March, as the Fed gave notice that TALF would be expanded, we also announced a considerable increase in the size of another program, our large–scale asset purchases in which we buy agency debt, agency-guaranteed mortgage–backed securities, and Treasury securities. These actions, taken together, represented a substantial escalation of our nontraditional policies, and they will probably maintain or increase the size of our balance sheet well above what it was until a year ago.\nI think this aggressive move was appropriate considering the many risks we were facing, the direness of some forecasts, and the uncertainty surrounding our new tools. Future developments will help us determine if our actions to date have been too much, too little, or just right.\nWe moved swiftly to launch nontraditional policies, but some of them have taken time to implement because their proper design required great care. And just as traditional policy is well known to act with long lags, nontraditional policies also take time to affect economic activity. So I expect to see further deterioration in some areas, notably job market conditions, before our policies gain full traction. Weak economic news by itself would not imply that we have misjudged the size of our latest actions. In my view, it would take a significant deterioration relative to our outlook for me to view our current policies as inadequate.\nOver time the degree of success of specific programs will let us reconsider the size of our actions. If we find that a given program is not proving as useful as we anticipated, we would be faced with a choice between making its terms more attractive (and taking on more risk) or letting it lapse. We will then need to keep in mind that the same level of aggressiveness may not be warranted by the circumstances of the day. Indeed, the possibility that the economy is close to a turning point is stronger now than just two months ago. Financial market spreads have improved even as long Treasury and mortgage rates have increased. And disinflationary pressures have been weaker than we had feared. Part of rightsizing will be to decide where boldness ends.\n\nBack to normal\nOver time, as the economy moves toward sustainable growth and stable prices, the Fed will progressively return to its traditional policies—that is, setting the Fed funds rate—and will reduce its balance sheet in an orderly way.\nHow will it do so? Partly on its own. Many of our liquidity programs provide short–term loans, so as these programs come to an end, the loans will mature fairly quickly and our balance sheet will shrink. Also, the pricing of our programs is designed to be unattractive in normal times, and attractive only to those who really need them in these unusual times. As they cease to be useful, they will cease to be used. Indeed, some programs are already being used less and we should see that trend continue as conditions in financial markets improve further.\nNonetheless, a significant portion of our balance sheet may not shrink on its own or at the appropriate rate. We need tools to reduce it actively so that monetary policy can be easily recalibrated. In this respect, we can be as creative on the way out as we were on the way in; or, put another way, we can be creative with our liabilities the way we have been creative with our assets.\nOne way to manage our balance sheet is to sell the assets. They can be sold outright, or they can be leased through reverse repurchase transactions. Another tool is the payment of interest on reserves, which we began last fall. Without interest on reserves, rates are raised only by restraining the quantity of reserves available to the market, and reaching our target could require sharp reductions in our balance sheet. With interest on reserves, we can raise the interest paid on reserves in tandem with our target rate. This will raise the opportunity cost of banks' lending and keep the Fed funds rate near the target. Finally, as we announced in March, we are seeking with the help of the Treasury additional tools through legislative action. An example of such tools would be the authority to issue interest–bearing debt in exchange for reserves or an expansion of the Supplementary Financing Program.\nWhat circumstances might require us to use the tools we have, and those we may have in the future, to reduce our balance sheet aggressively? One clear concern is price stability. Our balance sheet grew very fast in a matter of weeks last fall, and remains large. There are historical precedents for large increases in central bank balance sheets to result in broader credit expansion and to be subsequently associated with inflation. But I want to emphasize the middle link in this chain: inflationary pressures will not arise without broader credit expansion, and there is no evidence for that at present. Nevertheless, these precedents explain why there is concern on this point and why we look after our ability to reverse the growth in our balance sheet.\nForecasting inflation is never easy, but these are particularly difficult times for this exercise. All one has to do is look at the remarkable lack of consensus among professional forecasters. The spread between the lowest and the highest inflation forecast for 2010 reported by Blue Chip Economic Indicators is more than twice what it was a year ago for inflation in 2009. Two conflicting forces could come into play to explain such a wide range of opinions. A high unemployment rate and low rates of capacity usage, such as we now have, normally place strong downward pressure on costs and tend to lower inflation. Indeed, some statistical models have pointed to possible deflation risks in the quarters ahead. But inflation has not fallen to the extent we might have feared; and there is another factor that could come into play, namely consumers' and businesses' expectations of future inflation. So far, expectations as measured by surveys have remained relatively stable, which is a bit of a surprise considering the severity of the downturn. But as economic conditions improve consumers and businesses might expect upward pressure on inflation; and experience shows that a rise in inflation expectations, once solidified, becomes embedded in many economic decisions and makes inflation harder to control.\nCurrently, with core inflation near 2 percent, I see inflation at a level that would be acceptable under normal circumstances. But these two potentially strong forces work in opposite directions, and the Fed must be in a position to respond, whichever force dominates.\n\nConclusions\nThese have been challenging times, and the Fed has met the challenge with an array of innovative programs that depart from traditional policy. We have pursued this approach in a manner that is both commensurate to the size and robust to the variety of risks we faced. The multiplicity of programs should not obscure the fact that, although the means are many, the ends remain unchanged. Both traditional and nontraditional policies are aimed at fostering a stable financial system, sustainable growth, and price stability. As economic conditions improve and we lay the groundwork for an orderly reduction in our balance sheet, these ends remain uppermost in our minds.\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

            "content": "Introduction\nGood morning and thank you for inviting me to participate in this important discussion.\nWe are in the midst of the worst financial crisis of the past 70 years. Extraordinary disruptions in the flow of credit and liquidity have weighed on the economies in the United States, Central and Eastern Europe, and around the world. As events have unfolded over the past 20 months, the Federal Reserve, together with the United States Treasury and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), has implemented a broad range of policies aimed at mitigating the problems in our financial system and the fallout on the rest of the economy.\nI believe that our interventions are helping to address the difficulties we face and to eventually move the United States back to financial stability and economic recovery. And, as you are all well aware, capital flows are international. So, these efforts should also be positive factors for financial markets and economic activity around the world.\nToday I will concentrate my remarks on the Fed's responses to the liquidity and credit shocks that have affected the U.S. financial system. I will also discuss the challenges that lie ahead and our continued commitment to confront them. I should note that these are, of course, my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nCredit and liquidity shocks\nTrouble began in 2007, when falling housing prices and rising mortgage defaults produced strains in the market for securitized mortgages. As a result, many financial institutions reported severe losses. Famous names such as Bear Stearns, Wachovia, Washington Mutual, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, and American International Group (AIG), were on that list. Some of these firms appeared unable to survive on their own and were purchased by other financial institutions. In the case of Bear Stearns, this involved assistance from the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury also were able to arrange loans and guarantees to AIG in order to avoid large-scale disruptions in markets that had exposures to credit default swaps written by AIG. In contrast, when Lehman Brothers experienced especially large losses, no sale or loan support could be made at suitable terms. As a result, Lehman went into bankruptcy last September.\nLehman Brothers' bankruptcy intensified market participants' concerns over the potential losses on a range of assets, as well as over the ability of their counterparties to meet contractual obligations. One important sector that was disrupted was the money market industry. Worried over losses, investors in money market funds began making redemptions. To meet these redemptions, some funds had to liquidate assets into an already depressed market, further lowering the prices of these instruments.\nThe disruptions in the money market industry were the product of two main shocks: a credit shock and a liquidity shock. First, because of deteriorating economic conditions, market participants expected greater losses on commercial paper and other short-term securities. This is what I refer to as a \"credit shock.\" Second, the ease of trading these securities worsened: transaction volumes shrank dramatically, and in some cases it was even difficult to obtain price quotes. This is what I call a \"liquidity shock.\" The two shocks are not independent, as deteriorating liquidity conditions can spillover to produce higher losses among market participants. The interplay between credit and liquidity shocks made it difficult for firms to issue all but the safest and most liquid commercial paper. Only very short-term, often overnight, debt was issued when market conditions were at their worst.\nIt is easy to see the role that \"flight to quality\" played in these events. And I would like to underscore that \"flight to liquidity\" alone was sufficiently severe to disrupt the functioning of some markets that were largely immune from credit shocks. For example, in the United States many student loan payments are guaranteed by the federal government. Despite these guarantees, liquidity disruptions have nearly shut down the auction rate securities markets that student loan providers had used to obtain a good deal of their funding. Subsequently, they have had substantial difficulty in attracting investors to other types of securities backed by student loans. A second example is the market for Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). Like other Treasury securities, TIPS benefit from the guarantee of the federal government. Yet, in past months they have traded at a significant discount relative to more liquid (on-the-run) nominal Treasuries.\n\nMonetary policy in exceptional times\nThe Federal Reserve has responded aggressively to these extraordinary events. Since September 2007, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has lowered the target for the federal funds rate—our standard overnight interest rate policy lever—bringing it to essentially zero in December of last year. In addition, we have made adjustments to make it more attractive for banks to borrow from the discount window.\nHowever, financial distress, the weak outlook for growth, and the prospects for unusually low inflation call for more policy accommodation. With the funds rate near zero, the Fed has had to work to find new ways to inject monetary accommodation into the economy.\nOne way to make monetary policy more accommodating is to work to lower the unusual liquidity and risk premia that are raising private and longer-term borrowing costs. In this arena, the Federal Reserve has adopted several innovative policies that are providing liquidity support to a range of institutions and markets.\nSome of these policies were aimed at easing the liquidity pressures I spoke about earlier that hit the money market funds and commercial paper markets last fall. Two important ones were the Money Market Investor Funding Facility (or MMIF) and the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF).\nMost recently, a new joint program with the Treasury, called the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, became effective on March 19. The first lending through this temporary facility is designed to make credit available to consumers and small businesses on more favorable terms by facilitating the issuance of new asset-backed securities (ABS) and improving the market conditions for ABS more generally. The TALF is providing financing to investors to support their purchases of certain highly-rated ABS backed by newly and recently originated auto loans, credit card loans, student loans, and small business loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. Purchasers of these ABS will be able to borrow from the TALF, using the securities themselves as collateral.\nThe ABS market has typically played a critical role in providing credit to U.S. consumers and small businesses. However, this market has virtually closed since the worsening of the financial crisis last October. The TALF is aimed at re-opening this market by helping lenders finance new issues. Moreover, the program provides a lending backstop that will enhance the liquidity value of TALF-eligible securities. Since the announcement of the TALF, liquidity conditions in these securities have already improved. It is important to note that the TALF loans are for three years—medium-term loans that are noticeably longer than those available through other Fed lending facilities. So, TALF can impact longer-run interest rates.\nAnother important feature of the TALF is that the terms on these loans are attractive during current market conditions but are more costly than those that prevail during more normal times. So, TALF loans will become unattractive when conditions improve in markets for traditional sources of funding. Appropriate haircuts on the collateral and funding from the Treasury provide the Fed with credit protection on the facility.\nI should also note that, as conditions warrant, we will be expanding existing programs. For instance, the Fed already is undertaking a substantial expansion of the TALF. Last Thursday we added four new categories to the list of TALF-eligible ABS. And yesterday an expansion of the TALF to legacy assets was announced, with the new assets expected to include non-agency residential and commercial mortgaged-backed securities.\nMoreover, on March 18 the FOMC decided to further increase the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet by purchasing up to $1.15 trillion of additional securities, comprising (up to) $300 billion of longer-term Treasuries, (up to) $750 billion more of agency mortgage-backed securities, and (up to) $100 billion more of agency debt. Prices of Treasuries jumped sharply after the FOMC announcement, with the ten-year yield falling nearly 50 basis points over the day.\nTogether with the Treasury and the FDIC, the Fed earlier had also taken exceptional measures to attenuate the effect of the credit shock. For example, we provided assistance to JPMorgan Chase in the acquisition of Bear Stearns, and we arranged the ring-fencing of some non-performing assets held by Citi and Bank of America. Moreover, we provided capital to support the purchase of some collateralized debt obligations and the unwinding of AIG's credit default swap positions.\nAdditional interventions to deal with the credit crisis are being implemented. For instance, there is the Treasury's Financial Stability Plan. The plan includes a Capital Assistance Program to strengthen U.S. financial institutions so that they have sufficient lending capacity to better support economic recovery. The plan also includes a Public-Private Investment Program, aimed at providing greater means for financial institutions to cleanse their balance sheets of what are often referred to as \"legacy\" assets. Many of the details of this program were released yesterday, including the expansion of the Fed's TALF to legacy assets that I just mentioned.\nWhen economic activity recovers and financial conditions normalize, the use of nontraditional policy tools and the size of the Fed's balance sheet will be reduced, and the FOMC will return to its traditional focus on the federal funds rate. Some of this wind-down process will occur naturally as market conditions improve, given the particular pricing and maturity design features of these programs. Still, financial market participants need to be prepared for the eventual dismantling of the facilities that have been put in place during the financial turmoil. Fortunately, it is most likely that this dismantling would be associated with better economic and financial performance.\n\nConceptual motivations for these new initiatives\nLet me briefly step back and discuss these programs at a more conceptual level. In a well-functioning financial system, arbitrage moves funds across markets and balances out profit opportunities. It thus aligns term and risk-adjusted returns across markets. This is the reason, for example, why our typical moves to lower the short-term risk-free federal funds rate affect borrowing rates over a large range of maturity and risk structures. When financial markets are functioning well, the Fed can focus on the size of the liquidity injection instead of the particular segment of the market in which the injection occurs.\nBut that is not the case today. There is abundant evidence that arbitrage opportunities remain unexploited. Because of balance-sheet capacity limitations, or because of higher-than-normal uncertainty and risk aversion, market participants are largely avoiding markets that are undergoing unusual stress. For instance, as I mentioned previously, liquidity disruptions have made it difficult to attract investors to several types of securities backed by student loans, even in the presence of a federal government guarantee.\nOne way of thinking about these developments is that markets have become highly segmented. We do not see funds flowing in to take advantage of apparent profit opportunities with respect to distressed assets. If they were, they could ease liquidity pressures in these sectors and help keep some problems from spilling over into solvency concerns.\nThe flip side of this market segmentation is that liquidity injections aimed directly at a particular distressed market are less likely to leak out to other areas. The injections thus can significantly improve that market's functioning, seeding its transition to more normal liquidity and risk valuations. This is the rationale for focusing our nontraditional policies on loans and securities that affect transactions in particular key markets where we see points of stress. But a downside is that markets that are not the particular focus of policy intervention could experience some relative disadvantage because of the segmentation.\nAs stressed markets improve, more normal functioning of the financial system as a whole can be achieved. Market participants will become more willing to carry on their usual arbitrage activities, and segmentation will diminish. This will diminish both the need and usage of the special programs we have created.\nBecause segmentation will change dynamically, the effectiveness and unintended consequences of credit policies can shift over time and in unexpected ways. This highlights the need for careful design and continuous monitoring of these programs.\nThe programs I discussed today will help improve credit and liquidity conditions in U.S. financial markets. Since capital flows are international, these initiatives have the potential to positively impact capital markets around the world as well.\nThe Federal Reserve has also worked together with other countries to address pressures in global money markets directly. For instance, the Fed has established temporary reciprocal currency arrangements (swap lines) with several nations' central banks. These facilities are designed to help improve liquidity conditions in global financial markets and to make it easier to obtain U.S. dollar funding.\nOther international efforts are in place to provide direct support to countries that have been particularly affected by the financial crisis. For instance, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has provided funds to several Central and Eastern European countries, including Latvia, Hungary, Ukraine, and Belarus; and Romania is in talks with the IMF. Moreover, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the European Investment Bank (EIB) Group, and the World Bank Group recently pledged to provide up to €24.5 billion to support the banking sectors in Central and Eastern Europe and to fund lending to businesses hit by the global economic crisis.\n\nConclusions\nModern economic theories usually imply that there is little the public sector can do to offset a cyclical contraction in technology except to offset, to some degree, rigidities that affect the economy's response to the shock. This logic would carry over to financial shocks as well, if we chose to model them as a negative cost shock to an intermediate input.\nHowever, there are reasons to believe that policy has a very different role to play in mitigating the impact of financial shocks. For one thing, the Fed and other financial regulators are themselves part of the financial intermediation process. This means there could be alternative policy instruments that might directly affect the way the economy responds to a financial shock.\nSince August 2007, the FOMC's policy decisions have been calibrated to deal with the \"adverse feedback loop\" between disruptions to financial market stability and the real economy. This focus has influenced not only the setting of the funds rate, but also the implementation of several new policies aimed directly at the financial shocks, some of which I have discussed today.\nI believe these initiatives will help in restoring the normal functioning of the financial system. They will also have a stabilizing effect on markets around the world and will therefore eventually help stimulate worldwide economic recovery.\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

            "content": "Introduction\nGood afternoon and thank you for inviting me to speak to you today. And thank you, Einar Forsman, [President and CEO of the Rockford Chamber of Commerce], for that kind introduction.\nCurrently, we find ourselves in the midst of a serious recession—one that appears headed towards an experience more like the large downturns in the 1970s and 1980s than the moderate contractions of 1990 and 2001. Many manufacturing-intensive communities, like Rockford, have been particularly hard hit. Today I will discuss the events that brought us to this point, the outlook for the economy, and the policy challenges confronting the Fed during these troubling times. I should note that these are, of course, my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nBackground\nOver the past 18 months the economy has experienced deteriorating housing markets, large-scale disruptions to our financial services industry, and plummeting consumer and business confidence. These and related developments have resulted in a significant decline in overall spending and production and a rise in the unemployment rate, particularly over the past six months. All of this has occurred despite aggressive actions by the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to address difficulties in credit markets and to bolster aggregate demand. As you know, yesterday, the President signed the $787 billion fiscal stimulus bill. And last week, the Treasury recommended new proposals to deal with the financial sector problems. These actions, I believe, will help in addressing the difficulties we face and in moving us toward financial stability and economic recovery.\nThese certainly are challenging, if not extraordinary, times. How did we get here?\nIn 2007 housing prices peaked, mortgage defaults rose, and strains began to appear in the market for securitized mortgages. The problems in mortgages spilled over to other segments of our financial markets. Market participants re-assessed risk, and the prices of many assets declined. This cascading process of re-pricing had a detrimental impact on the liquidity and capital positions of a wide range of financial institutions in the United States and around the world.\nBy the spring and summer of 2008, the tightening of credit conditions had begun to weigh on business spending. And by the fall, household spending was affected as well. Spending was also reduced by the protracted weakness in housing markets, declines in financial wealth, softening labor markets, and substantial increases in prices for energy and other commodities. These factors contributed to a contraction in gross domestic product (GDP) beginning in the third quarter of 2008.\nA series of solvency and liquidity events also occurred during this period. Many financial firms reported severe losses. Famous names like Bear Stearns, Wachovia, Washington Mutual, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, and American International Group (AIG) were on the list. Some of these firms appeared unable to survive on their own and were purchased by other financial institutions. In the case of Bear Stearns, this involved assistance from the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury also were able to arrange loans and guarantees to AIG in order to avoid large-scale disruptions in markets that had exposures to credit default swaps written by AIG. In contrast, when Lehman Brothers experienced especially large losses last September, no sale or loan support could be made at suitable terms. As a result, they went into bankruptcy.\nThese developments intensified financial market participants' concerns over the potential losses on a range of assets, as well as the ability of their counterparties to meet contractual obligations. One important sector that was disrupted was the money market industry. Money funds are major suppliers of financing to commercial paper and other short-term credit markets. Worried over losses, investors in money market funds began making redemptions. To meet these, some funds had to liquidate assets into an already depressed market, further lowering the prices of these instruments.\nThis process resulted in a marked increase in the cost of issuing all but the safest, shortest maturity of debt that usually rolls through these markets. Even highly rated firms have found it more difficult and expensive to obtain financing. Some have been able to tap bank backup lines of credit. But this substitution just pushes the funding difficulties back into the banking system, squeezing out the ability of banks to make other loans.\n\nActions by the Federal Reserve\nIn response to these extraordinary events, the Fed has implemented a number of policies aimed at mitigating the problems in the financial system and their potential fallout on the rest of the economy.\nFirst, the Fed turned to its standard monetary policy instrument, the federal funds rate. Since September 2007, the Federal Open Market Committee has lowered the target funds rate 525 basis points, bringing it to essentially zero in December of last year.\nAlthough the corresponding injections of broad liquidity helped credit conditions somewhat, it became clear early on that more had to be done to facilitate market functioning.\nAt first, we simply made a number of adjustments to make it more attractive for banks to borrow from the discount window—which is the traditional way the Fed lends overnight to depository institutions.\nGiven the events of 2008—in which all types of institutions faced liquidity shortfalls—the Fed created a number of facilities to directly provide liquidity to nondepository institutions. The Federal Reserve Act grants us such emergency powers when the economy is faced with \"unusual and exigent circumstances.\"\nMost of these facilities have been aimed at the functioning of short-term credit markets. Some lend to broker-dealers that engage in securities transactions with the Fed and have a large-scale presence in short-term funding markets such as the repo market. Others provide a liquidity backstop for commercial paper issuers and facilitate the sale in secondary markets of a number of instruments held by money market funds. As such, these facilities are lending at relatively short maturities—generally not more than 90 days.\nMore recent Fed actions, however, have taken some longer-term assets onto our balance sheet. In December, we began purchasing debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs). This initiative will help support the flow of credit and lower borrowing costs in mortgage markets.\nOf course, the Federal Reserve has not been alone in dealing with the crisis. The FDIC increased deposit insurance limits and began to offer insurance on some liabilities of eligible depository institutions and financial holding companies.\nCongress enacted the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which authorized the Treasury Department's Troubled Assets Relief Program, (or TARP). This program has so far provided more than $335 billion in capital injections to the financial system to support the lending capacity of banks.\nLast week, Treasury Secretary Geithner outlined the Financial Stability Plan. One element of the Plan is to combine public and private capital in an effort to value illiquid assets and move them off of banks' balance sheets.\nWe have seen a number of indications that the traditional easing of monetary policy and the nontraditional policy actions are beginning to help the functioning of credit markets and reduce financial strains. The spreads on the interest rates charged for interbank lending, and on commercial paper relative to the fed funds rate, have come down appreciably since October particularly at the one-month maturity. More than $150 billion of debt has been issued with FDIC guarantees, facilitating medium-term funding by eligible financial institutions. And the rates on conforming mortgages relative to Treasury bonds have declined since the Fed's GSE purchase program was announced.\nThat said, market disruptions clearly remain, and most spreads between private lending rates and comparable-maturity risk-free government debt are still quite elevated relative to where they were before the crisis. Of course, we would not expect spreads and other lending terms to return to those prevailing shortly before the crisis—a period when risk was clearly underpriced. Nevertheless, current spreads and terms seem to be well above where the \"new normal\" will end up.\nOver the longer run, policy actions and the work being done in the private sector to reassess risks and shore up balance sheets will help move us toward a new benchmark and more stable financial conditions. This will not be an easy process, and it could take time before financial markets function in a manner that fully facilitates the activities of businesses and households. Until they do, we will continue to experience some drag on activity in the nonfinancial sectors of the economy.\n\nEconomic Outlook\nAs we know only too well, the economy currently is contracting at a disturbing pace. Labor markets have deteriorated significantly. The unemployment rate was 4.9 percent when the recession started in December 2007; last month it reached 7.6 percent. Weak labor markets have held back growth in real incomes, and further declines in the stock-market and home prices have led to marked reductions in household wealth. Slowing foreign activity and the higher dollar are reducing demand for our exports. Although there has been a modest improvement in some credit conditions, overall they still remain tight. The more pessimistic outlook for the economy has reduced everyone's confidence. In turn, we've seen a further pullback in risk-taking by investors, households, and businesses. They are particularly reluctant to take on longer-term investment or spending commitments.\nTogether, these factors have led to sharp drop offs in business investment, industrial production, and household spending. Overall output, as measured by real GDP, fell at a 0.5 percent annual rate in the third quarter of 2008 and then dropped at a 3.8 percent rate in the fourth quarter—moreover, recent data suggest that the revisions will make this figure even worse. Last quarter business fixed investment declined at a 19 percent annualized rate, residential investment fell at a 22.4 percent rate, and consumer spending dropped at a 3.5 percent pace. These are very large declines—on par with those experienced during the recessions of the mid-1970s and early 1980s.\nThe factors that produced the sharp decline in output in the second half of last year are still in play today. Although preliminary data for January were positive for retail sales, there continues to be weakness in housing starts, employment, and auto sales. Consequently, I expect real GDP will fall markedly in the first half of 2009. I am currently projecting that GDP will begin to expand later in 2009, but not enough to offset the declines in the first half of the year. In part, this expected pickup reflects the support from both traditional and nontraditional monetary policies, fiscal actions already taken to address the strains in financial markets, and progress that financial markets themselves make in working through their difficulties. In addition, the new fiscal stimulus package will boost output. However, its full impact is still unclear, and our forecast could need some recalibration as we gain knowledge on how the package is affecting the economy. Looking out a bit further, I expect the pace of GDP growth to move back up in the neighborhood of potential as we move through 2010. However, I do not see growth as being strong enough to make much progress in closing resource gaps over this period. Indeed, the unemployment rate—the main resource gap measure in the labor market—is likely to rise into 2010.\nOn the inflation front, headline consumer prices have fallen in recent months, and core prices—which exclude the volatile food and energy categories—have changed little. This appreciable reduction in inflationary pressures reflects falling prices for energy and other commodities, declines in import prices, and the increase in resource slack due to diminished economic activity. Looking ahead, futures markets expect some increase in energy prices. However, substantial resource slack and the likelihood of some moderate reduction in inflation expectations should hold back overall price increases.\nConsequently, I expect additional slowing in core consumer price inflation in 2009 and a further edging down in 2010. Over the longer-run, with appropriate monetary policy, I see both overall and core inflation averaging somewhere into the neighborhood of 2 percent, which is a rate I see as being consistent with price stability. That said, there is notable risk that inflation will remain a good deal below this range in the medium term.\n\nSome Perspectives on Policy\nI am now going to turn to some broader perspectives on the policy picture. The traditional monetary policy action used to combat sluggish economic activity is to lower the fed funds rate. This in turn reduces other borrowing rates and thus stimulates aggregate demand.\nIn December the FOMC decided to move the funds rate to near zero and two weeks ago we voted to leave it unchanged. With the fed funds rate near zero, we cannot lower it any further. Yet, clearly, the recession, financial distress, and low inflationary pressures call for more policy accommodation. For the Fed, this means that the Committee will have to focus on other ways to impart monetary stimulus to the economy.\nOne way that monetary policy influences financial and economic activity is through the clarity of our intentions and communications. Expectations of likely future outcomes, including those for monetary policy, obviously matter for decisions made by households and businesses today. In this vein, at a time when near-term inflation is likely to be lower than usual, endorsing an explicit numerical objective for inflation could help keep inflation expectations from falling very far. Such an anchor on inflation expectations would help preserve low real inflation-adjusted interest rates.\nAnother way to increase monetary accommodation is to work to bring down unusual liquidity and risk premia that are raising private and longer-term borrowing costs. As I discussed earlier, the Federal Reserve has already operated in this arena, adopting a number of nonstandard policies that are providing liquidity support to a range of institutions and markets. And, if necessary, such nontraditional tools can be expanded.\nIn this regard, in November we announced another joint program with the Treasury, called the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF. And last week the Fed announced it is prepared to undertake a substantial expansion of the TALF. Although not yet operational, the TALF should be up and running soon. This temporary facility is designed to support the demand for asset-backed securities by reducing the likelihood that future liquidity needs could force investors to sell into a depressed market. Holders of securities that are bundles of student, consumer, and small businesses loans can borrow from the TALF, using the securities themselves as collateral. Other asset-backed securities, such as commercial mortgage-backed securities, could also be eligible. The terms on these loans are more costly than those seen during more normal times. Thus TALF loans eventually will become unattractive when conditions improve in markets for traditional sources of funding. Large haircuts on the collateral and TARP funds provide the Fed with credit protection on the facility.\nAnother feature of the TALF is that its loans are for three years—medium-term loans that are noticeably longer than at our other lending facilities. So, like our GSE purchases, it can directly affect interest rates further out on the yield curve.\nI should also note that, as conditions warrant, we will be expanding existing programs. In addition, we are considering the purchase of longer-term Treasury securities, if evolving circumstances indicate that such transactions would be particularly effective in improving conditions in private credit markets.\nA common question I hear is: \"What principles guide the implementation of these new initiatives?\"\nLet me step back for a minute and discuss these programs at a more conceptual level. In a well-functioning financial system, arbitrage moves funds across markets and balances out profit opportunities. It thus aligns term and risk-adjusted returns across markets. This is the reason, for example, why our typical moves to lower the short-term risk-free federal funds rate affect borrowing rates over a large range of maturity and risk structures. In such an environment, we can focus on the size of the liquidity injection instead of the particular segment of the market in which the injection occurs.\nBut that is not the case today. There is abundant evidence that arbitrage opportunities remain unexploited. Due to balance-sheet capacity limitations, or because uncertainty and risk aversion are so much higher than normal, participants are largely avoiding markets that are undergoing unusual stress. For example, many student loan payments are guaranteed by the federal government. Despite the guarantees, liquidity disruptions have all but shut down the auction rate securities markets that student loan providers had used to obtain a good deal of their funding. Subsequently, they have had substantial difficulty in attracting investors to other types of securities backed by student loans.\nOne way of thinking about these developments is that markets have become highly segmented. We do not see funds flowing in to take advantage of apparent profit opportunities with respect to distressed assets. Such an action could ease liquidity pressures in these sectors and help keep some problems from spilling over into solvency concerns.\nThe flip side of this segmentation is that liquidity injections aimed directly at a particular distressed market are less likely to leak out to other areas. The injections thus hold open the possibility of improving that market's functioning a good deal, seeding its transition to more normal liquidity and risk valuations. This is the rationale for why our nontraditional policies focus on loans and securities that affect transactions in particular key markets where we see points of stress. But a downside is that markets outside of this segment could experience stress because of the separation.\nAs stressed markets improve, more normal functioning of the financial system as a whole can be achieved. Financial firms will become more willing to carry on their usual arbitrage activities, and market segmentation will diminish. As such, both the need and effectiveness of the special programs will diminish.\nBecause segmentation will change dynamically, the effectiveness and unintended consequences of credit policies can shift over time and in unexpected ways. This highlights the need for careful design and continuous monitoring of these programs.\nMore generally, as economic activity recovers and financial conditions normalize, the use of nontraditional policy tools and the size of the Fed's balance sheet will be reduced, and the FOMC will return to its traditional focus on the federal funds rate. Some of this wind-down will occur naturally as market conditions improve, given the particular pricing and maturity design features of these programs. Still, financial market participants need to be prepared for the eventual dismantling of the facilities that have been put in place during the financial turmoil. Fortunately, it is most likely that this dismantling would be associated with better economic and financial performance.\n\nConclusion\nTo conclude, the U.S. economy faces many challenges. The Fed has been proactive in addressing market liquidity stresses during the financial crisis—first by using our traditional monetary policy tools and later through our nontraditional lending facilities. Moving forward, we will be vigilant in monitoring the risks to growth and price stability. It is also important for us to continue to collaborate with policymakers throughout government and across the globe in the pursuit of financial stability worldwide. We likely are in for a protracted period of poor economic performance. But the policy actions taken by the Fed and other governmental agencies over the course of the financial crisis, and the efforts of the private sector to work through its difficulties, will eventually help support a recovery in economic growth.\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

In December, we began purchasing debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs). This initiative will help support the flow of credit and lower borrowing costs in mortgage markets.\nOf course, the Federal Reserve has not been alone in dealing with the crisis. The FDIC increased deposit insurance limits and began to offer insurance on some liabilities of eligible depository institutions and financial holding companies. Congress enacted the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which authorized the Treasury Department's Troubled Assets Relief Program, (or TARP). This program has so far provided more than $335 billion in capital injections to the financial system to support the lending capacity of banks.\nJust yesterday, Treasury Secretary Geithner outlined the Financial Stability Plan. One element of the plan is aimed at valuing illiquid assets and moving them off of banks' balance sheets. By doing so, this should attract more private capital and ease balance sheet restrictions on banks' lending capacity.\nWe have seen a number of indications that the traditional easing of monetary policy and the nontraditional policy actions are beginning to help the functioning of credit markets and reduce financial strains. The spreads on the interest rates charged for interbank lending and on commercial paper relative to the fed funds rate have come down appreciably since October, particularly at the one-month maturity. $156 billion of debt has been issued with FDIC guarantees, facilitating medium-term funding by eligible financial institutions. And the rates on conforming mortgages relative to Treasury bonds have declined since the Fed's GSE purchase program was announced.\nThat said, market disruptions clearly remain, and most spreads between private lending rates and comparable-maturity risk-free government debt are still quite elevated relative to where they were before the crisis. Of course, we would not expect spreads and other lending terms to return to those prevailing before the crisis—a period when risk was clearly underpriced. Nevertheless, current spreads and terms seem to be well above where the \"new normal\" will end up.\nOver the longer run, we will reach the \"new normal.\" Policy actions and the work being done in the private sector to reassess risks and shore up balance sheets will help move us back toward something resembling financial stability. This will not be an easy process, and it could take time before financial markets function in a manner that fully facilitates the activities of businesses and households. Until they do, we will continue to experience some drag on activity in the nonfinancial sectors of the economy.\n\nEconomic Outlook\nAs we know only too well, the economy currently is contracting at a disturbing pace. Labor markets have deteriorated significantly. The unemployment rate was 4.9 percent when the recession started in December 2007; last month it reached 7.6 percent. Weak labor markets have held back growth in real incomes, and further declines in the stock-market and homes prices have led to marked reductions in household wealth. Slowing foreign activity and the higher dollar are reducing demand for our exports. Although there has been a modest improvement in some credit conditions, overall they still remain tight. The more pessimistic outlook for the economy has reduced everyone's confidence. In turn, we've seen a further pullback in risk-taking by investors, households, and businesses. They are particularly reluctant to take on longer-term investment or spending commitments.\nTogether, these factors have led to sharp drop offs in business investment, industrial production, and household spending. Overall output, as measured by real GDP, fell at a 0.5 percent annual rate in the third quarter of 2008 and then dropped at a 3.8 percent rate in the fourth quarter. Last quarter business fixed investment declined at a 19 percent annualized rate, residential investment fell at a 22.4 percent rate, and consumer spending dropped at a 3.5 percent pace. These are very large declines—on par with those experienced during the recessions of the mid-1970s and early 1980s.\nThe factors that produced the sharp decline in output in the second half of last year are still in play today. Consequently, I expect real GDP will fall markedly in the first half of 2009. I am currently projecting that GDP will begin to expand some later in 2009, but not enough to offset the declines in the first half of the year. In part, this expected pickup reflects the support from both traditional and nontraditional monetary policies, fiscal actions already taken to address the strains in financial markets, and progress that financial markets themselves make in working through their difficulties. In addition, the new fiscal stimulus package will boost output. However, its full size and impact are still unclear, and our forecast could need some recalibration as we gain knowledge on how the package is affecting the economy. Looking out a bit further, I expect the pace of GDP growth to move back up in the neighborhood of potential as we move through 2010. However, I do not see growth as being strong enough to make much progress in closing resource gaps over this period. Indeed, the unemployment rate—the main resource gap measure in the labor market—is likely to rise into 2010.\nOn the inflation front, headline consumer prices have fallen in recent months, and core prices—which exclude the volatile food and energy categories—have changed little. This appreciable reduction in inflationary pressures reflects falling prices for energy and other commodities, declines in import prices, and the increase in resource slack due to diminished economic activity. Looking ahead, futures markets expect some increase in energy prices. However, substantial resource slack and the likelihood of some moderate reduction in inflation expectations should hold back overall price increases. Consequently, I expect additional slowing in core consumer price inflation in 2009 and a further edging down in 2010. Over the longer-run, with appropriate monetary policy, I see both overall and core inflation averaging somewhere into the neighborhood of 2 percent, which is a rate I see as being consistent with price stability. That said, there is notable risk that inflation will remain a good deal below this range in the medium term.\n\nSome Perspectives on Policy\nI am now going to turn to some broader perspectives on the policy picture. The traditional monetary policy action used to combat sluggish economic activity is to lower the fed funds rate. This in turn reduces other borrowing rates and thus stimulates aggregate demand.\nIn December the FOMC decided to move the funds rate to near zero and two weeks ago we voted to leave it unchanged. With the fed funds rate near zero, we cannot lower it any further. Yet, clearly, the recession, financial distress, and low inflationary pressures call for more policy accommodation. For the Fed, this means that the Committee will have to focus on other ways to impart monetary stimulus to the economy.\nOne way that monetary policy influences financial and economic activity is through the clarity of our intentions and communications. Expectations of likely future outcomes, including those for monetary policy, obviously matter for decisions made by households and businesses today. In this vein, at a time when near-term inflation is likely to be lower than usual, endorsing an explicit numerical objective for inflation could help keep inflation expectations from falling very far. Such an anchor on inflation expectations would help preserve low real inflation-adjusted interest rates.\nAnother way to increase monetary accommodation is to work to bring down unusual liquidity and risk premia that are raising private and longer-term borrowing costs. As I discussed earlier, the Federal Reserve has already operated in this arena, adopting a number of nonstandard policies that are providing liquidity support to a range of institutions and markets. And, if necessary, such nontraditional tools can be expanded.\nIn this regard, in November we announced another joint program with the Treasury, called the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF. And yesterday the Fed announced it is prepared to undertake a substantial expansion of the TALF. Although not yet operational, the TALF should be up and running soon. This temporary facility is designed to support the demand for asset-backed securities by reducing the likelihood that future liquidity needs could force investors to sell into a depressed market. Holders of securities that are bundles of student, consumer, and small businesses loans can borrow from the TALF, using the securities themselves as collateral. Other asset-backed securities, such as commercial mortgage-backed securities, could also be eligible. The terms on these loans are more costly than those seen during more normal times. Thus TALF loans eventually will become unattractive when conditions improve in markets for traditional sources of funding. Large haircuts on the collateral and TARP funds provide the Fed with credit protection on the facility.\nAnother feature of the TALF is that its loans are for three years—medium-term loans that are noticeably longer than at our other lending facilities. So, like our GSE purchases, it can directly affect interest rates further out on the yield curve.\nI should also note that, as conditions warrant, we will be expanding existing programs. In addition, we are considering the purchase of longer-term Treasury securities, if evolving circumstances indicate that such transactions would be particularly effective in improving conditions in private credit markets.\nA common question I hear is: \"What principles guide the implementation of these new initiatives?\"\nLet me step back for a second and discuss these programs at a more conceptual level. In a well-functioning financial system, arbitrage moves funds across markets and balances out profit opportunities. It thus aligns term and risk-adjusted returns across markets. This is the reason, for example, why our typical moves to lower the short-term risk-free federal funds rate affect borrowing rates over a large range of maturity and risk structures. In such an environment, we can focus on the size of the liquidity injection instead of the particular segment of the market in which the injection occurs.\nBut that is not the case today. There is abundant evidence that arbitrage opportunities remain unexploited. Due to balance-sheet capacity limitations, or because uncertainty and risk aversion are so much higher than normal, participants are largely avoiding markets that are undergoing unusual stress. For example, many student loan payments are guaranteed by the federal government. Despite the guarantees, liquidity disruptions have all but shut down the auction rate security markets that student loan providers had used to obtain a good deal of their funding. Subsequently, they have had substantial difficulty in attracting investors to other types of securities backed by student loans.\nOne way of thinking about these developments is that markets have become highly segmented. We do not see funds flowing in to take advantage of apparent profit opportunities with respect to distressed assets. Such an action could ease liquidity pressures in these sectors and help keep some problems from spilling over into solvency concerns.\nThe flip side of this segmentation is that liquidity injections aimed directly at a particular distressed market are less likely to leak out to other areas. The injections thus hold open the possibility of improving that market's functioning a good deal, seeding its transition to more normal liquidity and risk valuations. This is the rationale for why our nontraditional policies focus on loans and securities that affect transactions in particular key markets where we see points of stress. But a downside is that markets outside of this segment could experience stress because of the separation.\nAs stressed markets improve, more normal functioning of the financial system as whole can be achieved. Financial firms will become more willing to carry on their usual arbitrage activities, and market segmentation will diminish. As such, both the need and effectiveness of the special programs will diminish.\nBecause segmentation will change dynamically, the effectiveness and unintended consequences of credit policies can shift over time and in unexpected ways. This highlights the need for careful design and continuous monitoring of these programs.\nMore generally, as economic activity recovers and financial conditions normalize, the use of nontraditional policy tools and the size of the Fed's balance sheet will be reduced, and the FOMC will return to its traditional focus on the federal funds rate. Some of this wind-down will occur naturally as market conditions improve, given the particular pricing and maturity design features of these programs. Still, financial market participants need to be prepared for the eventual dismantling of the facilities that have been put in place during the financial turmoil. Fortunately, it is most likely that this dismantling would be associated with better economic and financial performance.\n\nConclusion\nTo conclude, the U.S. economy faces many challenges. The Fed has been proactive in addressing market liquidity stresses during the financial crisis—first by using our traditional monetary policy tools and later through our nontraditional lending facilities. Moving forward, we will be vigilant in monitoring the risks to growth and price stability. It is also important for us to continue to collaborate with policymakers throughout government and across the globe in the pursuit of financial stability worldwide. We likely are in for a protracted period of poor economic performance. But the policy actions taken by the Fed and other governmental agencies over the course of the financial crisis, and the efforts of the private sector to work through its difficulties, will eventually help support a recovery in economic growth.\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you, Jeff Mayers [president of WisPolitics.com, WisBusiness.com] for that introduction. And thanks to the Wisconsin Bankers Association for inviting me to speak. I'm delighted to be here to share my thoughts on the economy during this challenging period. As always, these are my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nToday we find ourselves in the midst of a serious recession—one that may end up being more like the large downturns in the 1970s and 1980s than the more moderate contractions of 1990 and 2001. I want to use my time today to discuss briefly how we got to this point, the outlook going forward, and the policy challenges that will be confronting the Fed as we move through these troubling times.\n\nHow did we get here?\nLast Friday the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the cumulative job loss in December alone was over 550,000 jobs. Since the beginning of the recession in December 2007, 2.6 million jobs have been lost, 1.9 million in the last four months. In December 2007 the unemployment rate was just 4.9 percent; it ended 2008 at 7.2 percent. The latest data on household and business spending are no more encouraging. Overall economic activity has declined substantially over the past six months despite aggressive moves by the Fed that lowered the fed funds rate to near zero and tripled the size of our balance sheet, as well as major actions by the Treasury and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) aimed at addressing difficulties in credit markets.\nHow did we get here?\nIn 2007 housing prices peaked, mortgage defaults rose, and strains began to appear in the market for securitized mortgages. The problems in mortgages spilled over to other segments of our financial markets. Market participants reassessed risk, and the prices of many assets declined. This cascading process of re-pricing had a detrimental impact on the liquidity and capital positions of a wide range of financial institutions in the United States and around the world.\nBy the spring and summer of 2008, the tightening of credit conditions had begun to weigh on business spending, and by the fall, household spending was affected as well. Spending was also reduced by the protracted weakness in housing markets, declines in financial wealth, and substantial increases in prices for energy and other commodities. These factors contributed to negative gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the third quarter of 2008.\nAs we moved through last year, many financial firms began reporting severe losses. Some institutions—notably Bear Stearns, Wachovia, Washington Mutual, and Merrill Lynch—appeared unable to survive on their own and were purchased by large banks. In the case of Bear Stearns, this occurred with assistance from the Fed. In the case of Lehman Brothers, the losses were especially large, and no buyer came forward at suitable terms. As a result, Lehman had to declare bankruptcy. At about the same time, American International Group (AIG), an important provider of large credit default insurance during this period, was unable to fund its liabilities. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury were able to arrange a package of loans and guarantees for AIG in order to support the functioning of markets that had important exposures to these credit default swaps and related instruments.\nAnd as we moved through the summer, ongoing developments in the financial markets dealt a series of blows to market confidence. The problems with such major institutions intensified financial market participants' concerns about the ability of their counterparties to repay debt. Money market mutual funds, important suppliers of funds to short-term credit markets, were exposed to potentially significant losses, and many investors began making withdrawals. To meet the redemptions, many money market funds liquidated assets into an already depressed market. As perceived price risk and redemption risk increased dramatically, there was a marked reduction in the maturity of commercial paper and other debt being rolled through the markets.\nAs a consequence of these pressures, even some highly rated firms have found it more difficult and expensive to obtain short-term financing. Some of these firms have been able to tap bank backup lines of credit. But this substitution just pushes the money market difficulties back into the banking system, squeezing out the ability of banks to make other loans.\n\nActions by the Federal Reserve\nIn response to these extraordinary events, the Fed has implemented a number of policies aimed at mitigating the problems in the financial system and their potential fallout on the rest of the economy.\nFirst, the Fed turned to its traditional monetary policy instruments; that is, it reduced the federal funds rate and the discount rate. The first funds rate cut occurred in September 2007. The initial moves were measured, but they eventually gave way to more aggressive rate cuts. At the last Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the funds rate was essentially cut to zero—525 basis points lower than when we began.\nAlthough the corresponding injections of liquidity helped credit conditions somewhat, it became clear early on that further and alternative extensions of central bank liquidity would be necessary to facilitate market functioning.\nThe Fed made a number of substantial changes to the discount window operations since August 2007 to encourage its use as a source of liquidity: We reduced the spread of the discount rate over the federal funds rate from 100 to 25 basis points; we increased the maximum maturity of the loans from overnight to 90 days; and we introduced a new facility that provides loans through auctions to overcome any stigma that was associated with discount window loans. As a result, we have seen a large increase in lending to depository institutions.\nEarly in 2008, new market dysfunctions emerged, such as the collapse of the auction rate security market. And then there was the sudden demise of Bear Stearns last March. These episodes clearly indicated that in this strained environment, financial market participants other than depository institutions might face liquidity shortfalls that could have serious, far-ranging repercussions for the economy. This led the Fed to create a number of facilities to directly provide liquidity to nondepository institutions; the Federal Reserve Act grants us such emergency powers when the economy is faced with \"unusual and exigent circumstances.\"\nAt first, these measures were aimed at lending to broker-dealers who engage in securities transactions with the Fed and who have a large-scale presence in short-term funding markets. Subsequently, we have introduced lending facilities to help work through the disruptions in the money market mutual fund and commercial paper markets. These programs provide a liquidity backstop for commercial paper and facilitate the sale in secondary markets of a number of instruments held by money market funds. The Fed began to purchase debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises. This initiative will help support the flow of credit and lower credit costs in mortgage markets. Indeed, we have already seen a notable reduction in the spreads of conforming mortgages to Treasury bonds since the program has been announced.\nOf course, the Federal Reserve has not been alone in dealing with the crisis. The FDIC increased deposit insurance limits and put in place special facilities to insure other liabilities of depository institutions. Congress enacted the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which authorized the Treasury Department's Troubled Assets Relief Program, or TARP. This program has so far provided more than $335 billion in capital injections to the financial system to support the lending capacity of banks.1 And, as you are aware, these capital injections are made through the purchase of preferred stock and also include other features that support the prudent stewardship of taxpayer resources.\nIn another joint program, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury established the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF. This facility is designed to support the demand for asset-backed securities by reducing the likelihood that future liquidity needs could force holders to sell them into a depressed market. Holder of securities that are bundles of student, consumer, and small businesses loans can borrow from the TALF, using the securities themselves as collateral. TARP funds provide credit protection to the facility.\nThe traditional easing of monetary policy and the nontraditional actions by the Federal Reserve, Treasury, and other government agencies all are working to support the functioning of credit markets and reduce financial strains. These actions and the work being done in the private sector to reassess risks and shore up balance sheets will help move us back toward something resembling financial stability. But this will not be an easy process, and it could take some time before financial markets function in a manner that noticeably facilitates the activities of businesses and households. Until they do, we will continue to experience some drag on activity in the nonfinancial sectors of the economy. And as we know too well, spending, production, and job creation all currently are contracting at a disturbing pace.\n\nEconomic Outlook\nLet's now take a look at these recent developments in overall economic activity as well as the outlook for the next few years.\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research declared the U.S. economy peaked in December 2007 and subsequently entered into a recession. Overall GDP growth has been choppy, but in the third quarter of 2008, GDP fell at an annual rate of 0.5 percent. Most indicators point to a large contraction in economic activity in the fourth quarter, with many private sector forecasters looking for a drop of 5 percent or more.\nAs I stated at the outset, labor markets have deteriorated significantly over the last few months. Weak labor markets have held back growth in real incomes. Along with the financial strains, these factors have led to weak business investment, industrial production, and consumer spending. Indeed, the declines in consumer spending over the past few months have been very large—on par with the drops experienced during the 1990 and 1982 recessions.\nThe housing market has continued to deteriorate, with construction, new home sales, and home prices all declining further in recent months. In the business sector, investment in equipment and software continued to contract. Weakening foreign activity and the higher dollar are reducing exports.\nOver the last several months we've seen a further pullback in risk-taking in financial markets, spurred in part by the more pessimistic outlook for economic activity. This led to lower equity prices, higher risk spreads, and tighter constraints in credit markets, all of which fed back into a further decline in real activity.\nGoing forward, rising unemployment, low levels of consumer sentiment, losses in stock market wealth, declining home values, and restrictive credit conditions are likely to continue to weigh on household spending. Business expenditures are also likely to be held back by a weaker sales outlook and tighter credit conditions. Consequently, real GDP is likely to fall sharply in the first half of 2009. We expect GDP growth to slowly recover over the remainder of the year, reflecting the support from both traditional and nontraditional monetary policies, fiscal policy actions (many of which are yet to be enacted), and progress by the financial markets in working through their difficulties. I expect real GDP to decline for 2009 as a whole and to rise at a pace in the neighborhood of potential growth during 2010. However, this growth will not be strong enough to close the resource gaps emerging over this period. Indeed, the unemployment rate—the main resource gap measure in the labor market—is likely to rise into 2010.\nOn the inflation front, headline consumer prices declined in recent months, since energy prices fell sharply and increases in consumer food prices moderated. Falling prices for energy and other commodities, declines in import prices, and the increase in resource utilization slack due to diminished economic activity have resulted in an appreciable reduction in inflationary pressures. These, along with some moderate reductions in inflation expectations, have caused me to reduce my forecasts for both core and overall personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation. I expect core inflation to slow considerably in 2009 and then to edge down further in 2010. My modal forecast is for inflation to level out within the range we generally see as being consistent with price stability, somewhere between 1-1/2 to 2 percent. There is notable risk that inflation will decline below this range in the medium term. We could see more declines in the headline inflation numbers—which includes both food and energy components—in the near term because of declining energy prices. However, I do not currently see much risk of an outright deflationary episode, that is, a period of sustained declines in the prices for a wide range of goods and services.\n\nSome Perspectives on Policy\nLet me now turn to the policy picture. The traditional monetary policy action used to combat sluggish economic activity is to lower the fed funds rate. This in turn reduces other borrowing rates and thus stimulates aggregate demand. At its last meeting, the FOMC moved the funds rate down very close to zero. In doing so, we judged that the benefits of these low rates in stimulating demand outweighed the possible adverse effects the low rates might have on the operations of some banks and other financial firms. With the fed funds rate now near zero, we cannot lower it any further. So, going forward, the Committee will have to focus on other ways to impart additional monetary stimulus to the economy.\nOne way that monetary policy influences financial and economic activity is through the clarity of our intentions and communications. The manner in which the FOMC communicates policy clearly influences its effectiveness. And expectations of likely future outcomes, including those for monetary policy, obviously matter for decisions made by households and businesses today. In this vein, at a time when near-term inflation is likely to be lower than usual, having an explicit numerical objective for inflation could help keep inflation expectations from falling very far. Such an anchor on inflation expectations would help preserve low real inflation-adjusted interest rates.\nAs I discussed earlier, the Federal Reserve has already adopted a number of nonstandard policies that are providing liquidity support to a range of institutions and markets. If credit market functioning does not improve, and if the outlook for economic activity does not begin to show signs of improvement, it may be necessary to use these nontraditional tools further.\nFor example, it could be useful to purchase significant quantities of longer-term securities such as agency debt, agency mortgage-backed securities, and Treasury securities to reduce borrowing costs for a range of longer-term instruments. Similarly, possible changes in the size and scope of credit facilities would lower the cost of borrowing in particular targeted markets.\nOf course, as economic activity recovers and financial conditions normalize, the use of nontraditional policy tools will have to be scaled back, the size of the balance sheet and level of excess reserves will have to be reduced, and the FOMC will return to its traditional focus on the federal funds rate. Some of this scaling back will occur naturally as market conditions improve, on account of how these programs have been designed. Still, financial market participants need to be prepared for the eventual dismantling of the facilities that have been put in place during the financial turmoil.\n\nConclusion\nTo conclude, the U.S. economy continues to face many challenges. The Fed has been proactive in addressing market liquidity stress during the financial crisis—first by using our traditional monetary policy tools and later through our improvised lending facilities. Moving forward, it is important that we be vigilant in monitoring the risks to growth, as well as any risks to the prospects for obtaining price stability. It is also important for us to continue to collaborate with policymakers across the globe in the pursuit of financial stability worldwide. We likely are in for a protracted period of poor economic performance. But the policy actions taken by the Fed and other governmental agencies over the course of the financial crisis, and the effort of the private sector to work through its difficulties, will eventually help support a recovery in economic growth.\nYet, undoubtedly, the greatest challenge we face is the enormous uncertainty of our situation. One great feature of being an economist in Chicago is that we benefit from the wisdom of many distinguished scholars at our local universities. An example of such wisdom is an observation made long ago by Robert Lucas, a Nobel Laureate from the University of Chicago: \"As an advice-giving profession, we economists are in way over our heads.\" At any time, this is a sobering and humbling thought to remember. Nevertheless, in the current environment, the pursuit of a range of robust policies in the face of large uncertainties is likely to be most efficacious. A good decision-maker can't place all of his or her policy bets on a single hypothesis when the evidence is still ambiguous.\nThe need to act in the presence of ambiguity and such unusual events certainly adds to our policy and communications challenges.\nWe need to work very hard to explain the risks that we are facing and the rationale for why we think our policy actions best address those risks. Much digital ink has been spilled in these attempts so far. More is on the way. If ink were fiscal stimulus, we might see a more rapid economic recovery in 2009.\n\nNote\n1 TARP has provided $250 billion to financial institutions, $40 billion to AIG, $25 billion to Citigroup, and $20 billion in other lending to institutions (U.S. Treasury Department, 2009, report, January 12).\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

            "content": "If I were here to address this group simply as an economic researcher, I might start with something like this. Both the Federal Reserve and the Treasury have taken actions recently in order to address exceptional problems in financial markets. Without these moves, the costs to our financial infrastructure and real economy would have soared far beyond those we are experiencing today. But these necessary actions also have the unfortunate consequence of distorting incentives for future behavior. Unchecked, they could lead to costly future problems in the functioning of markets.\nSome might say that incurring such future costs would simply be reaping what is being sown today by ignoring the lessons of the \"rules v. discretion\" literature. Although I don't subscribe to this view, it does cause me some concern. But, I think the current environment is also one in which we have to worry about the evil agent in Hansen and Sargent's robust control analyses. Recall that the \"evil agent\" is a parable for how we might end up in states of the world that fall outside of our typical probability distributions and entail huge downside costs to the economy. Robust policy guards against these outcomes, and I interpret the Fed's aggressive and innovative lending programs to be \"robust responses\" to probability distortions caused by a particularly evil agent.\nBut, of course, I'm not here to speak simply as an economic researcher so let me give you my perspective as a Fed president instead. As always, these are my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nToday, the U.S. economic and financial systems are facing their greatest challenges since World War II. Turmoil in the housing market accelerated in the summer of 2007. We have experienced large-scale disruptions to financial intermediation and the destruction of something on the order of ten trillion dollars of U.S. household wealth.1 We are now a full year into a recession: Many non-financial industries are facing substantial risks of long-term structural impairment; and according to most economic forecasts, the unemployment rate will likely exceed 8 percent this year.\nBeyond these serious immediate concerns, the U.S. economy is facing a number of diverse and difficult longer-term challenges. First, significant weaknesses have been revealed in our system of financial regulation. Market discipline did not prevent excessively leveraged portfolios and inadequate risk-management, and a patchwork of regulatory authorities failed to curb excessive risk-taking or detect systemic vulnerabilities. These failures call for a reassessment of the roles of market discipline and our regulatory structures in supporting the efficient functioning of financial markets.\nSecond, the Federal Reserve has undertaken policy actions of historic proportion. We have aggressively cut the federal funds rate, our traditional policy lever. We have also created multiple new lending facilities and transformed the asset side of our balance sheet. And, going forward, we will be expanding nontraditional policies now that the fed funds rate is approximately zero. Accordingly, we are faced with the challenge of calibrating these unfamiliar policies and, in the future, determining the appropriate time and methods for winding them down.\nThird, public policy responses have increasingly moved toward fiscal interventions. To date, these have mostly been aimed at improving market functioning: the Treasury's TARP program, FDIC guarantees, and the Hope for Homeowners Act, and other programs to re-work mortgages. Looking ahead, we expect large amounts of more traditional types of fiscal stimulus to increase aggregate demand. I believe a big stimulus is appropriate. But it is also sobering to be deploying large amounts of tax-payer funds at a time when our fiscal balance sheet is already coming under significant stress: The federal debt held by the public is 38 percent of GDP, states have large unfunded liabilities, and growing numbers of retiring baby-boomers will further pressure the unfunded liabilities for Social Security and Medicare. Furthermore—especially in light of current economic difficulties—many taxpayers already consider their tax burdens to be very high.\nFinally, the monetary and fiscal policy interventions have been fast-moving and complex responses to extraordinary events. As such, they are difficult to communicate succinctly, require periodic re-calibrations as events change, and are often misunderstood—even by well-informed segments of the public. There is a great need for effective communications and transparency in policy-making. This extends beyond communications with financial market participants. Efforts to enhance the general public's understanding of economic and financial issues are essential. In a democracy, an informed public is critical if government officials are to carry out policies for the public good. So it is important that policy makers and informed private citizens—like you in the NABE—continue to enhance communication efforts.\nAlthough each of these topics is worthy of an extensive discussion, time will allow me to make only a few modest observations on these long-term challenges.\nIf I were here to address this group simply as an economic researcher, I might start with something like this. Both the Federal Reserve and the Treasury have taken actions recently in order to address exceptional problems in financial markets. Without these moves, the costs to our financial infrastructure and real economy would have soared far beyond those we are experiencing today. But these necessary actions also have the unfortunate consequence of distorting incentives for future behavior. Unchecked, they could lead to costly future problems in the functioning of markets.\nSome might say that incurring such future costs would simply be reaping what is being sown today by ignoring the lessons of the \"rules v. discretion\" literature. Although I don't subscribe to this view, it does cause me some concern. But, I think the current environment is also one in which we have to worry about the evil agent in Hansen and Sargent's robust control analyses. Recall that the \"evil agent\" is a parable for how we might end up in states of the world that fall outside of our typical probability distributions and entail huge downside costs to the economy. Robust policy guards against these outcomes, and I interpret the Fed's aggressive and innovative lending programs to be \"robust responses\" to probability distortions caused by a particularly evil agent.\nBut, of course, I'm not here to speak simply as an economic researcher so let me give you my perspective as a Fed president instead. As always, these are my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nToday, the U.S. economic and financial systems are facing their greatest challenges since World War II. Turmoil in the housing market accelerated in the summer of 2007. We have experienced large-scale disruptions to financial intermediation and the destruction of something on the order of ten trillion dollars of U.S. household wealth.1 We are now a full year into a recession: Many non-financial industries are facing substantial risks of long-term structural impairment; and according to most economic forecasts, the unemployment rate will likely exceed 8 percent this year.\nBeyond these serious immediate concerns, the U.S. economy is facing a number of diverse and difficult longer-term challenges. First, significant weaknesses have been revealed in our system of financial regulation. Market discipline did not prevent excessively leveraged portfolios and inadequate risk-management, and a patchwork of regulatory authorities failed to curb excessive risk-taking or detect systemic vulnerabilities. These failures call for a reassessment of the roles of market discipline and our regulatory structures in supporting the efficient functioning of financial markets.\nSecond, the Federal Reserve has undertaken policy actions of historic proportion. We have aggressively cut the federal funds rate, our traditional policy lever. We have also created multiple new lending facilities and transformed the asset side of our balance sheet. And, going forward, we will be expanding nontraditional policies now that the fed funds rate is approximately zero. Accordingly, we are faced with the challenge of calibrating these unfamiliar policies and, in the future, determining the appropriate time and methods for winding them down.\nThird, public policy responses have increasingly moved toward fiscal interventions. To date, these have mostly been aimed at improving market functioning: the Treasury's TARP program, FDIC guarantees, and the Hope for Homeowners Act, and other programs to re-work mortgages. Looking ahead, we expect large amounts of more traditional types of fiscal stimulus to increase aggregate demand. I believe a big stimulus is appropriate. But it is also sobering to be deploying large amounts of tax-payer funds at a time when our fiscal balance sheet is already coming under significant stress: The federal debt held by the public is 38 percent of GDP, states have large unfunded liabilities, and growing numbers of retiring baby-boomers will further pressure the unfunded liabilities for Social Security and Medicare. Furthermore—especially in light of current economic difficulties—many taxpayers already consider their tax burdens to be very high.\nFinally, the monetary and fiscal policy interventions have been fast-moving and complex responses to extraordinary events. As such, they are difficult to communicate succinctly, require periodic re-calibrations as events change, and are often misunderstood—even by well-informed segments of the public. There is a great need for effective communications and transparency in policy-making. This extends beyond communications with financial market participants. Efforts to enhance the general public's understanding of economic and financial issues are essential. In a democracy, an informed public is critical if government officials are to carry out policies for the public good. So it is important that policy makers and informed private citizens—like you in the NABE—continue to enhance communication efforts.\nAlthough each of these topics is worthy of an extensive discussion, time will allow me to make only a few modest observations on these long-term challenges.\n\nThe Future of Market Discipline and Regulation\nMarket discipline plays a vital role in testing and validating corporate strategies and business execution. In most cases during normal times, financial markets can assimilate the relevant information to provide these important signals to investors. They then serve as a restraint on individual institutions taking undue risks.\nBut I think we've learned from recent events that the force of market discipline can fail in unexpected ways. The mechanisms are not fully clear, but it seems that in the quiescent period before the current crisis, market prices indicated a high value for residential housing and housing-related investments, such as MBSs and CDOs, with little perceived risk. Markets responded to these signals by increasing their provision of these investments, but with little attention paid to risk management. Then, after the crisis hit, market prices swiftly reversed. Now, they signaled what were arguably extremely low values for these same housing-related securities. It's likely that the true value of these securities lies somewhere between the euphoria of 2005 and the pessimism of 2008, but one could not infer this from market signals. Rather, it seems that these abrupt swings in market valuations were due at least in part to equally abrupt changes in market liquidity conditions. I don't claim to fully understand these changes in liquidity conditions. But the high prices earlier this decade may have been associated with the flood of liquidity into U.S. capital markets from abroad. And the current low valuations may derive in part from reduced liquidity due to balance sheet constraints and counterparty concerns surrounding financial institutions that have suffered significant losses. In any case, it appears that at least in extreme cases, market-liquidity distortions can defeat price transparency. This, in turn can inhibit the effect of market discipline on individual firm behavior.\nIn times of market stress, price movements are dominated by aggregate risk conditions, rather than the fundamental condition of individual firms. These movements can be driven by many factors. Industries, firms, or financial products which seem unrelated may become unexpectedly interconnected due to deterioration, or simply the perception of deterioration, in the health of one or more key financial intermediaries or market-makers. Separately, financial investors may suddenly reassess the relative risk/return profiles of certain classes of financial instruments and transactions, and may simply adopt a heightened level of risk aversion.\nHow might we mitigate some of the potentially adverse consequences of such interconnectedness? The futures and derivatives industry is weighing whether privately negotiated derivatives contracts should be centrally cleared or remain collateralized bilaterally among pairs of counterparties. An increasing number of derivatives contracts are now being multilaterally netted by central counterparties, or clearinghouses. Central clearing of such contracts shifts exposures from particular counterparties' balance sheets to the clearinghouse. For example, a significant effort is underway to begin central clearing of credit-default swaps. This effort is a reaction to the lack of transparency that left market participants not knowing which of their counterparties might be liable for large losses on credit-default swap positions. Arguably, this uncertainty caused many market participants to withdraw from trading a wide spectrum of financial instruments in which counterparty performance might be called into question. Of course, centralized clearing does not eliminate performance risk; it simply concentrates it at the clearinghouse. This means the clearinghouse itself becomes a potential single point of failure. Accordingly, adequate capital, good risk-management and prudential oversight are essential for such clearing facilities.\nAlthough forecasting is usually a very difficult task, some forecasts are easier than others. For example, it is not difficult now to predict that financial institutions will face more intense supervision and regulation. Indeed, investment banks and other financial institutions have already agreed to added scrutiny by applying to become bank holding companies. Presumably, the enhanced supervision will take aim at some of the obvious culprits of the recent turmoil. One objective would be to prevent a reoccurrence of imprudent mortgage lending practices: in particular, lending decisions that were not properly based on a borrower's underlying \"ability to pay\" but instead were viable only if housing prices continued to rise. Another aim would be more realistic assessments of firms' exposures to seemingly remote off-balance sheet assets.\nWe have also seen that a range of firms and institutions can be systemically important for financial stability. So it seems likely that the scope of financial enterprises subject to \"systemic\" supervision might need to be expanded as well. Here, too, the regulatory decisions will be difficult. Questions about changes in the treatment of clearing houses, exchanges, hedge funds, and private equity investors must be studied carefully. Furthermore, the types of financial entities that are systemically important may change over time. Of course, tighter regulation carries with it risks that must be taken into consideration, including the potential effect on innovation, the higher financing charges to recover the added costs of regulation, and the possibility that riskier activities may simply shift to off-shore jurisdictions. This latter risk highlights the need for international cooperation and coordination on regulatory reforms.\nDiscussions about systemic risks lead naturally to the topic of how to respond to asset price bubbles. The first issue in this discussion must be how to identify asset price bubbles. This was the famous question asked by Alan Greenspan in December 1996. It is important to get this right—I continue to be concerned that, as Chairman Greenspan pointed out, an aggressive campaign to fight a perceived asset bubble could entail large downside costs if the assessment proves to be wrong. That said, we are currently bearing enormous downside costs from the fallout from large mortgage-related asset losses, and this fact reinforces the need for changes in policy. My view is that we should concentrate on designing macro-prudential regulatory policies aimed at helping to prevent and protect against the consequences of asset price bubbles. Strong systemic supervision and enhanced market discipline will need to be a part of this design.\nFinally, strong supervision and market discipline will periodically determine that a financial institution is no longer viable. So a high-priority issue is the need to design a more efficient and orderly process to resolve the insolvency of large complex non-banking institutions. Such a process should be aimed at reducing the systemic ramifications of an imminent insolvency on the financial system and the economy. This raises a number of questions. What functions and size thresholds should be used to determine which institutions are covered? What are the appropriate triggers to invoke the insolvency resolution process? How should the priority of creditors' claims be established? Should the process include the possibility of a bridge bank type institution established by the regulatory authority? The answers to these questions must also confront the possibility that systemic problems may arise before insolvency, as counterparties may be reluctant to trade with an institution that is in distress.\n\nFiscal Implications of Policy Actions\nThe second long-term issue that will influence the future course of monetary and public policy is the quantity of government debt. The Federal Reserve has responded to the financial crisis by establishing a number of lending facilities, which have altered the composition and size of our balance sheet. And the Federal Reserve System has begun outright purchases of GSE debt and mortgage-backed securities to enhance liquidity in those markets and further reduce interest rates. Aggressive fiscal policy responses have also taken place during this recession: the initial tax cut stimulus, the Troubled-Asset Recovery Plan (TARP), FDIC guarantees for senior bank debt, and several programs aimed at delivering relief for troubled homeowners. And more traditional stimulus packages will be coming soon.\nFor me, the economic rationale is clear: Without these policy actions, the downturn—and its costs to society—would be even more severe than what we are currently facing. They hold open the promise of mitigating the losses in jobs and output during the downturn. And avoiding unnecessary realignments of financial, physical, and human capital would reduce any permanent impairment to the economy's productive infrastructure. Since most economic forecasters envision the current downturn as rivaling the deep recessions of 1974–75 and 1981–85, I think these fiscal programs must be large in order to be effective and to instill badly needed confidence.\nNo matter how necessary these actions may be, there are some devilishly difficult judgments involved. Our profession needs many constructive voices to remind us all of the effects that these public policies may have on the nation's long-term finances.\nBy historical standards, our current fiscal debt is not unusually large; but our expected future obligations are enormous. The war on terrorism continues generating great human cost and sacrifice, and mounting government debt. The onset of the baby-boomers' retirement will further pressure intergenerational insurance programs, such as Social Security and Medicare. In addition, many state pension plans are underfunded relative to future obligations. So the value of prudent fiscal management is high.\n\nCommunications and Policy Risks\nWith much of my time used up, I now come to one of the most important challenges policymakers face: communications. While we at the Fed pride ourselves on always conducting extensive, thorough analyses of all economic issues, our efforts to analyze the current situation and design appropriate policy initiatives are probably unprecedented in scope. But policymakers face another very important challenge: In a complex and dynamic environment, the public needs effective and transparent communications. As our lending facilities and other policy responses continue to evolve, this is a daunting task.\nIt would be nice if we could provide a simple summary of the country's financial predicament. I'll give it a try,—and, you will quickly see that it is inadequate in many ways. Here goes: Many investments and bets were placed on the assumption of ever increasing housing values. These positions were leveraged and amplified by innovative financial engineering based on an overly confident belief that risks could be dispersed to the winds. These beliefs became assurances that were too often accepted by investors, credit agencies, and regulators. All parties failed to see the possibility and extent of systemic vulnerabilities. As the bets turned sour and correlations among seemingly unrelated financial returns increased, losses cascaded into large disruptions to our financial system. These disruptions have negatively affected real economic activity, causing further losses in the financial sector and worsening the disruption. So, policy has responded in a number of new and targeted ways to these financial disruptions with the intention of mitigating the negative impact on economic activity.\nAs a communications device for explaining why we have transformed and expanded the Fed's balance sheet, this summary is simple but incomplete. It leaves out many critical details and fails to capture three key issues: complexity, speed, and uncertainty.\nMy earlier comments on market discipline and financial product structure have already touched on the complexity issue, but here's another example. Following the use of TARP funds to inject capital into the banking system, a notable public concern has been the absence of any obligation for banks to lend in exchange for this new capital. We have not done a good enough job in communicating that even though analyses of previous banking crises suggest that capital injections are more likely to unlock lending capacity at banks, it is not beneficial to substitute a policymaker's judgment over a banker's judgment with regard to initiating individual loans. We can productively insert judgment in some broad ways—such as on the supervisory side in questioning risk-management practices—but not on the ex ante review of individual lending decisions.\nTurning to speed, it is sometimes necessary to address emerging distress with quick action; and the time between that action and the communication of a full explanation of the events can seem uncomfortably long. We have provided a good deal of information to the public. In the past 18 months, Chairman Bernanke and Secretary Paulson have testified before Congress many times, and Federal Reserve officials have given numerous speeches about our policies. The minutes of our FOMC meetings also provide further context for our actions. And we now publish extended forecasts quarterly, with a commentary describing the forces shaping these outlooks. Still, we should strive to do more.\nUndoubtedly, the greatest challenge we face is the enormous uncertainty of this situation. Yes, the irony between \"undoubtedly\" and \"uncertainty\" is fully intended here. I discussed the challenges earlier of assessing financial risk from liquidity, credit, solvency or agency sources.\nThose are surely large. But I am also thinking of an important observation made by Robert Lucas long ago: As advice-giving profession, we economists are in way over our heads. At any time, this is a sobering and humbling thought to remember. Nevertheless, in the current environment, this reminds me that the pursuit of robust policies in the face of large uncertainties is likely to be most efficacious. A good Bayesian decision maker can't place all of his or her policy bets on a single hypothesized diagnosis when the evidence is still ambiguous. If Hansen and Sargent's evil agent is out there somewhere distorting probability distributions, he is doing a devilishly good job.\nThe need to act in the presence of ambiguity and such unusual events certainly adds to our policy and communications challenges. These challenges are further compounded by the fact that in order to restore the best balance between market discipline and government intervention, it is important for all of us to recognize that the current situation is a once in a 100-year event, not to be repeated in our lifetimes (or at least not to be expected sooner).\nConsequently, I think the communications response must be to \"never give up.\" We need to work very hard to explain the risks that we are facing and the rationale for why we think our policy actions best address those risks. As I alluded to earlier, much digital ink has been spilled in these attempts so far. More is on the way. If ink were fiscal stimulus, we might see a more rapid economic recovery in 2009.\n\nNote\n1 This figure incorporates rough estimates of changes in household wealth since the end of the third quarter.\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

            "content": "I’m delighted to be here today to share with you my thoughts on the economy and offer my perspective on monetary policy. Before I proceed further, let me stress that I will be sharing my personal views with you, and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.\nWith four quarters of positive growth under our belt and employment beginning to rise, the economic recovery from the recession that ended in June 2009 is certainly underway. However, the pace of recovery in both output and employment has slowed recently. Real GDP (gross domestic product) rose at an annual rate of just 1.7 percent in the second quarter, down markedly from 3.7 percent growth in the first quarter. I expect slightly stronger growth going forward — in the range of 2.0 to 2½ percent in the second half of the year, and 3.0 to 3½ percent next year.\nThis is a quite moderate pace of growth given the severity of the recession we experienced and in comparison with the economy’s potential growth rate. We need stronger growth for some time before we return to a more normal level of economic activity.\nNotably, at 9.6 percent in September, the unemployment rate remains well above the level I consider to be consistent with the Fed’s mandate of maximum employment. To bring the unemployment rate down substantially, the economy needs to grow substantially above the potential rate. But given my outlook for only moderate growth over the next two years, I don’t see unemployment falling below 8 percent by the end of 2012.\nPerhaps slower job growth is a new feature of recoveries. Following the two prior recessions, many measures of economic activity showed improvement well before the unemployment rate started to decline. But, in the current environment, slow job growth is symptomatic of a generally weak recovery.\nTo offer some perspective, let me remind you of the aftermath of the deep 1981 to 1982 recession. In the eighteen months following that recession, growth averaged nearly 8 percent and the unemployment rate declined by 3½ percentage points. In contrast, after 15 months of recovery from the recent recession, growth has averaged only 3 percent and the unemployment rate is only marginally lower than at its peak of 10.1 percent in the fall of 2009. Even after more solid growth materializes, unemployment will likely remain stubbornly high. Discouraged workers will resume searching for jobs, adding to the large number of those already looking for work. Furthermore, the number of long-term unemployed is extremely high, and such workers typically have a more difficult time finding a job.\nThe housing market will also be a factor constraining employment gains by reducing the mobility of homeowners who owe more on their home than it is worth. New construction and home sales remain well below their historical averages; and, supply and demand conditions could continue to weigh on real estate markets for some time. Low mortgage rates and more attractively priced homes suggest housing market conditions will get better as we move further into the expansion, but improvement is likely to be only gradual.\nRecently, many observers have questioned what more monetary policy can do to address the very high unemployment rate. Some have suggested that the financial crisis and the accompanying recession precipitated structural change in the demand for labor, raising the economy’s natural rate of unemployment. They suggest that it has become significantly more difficult to match job seekers with job vacancies over the past two years. If this is true, then monetary policy is not the appropriate tool to address the ramifications of such a change. If, however, structural factors can only explain a modest part of the rapid rise in unemployment, then monetary policy may be able to play a more constructive role.\nThere are reasons to think that the natural rate of unemployment has indeed risen over the last couple of years. The extension of unemployment insurance benefits during the recession helped to cushion unemployed workers from the adverse effects of lost income. But it also might have reduced the incentive for some workers to seek out new employment, or kept others from leaving the labor force. It is also conceivable that the recession affected different regions and sectors of the economy unevenly or severed an unusually large number of long-term employment relationships, factors making for an especially difficult transition for affected workers.\nThe historical relationship between unemployment and job vacancy rates is a useful tool for addressing this issue. 1 When labor markets are functioning well, an increase in job openings is accompanied by a decrease in unemployment. It has only been since the beginning of this year that we have seen an improvement in job openings that was not matched by a correspondingly large reduction in unemployment. Based on this, some have suggested that most of the increase in the unemployment rate over the past two years is due to a mismatch between the skills of the unemployed and those needed by employers.\nHowever, there are problems with this view, including the dearth of sectors reporting strong demand for hard-to-find skilled workers and the continued presence of disinflationary pressures that we would not expect to observe if the natural rate were higher and resource slack were smaller. Even if we take the job vacancy data at face value, the size of the deviation from its historical relationship with unemployment is not large enough to suggest an increase in the natural rate to anything like the current rate of unemployment. 2 Therefore, the 8 percent unemployment rate I expect to see by the end of 2012 still leaves us with a very large amount of resource slack.\nAt the same time, measures of consumer price inflation continue to under-run the 2 percent level that I consider consistent with price stability. With inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to remain below desirable levels for some time. It is not unreasonable to expect 1 percent inflation in 2012. Unless the actual conditions turn out to be very different from my forecast, inflation of less than 1½ percent in 2013 is a strong possibility.\nThe magnitude of resource slack, combined with the fact that inflation has been running below the level I consider consistent with long-term price stability, suggests to me that it would be desirable to increase monetary policy accommodation. Normally, this would involve lowering the target federal funds rate based on the economic outlook and the historical relationship between policy actions and their impact on the economy.3 However, at roughly zero, the fed funds rate is as low as it can go. As a result, the current economic environment poses unusual challenges for policymakers.\nA key aspect of the current situation that concerns me is the growing evidence that we are in what economists call a “liquidity trap.” In a liquidity trap, the supply of savings continually outstrips the demand for investment, but interest rates near zero can’t fall to equate supply and demand. Liquidity traps are exceedingly rare. The last time the U.S. economy was in a liquidity trap was during the Great Depression, some 80 years ago.\nThere’s a lot of evidence that we’re in a liquidity trap. Despite the accommodative stance of monetary policy, the amount of credit flowing to households and businesses has yet to expand. Undoubtedly, some of the decline in lending reflects tighter lending standards. However, standards for most loan types are no longer tightening, and anecdotal evidence suggests that credit is more readily available.\nRather, it seems to me that part of the reason for sluggish credit flows is that businesses aren’t particularly interested in increasing spending. As I assess the incoming data and talk to my business contacts, the impression I get is that executives are very cautious in their outlook and spending plans. They appear to be content to post strong profits generated by unprecedented cost-cutting, rather than grow their top-line revenues by expanding capital investment and hiring. Even after substantial improvement in financial conditions, firms are sitting on the cash generated by profits and the funds raised in capital markets. Some of our business contacts explain their reluctance to invest by pointing to uncertainties raised by regulatory actions and government policies. Yet, most admit they would increase spending if demand were stronger.\nTo be certain, some forms of business spending are already reviving. Inventory rebuilding contributed strongly to growth in previous quarters; but this process is nearing an end, as firms have made substantial progress aligning inventories with sales. Business fixed investment also increased at a solid pace earlier this year, with firms upgrading IT systems and replacing capital equipment in order to maintain competiveness and profitability. Recent data, however, suggest that the surge in replacement demand is beginning to subside. Absent further improvement in consumer demand, business spending is likely to be more moderate going forward.\nConsumers also remain reluctant to spend, adding to their savings nearly in proportion to increases in disposable income. The personal savings rate in August, at 5.8 percent, is well above the near 2 percent savings rate that we saw prior to the recession. In fact, personal savings continue to rise even though there is very little interest income to be earned. This suggests that the high savings rate reflects elevated risk aversion caused by the millions of jobs lost during the recession, as well as the $13 trillion wealth loss that accompanied it. Such an increase in households’ propensity to save is accompanied by a decrease in their rate of consumption.\nSo we have all the ingredients for a liquidity trap: Businesses are cautious about new investment and households are too worried to meaningfully increase consumption. And interest rates can’t fall in the way needed to increase investment and consumption because short-term rates are already at zero: They’ve fallen as far as they can go. If this state of affairs continues, it could very well stifle any reasonably robust recovery. Unemployment would remain unacceptably high, and disinflationary pressures would be reinforced — clearly an undesirable outcome.\nThese rare occasions of liquidity traps are very different from typical economic recessions. Consequently, they require a unique monetary policy response. Economic theory tells us that in such circumstances monetary policy should aim to lower the real, or inflation-adjusted, rate of interest by temporarily allowing inflation to rise above its long-run path. My preferred way of doing so is to implement an approach called price-level targeting. Simply stated, under this approach, the central bank strives to hit a particular price-level path within a reasonable period of time. For example, if the rate of change of the price-path is 2 percent and inflation has been under-running the path for some time, monetary policy would strive to “catch-up” so that inflation would be higher than the inflation target for a time until the path was regained. This higher inflation rate would decrease the real interest rate, raising the opportunity cost of holding money. This would provide an incentive for banks and corporations to release funds for investment, and in the process spur job creation.\nIn my opinion, such a strategy is entirely appropriate. The Fed has a mandate from Congress to encourage conditions that foster both price stability and maximum employment. Recently the Fed has missed on both dimensions of this dual mandate, with inflation running below the 2 percent level I associate with price stability, and with unemployment staying well above any reasonable estimate of the natural rate.\nPractically speaking, price-level targeting in the current environment would call for a series of large-scale asset purchases to recover the shortfall in inflation. At the same time, we would continue to carry a large balance sheet in order to maintain low interest rates for an extended period.  Most important, we would clearly communicate the path for prices that we expect to attain, in order to enhance the public’s understanding of the Fed’s intentions.\nThere are operational aspects of a price-level target policy that require much more elaboration and study, including the precise price-level target and how to achieve it. There are also potential challenges that we should be prepared to address. For instance, given the initial uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the new policy approach, inflation may at first continue to be very low. Sustaining our commitment to achieving the price-level target would be critical if we are to achieve success in this case. Conversely, we’d need careful advance planning to ensure that if inflation ran at a more elevated level than expected, we could bring the price level back to the target path. The tools we developed over the last two years to drain reserves from the banking system will prove useful in this regard. It would also be of utmost importance to appropriately use the Federal Reserve’s authorities of macroprudential supervision and regulation during this period to avoid the emergence of financial market imbalances.\nFor many, my proposal will be a hard pill to swallow. Central bankers generally loathe the idea that even a temporarily higher inflation rate could be beneficial for, or consistent with, price stability over the longer term. We do not want to lose what the Fed under Chairmen Volcker and Greenspan won for the American people by fighting inflation and achieving price stability. The current circumstances, however, require that we fight a different battle — namely, the extraordinary instance of liquidity trap conditions not seen since the 1930s. With potentially beneficial policies that are well grounded in rigorous economic analysis available to us, I cannot stare at our current projections for high unemployment and low inflation and think that they are consistent with the best policies to address the Fed’s dual mandate responsibilities.4\n\nNotes\n1 From its peak in January 2008 to its lowest point in February 2010, nonfarm payroll employment declined by 8.75 million.\n2 Making some plausible assumptions, my staff estimates that the level of unemployment consistent with recent data on job openings taken from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey is likely to be between 6 and 7 percent.\n3 A convenient summary of this relationship is given by the “Taylor rule,” first expressed in Taylor (1993) and later developed further in Taylor (1999).\n4 Academic studies of the benefits of price-level targeting given liquidity trap conditions include Krugman (1998), Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), Svensson (2003) and Auerbach and Obstfeld (2005).\n\nReferences\nAuerbach, Alan J., and Maurice Obstfeld, 2005, “The Case for Open-market Purchases in a Liquidity Trap,” American Economic Review, Vol. 95, No. 1, March, pp. 110–137.\nEggertsson, Gauti B., and Michael Woodford, 2003, “The Zero Bound on Interest Rates and Optimal Monetary Policy,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Vol. 34, No. 1, pp. 139–211.\nKrugman, Paul R., 1998, “It’s Baaack: Japan’s Slump and the Return of the Liquidity Trap,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Vol. 29, No. 2, pp. 137–187.\nSvensson, Lars E.

            "content": "Introductory Remarks\nI would like to thank Eric Rosengren, Jeff Fuhrer and the organizers for giving me the opportunity to speak on this panel today. I would like to use this opportunity to expand the discussion about additional communications tools available to central banks in a low-inflation environment. In a nutshell, I think there are special circumstances when price-level targeting would be a helpful complement to our current and prospective strategies in the U.S. Clearly communicating an expected path for prices would help guide the public’s understanding of the Fed’s intentions while we carry a large balance sheet and promise continued low interest rates for an extended period.\nThere are quite a number of academic studies of liquidity trap crises that find either price-level targeting or temporary above-average inflation to be nearly optimal policies;1 and yet, central bankers and the public generally loathe the idea that even a temporarily higher inflation rate could be beneficial or be consistent with price stability over the longer term.\nNevertheless, with potentially beneficial policies so well grounded in rigorous economic analysis, I cannot stare at our current projections for high unemployment and low inflation and think that these projections are consistent with the best monetary policies to address the Fed’s dual mandate responsibilities. Today, I want to expand the discussion of these tools. After all, debate on the merits is healthy.\nOf course, these are my views only and not those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nRationale: Much More Accommodation Is Appropriate\nLet me be very clear about the setting for this proposal. In my opinion, much more policy accommodation is appropriate today. In a speech two weeks ago,2 I stated that I believe the U.S. economy is best described as being in a bona fide liquidity trap. This belief is not a new development for me; instead, it is a dawning realization. Risk-free short-term interest rates are essentially zero. Both households and businesses have an excess of savings relative to the new investment demands for these funds. With nominal interest rates at zero, market clearing at lower real interest rates is stymied.\nIn this setting, even a moderate expansion without a double dip will not lead to appropriate labor market improvement.3 Accordingly, highly plausible projections are 1 percent for core Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index (PCE) inflation at the end of 2012 and 8 percent for the unemployment rate. For me, the Fed’s dual mandate misses are too large to shrug off, and there is currently no policy conflict between improving employment and inflation outcomes. The economic theories that central bankers rely on for evaluating appropriate monetary policy suggest to me that we need lower short-term real interest rates than the current real federal funds rate of –1 percent. Indeed, if the federal funds rate were positive, I would advocate substantial nominal reductions. But we are effectively at zero.\nA variety of typical linear Taylor rules suggests around –4 percent. In addition, some calculations for optimal monetary policy simulations I have seen indicate that real rates of –3 or –4 percent between now and the end of 2012 would boost aggregate demand enough to deliver substantially lower unemployment by the end of 2012. If you reach the conclusion that we are in a liquidity trap, or even near a perilous liquidity trap, more accommodation is not data-dependent or a close call.\nHow Does Price-level Targeting Help with Policy Communications?\nIf the Federal Reserve decided to increase the degree of policy accommodation today, two avenues could be: 1) additional large-scale asset purchases, and 2) a communication that policy rates will remain at zero for longer than “an extended period.”\nA third and complementary policy tool would be to announce that, given the current liquidity trap conditions, monetary policy would seek to target a path for the price level. Simply stated, a price-level target is a path for the price level that the central bank should strive to hit within a reasonable period of time. For example, if the slope of the price path, which I will refer to as P*, is 2 percent and inflation has been underrunning the path for some time, monetary policy would strive to catch up to the path: Inflation would be higher than 2 percent for a time until the path was reattained. I refer to this as a state-contingent policy because the price-level targeting regime is only intended for the duration of the liquidity trap episode. I will be more concrete in just a moment, but first, where does such a policy come from?\nA policy that targets a price-level objective emerges from analyzing standard—modern macroeconomic theory. The desirable properties of the price-level target (or temporarily above-average inflation) become most apparent in analyses that consider liquidity traps.\nFigure 1 displays the simplest example of a price path P* and its essential attributes. The reader must judge for herself whether this policy could be communicated straightforwardly and transparently to the public; my personal viewpoint is that it is horribly cynical to think that good communication is beyond our ability, especially if that is the best policy. Here are some key elements:\n\nThe first policy component consists of announcing a state-contingent entry into the P* policy. I think most of us imagine liquidity traps with double-digit unemployment rates to be relatively rare events, on the order of twice a century or less. Under such circumstances where the central bank is missing both components of its dual mandate by a large margin, there is justification for targeting a higher price-level path in an effective, disciplined, and limited fashion. A credible announcement of the policy is clearly crucial for stimulating the correct expectations by the public.\nThe second policy component is to select the parameters for the price-level path: the initial date when the index-path begins and the slope of the path. Given the recognition delay in understanding the implications of the liquidity trap, it seems reasonable that the path would begin at some date in the past. My preference would be to select December 2007, in part because it is the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) peak of the business cycle. With regard to the slope, for the sake of concreteness, I will illustratively suggest 2 percent for the average inflation rate; this rate corresponds to the mode of FOMC participants’ forecast endpoints for PCE inflation.4 With this definition of the P* path, it is easy to see an emerging “inflation deficit” to date.\nThe third policy component is to communicate regularly and often to the public that the intention of the FOMC’s policy actions is to achieve this path within a reasonable period of time. At a minimal level, this could simply be a disciplined guarantee regarding how long policy rates will be held at zero; it is an elaboration of what the current “extended period” language means. Other accommodative policies could be used to further build the public’s confidence that the Fed is pursuing this price-level path. The task of communicating many operational details would follow the announcement. Indeed, even before reaching the P* path, closing the gap would set the stage eventually for adjustments in operational policy, such as the altering size of the Fed’s balance sheet, taking reserve-draining actions along the way, and increasing the rate of interest on excess reserves (IOER), among others.\nThe fourth policy component is to clearly state the terms for the final, state-contingent exit from the P* policy. Determining that the price-level path has been achieved with confidence is a critical determination. Presumably, spending a few months at the price-level path would be more important than simply the first achievement of the path. Once the price-level path is achieved with confidence, the forward-looking monetary policy strategy would return to focusing on 2 percent inflation over the medium term. Future policy misses on either side of 2 percent would be “bygones.” Policy would continue to strive for price stability over the medium term, which would be 2 percent PCE inflation. The past inflation misses would be used to simply inform current analyses of inflation pressures and improve future projections and policy responses.\n\nWhat Might the Experience with P* Look Like? Some Favorable Cases\nLet me spend some time discussing alternative outcomes from this state-contingent price-level targeting regime. Remember, the regime is one where policy actions like large scale assets purchases (LSAPs), communications actions, etc., strive to increase monetary accommodation to hit the P* path within a reasonable period of time. Figure 2 shows the implied inflation rates for a 2 percent P* path where the current price gap is closed by the end of 2012. Given current forecasts for inflation, this would be a rapid turnaround in the inflation picture. Many questions regarding operational responses during this adjustment would need to be addressed:\n\nThe inflation rates are relatively modest: 2.2 percent core inflation in 2011 and 2.9 percent in 2012. For a policymaker with a symmetric loss function around 2 percent, 2.9 percent is about the same loss as 1 percent. This is not a significant change from current expectations of policy losses. Of course, ensuring commitment to the policy exit is presumably crucial for achieving 2 percent in 2013.\nIf short-term interest rates remain near zero during this adjustment, real interest rates would be between –2 and –3 percent. Perhaps that would be enough to improve labor markets and aggregate demand sufficiently, but I personally put more faith in analyses that suggest the liquidity trap is larger than this.\nConsequently, in this scenario at the end of 2012, if resource slack remains substantial and inflationary pressures are returning toward 2 percent over the medium term on account of credible policy commitment, then a standard Taylor-rule prescription may still call for a relatively low federal funds rate. And the size and composition of the Fed’s balance sheet might also be consistent with accommodation. How much? The ultimate decisions for monetary policy would continue to focus on our dual mandate responsibilities; but inflation would be nearer our goal of price stability and aggregate demand would be stronger.\n\nAs I mentioned, a 2 percent P* policy that achieves the target path by the end of 2012 might leave unemployment still relatively high given the implied real rates. Figure 3 displays a more aggressive P* policy that is assumed to close by the end of 2013. This path rises at a 3 percent rate from December 2007 until December 2012, and then reverts to the 2 percent slope, taken as price stability. This path incorporates what Svensson (2003) refers to as an initial “price gap to undo:” It allows the eventual price adjustment to incorporate a lower real rate if that is what the economic analysis suggests is most useful to increase aggregate demand. Over the course of this hypothetical adjustment, inflation is about 3, 4, and 3 percent from 2011 through 2013. Thus, policy can generate –3 and –4 percent real rates: This achieves a substantially higher opportunity cost of holding on to cash-like assets rather than lending and investing excess reserves in productive activities and workforces.\nAgain, credible commitment to the price path P* is, of course, critical to achieving the inflation endpoint of 2 percent over the medium term. In this regard, a reduction in the size of the Fed’s dual mandate shortfalls would reinforce the public’s perception that the Fed’s incentives are appropriately aligned with exiting the P* policy with medium-term price-stability in sight.\n\nWhat Might the Experience with P* Look Like? Some More Challenging Cases\nThere are many operational aspects of a P* policy that require much more elaboration and study. Nevertheless, let me mention three clear situations that require more complicated responses. It is a hallmark of the uncertain times that we face that these are at polar extremes.\nDelayed Inflation\nThe first challenge is to imagine that inflation continues to remain very low even after an announcement that monetary policy is following a price-level path. As inflation delay continues, the “inflation deficit” account builds. That is, the price gap gets larger, and implied future inflation to attain the P* path grows. This would clearly be nerve-wracking for policymakers, and the credibility of our commitment to ever growing inflation rates would be crucial for the success of the policy. If our resolve is credible, well-functioning financial markets should get the message. After all, investors and lenders sitting on cash-like assets would be building up an exposure to adverse future real interest rates. And I would expect the financial press to help communicate these investment risks on a regular basis. (I know I’ve felt that sting already.)\nAs cash moves out of investment portfolios into the general economy, inflation will rise as required by the price-level targeting policy.\nSmaller Resource Slack and Greater Inflation Pressures\nThe second challenge is to imagine that the degree of resource slack in the economy is much smaller than many presume. One example would be if the structural rate of unemployment was upward of 8 percent. In this case, more accommodation could lead to higher inflation and a rapid closing of the price gap.\nAs it turns out, this is not a challenge for the P* policy: A quicker closing of the price gap harkens the exit of the state-contingent price-level policy. The fact that unemployment would remain high would be a signal that increasing aggregate demand alone is not enough to address this problem. But monetary policy would have succeeded in moving closer to price stability with the attending benefits from achieving that policy goal. Confidently switching to the post-P* policy would enhance credibility for price stability over the medium term. And we would have done all that we could to address the employment situation—which would also enhance Fed credibility, in my judgment. \nAccelerating inflation once the price gap has been closed\nThe third challenge would be if inflation was surprisingly high at the point when the price gap was eliminated and policy reverted to targeting 2 percent inflation over the medium term. I regard this case as extremely unlikely. Recall that we are embarking on this price-level targeting policy in an environment of huge resource gaps, with minimal inflationary pressures. (I actually think that the greater difficulty will be getting inflation going in the first place.) But in the unlikely occurrence that inflation accelerates beyond the levels we anticipate, we have the tools to deal with it. Specifically, relative to initial baseline scenarios, the Fed could more aggressively increase the federal funds rate and interest on excess reserves (IOER), as well as drain liquidity from our balance sheet. Furthermore, any higher inflation would almost surely be associated with stronger economic growth and job creation, so these stronger “exit strategy” actions would be entirely appropriate.\n\nConcluding Remarks\nMy objective today has been a simple one: to discuss a policy tool that has received almost zero discussion, though it regularly comes out of careful analyses of mainstream economic models that we use to assess monetary policy options. We should put this policy tool on the table and debate its suitability to the current situation in the U.S.\nMost critiques I have heard of this type of policy tool involve the risk of runaway inflation expectations or the loss of hard-earned credibility. My response is to continually fall back on the discipline of the state-contingent exit plan. A central bank exercising this policy would have to credibly convey to the public that this policy will end when the price gap is closed. An important risk would be the temptation to keep policy easy if the labor market has not reached the vicinity of full employment. Depending on the parameters of the P* path, inflation expectations and the size of resource slack, the price gap could close before unemployment is reduced toward 6 percent or lower. Nevertheless, credibility requires exiting the P* policy at this point. Doing so ensures that this is a conservative policy, with prudent risk-mitigants against outcomes that monetary policy is unable to improve upon.\nBut I am more hopeful for this policy’s potential to improve upon our current liquidity trap economic conditions. I hope that my comments have helped expand the debate over the past few weeks.\n\nNotes\n1 An essential reference list would begin with Krugman (1998), Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), Svensson (2003), and Auerbach and Obstfeld (2005).\n2 Evans (2010). See also my interview with The Wall Street Journal in Hilsenrath (2010).\n3 In the speech cited earlier, I also discussed the relevant evidence on job mismatch and the Beveridge curve. I find unconvincing the argument that the natural rate of unemployment has risen enough to deter additional substantial policy accommodation.\n4 For the remainder of my comments, I will take 2 percent to be the FOMC’s explicit inflation objective over the medium term. This is not a decision that has been taken by the FOMC. I simply use 2 percent to facilitate the development of my comments.\n\nReferences\nAuerbach, Alan J., and Maurice Obstfeld, 2005, “The Case for Open-market Purchases in a Liquidity Trap,” American Economic Review, Vol. 95, No. 1, March, pp. 110–137.\nEggertsson, Gauti B., and Michael Woodford, 2003, “The Zero Bound on Interest Rates and Optimal Monetary Policy,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Vol. 34, No. 1, pp. 139–211.\nEvans, Charles L., 2010, “A Perspective on the Future of U.S. Monetary Policy,” Speech  at a conference sponsored by the Bank of France, The Future of Monetary Policy, Rome, Italy, October 1.\nHilsenrath, Jon, 2010, “Q&A: Chicago Fed’s Evans Elaborates on His Call for Aggressive Fed Action,” Real Time Economics: Economic Insights and Analysis from The Wall Street Journal, blog, October 5.\nKrugman, Paul R., 1998, “It’s Baaack: Japan’s Slump and the Return of the Liquidity Trap,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Vol. 29, No. 2, pp. 137–187.\nSvensson, Lars E.

            "content": "Thank you for that kind introduction. It’s a great pleasure to be here. Over the past three years, we have been dealing with a crisis that has reverberated around the world, inflicting severe damage to financial markets and economies. The response of policymakers in the U.S. and elsewhere was swift and unprecedented in its scope and magnitude. It was also well coordinated across the community of central banks. We set up swap lines to ease liquidity strains throughout the world and lowered target rates jointly at the height of the crisis. Such coordinated action was very helpful in stabilizing the global financial system.\nToday, as we progress with economic recovery, policymakers in all countries are faced with a new set of challenges and issues. Recognizing that they face a distinct set of challenges, I look forward to hearing my co-panelists discuss the issues facing European policymakers as they deliberate the future of monetary policy. For my part, I would like to give you my perspective on some of the issues we face in the U.S. Before I proceed further, let me stress that I will be sharing my personal views with you, and not necessarily offering the views of my colleagues on the FOMC, or the Federal Reserve System.\nThe U.S. was the epicenter of the financial crisis and the deep recession that followed. The decline in our economic activity and the damage to financial markets in the past three years are a reflection of the magnitude of the shock. Over the course of the recession, U.S. real GDP declined by more than 4 percent, over 8 million jobs were lost, the unemployment rate doubled within two years and the household sector – which accounts for the lion’s share of the U.S. economy – lost more than $13 trillion in wealth.\nOver the past year, however, we’ve seen significant improvements. Financial markets have stabilized and have progressed toward full repair. Aided by accommodative monetary policy, fiscal stimulus and improvements in financial markets, real GDP has recorded four quarters of positive growth and employment has begun to rise. However, given the depth of the recession, we still have a long road ahead before we catch up to the level of activity we would have achieved in the absence of the crisis, or any other shock. Moreover, we appear to have lost some of our forward momentum in recent months. Real GDP growth slowed markedly from an annual rate of 3.7 percent in the first quarter to 1.6 percent in the second quarter. More recent data suggest that growth in the second half of the year will be similarly weak – and softer than what I had expected just a few months ago. At the same time, measures of underlying inflation have fallen to very low levels -- levels that are below the 2 percent level that I, and most Fed policymakers, consider to be consistent with effective price stability.\nLooking ahead, I expect output growth will strengthen in 2011 and 2012. Nonetheless, the pace of growth I currently anticipate is quite moderate given the severity of the recession we experienced and the potential growth rate of output. As a result, I expect the unemployment rate to remain well above its pre-crisis level over the next two to three years. Given the current and the anticipated future level of resource slack and subdued long-term inflation expectations, I also expect inflation to remain below desirable levels over any reasonable forecast horizon.\nWith such an outlook for the economy, as a macroeconomist and policymaker, I think we face two key issues in the near and medium term. First, to what extent do structural factors explain the very high unemployment rate we currently have? Some have suggested that the financial crisis and the accompanying recession precipitated a seismic shift in the structure of labor markets, raising the natural rate of unemployment significantly above its pre-crisis level. If, as they suggest, labor market frictions rose dramatically over the past two years, then monetary policy is not the appropriate tool to address the ramifications of such a change. If, on the other hand, structural factors can only explain a modest part of the rapid rise in the unemployment rate, and aggregate demand deficiencies account for remainder, then monetary policy may be able to play a constructive role.\nThis brings me to the second key issue facing policymakers. If further monetary policy accommodation is desirable, what is the appropriate policy action when short-term interest rates are already at zero? Has extreme risk aversion by businesses and consumers put us in what can be described as a liquidity trap? And if so, what can we do about it?\nLet me first elaborate on the unsatisfactory progress in employment gains, and what it implies for monetary policy. There are several reasons to think that the natural rate of unemployment has risen over the last couple of years. It is possible that the extension of unemployment insurance benefits during the recession, while cushioning unemployed workers from the adverse effects of lost income, might have reduced some workers’ job search intensity, or kept others from leaving the labor force. To the extent that such incentives are present, the natural rate of unemployment would increase while the extended benefits are in effect. However, reasonable estimates of the effect of the extension of unemployment benefits range one-half to one percentage points – far from sufficient to explain the nearly 5 percentage point increase over the past two years. Moreover, given the current schedule for the expiration of these benefits, the resulting increase in the natural unemployment rate will fade away over the next two years – leaving us still with an unsatisfactorily high rate of unemployment at the end of my forecast horizon.\nIt is also possible that the shocks that reverberated through the economy created a mismatch between the skills sought by employers and the skills the unemployed workers have. For instance, it is conceivable that the recession affected the different regions and sectors of the economy unevenly. Moreover, the recession may have severed an unusually large number of long-term employment relationships, making for an especially difficult transition for affected workers. The unusually long spells of unemployment experienced during the recent recession and potential erosion of skills during that time are additional factors that might have magnified labor market frictions. The sharp decline in home values and tight credit conditions might have reduced the ability of unemployed workers to sell their homes and move to regions where jobs are available. Taken together, these developments might have eroded the efficiency of matching between workers and jobs, and raised the natural rate of unemployment.1\nThe key question is: Are these possible structural changes in the labor market sufficient to explain the current unemployment rate? The Beveridge curve that describes the relationship between the unemployment rate and the job vacancy rate is a useful tool for addressing this question. The unemployment-vacancy relationship through the end of 2009 is captured very well by a simple, stable Beveridge curve and a constant-returns Cobb-Douglas matching function. So, the relationship between job openings and unemployment through the end of 2009 has been relatively stable, and does not suggest a dramatic increase in labor market frictions. It is only recently that we have seen an improvement in job openings that was not matched by a correspondingly large reduction in unemployment. Based on these data, some have suggested that most of the increase in the unemployment rate over the past two years is due to skills mismatch.\nHowever, it seems likely that much of the apparent conflict between unemployment and vacancy data may be purely an issue of timing. At this stage of an economic recovery, it is not unusual for the vacancy rate to increase ahead of reductions in the unemployment rate – we have often seen such loops in the Beveridge curve at the end of past recessions.\nBut even if we take the job openings data at face value, it doesn’t suggest an increase in the natural rate to anything like the current rate of unemployment, which stands at 9.6 percent. Making some plausible assumptions, my staff estimates that the typical level of unemployment associated with a stable Beveridge curve passing through the recent data is likely to be about 7 percent. This includes the effects of increased unemployment insurance benefits that I already discussed.2 \nI am not suggesting that 7 percent is a good estimate of the current natural rate. As I said, there are reasons to discount some of the recent improvement in the vacancy data. Rather, I want to point to out that, even if one takes the vacancy data at face value and accepts that the natural rate has risen to 7 percent, we are still left with a very large amount of slack relative to the current rate of unemployment and the rate most analysts expect to see at the end of 2012.3\nThe size of the unemployment gap, combined with the fact that inflation has been running below the level I consider consistent with long-term price stability, suggests that it would be desirable to increase monetary policy accommodation to boost aggregate demand and achieve our dual mandate.\nShould the FOMC judge that further monetary policy accommodation is appropriate based on our economic outlook, what is the optimal level of additional accommodation and what policy tools should be employed to deliver the additional stimulus?\nDuring a typical period of policy accommodation, the answers to these questions would be straightforward. The FOMC would lower the target federal funds rate based on our economic outlook and the historical relationship between policy actions and their impact on the economy. For instance, were the current fed funds rate at 3 percent, my forecast would call for a substantial decline in the target rate. Such a reduction in the nominal fed funds rate would be consistent with several versions of the Taylor rule, which would call for negative interest rates.4 However, at roughly zero, the fed funds rate is as low as it can go.\nAs a result, the current economic environment poses unusual challenges to policymakers. In assessing the current state of the economy and considering the optimal policy response, a key issue that concerns me is the possibility that we might be in a liquidity trap.\nAs I assess the incoming data and talk to my business contacts, I see that executives are very cautious in their outlook and spending plans. They appear to be content to post strong profits generated by unprecedented cost-cutting, rather than growing their top-line revenues by expanding capital investments and hiring. Very conservative attitudes reign and cash is still king – even after the improvements in financial markets and strong bond issuance by businesses. Firms are sitting on the cash generated by profits and funds raised in capital markets. Very few are planning to grow their workforce. Although some contacts point to uncertainties raised by regulatory actions and government policies to explain their reluctance to invest, most admit that they would increase spending if stronger demand conditions prevailed.\nHouseholds are similarly cautious and gun-shy in their spending. Given the millions of jobs lost during the recession, the job insecurity faced by those employed, trillions of dollars in lost wealth and the balance-sheet repair that households have undertaken, consumers are displaying significant risk aversion. They have raised their savings rate, even though those savings earn very little interest income.\nThese are the classic symptoms associated with a liquidity trap: the supply of savings that outstrip the demand for investment even when short-term nominal rates are at zero.\nThe modern economic theory of liquidity traps indicates that the optimal policy response at zero-bound is to lower the real interest rate, almost surely by employing unconventional policy tools. Theory also indicates that, in the absence of such policy stimulus, the factors that generate high risk aversion could very well stifle a meaningful recovery, keep unemployment high and reinforce disinflationary pressures – clearly an undesirable equilibrium.\nSo, in the coming weeks and months, as I assess the incoming data, update my forecast and deliberate on the best monetary policy approach, I will be pondering two key issues: How much more should monetary policy do to reduce the shortfalls in meeting our dual mandate responsibilities for employment and price stability; and what tools should we use? Thank you.\nNotes\n1 See Petrongolo and Pissarides (2001) for a review of aggregate matching functions in labor markets and the related literature.\n2 As I noted before, unless unemployment insurance benefits and the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program are extended further, they are scheduled to expire in 2011, at which point any impact they had on the natural rate of unemployment will begin to fade away.\n3 There are other challenges for the view that the increase in the unemployment rate over the past two years reflects primarily structural factors: the dearth of sectors reporting strong demand for hard-to-find skilled workers; the lack of inflation pressures that we would expect to observe if the natural rate were higher and resource slack were smaller; and the unusually low quit rates and job-to-job transitions during the recession that are indicative of weak labor markets (De Wolfe and Klemmer, 2010; unpublished updates of the employment-to-employment transitions in Fallick and Fleischman, 2004).\n4 For instance, the guideline suggested by Taylor (1999) would call for the federal funds rate to be negative 3.5 percent given the current CBO output gap of negative 6 percent and core CPI inflation rate of 1 percent, assuming that the FOMC considers 2 percent inflation to be consistent with price stability. The guideline outlined in Taylor (1993), which puts a smaller weight on the current output gap, would suggest that the federal funds rate target should be negative 0.5 percent.\nReferences\nDe Wolf, M., and K.

            "content": "Good morning. I'm Charlie Evans, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. It’s my pleasure to welcome you to the 13th Annual International Banking Conference.\nOver the years, this conference has served as an important forum for the discussion of current issues affecting global financial markets. Past conferences have emphasized systemic risk, the globalization of financial markets, international regulatory structures, the problems involved with the resolution of globally active banks and financial crises management.\nWe have been fortunate to have leading scholars, regulators and industry executives participate over the years and provide their valuable perspectives on topical policy issues. Our co-sponsor this year is the International Monetary Fund (IMF). I want to take this opportunity to offer a special note of thanks to our IMF colleagues for helping to organize what I believe is an impressive program addressing an important policy issue here in the United States and around the world.\nThis year we examine the role of macroprudential regulation of financial markets. Historically, financial supervision and regulation has taken a microprudential approach. The typical assumption had been that the financial system as a whole could be made safe by ensuring that individual firms were made safe. While there was widespread knowledge that markets and firms were interconnected—in fact, that was the root of “too-big-to-fail” concerns—that interconnectedness was not a driving force behind financial supervision and regulation. And though we have learned many things from the recent financial crisis, nothing has been more important than understanding that the actions of individual firms can generate significant externalities that can adversely affect general market conditions, other institutions and, ultimately, the overall economy. Indeed, this reality helped make clear the critical need to change the way we supervise and regulate financial firms and markets.\nWe have recently seen a number of changes within the regulatory environment to address the shortcomings of the past supervisory model. Under the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP), U.S. regulators tested the ability of the largest institutions to withstand adverse macroeconomic shocks and continue to maintain aggregate system lending. The regulators’ stress tests had characteristics of both microprudential and macroprudential supervision, with a goal of enhancing system stability. The stress tests yielded many benefits—perhaps none more important than restoring public confidence in the largest institutions’ ability to withstand future worse-than-expected economic scenarios.\nTogether with other regulators, the Federal Reserve has also been heavily involved in the Basel III process, which includes major revisions to global capital standards and the introduction of new quantitative liquidity standards. The Federal Reserve System is also developing processes to better enable it to identify and address emerging risks, particularly risks with systemic implications. This “quantitative surveillance mechanism” (QSM) will incorporate data from markets, individual firms, and supervisors, and it will accommodate the results of stress testing in the future.\nIn the United States, the role of macroprudential regulation has been elevated significantly with the recent passage of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The act represents a paradigm shift in the American financial regulatory environment: We are moving toward a new regulatory landscape with an emphasis on financial system stability.\nThe act introduces a Financial Stability Oversight Council, made up of representation from the various financial regulatory agencies, with an explicit financial stability mandate. The council will be responsible for monitoring the financial system to identify systemic risks and regulatory gaps. It will identify systemically important firms (both bank and nonbank institutions), and these will be subject to more stringent prudential standards. The heightened standards will involve new liquidity and capital requirements, stress testing, prompt corrective action, and reporting requirements. If necessary, the selected firms may also be subject to contingent capital requirements, enhanced public disclosures, short-term debt limits and other prudential standards.\nFurthermore, the act requires additional regulation of certain payments, clearing, or settlement systems deemed to be systemically important. All of these reforms are aimed at protecting the financial system as a whole instead of just the individual financial institutions.\nWhile the Dodd–Frank Act stresses the important role of macroprudential regulation, it leaves many of the implementation details to the regulatory agencies. The following questions are left for them to answer:\nWhat are the determinants and appropriate levels of capital required of systemically important firms?\nHow should they vary over the business cycle?\nShould contingent capital be required?\nWhat instruments will qualify as contingent capital?\nAnd what data is needed to allow adequate monitoring of the activities of systemically important institutions?\nThese are just a few of the important questions that must be addressed within the new regulatory landscape. As we have seen during the recent global crisis, the interconnectedness of financial markets goes beyond our domestic borders. It is obvious that we need to do a better job of identifying cross-border linkages and their associated risks. Greater coordination across regulatory frameworks could be tremendously helpful in this effort. We hope that forums like this one will aid in that process.\nAgain, I’m pleased to welcome you to Chicago. I look forward to the next two days of stimulating discussion about how we as a global financial community should proceed with macroprudential regulation. I think you will find this conference both informative and useful.",

            "content": "Thank you, Ed. Good morning. On behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, I would like to thank you for joining us today at this Public Policy Symposium on OTC Derivatives Clearing. I’m delighted to be here to welcome you and provide some brief comments that, I hope, will help frame the discussion of the important issues related to the central clearing of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives.\nThe Chicago Fed has had a long-standing interest in clearing and settlement issues. In particular, we have an obvious interest, since Chicago is home to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and its clearinghouse, The Options Clearing Corporation and ICE Clear U.S. We are proud of our role in producing cutting edge research relating to clearing and settlement and facilitating dialogue among academics, policymakers and financial industry participants.\nIn 1996, we co-sponsored a conference on derivatives and public policy at which the Nobel laureate Merton Miller explored the competitive boundary between exchange-traded and over-the-counter derivatives and the impact of new technologies that were then changing the financial landscape. Miller recognized even then how clearing and settlement functions were central to the operation of financial markets.\nMany of you will no doubt recall that we co-sponsored a conference on central counterparty clearing with the European Central Bank in 2006. That event, like today’s, brought together industry leaders, policymakers and academics in a multidisciplinary discussion of key legal, risk-management and public policy issues relating to central counterparty clearing. In addition, the Chicago Fed has actively participated in the ongoing work of the OTC Derivatives Regulators’ Forum since its formation in 2009.\nWe recently experienced the worst financial crisis since the 1930s. As we emerge slowly from that crisis, we have become engaged in a vigorous debate on how best to address the major weaknesses in our financial regulatory framework—and the issue of centralized clearing of derivatives has taken a prominent role. As you all know, the Dodd-Frank bill seeks to address these weaknesses and put forward a structure that will help prevent another crisis of this magnitude.\nNotwithstanding the amount of work that has already been completed, making financial reform work will not be easy. We face complex problems that will require a comprehensive, multipronged approach. But make no mistake; reform is critical for ensuring our long-term economic and financial stability. And much of that reform will address the implications of the increasing interconnectedness of the global payment, clearing and settlement infrastructure that supports financial market operations today. In a 2008 report titled The Interdependencies of Payment and Settlement Systems, the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems said:\nThe development of tighter interdependencies has helped to strengthen the global payment and settlement infrastructure by reducing several sources of cost and risk. Yet, tightening interdependencies have also increased the potential for disruptions to spread quickly and widely across multiple systems and markets.1\nThe clearing of derivatives through central counterparties, or CCPs, is one important manifestation of the interdependencies in the financial system. CCPs interpose themselves between the counterparties to financial contracts by becoming the common buyer to each seller and the seller to each buyer. The centralization of clearing functions at the clearinghouse has obvious benefits, including multilateral netting and the centralization of the information needed to manage risk exposures in a robust manner. However, policymakers also recognize that central clearing concentrates risk and responsibility for risk management in the CCP.\nThis means the clearinghouse itself becomes a potential single point of failure. Accordingly, adequate capital, good risk management and prudential oversight are essential for such clearing facilities. The events of the recent financial crisis have certainly reinforced our recognition of the importance of these post-trade institutions.\nAs you know, the central clearing of over-the-counter derivatives is a core feature of the legislation recently enacted to reform financial market regulation—a development that has important implications for market structure. Interest in this topic isn’t merely local or even national—in fact, it’s global, as is evident from the attendance at this event.\nToday’s symposium has brought together leaders from industry, the policy and regulatory communities and academia from around the world to have an open and frank discussion on issues related to central counterparty clearing. Four questions will dominate the discussion:\nWho should own and control a central counterparty?\nWho should participate in central clearing?\nWhat is the appropriate capital structure for a central counterparty?\nWhat should the market structure look like?\nThese are all difficult questions. I doubt that a consensus will be reached quickly on all of the relevant issues. But it is important for us to understand all parties' perspectives and to consider the costs and benefits of the policies that are being implemented for the regulation of these markets. Good policymaking depends upon this interaction.\nThis symposium has been organized to take full advantage of the collective wisdom and body of expertise that exists in this room. The panelists’ remarks are designed to initiate the discussion of each set of topics and then open the discussion to all. Thank you all for coming. I look forward to a good discussion and further debate on the importance of OTC derivatives clearing and settlement.\nNote\n1 Bank for International Settlements, Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems, 2008, The Interdependencies of Payment and Settlement Systems, Basel, Switzerland, June, p. 1.",

            "content": "Good afternoon. I am pleased to be here today to share a few comments as we close out the first day of this excellent conference on REO and Vacant Property Strategies for Neighborhood Stabilization. Most of you already have some appreciation for the work that the Federal Reserve System has been doing to address financial and economic instability. What is less well known is that the Federal Reserve also has been working hard to respond to the foreclosure crisis on “Main Street.” We have leveraged our research, community affairs and supervision and regulation functions to support innovative foreclosure prevention and neighborhood stabilization strategies at the local level.\n  I’d like to talk about that important work, especially a Fed program called MORE, or the Mortgage Outreach and Research Effort; but before I do that, I’d like to discuss some of the larger issues that relate to homeownership and foreclosure mitigation. As a nation we have come to value homeownership because of the many benefits it brings, for both families and communities. Perhaps foremost is its potential for building household wealth. In addition, however, communities with high levels of homeownership tend to have greater involvement in school and civic organizations, higher graduation rates, lower housing turnover and higher home values. Simply stated, homeowners tend to put down deeper roots, and that is good for communities, as well as for families.\n  Recognition of these benefits has made encouraging homeownership a national priority. Tax incentives, FHA mortgage insurance and sponsorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac all contributed to a long rise in the U.S. homeownership rate—from 45 percent in 1940 to a peak of 69 percent in 2004. Of course, homeownership is only good for families and communities if it can be sustained. Home purchases that are very highly leveraged or unaffordable subject the borrower to a great deal of risk. There's no guarantee, as we've learned recently, that house prices will rise. Moreover, even in a strong economy, unforeseen life events and risks in local real estate markets represent vulnerabilities for highly leveraged borrowers.\n  Thus, it was very destructive when, in the early part of this decade, dubious underwriting practices and mortgage products inappropriate for mass consumption became more common. It is difficult to understand how loose underwriting, high degrees of leverage and the broad marketing of exotic and often very high-cost mortgage products could promote sustainable homeownership. In fact, these practices took us in the other direction, and homeownership began to decline even while mortgage underwriting standards continued to loosen. Moreover, partly as a result of these practices, we've seen an unprecedented housing market collapse that contributed to a very deep recession marked by many lost jobs. And homeownership has now declined for six straight years.\n  Although there are some signs of general economic recovery and some evidence of home price stabilization, we are certainly not out of the woods. Projections suggest foreclosed housing units in the U.S. could reach as high as 3 million in 2010.\nThe public policy response to the housing market collapse has become increasingly aggressive as the severity and extent of the collapse have become clearer. One might expect lenders to modify mortgages, making them more affordable for borrowers, rather than accepting large losses on foreclosed properties. However, for various reasons, the number of modifications has been lower than we might have hoped. Thus federal government efforts such as the Home Affordable Mortgage Program, or HAMP, continue to evolve, and the search for solutions goes on. The Federal Reserve has had a longstanding interest in these issues, but our work has taken on added significance since the advent of the housing meltdown and recent financial crisis.\n  My direct involvement in mortgage and foreclosure issues began fairly recently when I became President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and sponsor of a Federal Reserve Initiative called MORE, or the Mortgage Outreach and Research Effort. Prior to that, I had worked with our Community Affairs staff as they partnered with community organizations across our District to address foreclosures issues.\n  In Chicago, one of our most successful partnerships has been with Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago (NHS). Much of this work started in the late 1990s, culminating in a program called HOPI, the Homeownership Preservation Initiative, in 2003. The NHS, with our support, has pioneered many techniques to combat the ill effects of foreclosures. The HOPI has been instrumental in saving hundreds of families from foreclosure, hosting loan modification and counseling events, completing HAMP modifications for borrowers and creating strategies for reclaiming vacant properties.\nAs part of the MORE initiative, the Chicago Fed, together with Federal Reserve Banks around the country and the Board of Governors in Washington, is also addressing foreclosure mitigation and neighborhood stabilization efforts—through outreach, research and meetings with industry experts.\n  Perhaps most important so far has been our work to bring resources to the hardest hit cities and regions of the country. Home buyer counseling, for example, is a critical need in certain areas. Under the MORE program, we’ve helped many of our community development partners organize day-long “mega events” that have served thousands of troubled borrowers. Moreover, we’ve partnered with and brought together housing advocates, lenders, academics, and key government officials to discuss foreclosure issues and develop solutions. In some cases, alliances have been formed right on the spot to create and implement programs to keep people in their homes.\n  The MORE program also has included a partnership with the U.S Departments of Labor and the Treasury and the HOPE NOW Unemployment Taskforce to assist unemployed home owners at risk of losing their homes to foreclosure. This collaboration led to the creation of an online tool that allows homeowners and servicers to document unemployment insurance benefits as income to qualify for federally sponsored mortgage modification programs. In 2008, each Reserve Bank within the Federal Reserve System created an online Foreclosure Resource Center. These websites provide local constituents and consumers with easy access to information on foreclosure-related resources. Features of our Foreclosure Resource Center include an enhanced Foreclosure Mitigation Toolkit, which provides detailed steps and information for localities seeking to develop foreclosure prevention activities of their own, and a new Foreclosure Recovery Resource Guide, which seeks to assist consumers who have gone through the foreclosure process.\n  A number of Federal Reserve research projects have been initiated as part of the MORE program. They include several studies focusing on foreclosure prevention, financial education and adverse neighborhood effects resulting from foreclosures.\nIn this latter category, Community Affairs researchers across the Federal Reserve System launched a study in 2009 of the planning and early implementation stages of the federal Neighborhood Stabilization Program. The research team conducted a series of interviews with more than 90 recipients of HUD's NSP funds in the fall of 2009, they will release a report based on these interviews and other data in late 2010. This report will provide the first nationwide examination of the impact of the NSP.\n  In order to leverage the work of MORE and to make information available to practitioners in the field, we have been active in sponsoring several conferences. In addition to the conference held here today, the FRS and the FDIC are co-hosting a two-day conference this fall that will highlight policy-oriented research focused on the U.S. housing and mortgage markets. The first day of the conference will be dedicated to mortgage foreclosures, including research on the current situation and outlook, neighborhood spillover effects, and evaluations of efforts to mitigate foreclosures. The second day of the conference will present research on the future of housing finance.\n  All of the initiatives I have described as part of our MORE program serve to help supplement work being done on foreclosure prevention and neighborhood stabilization, both locally and nationally. My hope is that all of you here today will draw upon this information and the success of the MORE program to explore new and creative ways to address these important challenges. At the Fed, we will continue to do our part to encourage further research, participate in the dialogue, and coordinate concerned groups that want to work toward sustainable housing markets.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "It’s a pleasure to be here this morning. Since the start of the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve System has undertaken a series of unprecedented actions to help stabilize the financial markets and promote economic recovery. What is less well known is that the Federal Reserve has also been working to respond to the foreclosure crisis on Main Street, leveraging its research, community affairs and supervision and regulation functions to support innovative foreclosure prevention and neighborhood stabilization strategies at the local level. Today, I want to focus my remarks on some of those efforts as well as on other public policies that have been used to address the foreclosure crisis. Finally, I’d like to offer a few thoughts on policy alternatives that may prevent similar problems from occurring in the future.\nAs a nation we value homeownership because of the many benefits it brings, for both families and communities.1 Perhaps foremost is its potential for building household wealth. In addition, communities with high levels of homeownership tend to have greater involvement in school and civic organizations, higher graduation rates, lower housing turnover and higher home values.

In fact, these practices actually took us in the other direction, as homeownership began to decline even while mortgage underwriting standards continued to loosen. Moreover, partly as a result of these practices, we’ve seen an unprecedented housing market collapse that contributed to a very deep recession marked by many lost jobs. And now homeownership has declined for six straight years.\nAlthough there are some encouraging signs of general economic recovery and some evidence of home price stabilization, we are certainly not out of the woods. Projections suggest foreclosed housing units could reach as high as 3 million in 2010 with over a million lender repossessions. Mortgage distress is not limited to those with subprime loans. For example, in the state of Indiana, the inventory of subprime foreclosures actually decreased by about 4 percent from 2008 to 2009, while the inventory of prime foreclosures rose by over 36 percent. This is because job loss and unemployment are now causing more defaults than imprudent lending.\nPublic policy response to the housing market collapse has become increasingly aggressive as its seriousness and difficulty has been more fully recognized. Foreclosures are very costly for borrowers, lenders and communities. Prices of foreclosed homes often drop dramatically, implying big losses for lenders. Values of nearby homes are also affected, so large clusters of foreclosures can be devastating to communities.\nOne might expect lenders to modify mortgages, making them more affordable for borrowers, rather than accept large losses on foreclosed properties. However, the securitization process appears to have created conflicts between the interests of servicers and lenders. These and other impediments have kept the number of modifications lower than we might have hoped. The desire to see more modifications and fewer foreclosures has led to federal efforts, such as the Home Affordable Mortgage Program, or HAMP. To date, the number of successful modifications remains relatively small compared with the scale of the problem. Thus the search for solutions goes on. Some recent additions to HAMP include assistance for unemployed homeowners, more principal write-downs and plans to launch the FHA Refinance Option later this year. While the number of loan modifications are small compared with the number of foreclosures, one success the industry cites is that the programs have brought some standardization and consistency to the market.\nIn addition to federal interventions, many local and state agencies, as well as local practitioners have worked to lessen the effects of the crisis. They have pursued strategies ranging from land banking to court prescribed mediation between borrowers and lenders. The Chicago Fed has been very happy to partner with other organizations in many of these efforts, lending its resources to assist throughout the Seventh Federal Reserve District.\nWe’ve convened meetings of the key groups working toward mitigating the effects of the crisis. We have participated in research efforts to identify gaps in resources needed for foreclosure mitigation. And we’ve formed work groups to bring resources to the hardest hit areas. Home buyer counseling is a critical need in hard-hit areas, and we’ve helped many of our community development partners to organize daylong “mega-events” that have served thousands of troubled borrowers. Moreover, we’ve partnered with and brought together housing advocates, lenders, academics and key government officials to discuss foreclosure issues and develop solutions. In some cases, alliances have been formed right on the spot to create and implement programs to keep people in their homes.\nHere in Indiana, the Chicago Fed has had a long-standing working relationship with the Indianapolis Neighborhood Housing Partnership (INHP) on affordable housing and homeownership preservation issues. We’ve also worked with others throughout Indiana, such as the Mortgage Fraud and Foreclosure Task Force, the Indiana Mortgage Bankers Association and the Indiana Foreclosure Prevention Network. We regularly participate in homeownership preservation seminars, which provide delinquent borrowers with access to their mortgage lenders for the purpose of finding options for staying in their homes. And, as job loss has become a leading cause of foreclosures, we’ve been working with a number of organizations in Indiana to help promote employment in local communities.\nIt’s easy to be discouraged about the outcomes of efforts to deal with the mortgage crisis. While we can point to efforts that have saved thousands of homeowners from foreclosures, millions are still losing their homes. But, while we could always hope for more, I think the groups like INHP that have worked on this very difficult problem have a lot to be proud of.\nI’d now like to talk briefly about the question of what can be done to prevent problems like this from recurring in the future—a topic that I think is informed by some recent research done at the Chicago Fed, including on a paper on a program run by INHP. The mortgage crisis was caused in part by the use of inappropriate mortgage products. While economists usually give great respect to individual choice, in this case it seems that many borrowers made poor choices and that at least some lenders abetted those poor choices. People who had no business getting exotic mortgages, such as those without amortization, not only got them, but got them without having their income and ability to pay verified.\nHow might public policy respond to evidence of people being put into inappropriate nonstandard mortgage products?2 One possibility would be to impose very stringent regulatory oversight that eliminates such products all together. Such a policy would certainly prevent unqualified borrowers from obtaining high-risk mortgage products. However, such specialized products may actually be appropriate for certain people, so such a policy would have some real costs.\nAn alternative approach would be to place few restrictions on the choices available to borrowers and rely instead on better educating them about homeownership and mortgages. That would make borrowers better prepared to make informed financial decisions. Such an approach might keep those who shouldn’t be in exotic mortgages from getting them while leaving such mortgages available to the small group of people for whom they are appropriate. A big question, however, is whether financial education can work.\nStaff members at the Chicago Fed have recently undertaken a thorough review of studies evaluating the effects of financial education.3 What they find is that the evidence on the effectiveness of education and counseling is rather mixed. Some financial education programs improve financial outcomes, and some portion of this effect is due to increased financial literacy. However, other programs are less successful. More rigorous evaluation of specific programs is necessary to understand what can be done. My take is that financial education can work, but the programs must be very well designed and rigorous for financial education to be truly effective. Whether such programs can be implemented on a wide scale at reasonable costs is an open question.\nOne of the programs our staff evaluated was that of the INHP.4 As many of you know, the INHP program serves low- and moderate-income households, on a strictly voluntary basis. The goal is to prepare borrowers for homeownership by shoring up their finances. Classes and one-on-one counseling sessions cover money management, budgeting, credit score maintenance and home buying mechanics.\nThe program can take up to two years, and clients are considered successful if they are able to satisfy underwriting guidelines of external lending partners or the INHP lending committee. The program has strict requirements, and clients that cannot keep up may be asked to leave. Importantly, INHP continues to work with the client after the home purchase and is actively involved with the client if problems occur.\nPrevious research showed that INHP clients improved their credit scores during counseling, better preparing them for the mortgage application process.5 Our researchers evaluated whether this translated into better loan performance. The answer appears to be that it did. Compared with other borrowers, INHP clients on average started with significantly lower FICO scores and incomes. They also typically had lower down payments. Yet, despite entering the mortgage process in worse financial shape relative to other borrowers, INHP clients had a lower default rate over a 12-month period—they had a rate of 3.8 percent versus 6.3 percent for other borrowers. Importantly, after controlling for an array of additional influences, the difference between the default rates of the two groups appears even stronger—the 12-month default rate was typically 8–9 percentage points lower for INHP clients than for comparable borrowers not participating in the program. This is impressive and I want to recognize the INHP for its efforts.\nThat said, the success of counseling is certainly not guaranteed. Our researchers also evaluated the effects of a mandatory counseling program introduced in Chicago as a result of a controversial piece of legislation called Illinois House Bill 4050.6 This law grew out of concerns that predatory lenders were taking advantage of naïve, less sophisticated borrowers in certain markets. It required low FICO score applicants or those taking out nontraditional, high-risk mortgages in certain zip codes to go through a brief counseling session with a HUD-accredited counselor prior to the contract closing. The purpose was to discuss the contract terms and whether the loan product was a good fit for the mortgage applicant. This session typically occurred a few days prior to the closing. Our researchers found that such counseling had little effect. This is perhaps unsurprising given its extent and when it took place. Increasing participants’ financial sophistication is not easy.\nThe ineffectiveness of the program’s counseling did not, however, mean this program had no impact. In fact, our researchers found that the introduction of the mandatory counseling program significantly changed the behavior and performance of borrowers. Specifically, fewer high-risk loans were originated because some lenders, concerned about having their mortgage terms scrutinized by counselors and being accused of predatory lending, chose to exit the market. Additionally, borrowers were able to avoid the counseling sessions by taking alternative mortgage products that did not require financial counseling. While one can argue that this decrease in the supply of mortgages had a downside in terms of decreasing borrowers’ choices, the analysis found that the borrowers who were able to obtain mortgages performed significantly better than similar applicants in zip codes without the counseling requirement.\nThese two programs each affected the performance of loans, but they did so in quite different ways. In the case of INHP, the counseling apparently affected the behavior of potential borrowers and helped applicants better perform on their mortgage arrangements. In the Chicago program, a positive impact resulted from some lenders avoiding the new environment and borrowers choosing products that did not require counseling.\nThese findings fit quite well with the principles of a relatively new school of thought known as behavioral economics, which recognizes that people frequently make substantial mistakes in their economic decisions. In fact, these mistakes are so systematic that it is possible to alleviate many of their worst consequences by marginally adjusting the context in which the decisions are made. The costs resulting from the adjustment may be relatively minor and less costly, for example, than the consequences of prohibiting certain products altogether. In mortgage markets, prohibitions of products intended to “protect” borrowers could result in significant reductions in the availability of credit. This could prove costly as it would preclude some qualified customers from obtaining higher-risk mortgage products that they readily understand and can repay.\nAdditionally, behaviorists would argue that mass-scale counseling to promote informed financial decision-making may be very difficult and costly. A behaviorist’s approach would be to give consumers choices, but to incent them to make what policymakers would consider most likely the proper choice more frequently. For example, in the affected Chicago markets, the borrowers were free to choose among alternative product offerings, but had to participate in the counseling program if they took out a high-risk mortgage product. Thus this relatively low-cost incentive to avoid the high-risk product was quite effective at “nudging” borrowers toward the low-risk product option—usually the “proper choice” from a public policy perspective. We may look to behavioral economics more often as we evaluate new policy options aimed at avoiding the mortgage market problems we have seen in the recent past.\nIn summary, I’ve discussed the public policy response, including the role of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, as the housing market crisis has evolved. I have also discussed the means to protect against future foreclosure problems by better preparing loan applicants for the homeownership process. While financial education and counseling can be effective in generating more knowledgeable homeowners, they must be administered in a way that is timely and appropriate for both the borrower and the lender. Obviously, effective programs require significant time and effort if they are to result in significant changes in behavior and financial performance. Alternative approaches that attach small costs to choices that are likely to be risky are, I think, also well worth considering. At the Fed, we will continue to do our part to encourage further research, participate in the dialogue, and coordinate concerned groups that want to work toward sustainable housing markets, whatever form they may take.\nThank you.\nNotes\n1 See, for example, Daniel Aaronson, 2000, “A note on the benefits of homeownership,” Journal of Urban Economics, Vol. 47, No. 3, May, pp. 356–369; Robert D.

            "content": "Thank you, Madlyn, for that kind introduction and very warm welcome. I'd also like to extend a special thank you to Greg O'Leary for helping to arrange my visit to the University Club and the Civic Affairs Society Breakfast Forum. I'm especially pleased to be here this morning to explain what I see happening in the economy and express my views on some of the key issues we face today. Over the past couple of years I have been asked many times to speak about the Federal Reserve’s role in addressing the financial crisis. Usually, at the end of the talk, when I open the floor for discussion, I find myself being asked the same sorts of questions over and over again. So I’d like to address some of those questions in my remarks today and then give you an opportunity to follow up with questions of your own.\nLet me emphasize that the views that I am presenting today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or my other colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nLet’s begin with the question I hear most often: What are the prospects for the economy?\nIn short, the economy is recovering from the recession, and I am optimistic that it will continue to do so. My forecast is that real gross domestic product (GDP) will grow about 3-1/2 percent this year. In fact, we have been hearing many more upbeat business reports over the past several months, and have nudged up our outlook accordingly.\nThat said, we still need to experience a good deal of growth before we return to the more normal pace of economic activity and levels of unemployment that we enjoyed in late 2007. And the 3-1/2 percent pace of growth I anticipate is quite moderate given the severity of the recession. To offer some perspective, in the first year and a half following the deep 1981 to 1982 recession, growth averaged nearly 8 percent.\nLet me give you some of the details underlying this assessment of the economy.\nFirst, consider the recent GDP numbers, which measure the value of all of the goods and services produced in the economy. GDP fell sharply—3.7 percent all told—during 2008 and the first half of 2009. But GDP has increased in each of the past three quarters, with growth averaging a 3.6 percent annual rate.\nWhere did this growth come from? Some of it reflected the federal government stimulus package passed in 2009. This raised economic activity a good deal in the second half of last year, and should be a continued solid boost to spending through much of 2010.\nBut government stimulus is hardly the whole story. Unmistakably, private spending has been reviving. One area is inventory investment by businesses. During the recession, firms aggressively cut inventories to very lean levels. By avoiding an overhang of excess stocks, they are now increasing orders for newly produced goods to meet incoming demand—and we’ve seen manufacturing production increase accordingly. We have also seen an increase in business spending on capital equipment, most notably on high-tech items, as firms replace and upgrade their IT systems and other equipment in order to maintain competiveness and profitability.\nConsumers also have increased spending. Job worries and losses in household wealth had caused consumers to cut back on spending appreciably during the recession. But they have now begun to reopen their pocketbooks. During the first quarter of 2010 total personal consumption expenditures increased at a 3-1/2 percent annual rate. Significantly, these increases were distributed across many different types of goods and services. Even in the hard-hit automobile sector, sales have averaged over 11 million units annual rate so far this year—up over 17 percent from a year ago, though still well below the pace of 16.6 million units that prevailed before the recession.\nIn contrast, housing continues to struggle. During the second half of 2009, both sales and new construction lifted off from the recession low points seen around the turn of last year. But sales fell back after the expiration last November of the first round of tax credits for first-time home buyers, before receiving another boost this spring, as buyers rushed to beat the end-of-April expiration date for the extension of the home buyer tax credits. The increase in housing starts also stalled later in 2009 before showing some modest renewal during the past several months. Still, the rates of sales and starts are far below historical norms. Fundamentally, supply conditions continue to weigh on real estate markets, and they could for some time as foreclosures add to the overhang of unsold homes. But with the improving economy, low mortgage rates, and more attractively priced homes, housing market conditions will get better as we move further into the expansion.\nWhat about labor markets? In general, many measures of economic activity show improvement early in a recovery well before the jobs picture starts to get better. This was especially true following the two previous recessions. I am concerned that this may be the case during this expansion as well. As the economy entered the most recent recession, businesses quickly cut their work forces. And even as the economy grew during the second half of 2009, job destruction outpaced the extremely low levels of hiring.\nMore recently, there has been a modest improvement in the jobs picture. Over the first five months of the year, excluding temporary hiring for the U.S. Census, on average about 86,000 jobs per month were added to the economy. Last Friday's data were disappointing, but they are only one month's numbers.\nBusinesses are being cautious about adding permanent staffing. They continue to strive to produce more with fewer people. But they can increase output for only so long without adding to payrolls. As the recovery progresses and businesses become more confident in the future, employment will increase on a more consistently solid basis.\nIndeed, there are signals that we currently are near such a turning point. There is the modest pickup in the jobs numbers I just noted. Underlying those recent employment numbers, layoffs are down substantially. Some of those businesses that cut employment most aggressively at the beginning of the recession have begun to rehire. And others that are taking a more wait-and-see attitude are hiring temporary workers to fill their staffing needs. In fact, temporary worker employment has increased solidly in each of the past eight months.\nNonetheless, even after more solid employment gains materialize, unemployment may remain stubbornly high. Discouraged workers will resume searching for jobs, adding to the number of those already looking for work. In addition, the number of long-term unemployed is extremely high, and such workers typically have a more difficult time finding a job. Consequently, the outlook for these workers is challenged. So I anticipate that the rate and length of unemployment will improve relatively slowly.\nWith consumer spending accounting for roughly two-thirds of GDP, the economic forces at work here are key factors underlying the moderate projections for overall growth. Households entered this recession with high net worth but also with low levels of savings and high levels of debt. When faced with a temporary loss of income, households can maintain spending only by drawing down assets, borrowing more, or reducing savings. But as the recession took hold, households faced mounting job losses, stark reductions in the value of their housing and equity assets, and little in the way of liquid savings. So it is little wonder that consumers sharply retrenched on spending.\nThe need for households to repair their balance sheets will moderate growth in consumer spending going forward. In addition, we are seeing reduced availability of household credit. And, importantly, muted gains in employment will hold back growth in wages and salaries. All of these factors contribute to an outlook for relatively modest growth in consumer spending, which, in turn, restrains the forecast for overall GDP growth.\nIn addition to consumer lending, the availability of bank credit remains a significant headwind for many small- and medium-sized companies. Both supply and demand considerations are at work here. Some of the decline in bank lending last year reflects weak demand for loans by businesses wary of taking on new debt burdens in an uncertain economic environment. But at least some of the reduced lending arises from banks’ tighter lending standards. These tighter standards appear to reflect concerns of banks about their own capital levels and also the credit quality of borrowers. More generally, credit flows are being reduced because both borrowers and lenders are still dealing with losses from the recession, especially the busts in residential and commercial real estate. I expect banking conditions to improve and better support growth, but this is likely to take some time.\nWhile I’ve mentioned a number of factors that we think will dampen growth, we could be surprised on the upside. Increases in confidence could turn into higher spending sooner than we now think. And productivity growth has remained strong. Technology continues to advance, and firms continue to create new products and find new ways to produce more efficiently. These factors will lead to higher incomes in the longer term. And even over the shorter term, the higher profits and incomes generated by productivity can help restructure balance sheets and support spending.\nWell, that was a long answer to a short question. The second question I’m often asked is a two-parter concerning inflation. The first part is: Isn’t inflation about to explode? The second part is: Are you concerned about deflation? The answer is no in both cases: I think inflation will remain relatively stable.\nBoth camps have clear arguments. The current low rates of resource utilization strongly point to lower inflation. At 9.7 percent, the unemployment rate is quite high. Similarly, manufacturing capacity utilization is quite low. Such resource slack reduces cost pressures and makes firms less able to push through price increases. These factors have contributed significantly to lower inflation. The Fed’s preferred measure of core inflation—the deflator for Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE, excluding food and energy—has fallen from 2.7 percent in August 2008 to 1.2 percent in April 2010. That is a large decline for a relatively stable data series.\nThose who press me on higher inflation point to the Fed’s accommodative policy and expanded balance sheet. We all know that too much money chasing too few goods eventually will generate inflation. But, currently, most of the funds used to increase our balance sheet are sitting idly in bank reserves. And because banks are not lending those reserves, they are not yet generating spending pressure. But, of course, leaving the current highly accommodative monetary policy in place for too long would eventually fuel such inflationary pressures.\nWith core inflation at 1-1/4 percent, I see the opposing forces of resource gaps and accommodative monetary policy as roughly balancing out over the medium term. As resource slack abates in a recovering economy, I expect inflation to move up to about 1-3/4 percent by 2012.\nWhat does all of this mean for monetary policy? Currently, policy is, appropriately, very accommodative. But, eventually, we will have to return to a more normal stance. Judging the appropriate timing and pace for reducing accommodation poses a significant challenge for policymakers over the next couple years. On the one hand, removing too much accommodation prematurely could inhibit the recovery. On the other hand, as I noted, if the Fed leaves the current level of accommodation in place too long, inflationary pressures will eventually build. The Fed’s decisions will be based on careful monitoring of business activity and keeping an alert eye out for signs of changes in the inflation outlook. In addition, the FOMC is making sure that it has the technical tools it will need when it decides to reduce monetary accommodation. Overall, I am confident that monetary policy will both support economic growth and bring and keep inflation near my guideline of 2 percent over the medium term.\nAs you can imagine, the crisis and recession have kept us busy. And we are constantly alert to issues that may cause us to reassess our outlook. With this in mind, I’d like to address a question that I have been asked a lot lately: How will recent events in Europe affect the U.S. economy?\nThere are a few channels through which the European sovereign debt problems could influence us here. European efforts to lower debt will likely weigh on their economic growth over the medium term. This will translate into less demand by Europeans for U.S. products. In addition, the dollar already has appreciated relative to the euro. This means that European consumers find our products to be relatively more expensive than before. At the same time, prices for European goods in terms of the dollar have fallen, boosting our demand for European imports. All of these channels work in the direction of lowering U.S. net exports, which, all else being equal, would tend to reduce the outlook for U.S. GDP growth.\nHowever, a couple of factors suggest that these trade effects of the European fiscal situation on the U.S. economy are likely to be limited. Although the euro-11 economy is large, it represents only about 15 percent of U.S. exports. In comparison, our single largest trading partner, Canada, accounted for over 19 percent of domestic exports last year. And while the dollar has appreciated almost 18 percent relative to the euro since late November, the broad dollar exchange rate that is a trade-weighted average across all currencies has appreciated only 5.1 percent over the same period.\nNonetheless, if events in Europe evolve so that they have a more severe and broad impact on financial markets, then the scope of the problems for the U.S. could be magnified. Fortunately, our direct exposure to European debt is limited. But an intensification of liquidity or solvency problems in Europe and some related spillover losses in U.S. markets could cause a marked increase in investor risk aversion. More lenders could pull back on intermediation, restricting the flow of credit to fund worthy spending projects of U.S. firms and households.\nTo date, though, this doesn’t seem to have occurred. Notably, the spreads between riskier and safer assets have risen some, but they are still nothing at all like the spreads we observed during the height of the financial panic. But this is a risk to monitor carefully.\nIndeed, recognizing the importance of providing liquidity to stressed financial markets, the Fed recently re-opened currency swaps with the European Central Bank (ECB) and other major central banks. This step seems prudent as the events in Europe have the potential to create dollar funding pressures in world markets. As we did earlier, the Federal Reserve today offers dollars in exchange for foreign currency collateral—at a fixed exchange rate and a penalty rate. In this way foreign central banks can extend dollar liquidity support to creditworthy financial institutions facing temporary liquidity strains in foreign credit markets. To date, these lines have not been tapped much.\nI’d like to conclude at this point, but I hope you’ll recall that the answers to our three questions about future growth, inflation, and the European debt crisis were three-and-a-half, no, and probably not much, but we are being vigilant. Of course, the details behind these short answers are key to understanding how we put the pieces together to create a picture of the economy. I hope I have been able to convey some of that to you today.\nI look forward to your questions.",

            "content": "In the United States, the Federal Reserve is charged with promoting financial conditions that provide for maximum employment and price stability. During normal times, when small to moderate adjustments in policy are appropriate, our primary policy tool has been a market interest rate, the federal funds rate. Indeed, to address just about all of the deviations of employment and inflation from their goal values, a policy of adjusting the short-term market rate—though sometimes by hundreds of basis points— has been sufficient. Of course, in the nearly three years that I have been Chicago Fed president, economic and financial fluctuations have been far from typical. Today, I would like to comment on monetary policy strategies for responding to unusually large risk-events.\nCentral banks must always be on guard against risks that are relatively rare, but have potentially large and disruptive effects. Or, to put it another way: Central banks must always monitor economic conditions for potentially large disruptions in the economic infrastructure. Such disruptions might lead to structural impediments to previously sustainable growth rates, long periods of disinflation, or stagflationary conditions, to name just a few possible negative outcomes. In my discussion, I will take it for granted that inflation scares and loss of central bank credibility must be included on this list of infrastructure disruptions.1\nOne major disruption occurred in the 1970s when the Federal Reserve arguably did not appreciate the persistence of the productivity slowdown and monetary policy unintentionally generated destructive inflationary pressures.2\nOther disruptions have been associated with financial crises. I think of the problem posed by these in the following way. At some point in time, circumstances arise that create large real losses for investors, businesses, and households. These losses are real in the sense that now the current and future production possibility set is smaller or consumption possibilities are more limited. Just to be completely clear, production possibilities may be smaller if everyone’s previous assessments are shown to be exaggerated. And lower expected consumption follows naturally from any decline in permanent income and wealth. For a central bank, with no ability to eliminate these underlying real losses, the challenges in assessing the situation are threefold:\nWill these real losses increase further? How much of the losses are already in train and when will they end?\nWill leverage and zero-sum hedging activities result in concentrations of distress that disrupt systemically important financial intermediation?\nWill these losses and collateral financial consequences negatively impair the economy’s infrastructure, capital stock, and labor force in ways that amplify the effects?\nI think it is safe to say that we have yet to develop realistic macroeconomic models incorporating a rich enough array of financial markets and frictions to provide definitive policy analysis.3 But the history of central banking and most monetary analyses suggest to me the following policy directions to address these three challenges. First, when an economy has accumulated real losses that limit production and consumption possibilities, a central bank cannot eliminate those primary losses with its access to the printing press, even if it is a twenty-first-century printing press.4 Second, however, well-designed lending facilities may be able to mitigate amplification and knock-on effects associated with wholesale increases in the risk aversion of private liquidity-providers. In this way, these programs may limit the effects of these losses on unaware agents and collateral economic sectors. Third, limiting the effects of increased perceptions of liquidity risks may avoid additional destruction of economic infrastructure. However, an important caveat is that central bank actions must strike a balance between reasonable repair and unreasonable liquidity expansions that misdirect activities into unproductive areas, create larger incentive problems, or ultimately fuel inflation scares.\nIt is easy to describe this balancing act, but difficult to draw bright lines. Nevertheless, in my judgment, there can be substantial scope for central bank action in the face of a financial crisis. Here are a few examples.\nIn the U.S. in the early 1930s, there was a string of bank failures that the Fed failed to contain. These hobbled the real economy in a period when firms were heavily dependent on bank lending. Moreover, the effective destruction of bank expertise in underwriting loans and originating credit increased the real cost of credit intermediation, adding to the length and severity of the depression.5 During the recent episode, we also saw something akin to a series of runs—liquidity runs—that multiplied the impact of the initial losses. This time the liquidity runs were not on standard commercial banks. Instead they were on institutions in the “shadow” banking system, especially those that support securitization. This was of great concern because in the U.S., securitization plays a critical role in the ultimate provision of credit to households and nonfinancial businesses.\nThis time, the Fed responded aggressively. We eased access to our ordinary discount window. In a departure from normal practice, the Fed made loans available to financial institutions other than commercial banks. Our programs also supported money market funds and the commercial paper market. And in an effort to revive lending that had been dependent on securitization, we cooperated with the Treasury to lend to purchasers of asset-backed securities.\nIn 2008, the Federal Reserve also cooperated with many foreign central banks to help address liquidity strains. Institutions in other countries also had financed asset purchases—many of them U.S. based—with short-term dollar-denominated borrowing. Some of the same spillovers that had affected U.S. credit markets also pressured these foreign financial firms and put further demands on dollar liquidity in U.S. markets, with possible negative consequences for our economy. Accordingly, the Fed set up dollar-swap facilities with foreign central banks.\nThe Federal Reserve recently reopened these swap lines. This step seems prudent as the dramatic repricing of the sovereign credit risk of some peripheral European countries has the potential to create dollar funding pressures in world markets. As we did earlier, the Federal Reserve today offers dollars in exchange for foreign currency collateral—at a fixed exchange rate and a penalty rate. In this way foreign central banks can extend dollar liquidity support to creditworthy financial institutions facing temporary liquidity strains in foreign credit markets.\nWith respect to many of our lending programs, some have described our actions as taking the place of the private sector while the private sector was incapacitated. In fact, it was a partial and incomplete step in that direction. The central bank’s difficult job is to provide liquidity, without taking on undue credit risk. So, we never went as far as offering funding on the same terms that private institutions previously did in credit markets. Believe me, I heard that often and repeatedly from some of my financial sector contacts! We lent only against higher-quality assets and priced our loans and haircut collateral at what in normal circumstances would have been hefty penalty rates. The exceptions to this were the special assistance offered to specific institutions during the Bear Sterns demise and AIG assistance. In these cases, taking on some credit risk was a necessary cost of preventing further intensification of the financial crisis.\nMy time is running short, but I would like to make just some quick comments on quantitative easing. While the liquidity support we provided the economy was very helpful, it was clearly not enough. Given the huge resource gaps, and low and declining inflation, more monetary accommodation was appropriate. Under any version of the Taylor Rule, the funds rate should have been quite negative during the darkest period of the recession. But policy was constrained by the zero-bound on interest rates. So we increased accommodation by turning to large-scale purchases of long-term assets. We ultimately purchased $1.7 trillion of GSE debt, MBS, and long-term Treasuries. The idea was that significant purchases of these assets would lower term risk premia through a portfolio balance effect. In addition, in the case of MBS, our purchases likely lowered liquidity premia.\nI think the jury is still out on exactly how much additional monetary accommodation these purchases have provided. By some empirical estimates, these purchases decreased term premia on long-term assets somewhere in the 30 to 100 basis point range.6 Although even the smallest effect would be helpful to the economy, I suspect the larger beneficial effects were nonlinear. Back in March 2009, every business contact I spoke with was extremely concerned that the downward spiral might turn into a complete financial meltdown. It may be easy to dismiss that concern today—ex post, sort of like surviving a cancer scare or a sharp pain in your chest—but it was a very real risk at that time. And I think that by announcing unprecedented monetary policy actions during this time, in conjunction with substantial fiscal stimulus, that everyone understood today’s twenty-first-century public policymakers were committed to doing everything in their power to avoid the worst-case events that befell the U.S. economy in the 1930s.\nMy time has undoubtedly expired. So I’ll save any further commentary on exit strategies to the general panel discussion.\nNotes\n1 See Marvin Goodfriend, 1993, “Interest rate policy and the inflation scare problem: 1979–1992,” Economic Quarterly, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Vol. 79, No. 1, Winter, pp. 1–23.\n2 See Athanasios Orphanides, 2002, “Monetary policy rules and the Great Inflation,” American Economic Review, Vol. 92, No. 2, May, pp. 115–120.\n3 See Charles L.

The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) is one example, which directed liquidity to the market for asset-backed securities. That being said, in another way there is little “new” about this avenue for money creation—liquidity injected through programs like the TALF will still show up on the liability side of the central bank’s balance sheet as an increase in high-powered money.\n5 See Ben S.

            "content": "Thank you for that kind introduction. I'm delighted to be back in Bloomington Normal and at Illinois Wesleyan. Certainly, in a University town, this is the time of year when talk of the economy seems most relevant. As we approach graduation day, students tend to focus intently on jobs and careers and perhaps for the first time, they seem especially keen on finding a way to put what they've learned to good and productive use.\nSo, I'm pleased to be here to have the opportunity to explain how I see the economy evolving and to express my views on some of the key issues we face today. At the end of these talks, when I open the floor for discussion, I find myself being asked the same sorts of questions over and over again. So I’d like to address some of those questions in my remarks today and then give you an opportunity to follow up with questions of your own.\nLet me emphasize that the views that I am presenting today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or my other colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nLet’s begin with the question I hear most often: What are the prospects for the economy? In short, the economy is recovering from the recession, and I am optimistic that it will continue to do so. My forecast is that real gross domestic product (GDP) will grow about 3-1/2 percent this year. In fact, we have been hearing many more upbeat business reports, and we recently nudged up our outlook accordingly. But the “for sale” signs posted in yards, empty storefronts, and long waits for job seekers are powerful reminders of how serious the recession was and how far below our potential we still are. We need to experience a good deal of growth before we return to the more normal pace of economic activity and levels of unemployment that we enjoyed in late 2007. And the 3-1/2 percent pace of growth I anticipate is quite moderate given the depth of the recession. To offer some perspective, in the first year and a half following the deep 1981 to 1982 recession, growth averaged nearly 8 percent.\nLet me give you some of the details underlying this assessment of the economy. The recent GDP numbers—the value of overall production of goods and services in the economy—are the broadest indication that the economy is growing again. GDP fell sharply—3.7 percent all told—during 2008 and the first half of 2009. But GDP has increased in each of the past three quarters, with growth averaging a 3.7 percent annual rate.\nWhere did this growth come from? Some of it reflected the federal government stimulus package passed in 2009. This raised economic activity a good deal in the second half of last year, and should be a continued solid boost to spending through much of 2010.\nBut government stimulus is hardly the whole story. Unmistakably, private spending has been reviving. One area is inventory investment by businesses. During the recession, firms aggressively cut inventories to very lean levels. By avoiding an overhang of excess stocks, they are now increasing orders for newly produced goods to meet incoming demand—and we’ve seen manufacturing production increase accordingly. We have also seen an increase in business spending on capital equipment, most notably on high-tech items, as firms replace and upgrade their IT systems and other equipment in order to maintain competiveness and profitability.\nEven consumers have increased spending, although concerns remain about the sustainability of the recent strength. Job worries and losses in household wealth had caused consumers to cut back on spending appreciably during the recession. But they have now begun to reopen their pocketbooks. During the first quarter of 2010 total personal consumption expenditures increased at a 3.6 percent annual rate. Significantly, these increases were distributed across many different types of goods and services. Even in the hard-hit automobile sector, sales have averaged 11.0 million units so far this year—up over 17 percent from a year ago, though still well below the 16.6 million unit pace that prevailed before the recession.\nIn contrast, housing continues to struggle. During the second half of 2009, both sales and new construction lifted off from the recession low points seen around the turn of the year. But sales fell back after the expiration last November of the first round of tax credits for first-time home buyers, and starts have not shown much discernible improvement over the past several months.\nWe currently are seeing a bit of a pickup in housing markets. But this is likely a temporary boost as buyers rush to beat the end-of-April expiration date for the extension of the home buyer tax credits. More fundamentally, supply conditions continue to weigh on real estate markets, and they could for some time as foreclosures add to the overhang of unsold homes. But with the improving economy, low mortgage rates, and more attractively priced homes, housing market conditions will get better as we move further into the expansion.\nWhat about labor markets? In general, many measures of economic activity show improvement early in a recovery well before the jobs picture starts to get better. This was especially true following the two previous recessions. I am concerned that this may be the case during this expansion as well. As the economy entered the most recent recession, businesses quickly cut their work forces. And even as the economy grew during the second half of 2009, job destruction outpaced the extremely low levels of hiring.\nMore recently, there has been a modest improvement in the jobs picture. Over the first four months of the year, excluding temporary hiring for the U.S. Census, on average about 109 thousand jobs per month were added to the economy.\nBusinesses are being cautious about adding permanent staffing. They continue to strive to produce more with fewer people. But they can increase output for only so long without adding to payrolls. As the recovery takes hold and businesses become more confident in the future, employment will increase on a more consistently solid basis.\nIndeed, there are signals that we currently are near such a turning point. There is the pickup in the jobs numbers I just noted. Underlying those recent employment numbers, layoffs are down substantially. Some of those businesses that cut employment most aggressively at the beginning of the recession have begun to rehire. And others who are taking a more wait-and-see attitude are hiring temporary workers to fill their staffing needs. In fact, temporary worker employment has increased solidly in each of the past seven months.\nNonetheless, even after more solid employment gains materialize, unemployment may remain stubbornly high. Discouraged workers will resume searching for jobs, adding to the number of those already looking for work. In addition, the number of long-term unemployed is extremely high, and such workers typically have a more difficult time finding a job. Consequently, the outlook for these workers is challenged. So I anticipate that the rate and length of unemployment will improve relatively slowly.\nWith consumer spending accounting for roughly two-thirds of GDP, the economic forces at work here are key factors underlying the moderate projections for overall growth. Some historical context is helpful. Over the fifteen years or so before the most recent recession, productivity growth had been quite robust. This growth supported solid expansion in asset values and disposable income. Believing these factors would persist, consumers borrowed heavily: Households entered this recession with high net worth but also with low levels of savings and high levels of debt.\nWhen faced with a temporary loss of income, households can maintain spending only by drawing down assets, borrowing more, or reducing savings. But as the recession took hold, households faced mounting job losses, stark reductions in the value of their housing and equity assets, and little in the way of liquid savings. So it is little wonder that consumers sharply retrenched on spending.\nThe need for households to repair their balance sheets will moderate growth in consumer spending going forward. In addition, we are seeing reduced availability of household credit. And, importantly, muted gains in employment will hold back growth in wages and salaries. All of these factors contribute to an outlook for relatively modest growth in consumer spending, which, in turn, restrains the forecast for overall GDP growth.\nIn addition to consumer lending, the availability of bank credit remains a significant headwind for many small- and medium-sized companies. Both supply and demand considerations are at work here. Some of the decline in bank lending last year reflects weak demand for loans by businesses wary of taking on new debt burdens in an uncertain economic environment. But at least some of the reduced lending arises from banks’ tighter lending standards. These tighter standards appear to reflect concerns of banks about their own capital levels and also the credit quality of borrowers. More generally, credit flows are being reduced because both borrowers and lenders are still dealing with losses from the recession, especially the busts in residential and commercial real estate. I expect banking conditions to improve and better support growth, but this is likely to take some time.\nWhile I’ve mentioned a number of factors that we think will dampen growth, we could be surprised on the upside. Increases in confidence could turn into higher spending sooner than we now think. And productivity growth has remained strong. Technology continues to advance, and firms continue to create new products and find new ways to produce more efficiently. These factors will lead to higher incomes in the longer term. And even over the shorter term, the higher profits and incomes generated by productivity can help restructure balance sheets and support spending.\nWell, that was a long answer to a short question. The second question I’m often asked is a two-parter concerning inflation. The first part is: Isn’t inflation about to explode? The second part is: Are you concerned about deflation? The answer is no in both cases: I think inflation will remain relatively stable.\nBoth camps have clear arguments. The current low rates of resource utilization strongly point to lower inflation. At 9.9 percent, the unemployment rate is quite high. Similarly, manufacturing capacity utilization is quite low. Such resource slack reduces cost pressures and makes firms less able to push through price increases. These factors have significantly contributed to lower inflation. The Fed’s preferred measure of core inflation—the deflator for Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE, excluding food and energy—has fallen from 2.7 percent in August 2008 to 1.3 percent in March 2010. That is a large decline for a relatively stable data series.\nThose who press me on higher inflation point to the Fed’s accommodative policy and expanded balance sheet. We all know that too much money chasing too few goods will generate inflation. But, currently, most of the funds used to increase our balance sheet are sitting idly in bank reserves. And because banks are not lending those reserves, they are not yet generating spending pressure. But, of course, leaving the current highly accommodative monetary policy in place for too long would eventually fuel such inflationary pressures.\nWith core inflation at 1-1/4 percent, I see the opposing forces of resource gaps and accommodative monetary policy as roughly balancing out over the medium term. As resource slack abates in a recovering economy, I expect inflation to move up to about 1-3/4 percent by 2012.\nWhat does all of this mean for monetary policy? Currently, policy is, appropriately, very accommodative. But, eventually, we will have to return to a more normal stance. Judging the appropriate timing and pace for reducing accommodation poses a significant challenge for policymakers over the next couple years. On the one hand, removing too much accommodation prematurely could inhibit the recovery. On the other hand, as I noted, if the Fed leaves the current level of accommodation in place too long, inflationary pressures will eventually build. The Fed’s decisions will be based on careful monitoring of business activity and an alert eye out for signs of changes in the inflation outlook. In addition, the FOMC is making sure that it has the technical tools it will need when it decides to reduce monetary accommodation. Overall, I am confident that monetary policy will both support economic growth and bring and keep inflation near my guideline of 2 percent over the medium term.\nAs you can imagine, the crisis and recession have kept us busy. But we have also devoted a good deal of energy reflecting on events of the past several years. This is, in large part, because of the importance of the last question I am regularly asked: What have you at the Federal Reserve learned about how to guard against future financial crises? There are, of course, a number of lessons. I’d like to touch on a couple of them now.\nOne lesson is that responding effectively during times of crisis may require innovative and targeted policy tools. As the crisis unfolded, we lowered our traditional policy tool, the federal funds rate, to zero—as low as it could go. But credit markets remained frozen and macroeconomic conditions were deteriorating. We thus turned to nontraditional tools to clear up the choke points. These included providing liquidity directly to nonbank financial institutions and supporting a number of short-term credit markets. We also purchased longer-duration assets that further reduced long-term interest rates. These nontraditional actions helped us avoid what easily could have been an even more severe economic contraction.\nOf course, in the future it would be best to reduce the chances of facing financial crises in the first place. Until recent events, our approach to preventing financial crises has relied on the microprudential supervision and regulation of individual banks. Since the Great Depression, this approach appeared to suffice, even as our financial system became more dependent on nonbank financial intermediaries, such as broker–dealers, hedge funds, and other institutions beyond the regulatory reach of the Fed and the other banking regulators. Nevertheless, the scale and scope of the past few years’ events have exposed the weaknesses of a bank-by-bank regulatory approach. I believe that an important safeguard will be the creation of a systemic risk regulator charged with monitoring and addressing risk across the wide range of financial institutions.\nSetting up more pre-established systematic risk controls is important as well. As part of these, we need to ensure that no financial institution, bank or nonbank, is “too big to fail.” Many of the unprecedented interventions undertaken by the Fed, the FDIC, and the U.S. Treasury occurred because we lacked alternatives that would have allowed for the orderly unwinding of these large, complex financial institutions. While mechanisms already exist to address large banking failures, we also need an effective process to resolve failing nonbank institutions that limits market disruption and minimize moral hazard. These situations should not be dealt with on an ad hoc basis. The need for an advance plan is imperative.\n I’d like to conclude at this point, but I hope you’ll recall that the answers to our three questions about future growth, inflation, and the financial crisis were three-and-a-half, no, and we’ve learned a lot. Of course, the details behind these short answers are key to understanding how we put the pieces together to create a picture of the economy and the workings of our financial system. I hope I have been able to convey some of that to you today.\nI look forward to your questions.",

            "content": "Thank you for that kind introduction and for making me feel welcome in Hong Kong. Though I've been here only a short time, I find it easy to see why this unique city has become so important to the financial services industry throughout the world. I'd also like to thank Christopher Rogers and the Institute of Regulation & Risk for their kind invitation. It was that invitation that prompted my thinking in putting together this two-week visit to China. I know other Federal Reserve presidents have participated in this event in the past, and I am pleased to add my name to that list and the list of distinguished panelists who have joined us here tonight.\nWe are slowly emerging from the worst financial crisis since the 1930s. The hardships created by these exceptional circumstances for households and businesses are well known. Governments and regulators around the world have responded to the crisis with a variety of aggressive and innovative policy actions, including giving special assistance to specific institutions.\nNow, as we slowly emerge from the crisis, we are engaged in a vigorous debate on how best to address the major weaknesses in our financial regulatory framework that were revealed by the crisis. Our goal, clearly, is to avoid another crisis of this magnitude. Financial reform will not be easy. We face complex problems that will require a comprehensive, multi-pronged approach. But reform is critical for ensuring our long-term economic stability.\nToday, I would like to offer my thoughts on some of the reform proposals that are being discussed. I should note that my remarks reflect my own views and are not those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.\nTo highlight some of the changes that are being considered, there are proposals that would assign monetary policy a more active role in fighting asset bubbles; proposals that would strengthen current microprudential regulations; proposals that would introduce a systemic regulator and macroprudential regulations; and proposals that would create resolution authority – particularly for systemically important financial institutions.\nTime does not permit me to discuss the specifics of each of these proposals today. Instead, I would like to offer my thoughts on some of the challenges we are likely to face in implementing even the most well-thought-out policies.\nLet me be clear. I don’t bring up these potential challenges as roadblocks to the healthy debate that is underway. Rather, I offer them as issues we need to consider as we build a better financial infrastructure.\nOne preemptive action that is being debated concerns the role of monetary policy in combating asset bubbles. Given the rapid rise in some asset prices prior to the recent crisis, there are increasing calls for central banks to be more proactive in responding to signs that an asset bubble may be emerging and to raise their target rates in order to lower asset prices that, by historical standards, seem unusually high. In previous forums, I have discussed why I view these proposals with skepticism.1 I won’t cover the same ground here again. Instead, let me just note that I am skeptical about our ability to easily and definitively sort out in real time whether a rapid increase in asset prices is associated with overvaluation. That is, how confidently can we state that we are in the midst of a bubble? I also think that monetary policy is too blunt a tool for pricking bubbles: It can’t be targeted precisely and it will affect other financial and macroeconomic variables in addition to the suspected bubble asset. In addition, the typical changes in interest rates that a central bank might contemplate are likely to be too small to produce big changes in asset prices.\nFortunately, monetary policy is not the only tool that policymakers have to deal with financial exuberance. In my view, redesigning regulations and improving market infrastructure offer more promising paths. Regulation may or may not be sufficient to avoid all of the events that create crises, but it should go a long way toward doing so. Better supervision and a sound regulatory infrastructure can also increase the resiliency of markets and institutions and their ability to withstand adverse shocks that do occur.\nHow do we promote such resiliency?\nWithin the existing structure, regulators have the ability to promote better, more resilient financial markets, either through rule-making or by serving as a coordinator of private initiatives. They can also encourage more and better disclosure of information—a key element of effective risk management. A number of initiatives along these lines have been taken and additional ones are being considered.2\nWe can use existing regulatory tools more effectively, but we also need to address the shortcomings of current regulations. The ongoing work of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision regarding the possible introduction of liquidity standards and adjustments to the existing capital requirements are examples of such efforts.\nWhile such enhancements to micro-prudential regulations are necessary, I would argue that they are not close to being sufficient to address the complex issues we faced during the recent crisis. Success in preventing and controlling potential risks requires very early and courageous action by policymakers. Typically, risks and problems in the financial system build over a number of years. There is an awful amount of uncertainty as to whether risks are developing; how they will be perpetuated; and when to take action. Microprudential regulations alone are not likely to resolve these issues.\nLet me illustrate the sort of problems a microprudential regulator faces with a specific example. As you know, the problems with residential mortgages, particularly with subprime mortgages, were one of the key areas that precipitated the current crisis. Currently, the U.S. financial system faces problems with commercial real estate (CRE) loans. At the end of 2009, depository institutions in the U.S. held over $1.5 trillion in commercial real estate and construction loans on their books. In addition, there are currently nearly $800 billion in commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) outstanding. Over the past two years, delinquencies on these loans and securities have been rising at an uncomfortably rapid rate.  Figure. 1 Of the over $1 trillion in commercial real estate loans held by depository institutions today, nearly 4 percent are noncurrent.3 This ratio was about 0.5 percent before the crisis (June 2007). The picture is even worse for the riskier construction and land development loans. While these loans total less than $0.5 trillion, the noncurrent portion had risen from 1.5 percent at the end of June 2007 to nearly 16 percent by the end of last quarter. For CRE loans packaged into securities, serious delinquencies represent 4 percent of all CMBS currently outstanding, up from nearly zero before the crisis.\nDoes such a fast rise in CRE and CMBS delinquencies mean that bank examiners missed clear signs of forthcoming problems and failed to take action? Commercial real estate loans are a key problem area for the banks in my District. I went to my supervisory staff and said: “I know you are struggling with commercial real estate loan portfolios. What are the difficulties? What do you think we needed to have done in the past in order to avoid the current problems?”\nI have to admit that their response made me pause. They said “You know, Charlie, if we wanted to avoid the current situation, we needed to act very, very early – probably in 2004 or 2005.” That is a full two to three years before the onset of problems in the sector. Clearly, we needed to act very early. But at that time, it would have been difficult to argue convincingly in favor of reigning in this lending. The economy was coming out of the jobless recovery and just beginning to gain traction. And the banking industry had proven it could maintain profits through a recession, it had reduced problem loans back to historically low levels, and it appeared to have more than sufficient capital to cushion against potential losses.4\nGiven previous problems with commercial real estate loans, my supervisors understood the potential risks. Here is a typical situation they faced. Imagine you are an examiner and you go out to review a large financial institution in 2005. The institution is warehousing commercial real estate loans prior to securitization during a period when CMBS issuance is just taking off and, for every $1,000 in CRE loans, only $6 are noncurrent. Nonetheless, as an examiner, you have a discussion with the bank managers and you learn about their lending practices, and you kind of wonder, “How well-controlled is all of this?”\nThe loan officers will give you some very good arguments about what their business is and how the risks are being controlled. First, they are not really storing the loans on their books. They are underwriting the loans with the full intention of packaging them into securities. They have to build up a critical mass before securitization, but they are not going to keep the loans.\nFrom the banks’ perspective, they are not in the storage business. They are in the transportation business. It is rather short term – 60, 90 days. Presumably, the risk is only proportional to how long they are holding on to it – which is not very long. Furthermore, during this period, real estate prices are going up, delinquencies are negligible, and banks have a variety of hedges in place. They look at commercial real estate prices and think, if needed, they can get out of their portfolio at little cost. And even if some losses materialize, they have adequate capital.\nI have some interesting people on my staff who can push back in a pretty challenging fashion. But at the end of the day, after carefully considering the banks’ arguments, they think: “All right, I guess the loan officers are looking at this pretty reasonably and are protecting their institution.” And the risk to the deposit insurance fund from all this activity seems pretty small. So, you end up being convinced that the activity is probably OK.\nToday, with hindsight, we know that while most of the micro risks appeared very small at the time, their sum was far less than the macro risk that was silently building up. That’s the key thing: A collection of negligible micro risks can add up to a far greater macro risk. Focusing on individual institutions and controlling risks on a firm-by-firm basis are not enough for detecting and controlling systemwide stress points.\nThat is why we need macroprudential supervision and regulation.\nSuppose for a particular class of assets, values decline on an economy-wide basis. This means losses are going to be taken at the macro level. Perhaps managers at a few individual banks can be smart, foresee the price declines, and liquidate their positions in time to avoid large losses at their institution. But the macro economy has to take these losses, and that’s where we get stuck. Not everyone can get through the exit door at once; someone has to end up bearing the macro losses.\nThis is why macroprudential regulations that aim to assess and control systemwide risks should play a critical role in our regulatory structure.\nFor instance, dynamic capital requirements and loan loss provisions that vary over the cycle can temper some of the boom–bust trends we have seen in the past. History shows that during boom times, when financial institutions are perhaps in an exuberant state, they may not price risks fully in their underwriting and risk-management decisions. During downturns, faced with eroding capital cushions, increased uncertainty, and binding capital constraints, some institutions may become overcautious and excessively tighten lending standards. Both behaviors tend to amplify the business cycle. Varying required capital loan loss provisions over the cycle could serve to offset some of this volatility.\nWe saw the advantages of a systemic, macroprudential approach firsthand during the implementation of the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) – the so-called “stress tests.” Last spring, the Federal Reserve led a coordinated examination of the largest 19 U.S. banks. We reviewed the institutions simultaneously, applying a common set of assumptions and scenarios across all of them. Such an approach provided us with a view of these banks in their totality, as well as the financial condition of individual institutions on a stand-alone basis. The horizontal view was essential in assessing how risks taken individually by each bank are correlated and how they can add up to more than the sum of individual components. The review also had a forward-looking element that assessed the likely condition of the banks under a specific set of adverse economic conditions and determined the amount of capital the banks would need under these “stress” conditions. Such procedures also enable supervisors to identify best practices in risk management and to push banks with weak controls to improve and adopt these industry best practices. Indeed, supervisors at the Federal Reserve have already begun to adopt such an approach.\nHowever, even with such macroprudential strategies, we are going to face challenges. Let’s think about what, as a hypothetical macroprudential regulator, we would have to do. What should be the early call focus? What should we be looking at? When should we be looking at it? How confident are we that that we are actually going to be able to identify the problem? A macroprudential regulator is confronted with the same type of questions a microprudential regulator faces, but at a systemwide level.  \nConsider these questions within the context of commercial real estate. The facts are, today, CMBS and CRE loans have large delinquencies. Could anyone have made this call confidently in time to arrest the problems we face today?\nOn this slide Figure. 2, on the top panel, you see that the outstanding volume of CMBS ramps up in 2004, 2005. At the same time, commercial real estate prices (shown in the middle panel) continue to rise well into 2007. On the bottom panel, we see the performance of loans originated during this period, depending on when the loans were made. Loans originated later in the credit cycle are performing worse than older loans. For instance, loans underwritten in 2005 did not reach a 1 percent delinquency rate until about 42 months (3.5 years) after origination. In contrast, loans made in 2008 reached the 1 percent delinquency mark only six months after origination. The progressively worsening performance of loans originated later in the credit cycle is likely due to looser underwriting standards that supported the issuance boom.\nWith the benefit of hindsight, I can point to the inflection point in volume and say “I should have put my finger on that right then.”\nAt that point in the credit cycle, “shouting” would have been an important part of risk-control, as it would have emphasized potential risks to the market players.\nBut I can’t imagine that supervisors’ concerns would have been taken seriously in 2005 or 2006 -- even if they started going out and shouting to the heavens that there is a big, big problem and we need to do more about it. Recall that, at that time, real estate prices were ramping up and delinquencies were low. Indeed, in 2007, the Federal Reserve, along with other bank regulators, issued a supervisory guidance on concentrations in commercial real estate. 5 We also gave a number of speeches prior to the crisis about risk pricing and about market exuberance – to little avail. These warnings were largely ignored and we got a lot of push-back from banks. During boom periods when risks are silently building up, there are a lot of people with a lot of money at stake who will come out against such pronouncements. So, if policymakers do not follow words with actions, then we are not likely to make much progress. Shouting and supervision – together – are essential.\nI raised some potential issues with both micro- and macro-prudential regulations.\nHow do we address these issues? This is where we would take full advantage of our multi-pronged approach to regulatory reform. If we are not certain that a particular approach may not be as effective as we would like, we can put more pressure on other levers to obtain a desired amount of risk control. So, if we think that macroprudential regulations may have some potential operational issues, we would need to implement more stringent capital and liquidity requirements than we would otherwise to overcome these issues.\nThis is why we need a multi-pronged approach to a robust regulatory structure: a structure that takes full advantage of the existing tools supervisors have ; a structure that supplements the existing one with dynamic capital requirements and a comprehensive approach to risk management ; a structure that includes a macroprudential supervisor than can monitor and assess incipient risks across institutions and markets and, when necessary, impose higher regulatory requirements on firms that pose systemic risks.\nHowever, even with such a structure, it would be hubris on the part of policymakers to assume that we would be able to prevent financial stress at all financial institutions. Therefore, we also need to contain the disruptive spillovers that result from the failure of systemically important institutions without resorting to bailouts or ad hoc rescues. A necessary element of this is having a mechanism for resolving the failure of a systemically important institution.6 This is something we currently lack in many cases, though there are proposals now under discussion that would provide this resolution power.\nAnother issue that arises in the regulatory reform debate is whether the central bank should be entrusted with supervision and regulation responsibilities. There are many synergies between monetary policy and supervision and regulation that I and others have discussed in previous speeches.7 Let me point out a couple of reasons why it might be optimal for a central bank to have a key role in financial stability and regulation.\nThe reality is that central banks have the unique ability to act as the lender-of-last-resort during financial crises. The central bank cannot use this tool effectively if it is not knowledgeable about the financial condition of the institutions it might lend to, particularly if such loans need to be made at very short notice.\nThe lender-of-last-resort role inevitably thrusts the central bank into efforts to promote financial stability and avoid crises. If, however, central banks have no supervision and regulation tools, they are constrained to act with the only tool at their disposal – monetary policy.\nI already mentioned that I am skeptical about using monetary policy to control financial exuberance. But without supervisory powers, there may be no choice. We know that time consistency issues can lead a central bank to choose inflationary outcomes in the short run, even though there is no long-run tradeoff between output growth and price stability. Ken Rogoff pointed out that one way to deal with this issue would be to appoint a conservative central banker who would be tougher than the public. This would ensure that appropriate decisions would be made and appropriate actions would be taken\nNow, consider the reaction function of a central banker that has the additional responsibility for financial stability – but not the additional tools provided by a supervision and regulation role. Such a central banker might have to act against exuberance in financial markets more actively than it would otherwise. That would be entirely necessary and appropriate to preserve financial stability. However, that policy may not be the most appropriate one at that time for addressing the traditional goals of monetary policy of maximum sustainable employment and price stability. A central bank with three goals and only one lever is a recipe for producing some difficult policy dilemmas.\nTo sum up, it is clear that, in order to avoid a situation like the one we have faced in the past two years, we need to fortify our regulatory lines of defense. We need to change the rules of regulation to be more efficient and effective in their design and implementation. But we also need to openly acknowledge the challenges policymakers and regulators are likely to face in containing potential financial crises. Despite all the challenges, I believe that we can design a more effective regulatory structure through discussions such as the one we are having today.\nThank you. \nNotes\n1 For instance, see Evans (2009a and 2009b).\n2 For instance, in recent years, regulators have actively supported the development of the Trade Information Warehouse (a central repository for trade reporting of over-the-counter credit derivatives contracts) and clearing houses for credit default swaps, such as ICE Trust.\n3 Noncurrent loans are those that are 90 days or more past due plus loans in nonaccrual status.\n4 At the end of 2004, return on equity at all commercial banks in the U.S. was 13.08 percent, near its historical peak of 16.23 percent in the second quarter of 1993. Return on assets were similarly high, and net charge-offs accounted for only 0.68 percent of total loans, well below 1.31 percent reached at the end of 2001.\n5 See, “SR 07-1 Interagency Guidance on Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate” available online. More recently, the Federal Reserve issued a supervisory guidance on managing interest rate risk (“SR 10-1 Interagency Advice on Interest Rate Risk,” available online) and highlighted it in speeches (for instance, see Kohn (2010)). In addition, the Federal Reserve – along with the other Federal banking agencies – issued a policy statement on funding and liquidity risk management on March 17, 2010 (available online).\n6 See Evans (2009c) for my views on the advantages of resolution authority and the issues it would address.\n7 For instance, see Bernanke (2010), Evans (2010), Kashyap (2010), and Volcker (2010).\nReferences\nBernanke, Ben S., 2010, The Federal Reserve’s Role in Bank Supervision, Testimony before the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services, Washington, DC, March 17.\nEvans, Charles L., 2009a. “The International Financial Crisis: Asset Price Exuberance and Macroprudential Regulation.” Remarks given at the 2009 International Banking Conference on September 24, 2009 in Chicago, IL.

            "content": "Good morning. It is a pleasure to be with you today. This year’s conference, and the topics being discussed, are of great importance to us all—economists, regulators, market participants and policymakers. We share a common interest in fostering the economic recovery and a return to strong growth in an environment of low and stable inflation. Conferences such as this one bring together diverse perspectives that will help in devising solutions to achieve these goals.\nToday I would like to discuss a few challenging issues that the labor market presents for monetary policymaking. For a bit of context, let me say that I approach this from not just the perspective of a Fed bank president, but also of a macroeconomist and former Fed research director. I’ve had the benefit of attending FOMC meetings since 1995. I have observed firsthand some of the conflicts that FOMC members face in addressing the Fed’s dual mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability even in more normal times. For me, price stability is 2 percent inflation as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) deflator over the medium term. When I became Chicago Fed president in 2007, I never would have guessed that my first 2-1/2 years would have me voting continually for lower interest rates and more policy accommodation. But with the unemployment rate at 9.7 percent and inflation significantly under my benchmark for price stability, there is no conflict between our policy goals, and so the directions for policy have been clear. Today, I will highlight a number of labor market issues that lead me to think this accommodation will likely be appropriate for some time.\nLet me emphasize that the views that I am presenting today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or my other colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nI find myself in broad agreement with the view that restrictive bank credit, along with business and household caution, will continue to restrain the recovery’s strength but that these headwinds will abate as we move through 2010. Most business cycle indicators have turned favorable already. Yet many households and businesses remain wary that a full-fledged recovery is in train. That is not surprising. As we all know, employment is often the last piece of the puzzle to fall into place, and until the economy begins to add jobs in significant numbers, for many it will not feel like much of a recovery.\nThe latest reports on this front have been mixed. Layoffs are subsiding. Firms are hiring more temporary workers, and after a large decline, the average workweek is showing signs of stabilizing and perhaps reversing course. These developments usually are precursors of a broader scale recovery in labor demand. But, today, employers remain cautious. Job openings are still scarce, and there are few signs, even anecdotally, that permanent hiring has picked up yet. Moreover, even once labor markets turn the corner, there is a long ways to go before they get back to what we would consider to be normal.\nThe ongoing weakness in labor markets—and memories of the jobless recoveries from the previous two recessions—have raised concerns that something has fundamentally changed in the way labor markets work. Some worry that they have deteriorated more than would be expected given the declines in output during the recession and, in turn, this additional weakness might impinge on the speed of the recovery moving forward.\nHeadline unemployment numbers are consistent with the recession\nThe usual starting point for thinking about this issue is Okun’s famous “law” relating gross domestic product (GDP) growth to the change in the unemployment rate. The usual estimates of Okun’s law imply that the unemployment rate should be at least a percentage point lower than the 9.7 percent we actually saw last Friday.\nHowever, this calculation assumes that the association between economic activity and the unemployment rate does not vary across the business cycle. In fact, many employment indicators tend to deteriorate faster during recessions than they improve during expansions. A simple statistical model that uses the historical relationship between GDP growth and unemployment estimated only during recessions can actually account for the sharp rise in the unemployment rate. Figure 1 compares the actual unemployment numbers (the blue line) to their predicted values from models estimated using GDP data only from recessions (the red line). The two lines are just about spot on. But the green line—the prediction from a standard model that does not distinguish between behavior in expansions and recessions—is not capable of capturing the current numbers. Similar “recession-only” models can also explain the rise in broader measures of unemployment and “underemployment” like the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ U-6 rate, as well as the declines in payroll employment.1\nBased on these exercises, I think that it is reasonable to conclude that the unemployment rate and employment growth have evolved about as we would expect given the severity of this recession.\nBut other labor market measures are weaker than expected\nOnce you look past the headline numbers, however, some other labor market indicators are unusually weak. In particular, the share of adults who are outside the labor force has increased more, and the average length of a spell of unemployment has grown much longer than predicted by even our “recession-only” models.\nI would like to spend some time elaborating on the implications of the increase in unemployment duration. Much of this material will be appearing in a forthcoming article by my colleagues at the Chicago Fed, Dan Aaronson, Bhash Mazumder, and Shani Schechter. The consequences of long-term unemployment on households can be quite severe. Such households, especially those with little or no wealth, are susceptible to sharp falls in consumption. Moreover, long-term unemployment often leads to a significant loss in permanent earnings even after the worker finds a new job.\nUnemployment duration has risen at an unprecedented rate over the past year or so. In February, over 40 percent of the unemployed were in the midst of a spell lasting more than six months, by far the highest proportion in the post-World War II era.\nYou can see this in Figure 2, which plots from 1948 to the present the relationship between the unemployment rate (x-axis) and the average length of an ongoing spell of unemployment (y-axis). The red dots represent the monthly figures for 2008 and 2009. At the beginning of the recession, the unemployment rate was at 5 percent and the average unemployment duration was about 17 weeks. Duration was already about 4 weeks more than what would be predicted based on the average historical relationship, represented by the black regression line, between the two measures. This divergence is largely accounted for by a secular shift toward longer spells of unemployment due to the aging of the work force and the much stronger labor force attachment of women.\nIn the first 15 months of the recession, average duration increased with unemployment at roughly the rate you would have expected. This is indicated by the series of red dots that fall along the top of the blue cloud and are parallel to the black line. But since the first quarter of 2009, average duration has increased much more rapidly than the rise in the unemployment rate would predict.\nThe extension of unemployment insurance benefits, while helpful in supporting unemployed households, likely accounts for a portion of the recent rise in unemployment duration.2 Even so, we view the overall magnitude of the increase as an indicator that labor market conditions are even bleaker than the unemployment rate alone suggests. This weakness may also explain why the share of those outside the labor force has also grown so much—many people have simply stopped searching for jobs given the lack of demand for their services at prevailing wages.\nImplications of rising long-term unemployment on the outlook\nThe rise in long-term unemployment may have ramifications for the economy going forward. The likelihood of finding a job tends to decline as an individual remains out of work for a longer period. Partly this reflects the fact that those who typically have a difficult time finding work will tend to be unemployed longer. In this case, longer spells are a symptom rather than the source of an underlying problem. However, a long unemployment spell could itself cause deterioration in a worker’s skills, leaving some of the long-term unemployed with less bright job prospects even as the economy begins to revive.  This could contribute to high average unemployment duration for some time.\nWe can gain some insight into this dynamic from earlier periods. Figure 3 highlights the path of the unemployment rate and duration during the last two severe recessions. As you’d expect, both measures rise in tandem during the recession. But during the recovery phase, unemployment duration remains persistently high for quite some time even as the unemployment rate declines. We expect to see a similar pattern in the near future. And as I noted earlier, long-term unemployment tends to lead to permanent earnings losses, particularly for those who have previously invested heavily in job- or industry-specific skills. So, high unemployment durations could have long-lasting effects on consumer confidence and demand.\nTo summarize this discussion of the labor market, headline employment indicators appear to be roughly following a conventional track given the severity of the recession. But these measures may not fully capture the weakness displayed in the rising unemployment duration and the withdrawal of workers from the labor force. These developments thus raise the risk that the recovery in labor markets could be slow even as output returns to a well-established growth path.\nProductivity and resource slack\nThe other side of an economy experiencing growing output but low labor utilization is high productivity growth. Indeed, productivity has been quite strong of late, particularly over the past three quarters. This is often the case in the early stages of a recovery, as firms first meet higher demand for their products and services without expanding their work force.\nA key question today is the degree to which the recent productivity surge reflects a temporary cyclical development or a more enduring increase in the level or trend rate of productivity. If the gains are predominantly driven by intense cost cutting, then they may be unsustainable once demand revives more persistently. In this case, we would expect hiring to pick up quickly as the economic expansion takes hold. However, if the level or trend in productivity has risen due to technological or other improvements, then higher average productivity gains will continue.  In this case, the implications for hiring are not clear. Higher levels of productivity will show through in both higher potential and actual output for the economy, and so need not necessarily come at the cost of lower labor input.\nThe relative importance of these factors also has consequences for our assessment of the degree to which resource slack exists in the economy. Since a higher level or trend of productivity implies a higher path for potential output, a given level of actual GDP would also be associated with a greater degree of economic slack. That is, the good news on productivity, if sustained, suggests that as of today we have a larger output gap to fill In contrast, some are skeptical that the economy really is operating far below sustainable levels. They argue that much of the drop in output during the recession was the result of a permanent reduction in the economy’s productive capacity, perhaps because certain financial market practices that had for a time enabled additional investments have now been discredited. According to this view, the strong productivity growth of recent quarters only goes a fraction of the way toward offsetting this decline in the level of potential output.\nOf course, the unemployment rate gives us another way to infer the degree of slack in the economy. My earlier discussion of the sharp rise in unemployment duration and decline in labor force attachment may lead one to think that slack is even greater than what is implied by the unemployment rate itself.\nHowever, it is possible that longer durations and lower labor force attachment could reflect broader structural changes in the economy, such as a mismatch between the skills of the unemployed and those demanded by employers. There may also be other impediments that currently prevent workers from shifting to the industries or locations where jobs are available. Under these scenarios, labor market slack might actually be lower than what one might infer from the unemployment rate alone.\nI have just given you 2 minutes of classic two-handed economist speak. In the final analysis, however, the sheer magnitude of unemployment today is so large that there is little doubt in my mind that there is considerable slack in the economy. Incorporating alternative views about productivity and labor market behavior do not alter this general conclusion. The debate really boils down to whether the amount of slack in the economy is large or is extremely large.\nShould the Fed have done more?\nGiven this large degree of slack, there is a legitimate question of whether monetary policy could, and more fundamentally should, have done more to combat the deterioration in labor markets. As we all know, a lot was done. As the crisis arose, we first used our traditional tools, substantially cutting the federal funds rate and lending to banks through our discount window. As we neared a zero funds rate, we turned to nontraditional tools to clear up the choke points, providing liquidity directly to nonbank financial institutions and supporting a number of short-term credit markets. Finally, we reduced long-term interest rates further by purchasing additional medium- and long-term Treasury bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and the debt of government-sponsored enterprises.\nThese nontraditional actions helped us avoid what easily could have been an even more severe economic contraction. But the unemployment rate still hit 10 percent this fall.\nHad we done more, the most plausible action would have been to expand our Large Scale Asset Purchases (LSAP) program. Precisely quantifying the effect this would have had is difficult. A good place to start, though, is to look at the recent empirical evidence.3 When significant new asset purchases were announced, our big, fluid financial markets built that information immediately into asset prices. For example, right after the March 2009 Treasury purchase announcement, ten-year Treasury yields fell about 50 basis points. Comparable declines occurred in Option Adjusted Spreads (OAS) on the announcement of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) purchases in November 2008. It might be reasonable to infer that say, doubling the size of the LSAPs might have doubled this impact on rates.\nHowever, I would attach more than the usual amount of uncertainty to such an inference. Part of my hesitation reflects our lack of understanding about the interactions between nontraditional monetary policy, interest rates, and economic activity. While research efforts at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere to assess the effects of nonstandard monetary policy have been ramped up considerably, to date we do not have a robust suite of formal models to reliably calibrate interventions of this sort.\nMoreover, there are reasons to expect that the impact of recent nontraditional policy actions might not have scaled up so simply. We initially responded to the financial crisis with our highest-value tool—a reduction in the funds rate—and then moved to our best alternative policies as interest rates approached zero. Finally, we turned to the LSAPs, which were designed to further lower long-term interest rates and thus stimulate demand for interest-sensitive spending, such as business fixed investment, housing, and durables goods expenditures. But the influence of lower rates on private sector decision-making may have reached the point of second-order importance relative to the countervailing forces of the housing overhang, business and household caution, and considerably tighter lending standards.\nMoreover, although it is impossible to quantify, a portion of the impact of our nontraditional actions may have come simply from boosting confidence. In those very dark times, I believe households, businesses, and financial markets were reassured that policymakers were acting in a decisive manner. Further asset purchases would not have had an additional effect of this kind.\nIn addition, on a practical level, the portfolio of future purchases likely would have looked different and therefore their overall effectiveness might have deviated from our recent experience. The Fed’s typical monthly purchases of new issuance MBS were so large that it left very little floating supply for private investors. This could have forced a larger LSAP program to concentrate more heavily in Treasuries or existing MBS. Though the empirical evidence is limited, these assets likely are less close substitutes than new MBS for many of the instruments used to finance spending on new capital goods, housing, and consumer durables. Consequently, the effect of their purchase on economic activity may be less.\nFinally, we must also keep in mind that more monetary stimulus also has costs. These could be considerable at higher LSAP levels. Many are already worried about the inflation implications of the Fed’s expanded balance sheet and the associated large increase in the monetary base. Currently, most of the increase in the monetary base is sitting idly in bank reserves—and because banks are not lending those reserves, they are not generating spending pressure. But leaving the current highly accommodative monetary policy in place for too long would eventually fuel inflationary pressures. Likewise, if the monetary base was expanded much beyond where we are today, the risk that such pressures would build as the economy recovers would be significantly increased. Furthermore, policymakers already face the task of unwinding a sizable balance sheet at the appropriate time and pace. Substantially increasing the size of asset purchases could have further complicated the exit process down the road.\nThat said, changes in economic conditions could alter the cost–benefit calculus with regard to the LSAP. Hopefully the recovery will progress without any serious bumps in the road and the inflation outlook will remain benign. But, as we have repeatedly indicated in the FOMC statements, the Committee will continue to evaluate its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.\nNotes\n1 For further details, see Aaronson, Brave, and Schechter (2009).\n2 Aaronson, Mazumder, and Schechter (2010) apply estimates from Katz and Meyer (1990) and Card and Levine (2000) of the elasticity of increases in the maximum eligibility time for unemployment insurance benefits on the duration of unemployment to the current context.

Some caution should be applied to these estimates, since they rely on strong assumptions.\n3 See Sack (2009) as well.\nReferences\nAaronson, Daniel, Scott Brave, and Shani Schechter, 2009, “How Does Labor Adjustment in this Recession Compare to the Past,” Chicago Fed Letter, June.\nAaronson, Daniel, Bhashkar Mazumder, and Shani Schecter, 2010, “An Analysis of the Rise in Long-Term Unemployment”, forthcoming, Economic Perspectives.\nCard David and Phillip B.

            "content": "Thank you for that warm introduction.  It’s just over two years since I became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and I am reminded that one of my first public speaking engagements was to this group in February of 2008.  You'll recall that my remarks that day were made as the world financial crisis was in its early stages. In fact I spoke to you just before the collapse of Bear Stearns in mid-March.\nSo much has happened since then, not the least of which is the fact that the crisis and the actions of the Federal Reserve in helping to resolve it have become a staple for the news media worldwide. In fact, it's almost impossible to read a newspaper or watch television without hearing something about the Fed, the economy, and the financial crisis.  \nAs I have travelled around the country making speeches over the past few months, I find myself being asked the same three questions over and over again. So for my prepared remarks today, I’d like to address those big questions about the economy. Afterwards, I’ll also give you an opportunity to ask some questions of your own.\nLet me emphasize that the views that I am presenting today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or my other colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nLet’s begin with the question I am asked more frequently than any other: Is the recession really over? In a narrow, technical sense, the short answer is yes. Many broad indicators of economic activity are increasing as we would expect in the early stages of a recovery. Nonetheless, I keep hearing the question because many households and businesses do not yet feel like they are in much of a recovery. Unemployment remains very high, and many businesses are still producing and selling much less than they did two years ago. What people really want to know is when will we make significant progress in returning unemployment and other measures of economic health to more normal levels? We appear to be moving in that direction, but there is much work to be done.\nLet me elaborate a little on those points. Although 2009 started as a very weak year, it finished well. Real gross domestic product (GDP), our broadest measure of economic output, increased at a 4.1 percent rate in the second half of last year. A portion of this improvement reflects the effects of government stimulus spending. But private demand is beginning to firm up as well. For example, in the automobile industry, which was hit especially hard by the recession, sales have held up in recent months even after the cash-for-clunkers program ended. In other industries, many firms that cut production and inventories very aggressively during the recession are now dialing back their inventory liquidation. On balance, the latest data on manufacturers’ orders have been more positive, both for materials and parts and for capital equipment. Demand from abroad is also increasing; in particular, the emerging-market economies are showing renewed vigor that should benefit U.S. exporters.\nIn the housing market, the news has been mixed. Sales of new homes and housing starts stopped falling early last year and have been bouncing along without much of a trend over the past several months. Sales of existing homes increased a good deal through most of 2009, but much of the gain was retraced around the turn of the year. Subsidies for first-time home buyers have contributed to the ups and downs in the data, and we have yet to see how well the housing market will hold up once they ultimately expire. However, the declines in home prices that earlier precipitated the financial crisis are now attracting buyers, and so are low mortgage rates. Sadly, many of these sales are for foreclosed homes, but at least they are now moving on the market. Last year's sales and the low level of starts have substantially helped to reduce the overhang of unsold homes, which should help set the stage for a gradual recovery in residential construction.\nMost forecasters also expect only a gradual recovery in consumer spending. In part, this is because the drop in home prices and the fall in the stock market during the height of the crisis reduced household wealth. It’s also because the availability of household credit has tightened. In addition, the unemployment rate currently is at 9.7 percent. For states in the Federal Reserve’s Seventh District, unemployment was 11 percent in December. With such a depressed labor market, workers are seeing little growth in wages and salaries. So, with credit tight and households needing to repair their balance sheets, consumer spending will gain momentum only as people get back to work.\nEmployment is often the last piece of the puzzle to fall into place during a recovery. This will certainly be true this time. Many businesses slashed payrolls during the recession, and going forward, many are hoping to keep staffing levels lean. Indeed, even though output was increasing, employment still fell substantially during the second half of 2009. Toward the end of the year, however, the pace of job loss moderated significantly. Some of the businesses that cut their payrolls most deeply during the recession have begun to rehire workers. Others have accommodated recent increases in demand by hiring temporary workers. This is just the first stage of the recovery process. Most employers are very cautious about hiring at this time, given the uncertainty over the pace of the recovery. But I think that many businesses already are finding they can take lean production only so far. These firms should be ready to expand permanent hiring once they see clearer signs of sustained increases in demand.\nThe picture with regard to financing conditions is complex to say the least. On the plus side, more and more financial markets are functioning well without the need for ongoing government support. As a result, large firms are able to borrow at reasonable spreads, both short term in commercial paper markets and long term in corporate bond markets. On the down side, the availability of bank credit remains a significant headwind for many small- and medium-sized companies. Some of the decline in bank lending that we saw last year reflects weak demand for loans by businesses wary of taking on new debt burdens in an uncertain economic environment. But at least some of the reduced lending arises from banks’ tighter lending standards. These tighter standards, in turn, appear to reflect banks’ concern over their capital levels and also the credit quality of borrows. More generally, credit flows are being reduced because both borrowers and lenders are still dealing with losses from the recession, especially the busts in residential and commercial real estate. I expect banking conditions to improve, but this is likely to take some time.\nLooking ahead, I anticipate that restrictive bank credit, along with business and household caution, will continue to restrain the recovery’s strength. Nevertheless I expect these dampening influences to abate as we move through 2010. We at the Chicago Fed expect GDP growth to average 3 to 3-1/2 percent in 2010. Such growth is only slightly above our estimate of the economy’s potential growth rate, which means unemployment will likely decline only modestly in 2010.\nOf course, the recovery could exceed these expectations. The growth we’re expecting is modest for a recovery following a deep recession, which is typically followed by a sharp increase in economic activity. For example, GDP growth in the year and a half following the recession of 1981 and 1982 averaged about 8 percent. While that’s not the case now, some of the recent data have been better than expected. Increases in confidence could turn into higher spending sooner than we think. And an important longer-term factor is that productivity growth has remained strong. Technology continues to advance, and firms continue to create new products and find new ways to produce more efficiently. Such productivity gains will result in higher incomes and improving standards of living over the longer term.\nWell, that was a long answer to a short question about the recovery. The second question I’m often asked comes in two versions. The first version is: Isn’t inflation about to go through the roof? The second version is: Isn’t inflation about to fall further—aren’t we looking at deflation? The answer is no in both cases: I think inflation will remain relatively stable. But the fact that I get these completely different questions highlights the degree of uncertainty currently underlying the inflation outlook. Surveys of consumer inflation expectations, professional forecasters’ projections, and the implied inflation forecasts from the market for Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities all see inflation running close to current rates over the medium term. But these stable inflation expectations balance out some important crosscurrents. I’m reminded of the old joke that says if you put two economists in a room you’ll get at least three opinions. Well, that’s especially true now.\nThe current low rates of resource utilization strongly point to lower inflation. The 9.7 percent unemployment rate and the still very low rates of manufacturing capacity utilization are factors that reduce cost pressures and make firms less able to push through price increases. In fact, these factors have significantly contributed to a recent decline in inflation. The Fed’s preferred measure of core inflation—the deflator for Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE, excluding food and energy—has fallen from 2.7 percent in August 2008 to 1.4 percent in January 2010. That is a large decline for a relatively slow moving data series.\nThe people who press me on higher inflation point to the Fed’s expanded balance sheet and the associated large increase in what economists call the monetary base. We all know that too much money chasing too few goods will generate inflation. But, currently, most of the increase in the monetary base is sitting idly in bank reserves—and because banks are not lending those reserves, they are not generating spending pressure. Of course, leaving the current highly accommodative monetary policy in place for too long would eventually fuel inflationary pressures.\nWith core inflation at 1-1/2 percent, we see the opposing forces of resource gaps and accommodative monetary policy as roughly balancing out over the medium term. Resource slack could result in core PCE inflation coming down a bit more in 2010 and 2011. As resource slack abates in a recovering economy, I expect inflation to move up to about 1-3/4 percent in 2012.\nTo achieve this outlook, monetary policy cannot be passive. A large challenge facing policymakers over the next couple of years will be judging the appropriate timing and pace for reducing accommodation. On the one hand, removing too much accommodation prematurely could choke off the recovery. On the other hand, as I noted, if the Fed leaves the current level of accommodation in place too long, inflationary pressures will eventually build. The Fed is preparing for these decisions by carefully monitoring business activity and remaining alert for signs of incipient inflation. In addition, the FOMC is making sure that it has the technical tools it will need when it decides to reduce monetary accommodation. Overall, I am confident that monetary policy will bring and keep inflation near my guideline of 2 percent over the medium term.\nNeedless to say, the crisis and recession have kept us busy. But we have also devoted a good deal of energy to reflecting on events of the past several years. This is, in large part, because of the importance of the last question I have been asked recently: What have you at the Federal Reserve learned about how to guard against future financial crises again creating such a major recession?  It is not always worded so nicely!  There are, of course, a number of lessons. I’d like to touch on a couple of them now.\nOne lesson is that responding effectively during times of crisis may require innovative and targeted policy tools. As the crisis arose, we first used our traditional tools, substantially cutting the federal funds rate and lending to banks through our discount window. However, we lowered the funds rate to zero—as far as it can go—and still were facing frozen credit markets and severely deteriorating macroeconomic conditions. We thus turned to nontraditional tools to clear up the choke points. These included providing liquidity directly to nonbank financial institutions, and supporting a number of short-term credit markets. We also purchased additional medium- and long-term Treasury bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and the debt of government-sponsored enterprises. These purchases further reduced long-term interest rates.\nThese nontraditional actions helped us avoid what easily could have been an even more severe economic contraction. Of course, in the future it would be best to reduce the chances of facing financial crises in the first place by better protecting the economy from systemic financial risks. Another important lesson is that to be most effective, financial market supervision needs to be based on prospective economic conditions and applied at the same time across the range of institutions. This is an essential aspect of an approach known as horizontal macroprudential regulation. Such an approach was taken during the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (what we called the SCAP). In the popular press this was better known as the bank stress tests. This was an important effort undertaken in the spring of 2009 that went a long way toward stabilizing and restoring trust in the banking system.\nDuring SCAP, the Fed and other regulators worked with the 19 largest bank holding companies to evaluate the banks’ capital adequacy under two macroeconomic scenarios. One was a baseline that embodied the expectations of most professional forecasters at the time. The other was a more adverse scenario, which ended up being closer to how the economy actually performed. As part of the exercise, banks’ assets were grouped into several buckets—categories such as First-Lien Mortgages, Junior Mortgages, Commercial Real Estate loans, etc. Both the banks and the SCAP staff of more than 150 examiners, economists, accountants, and other bank supervision specialists were asked to evaluate how these assets would perform under the two scenarios. Comparing the different assessments and working through them led to a much better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the leading bank holding companies.\nIn the end, the results indicated which institutions would need additional capital to cover their losses and maintain good capital ratios in the worse-than-expected macroeconomic environment. With this information in hand, the Fed, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) compelled institutions that fell short of this common benchmark to increase their capital. And they did. The information made public after the SCAP helped private investors make more confident valuations of the banks. Nearly all banks then were able to raise new capital on public equity markets without drawing on additional government funds.\nI see a number of benefits to making similar macroprudential stress tests routine. Such horizontal cross-bank reviews of balance sheets and risk exposures can identify potential systemic risks that might escape an institution-by-institution analysis. Furthermore, they provide a ready way for supervisory reviews and actions to respond to the latest information on macroeconomic developments. In addition, going forward, we might consider dynamic capital standards that would require banks to build their capital base during periods of strong economic growth and high bank profitability, and let banks draw down their capital cushions during downturns when profits and capital tend to be more scarce.\nSuch proactive bank supervision requires collaboration between economists and regulators. The Federal Reserve has many well-trained and experienced economists gathering intelligence and analyzing incoming data to prepare the Federal Reserve System’s Governors and Bank presidents for their monetary policy decisions. I believe that the same macroeconomic insights can help promote financial stability by substantially improving regulators’ ability to identify and assess risks that are relevant to a range of financial institutions. This was demonstrated during the SCAP and this approach will be applied to other supervisory efforts.\nAt the same time, we have well-trained and experienced bank examiners who can offer sound judgments on the creditworthiness of financial institutions’ balance sheets. Such supervisory information can and does make a valuable contribution to monetary policy analysis. For a number of years, we at the Chicago Fed have included information on banks’ financial condition and lending activity from our staff in Supervision and Regulation in our regular preparation for monetary policy meetings. Since a recovery in bank lending capacity and inclination will be an important indicator of self-sustaining momentum in the recovery and of the appropriate time to adjust monetary policy, this information is crucial now more than ever.\nJust a minute ago, I used the term macroprudential regulation. This is part of a shift in our philosophy spurred by the crisis. Since Congress created the Federal Reserve System in 1913, our approach to preventing financial crises has relied on the microprudential supervision and regulation of individual banks. In theory, ensuring sound lending standards and adequate capitalization on a bank-by-bank basis would reassure depositors that their money was safe and prevent panics. Such panics were all too common in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and were important factors leading to the formation of the Fed. If a problem bank slipped through this regulatory safety net, we could use our powers as the lender of last resort to prevent its weakness from contaminating a broader range of institutions. And, if there were macroeconomic consequences, then monetary policy could be eased to mitigate the overall effects on the economy.\nOf course, as Chairman Bernanke and other experts on the Great Depression have noted, the 1930s Fed failed to use these tools well enough. But from then until the current episode, this approach appeared to suffice, even as our financial system became more dependent on nonbank financial intermediaries, such as broker–dealers, hedge funds, and other institutions beyond the regulatory reach of the Fed and the other banking regulators. Nevertheless, the scale and scope of the past few years’ events have exposed the weaknesses of a bank-by-bank regulatory approach to guarding against the macroeconomic risks stemming from financial instability.\nOne highly visible characteristic of our recent financial instability was the bubble that arose in the housing market and its subsequent collapse. Now, in the aftermath of that bubble’s collapse, there are increasing calls for central banks to be more proactive in responding to signs that an asset bubble may have emerged. This is often described as an imperative to “lean against potential bubbles,” meaning that the central bank should act to lower asset prices that, according to some benchmark, seem unusually high. Now not all financial crises arise from bubbles; the implosion of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) following the Russian bond default is a case in point, so a policy of leaning against bubbles is at best incomplete. Moreover, there are good reasons to think that using one of the traditional monetary policy tools—namely, adjusting the short-term policy interest rate—to lean against a potential bubble could be ineffective and maybe even counterproductive. One argument is that interest rate policy is too blunt of a tool to effectively prick bubbles—it cannot be targeted precisely, and thus will affect other financial and macroeconomic variables beyond just the set of asset prices in question. A second argument is that the typical changes in interest rates that a central bank might contemplate are likely to be too small to produce big changes in asset prices. I continue to find these two arguments quite persuasive, which is why at this point I think that well-structured regulatory policy provides the most promise in protecting the economy from financial crisis.\nI’d like to conclude at this point, but I hope you’ll recall that the answers to our three questions about recovery, inflation, and the financial crisis were yes, no, and we’ve learned a lot. Giving shorter answers to these questions is certainly easy and often necessary, but always frustrating. Today, more than at any time in recent memory, people want to know about the Federal Reserve, the things we do and think about, and how we put the pieces together to create a picture of the current economy. We’re doing our best to satisfy that demand by providing as much information as we can to business people and bankers, members of Congress, the media, and, most important, consumers and the public.\nThank you for the opportunity to be with you today. I look forward to your questions.",

First, it’s an opportunity for me to share my perspective on the economy. And second, having the chance to spend a day in Iowa is a great way for me to learn more about the regional economy, specifically business conditions in this area.\nI’ve been doing a number of events like this over the past few months.

In addition, growth appears to have accelerated in the fourth quarter—some analysts are even expecting growth to top 5 percent.

Some of the businesses that cut their payrolls most deeply during the recession have begun to rehire workers. Others have accommodated recent increases in demand by hiring temporary workers. Looking ahead, most employers are very cautious about hiring at this time, given the uncertainty over the pace of the recovery. But I think that many businesses already are finding they can take lean production only so far. These firms should be ready to expand permanent hiring once they see clearer signs of sustained increases in demand.\nThe picture with regard to financing conditions is complex. On the plus side, more and more, financial markets are functioning well without the need for ongoing government support. As a result, large firms are able to borrow at reasonable spreads, both short-term in commercial paper markets and long-term in corporate bond markets. On the down side, the availability of bank credit remains a significant headwind for many small- and medium-sized companies. Some of the decline in bank lending that we saw last year reflects weak demand for loans by businesses wary of taking on new debt burdens in an uncertain economic environment. But at least some of the reduced lending arises from banks’ tighter lending standards. These tighter standards, in turn, appear to reflect banks’ concern over their capital levels and also the credit quality of borrows. More generally, credit flows are being reduced because both borrowers and lenders are still dealing with losses from the recession, especially the busts in residential and commercial real estate. I expect banking conditions to improve, but this is likely to take some time.\nLooking ahead, restrictive bank credit, along with business and household caution, will continue to restrain the recovery’s strength. Nevertheless I expect these headwinds to abate as we move through 2010. We at the Chicago Fed expect GDP growth to average 3 to 3-1/2 percent in 2010. Such growth is only slightly above our estimate of the economy’s potential growth rate, which means unemployment will likely decline only modestly in 2010.\nOf course, the recovery could exceed these expectations. The growth we’re expecting is modest for a recovery following a deep recession, which is typically followed by a sharp increase in economic activity. For example, GDP growth in the year and a half following the recession of 1981 and 1982 averaged about 8 percent. While that’s not the case now, some of the recent data have been a good deal better than expected. Increases in confidence could turn into higher spending sooner than we think. And an important longer-term factor is that productivity growth has remained strong. Technology continues to advance and firms continue to create new products and find new ways to produce more efficiently. Such productivity gains will result in higher incomes and improving standards of living over the longer term.\nWell, that was a very long answer to a very short question about the recovery. The second question I’m often asked comes in two versions. The first version is: Isn’t inflation about to go through the roof? The second version is: Isn’t inflation about to fall further—aren’t we looking at deflation? The answer is no in both cases: I think inflation will remain relatively stable. But the fact that I get these completely different questions highlights the degree of uncertainty currently underlying the inflation outlook. Surveys of consumer inflation expectations, professional forecasters’ projections, and the implied inflation forecasts from the market for Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities all see inflation running close to current rates over the medium term. But these stable inflation expectations balance out some important crosscurrents. I’m reminded of the old joke that says if you put two economists in a room you’ll get three opinions. Well, that’s especially true now.\nThe current low rates of resource utilization strongly point to lower inflation. The 10 percent unemployment rate and the still very low rates of manufacturing capacity utilization are factors that reduce cost pressures and make firms less able to push through price increases. In fact, these factors have significantly contributed to a recent decline in inflation. The Fed’s preferred measure of core inflation—the deflator for Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE, excluding food and energy —has fallen from 2-3/4 percent in August 2008 to 1-1/2 percent in November 2009. That is a large decline for a relatively slow moving data series.\nThe people who press me on higher inflation point to the Fed’s expanded balance sheet and the associated large increase in what economists call the monetary base. We all know that too much money chasing too few goods will generate inflation. But, currently, most of the increase in the monetary base is sitting idly in bank reserves—and because banks are not lending those reserves, they are not generating spending pressure. Of course, leaving the current highly accommodative monetary policy in place for too long would eventually fuel inflationary pressures.\nWith core inflation just below 1-1/2 percent, we see the opposing forces of resource gaps and accommodative monetary policy as roughly balancing out over the medium term. Resource slack could result in core PCE inflation coming down a bit more in 2010 and 2011. As resource slack abates in a recovering economy, I expect inflation to move up to about 1-3/4 percent in 2012.\nTo achieve this outlook, monetary policy cannot be passive. A large challenge facing policymakers over the next couple of years will be judging the appropriate timing and pace for reducing accommodation. On the one hand, removing too much accommodation prematurely could choke off the recovery. On the other hand, as I noted, if the Fed leaves the current level of accommodation in place too long, inflationary pressures eventually will build. The Fed is preparing for these decisions by carefully monitoring business activity and remaining alert for signs of incipient inflation. In addition, the FOMC is making sure that it has the technical tools it will need when it decides to reduce monetary accommodation. Overall, I am confident that monetary policy will bring and keep inflation near my guideline of 2 percent over the medium term.\nNeedless to say, the crisis and recession have kept us busy. But we have also devoted a good deal of energy to reflecting on events of the past several years. This is, in large part, because of the importance of the last question I have been asked recently: What have you at the Federal Reserve learned about how to guard against future financial crises again creating such a major recession? There are, of course, a number of lessons. I’d like to touch on a couple of them now.\nOne lesson is that responding effectively during times of crisis may require innovative and targeted policy tools. As the crisis arose, we first used our traditional tools, substantially cutting the federal funds rate and lending to banks through our discount window. However, we lowered the funds rate to zero—as far as it can go—and still were facing frozen credit markets and severely deteriorating macroeconomic conditions. We thus turned to nontraditional tools to clear up the choke points. These included providing liquidity directly to nonbank financial institutions, supporting a number of short-term credit markets, and reducing long-term interest rates further—by purchasing additional medium- and long-term Treasury bonds, as well as mortgage-backed securities, and the debt of government-sponsored enterprises.\nThese nontraditional actions helped us avoid what easily could have been an even more severe economic contraction. Of course, in the future it would be best to reduce the chances of having financial crises by better protecting the economy from systemic financial risks.\n Another important lesson is that to be most effective, financial market supervision needs to be based on prospective economic conditions, applied at the same time across the range of institutions, an essential aspect of an approach known as horizontal macroprudential regulation. Such an approach was taken during the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, what we called the SCAP. In the popular press this was better known as the bank stress tests. This was an important effort undertaken in the spring of 2009 that went a long way toward stabilizing and restoring trust in the banking system.\nDuring SCAP, the Fed and other regulators worked with the 19 largest bank holding companies to evaluate the banks’ capital adequacy under two macroeconomic scenarios. One was a baseline that embodied the expectations of most professional forecasters at the time. The other was a more adverse scenario, which ended up being closer to how the economy actually performed. As part of the exercise, banks’ assets were grouped into several buckets—categories such as First-Lien Mortgages, Junior Mortgages, Commercial Real Estate loans, etc. Both the banks and the SCAP staff of more than 150 examiners, economists, accountants, and other bank supervision specialists were asked to evaluate how these assets would perform under the two scenarios. Comparing and working through the different assessments led to a much better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the leading bank holding companies.\nIn the end, the results indicated which institutions would need additional capital to cover their losses and maintain good capital ratios in the worse-than-expected macroeconomic environment. With this information in hand, the Fed, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) compelled institutions that fell short of this common benchmark to increase their capital. And they did. The information made public after the SCAP helped private investors make more confident valuations of the banks. Nearly all banks then were able to raise new capital on public equity markets without drawing on additional government funds.\nI see a number of benefits to making similar macroprudential stress tests routine. Such horizontal cross-bank reviews of balance sheets and risk exposures can identify potential systemic risks that might escape an institution-by-institution analysis. Furthermore, they provide a ready way for supervisory reviews and actions to respond to the latest information on macroeconomic developments. In addition, going forward, we might consider dynamic capital standards that would require banks to build their capital base during periods of strong economic growth and high bank profitability, and let banks utilize/draw down their capital cushions during downturns when profits and capital tend to be scarcer.\nSuch proactive bank supervision requires collaboration between economists and regulators. The Federal Reserve has many well-trained and experienced economists gathering intelligence and analyzing incoming data to prepare the Federal Reserve System’s Governors and Bank presidents for their monetary policy decisions. I believe that the same macroeconomic insights can help promote financial stability by substantially improving regulators’ ability to identify and assess risks that are relevant to a range of financial institutions. This was demonstrated during the SCAP and this approach will be applied to other supervisory efforts.\nAt the same time, we have well-trained and experienced bank examiners who can offer sound judgments on the creditworthiness of financial institutions’ balance sheets. Such supervisory information can and does make a valuable contribution to monetary policy analysis. For a number of years, we at the Chicago Fed have included information on banks’ financial condition and lending activity from our staff in Supervision and Regulation in our regular preparation for monetary policy meetings. Since a recovery in bank lending capacity and inclination will be an important indicator of self-sustaining momentum in the recovery and of the appropriate time to adjust monetary policy, this information is crucial now more than ever.\nJust a minute ago, I used the term macroprudential regulation. This is part of a shift in our philosophy spurred by the crisis. Since Congress created the Federal Reserve System in 1914, our approach to preventing financial crises has relied on the microprudential supervision and regulation of individual banks. In theory, ensuring sound lending standards and adequate capitalization on a bank-by-bank basis would reassure depositors that their money was safe and prevent panics. Such panics were all too common in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and were important factors leading to the formation of the Fed. If a problem bank slipped through this regulatory safety net, we could use our powers as the lender of last resort to prevent its weakness from contaminating a broader range of institutions. And, if there were macroeconomic consequences, then monetary policy could be eased to mitigate the overall effects on the economy.\nOf course, as Chairman Bernanke and other experts on the Great Depression have noted, the Fed failed to use these tools well enough during the 1930s. But from then until the current episode this approach appeared to suffice, even as our financial system became more dependent on nonbank financial intermediaries, such as broker–dealers, hedge funds, and other institutions beyond the regulatory reach of the Fed and the other banking regulators. Nevertheless, the scale and scope of the past few years’ events have exposed the weaknesses of a bank-by-bank regulatory approach to guarding against the macroeconomic risks stemming from financial instability.\nOne highly visible characteristic of our recent financial instability was the bubble that arose in the housing market and its subsequent collapse. Now, in the aftermath of that bubble’s collapse, there are increasing calls for central banks to be more proactive in responding to signs that an asset bubble may have emerged. This is often described as an imperative to “lean against potential bubbles,” meaning that the central bank should act to lower asset prices that, according to some benchmark, seem unusually high. Now not all financial crises arise from bubbles; the implosion of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) following the Russian bond default is a case in point, so a policy of leaning against bubbles is at best incomplete. Moreover, there are good reasons to think that using one of the traditional monetary policy tools—namely, adjusting the short-term policy interest rate—to lean against a potential bubble could be ineffective and maybe even counterproductive. One argument is that interest rate policy is too blunt of a tool to effectively prick bubbles—it cannot be targeted precisely, and thus will affect other financial and macroeconomic variables beyond just the set of asset prices in question. A second argument is that the typical changes in interest rates that a central bank might contemplate are likely to be too small to produce big changes in asset prices. I continue to find these two arguments quite persuasive, which is why at this point I think that that well-structured regulatory policy provides the most promise in protecting the economy from financial crisis.\nI’d like to conclude at this point, but I hope you’ll recall that the answers to our three questions about recovery, inflation, and the financial crisis were yes, no, and we’ve learned a lot. Giving shorter answers to these questions is certainly easy and often necessary, but always frustrating. Today, more than at any time in recent memory, people want to know about the Federal Reserve, the things we do and think about and how we put the pieces together to create a picture of the current economy. We’re doing our best to satisfy that demand by providing as much information as we can to business people and bankers, members of Congress and the media, and, most important, consumers and the public.\nThank you for the opportunity to be with you today. I look forward to your questions.",

            "content": "Introduction\nIt is my pleasure to be here in Muncie today to speak to you about my views on the progress of the recovery and on the course of monetary policy. I would like to thank Steve Smith, president of the Muncie Forecasting Roundtable, for that kind introduction.\n \nFor those of you who follow monetary policy deliberations, you will certainly be aware that I was the lone dissenter at the last policy meeting held in early November. So it should come as no surprise when I say that the views that I am presenting today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or my other colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nReal Output Gap\nFour years ago the U.S. economy entered what developed into the deepest recession since the Great Depression. Two and a half years ago the recovery began. Yet, despite both accommodative monetary policy and fiscal stimulus, the pace of improvement has been agonizingly slow. Real gross domestic product (GDP) is only just back to where it stood at its pre-recession peak in 2007, employment growth is barely enough to keep pace with natural growth in the labor force and the unemployment rate remains extraordinarily high.\nEarlier this year, most forecasters thought that the recovery was gaining traction and that economic activity would increase at a solid  — though not spectacular  — pace through 2012. The labor market was beginning to show some long-awaited improvement, and the financial repair process seemed to be making progress. Analysts thought that higher prices for energy and other commodities would weigh on output growth, as would supply-chain disruptions from the disaster in Japan. But these factors were expected to be transitory, and most forecasters thought growth would improve significantly once these influences had passed.\nUnfortunately, the news over the past several months has proved this forecast to be too optimistic. To use an automotive analogy, employment and growth are stuck in neutral. Job growth has been disappointing, and the unemployment rate just last month dipped below 9 percent. Revised data indicate that annualized real GDP growth in the first half of 2011 was only 1 percent and improved only modestly to a 2 percent pace in the third quarter. Consumer spending has been particularly sluggish. Furthermore, the weakness in GDP growth began before the bulk of the effects of higher energy prices hit the economy and before the disaster in Japan happened. This timing, along with the continued softness of most economic indicators into the early summer, indicates that the slowing in output growth was not all due to temporary factors. Even with slightly firmer economic data that have come out recently, the sense of building momentum seems absent. Rather, the headwinds facing consumers and businesses are even stronger than we had thought.\nAgainst this backdrop, the outlook has weakened substantially. Last June my colleagues on the FOMC and I were projecting real GDP growth would be around 2-3/4 percent in 2011 and 3-1/2 percent in 2012. As I alluded to a moment ago, some of the recent incoming numbers — on manufacturing activity and automobile sales, for example — have improved. Even so, our latest forecast made in early November revised down our outlook for 2011 by a full percentage point and projected GDP growth at just 2-3/4 percent in 2012 — barely above most analysts’ views of the potential rate of output growth for the economy. Such growth rates certainly are not strong enough to make much of a dent in the unemployment rate and other measures of resource slack. Indeed, the FOMC’s latest forecasts are for the unemployment rate to remain above 8-1/2 percent through 2012 and to fall only to about 8 percent in 2013. Without new developments or changes in policy, I don’t believe the U.S. economy is poised to achieve escape velocity anytime soon.\n\nInflation Outlook under 2 Percent\nWhat about inflation? Large increases in energy prices pushed headline inflation — as measured by the 12-month change in the total Personal Consumption Expenditures Price (PCE) Index — up from about 1-1/4 percent last fall to almost 3 percent this summer. These higher prices certainly took a bite out of households’ budgets. But they did not portend a permanent ratcheting up of inflation. Core PCE inflation — which excludes the volatile food and energy components and is a better predictor of future overall inflation — has been just 1.7 percent over the past year. Furthermore, prices for energy and many other commodities have softened of late. And with the unemployment rate still high and capacity utilization low, resource slack continues to exert downward pressure on prices. In addition, measures of longer-run inflation expectations are at the low end of the range they have been running since last November.\nPutting these factors together, I would argue that inflation is likely to remain moderate over the foreseeable future. The FOMC forecasts for core inflation were concentrated near 1.8 percent this year, and its forecasts for total inflation were in the range of 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent for 2012, 2013 and 2014. My own assessment is that inflation will be at the lower end of these ranges.\n\nFed Performance\nThese disappointing forecasts pose a challenge for monetary policy. The Fed is charged by Congress in the Federal Reserve Act to encourage conditions that foster both maximum employment and price stability. This is what you hear us refer to as the Fed’s “dual mandate.” Given the high unemployment rate and low job growth, I think it is clear that the Fed has fallen short in achieving its goal of maximum employment. I will return to this point shortly. As for the price stability component of our dual mandate, the majority of FOMC participants — including me — judge our objective for overall inflation to average 2 percent over the medium term. With my own view that inflation is likely to run below this rate over the next few years, I believe we run the risk of missing on our inflation objective as well.\n\nTwo Different Perspectives on the Economy\nCentral bankers must formulate monetary policy with the understanding that our knowledge is imperfect. We may have incomplete and sometimes competing views of the forces that generate current economic conditions. This is especially true in the difficult circumstances we face today. In my view, we should try to formulate a monetary policy strategy that carefully balances the risks associated with the reasonable alternative economic scenarios that we face and is as robust as possible to miscalculations as to which of these scenarios is predominantly true.\nLet me now discuss two quite different perspectives that could account for the disappointing slow growth and continued high unemployment that we confront today. These two conditions are important to consider in that they have markedly different monetary policy prescriptions.\nThe first storyline I will refer to as the “structural impediments scenario.” In this scenario, the recent period, which has been referred to as the Great Recession, was accompanied by an acute period of structural change, skills mismatch, job-killing uncertainties and excessive regulatory burdens. Accordingly, these structural impediments have caused the natural rate of unemployment to increase.\nThe structural impediments scenario sounds plausible to many, but I do not find it compelling. As best I can tell, it rests on lots of conjecture about economic forces and outcomes that are not confirmed by the evidence at hand. As an economist seeking firm quantitative explanations, I am not aware of any rigorously studied economic models1 that both match critically important time-series properties of the data and support the notion that today’s high unemployment rate arises from special structural impediments2Even generous estimates of the impact of structural reallocation and other factors on today’s equilibrium, or the so-called natural rate of unemployment, do not come anywhere near the current 9 percent rate of unemployment.\nNevertheless suppose this scenario were true. In this case the role for additional monetary accommodation is modest at best: The economy faces a supply constraint that monetary policy simply cannot address. Accordingly, those subscribing to this view think that additional easing would likely raise inflation without having a sizable impact on unemployment. In this scenario, our running a more accommodative monetary policy potentially risks repeating the stagflation of the 1970s. At that time, the Fed did not understand that the changing structure of the economy had caused the natural rate of unemployment to rise. In an effort to reduce the unemployment rate, it provided too much accommodation that only served to raise inflation and inflation expectations. To avoid that mistake today, under the structural impediments scenario, the Fed should revert to a “business-as-usual” monetary policy and begin to consider removing excess accommodation before inflation rises above its target and inflation expectations start to creep unalterably upward.\nThere is a second competing storyline — one that I refer to as the “liquidity trap scenario.” First, consider what occurs during normal times when nominal rates of interest are considerably above zero and real rates of interest are positive. If the supply of savings increased but the demand for investment remained unchanged, market forces would drive down real interest rates to some natural rate of interest that equilibrates savings and investment. This market dynamic is thwarted in the case of a liquidity trap.\nHere, cautious behavior holding back spending — whether it is due to risk aversion, extreme patience or deleveraging — causes the supply of savings to exceed the demand for investment even at very low interest rates. Today short-term, risk-free interest rates are close to zero and actual real rates are only modestly negative. But they are still not low enough — because short-term nominal interest rates cannot fall below zero, real rates cannot become negative enough to equilibrate savings and investment.\nAs I weigh the evidence, I find the case for the liquidity trap scenario more compelling than one for the structural impediments scenario. My assessment has been influenced by the book titled This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly3 by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff. Reinhart and Rogoff document the substantially detrimental effects that financial crises typically impose on the subsequent economic recovery. As we all know, the recent recession was accompanied by a large financial crisis. When I look at the U.S. economy today, I see it tracking Reinhart and Rogoff’s observation that such recoveries are usually painfully slow — and are so for reasons that have little to do with structural impediments in the labor market and the like.\nLiquidity traps are rare and difficult events to manage. They present a clear and present danger that we risk repeating the experience of the U.S. in the 1930s or that of Japan over the past 20 years. However, liquidity traps have been studied over the years in rigorous analytical models by a number of prominent economists, including Paul Krugman, Gauti Eggertsson, Michael Woodford and Ivan Werning.4 Variants of these models have successfully explained business cycle developments in the United States. The lesson drawn from this literature is that the performance of economies stuck in a liquidity trap can be vastly improved by lowering real interest rates and lifting economic activity using an appropriately prolonged and forward-looking period of accommodative monetary policy. Of course, such monetary accommodation is the antithesis of the policy prescription for the structural impediments scenario.\n\nA Risk-Management Approach to Policy Changes\nOf course, I realize that I could be wrong in my assessment. So let us consider how we should conduct policy when we don’t know for sure which scenario is really the one we face today. How can we avoid risking a repeat of either the stagflation of the 1970s or the slow growth of the 1930s?\nThe problem, of course, is that policies that are optimal for the liquidity trap scenario would tend to generate higher inflation without significant reductions in unemployment if the structural impediments scenario were true. Conversely, policies that are optimal for the structural impediments scenario would leave the economy unnecessarily mired in depression and deflation if we were actually in the liquidity trap scenario.\n\nA Middle Ground Proposal\nFortunately, between these two extreme scenarios, there is a robust middle ground policy approach. The Fed could sharpen its forward guidance in two directions by implementing a state-contingent policy. The first part of such a policy would be to communicate that we will keep the funds rate at exceptionally low levels as long as unemployment is somewhat above its natural rate. The second part of the policy is to have an essential safeguard — that is, a commitment to pull back on accommodation if inflation rises above a particular threshold. This inflation safeguard would insure us against the risks that the supply constraints central to the structural impediments scenario are stronger than I think. Rates would remain low as long as the conditions were unmet.\nFurthermore, I believe the inflation-safeguard threshold needs to be above our current 2 percent inflation objective — perhaps something like 3 percent. Now, the “3 percent inflation” number may seem shocking coming from a conservative central banker. However, as Kenneth Rogoff recently wrote in a Financial Times piece, “Any inflation above 2 percent may seem anathema to those who still remember the anti-inflation wars of the 1970s and 1980s, but a once-in-75-year crisis calls for outside-the-box measures”5 I agree wholeheartedly with Professor Rogoff.\nAnd actually, this middle ground policy guidance is not as out-of-the box as one might think. Importantly, it is consistent with the most recent liquidity trap research, which shows that improved economic performance during a liquidity trap requires the central bank, if necessary, to allow inflation to run higher than its target for some time over the medium term. Such policies can generate the above-trend growth necessary to reduce unemployment and return overall economic activity to its productive potential. In fact, I have seen model simulation results that suggest to me that core inflation is unlikely to rise as high as 3 percent under such a policy.\nBut suppose the structural impediments scenario turns out to be correct. In this case, inflation will rise more quickly and without any improvements to the real side of the economy. In such an adverse situation, the inflation safeguard triggers an exit from the now-evident excessive policy accommodation before inflation expectations become unhinged. We would not have the desired reductions in unemployment, but then again, there wouldn’t be anything that monetary policy could do about it. We would suffer some policy loss in that a 3 percent inflation rate is above our 2 percent target. But we certainly have experienced inflation rates near 3 percent in the recent past and have weathered them well. And 3 percent won’t unhinge long-run inflation expectations. We are not talking about anything close to the debilitating higher inflation rates we saw in the 1970s or 1980s. We would also know that we had made our best effort.\n\nConclusion\n Today, I have outlined an appropriate course for monetary policy to take when we cannot know with certainty the degrees to which various forces are driving the economic weakness we currently face. If, as I fear, the liquidity trap scenario describes the present environment, we risk being mired in recession-like circumstances for an unacceptably long period. Indeed, each passing month of stagnation represents real economic losses that are borne by all. In addition, I worry that even when the economy does regain traction, its new potential growth path will be permanently impaired. The skills of the long-term unemployed may atrophy and incentives for workers to invest in acquiring new skills may be diminished. Similarly, businesses facing uncertain demand are less inclined to invest in new productive capacity and technologies. All of these factors may permanently lower the path of potential output.\nAs I said in the fall of 2010 and I repeat the message again today: I think state-contingent policies such as those I just described are a productive way to provide such necessary monetary accommodation. There is simply too much at stake for us to be excessively complacent while the economy is in such dire shape. It is imperative to undertake action now.\n\nNotes\n1 See Christiano, Eichenmbaum and Evans (2005), Smets and Wouters (2007) and Chung et al.

            "content": "The Enormity of the Problem\nIn the summer of 2009, the U.S. economy began to emerge from its deepest recession since the 1930s. But today, more than two years later, conditions still aren’t much different from an economy actually in recession. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth was barely positive in the first half of 2011. The unemployment rate is 9.1 percent, much higher than anything we had experienced for decades before the recession. And job gains over the past several months have been barely enough to keep pace with the natural growth in the labor force, so we’ve made virtually no progress in closing the “jobs gap.”\nWith unemployment having lingered for so long at rates around 9 percent, it is perhaps natural that some would begin to think that nothing more can be done to improve upon this situation. However, I don’t agree. Before seriously contemplating doing nothing, it is important to realize just how enormous this economic problem really is. To put this in perspective, consider that prior to the recession, most analysts thought the long-run trend growth rate of GDP was about 2-1/2 percent per year. Given the sharp drop in output during the recession and lackluster early recovery, GDP is currently below its potential by nearly 7 percent, or $1 trillion dollars.1Just prior to the recession, the unemployment rate averaged between 4-1/2 and 5 percent. It peaked at 10.1 percent during the recession and, as I just noted, is still 9.1 percent today. In terms of jobs, payroll employment is about 6-1/2 million below its pre-recession level. These are massive shortfalls in output and employment.\nIt does not appear as if these gaps are going to be reduced significantly any time soon. Real GDP growth has been anemic so far this year. Gains in employment have slowed markedly. Even though credit conditions overall have been improving, many households and small businesses still seem to be having trouble getting credit. In addition, the repair process in residential real estate markets is painstakingly slow, and households are still in the process of paring debt and adapting to the huge losses in real estate and financial wealth that they experienced during the recession.\nI largely agree with economists such as Paul Krugman, Mike Woodford and others who see the economy as being in a liquidity trap: Short-term nominal interest rates are stuck near zero, even while desired saving still exceeds desired investment. This situation is the natural result of the abundance of caution exercised by many households and businesses that still worry that they have inadequate buffers of assets to cushion against unexpected shocks. Such caution holds back spending below the levels of our productive capacity. For example, I regularly hear from business contacts that they do not want to risk hiring new workers until they actually see an uptick in demand for their products. Most businesses do not appear to be cutting back further at the moment, but they would rather sit on cash than take the risk of further expansion.\nConsidering the substantial lost wealth that came with the Second Great Contraction and the enormous uncertainty over the recovery today, it is understandable why households, businesses and market participants are exceedingly cautious. We seem to be following the tendency, documented by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, that recoveries from economic downturns caused by large financial crises usually are painfully slow. Accordingly, it is of the utmost importance for monetary policymakers to respond appropriately.\nRecently, many critics of the Fed’s actions have raised concerns about the credibility of Fed policy. Credibility — that is, the general belief that the Fed does what it can to achieve its mandated policy objectives — is certainly a critical issue. Defining “credibility” sounds easy, but there are several aspects to credibility. For example, at any point in time, the Federal Reserve will likely need to contemplate a series of current and future policy actions in order to effectively influence the trajectory of the economy and better achieve the goals of monetary policy. In order for households, businesses and financial markets to conduct business in accordance with the Fed’s planning, the public must believe that the Fed will carry out these future actions as expected to achieve its well-understood objectives. Credibility requires a clear public understanding of the Fed’s policy objectives, as well as a belief by the public that the Fed’s actions are consistent with achieving these objectives. Lower levels of credibility would be associated with erratic and misunderstood policy actions that seemed inconsistent with the stated objectives of monetary policy.\nAt this point, it would be useful to describe the typical way in which monetary policy is set by central banks with any eye toward discussing how deliberations should be evaluated for effectiveness and credibility.\n\nThe Policy Decision Process\nIn setting monetary policy, a central bank like the Federal Reserve must deliberate systematically about a wide variety of important issues. Perhaps at the cost of oversimplifying, I will broadly characterize this deliberative process as consisting of four steps.\nFirst, members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) must have a clear vision of the goals of monetary policy. In my mind, the Federal Reserve Act is very clear in specifying that the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate: The FOMC should provide for monetary and financial conditions that support maximum employment and price stability.2 With regard to inflation, we should seek to keep inflation near 2 percent over the medium term. We should also remember that a 2 percent objective should represent an average level of inflation, not an impenetrable ceiling. With regard to our real economy mandate, we should minimize the deviations of the actual path of the real economy from its potential path (or more technically, its efficiently-achievable path). From my earlier discussion of the immensity of the current problem, we are far from minimizing these real deviations today.\nSecond, the FOMC needs to closely look at the plethora of data that comes out every month in order to evaluate the outlook for the economy and inflation, keeping in mind a variety of potential risk scenarios and financial stability considerations. Four times each year, the FOMC formally publishes forecasts in its Summary of Economic Projections. Of course, it is crucial for each FOMC member to update his/her outlook for each meeting.\nThird, in evaluating the state of the economy and inflation pressures, the FOMC must periodically step back and ask itself whether something very different than normal is afoot. We all recognize that our views about how the economy works are imperfect. So we must always ask if we have seen anything that would move us away from our current viewpoints and forecasting methodologies — and if things have changed significantly, we must ask if achievable paths for our policy goals or the channels through which monetary policy works have been altered in any substantive way. These considerations would include questions about whether we are facing structural economic change that lowers the economy’s potential output, substantial financial impediments holding back demand along the lines stressed by Reinhart and Rogoff, global financial stress, and the like. A good portion of these concerns are related to appropriate risk-management considerations.\nFourth, policymakers must make a decision regarding the stance and course of monetary policy. They must ask if their forecasts are consistent with their medium- and long-term policy objectives, and if not, what then is the best response for monetary policy to influence the trajectory of the economy and inflation in order to meet the FOMC’s objectives?\nThat is a very quick summary of the necessary steps for effective monetary policymaking.\nWhere does credibility come into play in all of this?\nSince no policymaking process can be perfect, some errors will naturally arise. At the forecasting stage, no one has a perfect crystal ball. Forecast errors will be made, and these errors could have an impact on credibility. It seems natural to believe that greater losses would occur if there were repeated mistakes in economic projections of a one-sided nature. An example would be repeated extreme optimism or extreme pessimism in the face of reasonable evidence to the contrary. Such bouts could be due to mistakes about cyclical factors or a misunderstanding of the changing structure of the economy.\nAt the policymaking level, a continuing pattern of not taking appropriate policy actions in the face of a changing economic outlook or structure would presumably lead to poor outcomes against medium-term goals. Now, caution in policymaking can be a virtue. But at some point, when the weight of the evidence is large, continued delays in action could erode credibility.\nIn general, although a policymaker’s credibility account is credited and debited on a regular basis, the most substantial credibility losses come in two varieties: 1) really large and systematic deviations of outcomes from ex ante chosen policy objectives; and 2) a substantial misunderstanding of policy objectives. Monetary economists often point to the poor economic experiences of the 1970s and 1930s as times when the Federal Reserve’s credibility account was debited substantially because of both of these factors. I believe the current liquidity trap environment following the 2008 financial crisis is similarly challenging today’s policymakers. So far, I believe we have done the right thing. Since the recession’s end in 2009, more than once the FOMC’s projections have proved too optimistic, and the U.S. economy has been unable to achieve escape velocity for returning to stronger, self-sustaining growth. But instead of doing nothing, the FOMC took further policy actions to support stronger growth in the context of continued price stability. These actions have provided a credible counterweight to the forecast errors and maintained steadfastness with our medium-term policy objectives. I’m not so sure how well we will do going forward. My recent speech in London on dual mandate arithmetic was meant to clarify the challenges we face in describing the Federal Reserve’s policy objectives. The upshot I take from that analysis is this: If we sit on our hands as the economy withers relative to our mandate, then we could take a huge hit to our credibility, akin to what happened to our credibility following the devastating mistakes of the 1930s.\n\nTwo Examples of Enormous Credibility Hits to Monetary Policy: The 1970s and 1930s\nThe Federal Reserve’s policy actions during the 1970s and 1930s stand out as two exemplary cases of poor monetary policymaking. In the post-war era, most critics of expansionary monetary policy cite the 1970s Fed Chairmen, Arthur Burns and William Miller, as writing the playbook for high inflationary outcomes. By most accounts, the Burns–Miller Fed failed to understand that growth in the productive capabilities of the U.S. economy had slowed. In addition, changes in labor markets made it harder to allocate workers to new jobs in quick order. As a consequence of these structural shifts in the functioning of the economy, the Fed policymakers failed to realize that output was higher than they thought relative to its potential. As a result, additional monetary stimulus couldn’t bring about stronger growth and lower unemployment, but only exacerbated inflation, higher inflationary expectations and an accelerating wage–price spiral. In fact, inflation rose to double digits, wages chased these prices higher in order to minimize reductions in living standards, and unemployment remained high.\nThe Burns–Miller Fed failed, but where was the failure greatest? With regard to my earlier description of the policymaking process, the Burns–Miller Fed did not properly understand the changing evolution of the U.S. economy in the 1970s, nor how monetary policy interacted with the new structure. To be fair, the Burns–Miller Fed was not alone—other experts at that time made the same mistakes. These common misunderstandings meant that the credibility loss over being slow to understand the changing environment probably was not large.\nFar more damaging to the Burns–Miller Fed’s credibility was the failure to adjust policy when it later saw rising and high inflation and inflation expectations. Surely, those developments were major evidence of a change in the structure of the economy, and the Burns–Miller Fed’s failure to adjust its thinking and policy in light of them had huge implications for credibility. I take such credibility risks extraordinarily seriously.\nThe 1930s were an episode of even worse Fed policymaking. This was a period of far greater economic dislocation and hardship. When thinking about the 1930s, I find it useful to turn to the wisdom of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz from their book titled A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960. Friedman and Schwartz discuss how monetary policy in the early 1930s actually contributed to the contraction, despite the fact that bank reserves increased significantly over that period. Broad monetary aggregates contracted, even though bank reserves were higher, because 1) banking panics and the weak real economy led the public to hoard cash and 2) banks wanted to increase reserve ratios as insurance against liquidity shortages and runs. As a result, the amount of lending supported by a given level of reserves fell dramatically, and the U.S. economy experienced a period of deflation. However, the Fed failed to see that it was running a restrictive monetary policy. One reason was they were striving to stay on the gold standard, which dictated policies to counter gold outflows. In addition, the Fed interpreted the excess reserves on banks’ books and the associated low level of money market interest rates as signs of an accommodative financial environment and so did not aggressively loosen monetary policy. But, as Friedman and Schwartz note, this interpretation was misguided—the excess reserves were attempts by banks to maintain a larger buffer stock against liquidity shortages, and low interest rates reflected heightened demands for low-risk assets that the Fed should have further accommodated.\nI bring up the 1970s and 1930s Fed policymaking examples because they are relevant for the critiques of monetary policy that we are hearing today. It’s safe to say that the aggressive moves the Federal Reserve has made to provide monetary accommodation have not been universally applauded. Critics point to the large expansion of bank reserves and low levels of interest rates throughout the Treasury yield curve and surmise that the Fed is sowing the seeds of future inflation, as in the 1970s. They believe we should be taking back accommodation — some say now, some say soon — as the recovery gains some more steam or inflation creeps up a few more tenths.\nI don’t see it that way. Rather than fighting the inflation ghosts of the 1970s, I am more worried about repeating the mistakes of the 1930s. As in the 1930s, today we see a lack of demand for loans and a resistance of lenders to take on risk — factors that mean the high level of bank reserves is not finding its way into broader money measures. As in the 1930s, today’s low Treasury interest rates in good part reflect elevated demand for low-risk assets — we see investors run to U.S. Treasury markets every time they hear any bad economic news from anywhere in the world. Consider another metric for interest rates, the well-known Taylor Rule, which captures how monetary policy typically adjusts to output gaps and deviations in inflation from target. Its prescriptions would call for the federal funds rates to be something like –3.6 percent now, well below the zero lower bound the funds rate is currently stuck at. Our large-scale asset purchases have provided additional stimulus, but by most estimates not enough to bring us down to the Taylor Rule prescriptions. Also, I should note that in 1998, Friedman gave a similar recommendation to the Japanese, advocating that the Bank of Japan undertake more accommodation by buying government bonds on the open market.\nOther critics raise the specter of 1970s-like structural changes in the economy. Such changes, they argue, have reduced our productive potential, in particular the mechanisms by which resources — most notably labor — move from declining to expanding sectors of the economy.3 I am acutely aware of the costs of making such an error. No central banker wants to repeat the painful experiences of the 1979–83 period. Indeed, the FOMC discussed this issue at great length (see the minutes of our January 2011 meeting).4 However, I have yet to see empirical evidence based on a modeling framework that successfully captures U.S. business cycle dynamics that shows such supply-side structural factors can come close to explaining the huge shortfalls in actual GDP from trend and the high level of unemployment. For example, extended unemployment insurance and increased difficulties in matching workers to vacant jobs may have resulted in a transitory increase in the natural rate of unemployment, but the analysis I’ve seen doesn’t get you close to the 9 percent rate we currently are experiencing.\n\nThe Policy Loss Function\nThe macroeconomics literature often describes the policymaker’s problem as one of minimizing societal costs of bad outcomes — which it mathematically approximates by the sum of the squared deviations in inflation from its target and the unemployment rate from its so-called natural rate. It turns out that a conservative and tough-minded central banker should value these deviations about equally.5 Accordingly, an inflation rate of 5 percent against an inflation goal of 2 percent is the same sized loss as an unemployment rate of 9 percent against a conservative estimate of 6 percent for the natural rate of unemployment. Today, we are facing an unemployment rate of 9 percent with little prospect of meaningful declines soon and the medium-term outlook for inflation is under 2 percent.\nThis policy framework is often described as flexible inflation targeting. In strict inflation targeting, all policy actions are aimed at hitting an inflation target. In flexible targeting, policymakers balance deviations from both the unemployment and inflation targets. Usually, the policy prescriptions from the two targets are not in conflict. Above- target unemployment is typically associated with muted inflationary pressures, and accommodative policies are appropriate to reduce both gaps from their respective targets. At times, however, conflicts can occur. When they do, a flexible targeter does not accept a large miss in one target in order to hit the other perfectly, but instead accepts moderate misses in both in order to minimize the total loss. A corollary is that any flexible inflation targeter has to accept the idea that optimal policy may involve inflation running for a time above the long-run target if that is a consequence of policies designed to bring unemployment more in line with its target rate.\n\nPolicy Prescription\nGiven the economic scenario and inflation outlook I have discussed, if it were possible, I would favor cutting the federal funds rate by several percentage points. But since the federal funds rate is already near zero now, that’s not an option. To date, the Fed’s policymaking committee, the FOMC, has used a number of nontraditional policy tools to impart greater financial accommodation. I have fully supported these policies. However, I would argue for further policy actions based on our dual mandate responsibilities and the strong impediments of the financial crisis.\nIn a recent Financial Times commentary, Michael Woodford of Columbia University discussed how greater clarity in policy communications would help.6 I agree. As I see it, current financial conditions are more restrictive than I favor, in part because households, businesses and markets place too much weight on the possibility that Fed policy will turn restrictive in the near to medium term. The FOMC’s announcement in August that it anticipates short-term rates remaining low through mid-2013 was certainly a step in the right direction because it significantly raised the hurdle for early policy tightening. But I think we could go even further. One way would be to make a simple statement about our policy plans that clearly lays out our conditionality in terms of our dual mandate responsibilities and observable economic data. This could be done by stating that we would hold the federal funds rate at extraordinarily low levels until particular markers were reached with regard to the unemployment rate and inflation. I will talk about this in more detail in a minute. Alternatively, I have previously discussed how state-contingent, price-level targeting would work in this regard.7 Another possibility might be to target the level of nominal GDP, with the goal of bringing it back to the growth trend that existed before the recession. I think these kinds of policies are worth seriously contemplating as ways to enhance economic growth and employment while maintaining a disciplined inflation performance.\n\nPolicy Problem\nSuch conditional-trigger and level-targeting policies could result in inflation running at rates that would make us uncomfortable during normal times. I understand this discomfort. The difficulties in reestablishing credibility following the inflation of the 1970s weigh on all central bankers’ minds. And many of us are conditioned by the work of Ken Rogoff8 and others, who note that in normal times, we may want conservative central bankers as institutional offsets to what would otherwise be inflationary biases in the monetary policy process.\nGiven this strong anti-inflationary orientation of central bankers, appropriate policy actions may face a credibility challenge of a different nature than we are used to talking about — can conservative central bankers be counted on to commit to keeping interest rates low in the event inflation rises above their long-run target? To the degree that the public doubts that we will, current accommodation is reduced because expected future short-term rates, interest rate uncertainty and associated risk premiums all will be higher than they otherwise would be. Premature talk of exit strategies or assertions of inflation targets as ceilings only feed the perception that we are not committed to the low rates. And thus, I think we are seeing such added restraint today.\n\nA Proposed Policy\nI believe that we can substantially ease the public’s concern that monetary policy will become restrictive in the near to medium term and, hence, reduce the restraint in expanding economic activity. This can be done by clearly spelling out in our policy statements the conditionality of our dual mandate responsibilities. What should such a statement look like? I think we should consider committing to keep short-term rates at zero until either the unemployment rate goes below 7 percent or the outlook for inflation over the medium term goes above 3 percent. Such policies should enable us to make progress toward our mandated goals. But if this progress is too slow, then we should move forward with increased purchases of longer-term securities. We might even consider a regime in which we reevaluate our progress toward our policy goals and the rate of purchase of such assets at every FOMC meeting.\nLet me note several aspects to this policy conditionality. As I just said, I subscribe to a 2 percent target for inflation over the long run. However, given how badly we are doing on our employment mandate, we need to be willing to take a risk on inflation going modestly higher in the short run if that is a consequence of polices aimed at lowering unemployment. With regard to the inflation marker, we have already experienced unduly low inflation of 1 percent; so against an objective of 2 percent, 3 percent inflation would be an equivalent policy loss to what we have already experienced. On the unemployment marker, a decline to 7 percent would be quite helpful. However, weighed against a conservative estimate for the natural rate of unemployment of 6 percent, it still represents a substantial policy loss. Indeed, weighed against a less conservative long-run estimate of the natural rate, it is a larger policy loss than that from 3 percent inflation. Accordingly, these triggers remain quite conservatively tilted in favor of disciplined inflation performance over enhanced growth and employment, and it would not be unreasonable to consider an even lower unemployment threshold before starting policy tightening.\nI would also highlight that while I believe that optimal policy would be consistent with inflation running above our 2 percent target for some time, this policy does not abandon the 2 percent target for long-run inflation. Indeed, I would support combining this policy with a formal statement of 2 percent as our longer-run inflation target in conjunction with reaffirming our commitment to flexible inflation-targeting. Furthermore, I see a 3 percent inflation threshold as a safeguard against inflation running too high for too long and thus unhinging longer-run inflation expectations. It also is a safeguard against the kinds of policy errors we made in the 1970s. If potential output is indeed lower and the natural rate of unemployment higher than I currently think, then resource pressures would emerge and actual inflation and the outlook for inflation over the medium term would rise faster than expected. If this outlook for inflation hit 3 percent before the unemployment rate falls to 7 percent, then we would begin to tighten policy.\nI understand that some may find such a policy proposal to be hard to understand, or even risky. But these are not ordinary times — we are in the aftermath of a financial crisis with massive output gaps, with stubborn debt overhangs and high degrees of household and business caution that are weighing on economic activity. As Ken Rogoff wrote in a recent piece in the Financial Times, “Any inflation above 2 percent may seem anathema to those who still remember the anti-inflation wars of the 1970s and 1980s, but a once-in-75-year crisis calls for outside-the-box measures.”9 The Fed has done a good deal of thinking out of the box over the past four years. I think it is time to do some more.\n\nNotes\n1 Real GDP fell about 5 percent during the recession, and growth has averaged about a 2-1/2 percent annual rate so far in the recovery.

            "content": "In the summer of 2009, the U.S. economy began to emerge from its deepest recession since the 1930s. But today, two years later, conditions still aren’t much different from an economy actually in recession. GDP growth was barely positive in the first half of the year. The unemployment rate is 9.1%, much higher than anything we have experienced for decades before the recession. And job gains over the last several months have been barely enough to keep pace with the natural growth in the labor force, so we’ve made virtually no progress in closing the \"jobs gap.\"\nThe Federal Reserve has responded aggressively to the deep recession and weak recovery, cutting short-term interest rates to essentially zero and purchasing assets that expanded its balance sheet by a factor of three. But since undertaking the so-called QE2 round of asset purchases last fall, the Fed’s aggressive policy actions have been on hold.\nSome believe that this pause is entirely appropriate. They claim that the economy faces some kind of impediment that limits how much more monetary policy can do to stimulate growth. And, on the price front, they note that the disinflationary pressures of 2009 and 2010 have given way to inflation rates closer to what I and the majority of Fed policymakers see as the Fed’s objective of 2%. These considerations lead many to say that when adding up the costs and benefits of further accommodation, the risk of over-shooting our inflation objective through further policy accommodation exceeds the potential benefits of speeding the improvement in labor markets.\nI would argue that this view is extremely, and inappropriately, asymmetric in its weighting of the Fed’s dual objectives to support maximum employment and price stability.\nSuppose we faced a very different economic environment: Imagine that inflation was running at 5% against our inflation objective of 2%. Is there a doubt that any central banker worth their salt would be reacting strongly to fight this high inflation rate? No, there isn’t any doubt. They would be acting as if their hair was on fire. We should be similarly energized about improving conditions in the labor market.\nIn the United States, the Federal Reserve Act charges us with maintaining monetary and financial conditions that support maximum employment and price stability. This is referred to as the Fed’s dual mandate and it has the force of law behind it.\nThe most reasonable interpretation of our maximum employment objective is an unemployment rate near its natural rate, and a fairly conservative estimate of that natural rate is 6%. So, when unemployment stands at 9%, we’re missing on our employment mandate by 3 full percentage points. That’s just as bad as 5% inflation versus a 2% target. So, if 5% inflation would have our hair on fire, so should 9% unemployment.\nToday, I would like to explore further the implications of the Fed’s dual mandate framework for monetary policy-making in today’s environment. And don’t worry, the views I am about to express are my own and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve System colleagues.\n\nBrief Update on the U.S. Economy\nIt’s useful to start with a brief update on the U.S. economy. The economic outlook clearly has deteriorated this year. Early in 2011, most forecasters thought that the recovery was gaining traction and that economic activity would increase at a solid—though not spectacular—rate this year and next.\nThe financial repair process seemed to be progressing well, and, at least among large firms with access to the bond market, borrowing costs were quite low. We also had finally begun to see a long-awaited improvement in labor market conditions, with private job gains running about one-quarter million per month during the winter of 2011 and the unemployment rate falling about 1 percentage point over a four-month period. Higher prices for energy and other commodities were taking a bite out of purchasing power and the disasters in Japan were a drag, but these influences were expected to be temporary and growth was expected to strengthen.\nThe news over the past several months has proved this forecast wrong. Gains in employment have slowed markedly, and the unemployment rate has edged back up over 9%. The earlier improvements in labor markets now appear to have reflected the lagged influence of previous output growth and not—as we had hoped--the start of a virtuous circle of hiring and spending. Furthermore, revised data now indicate that real GDP began to decelerate in late 2010 and then barely edged up in the first half of this year. Consumer spending was particularly sluggish. Importantly, the weakness in growth began before the bulk of the effects of higher energy prices hit the economy and before the disaster in Japan. This timing, and the continued softness of most economic indicators into the early summer, indicates that the headwinds facing consumers and businesses are even stronger than we thought.\nWhat are these headwinds? First, even though credit conditions overall have been improving, many households and small businesses still seem to be having trouble getting credit. In addition, the repair process in residential real estate markets is painstakingly slow, and households are still in the process of paring debt and adapting to the huge losses in real estate and financial wealth that they experienced during the recession.\nOf course, these forces are not new—indeed, they are important reasons why in this cycle forecasters never predicted rapid gains in output such as those that followed the deep recessions in the 1970s and 1980s. But they now appear to be even deeper and more persistent than we thought earlier in the year.\nMany households and business may still feel they have inadequate buffers of assets to cushion against unexpected shocks. This leads to cautious behavior that holds back spending. For example, I regularly hear from business contacts that they do not want to risk hiring new workers until they actually see an uptick in demand for their products. They do not appear to be paring back at the moment, but they would rather sit on cash than risk undertaking a potentially unprofitable expansion. In addition to these long-running problems, continued uncertainty about the European debt crisis and the difficulties dealing with the U.S. fiscal situation have held back growth.\nAgainst this backdrop, the outlook has weakened substantially. Last June, most private sector forecasters were expecting real GDP to increase 2-3/4% in 2011 and 3.1% in 2012. By early August, these forecasts had dropped to 1.6% and 2.7%, respectively. This 2012 growth rate is barely above most analysts’ views of potential growth—so it certainly won’t make much of a dent in the unemployment rate and other measures of resource slack.\nOn the price front, with energy prices increasing markedly, headline inflation – as measured by the 12 month change in the total personal consumption expenditures price index - rose from about 1-1/4% last fall to 2-3/4% in July. Excluding food and energy, PCE inflation has moved up from about 1% to 1-1/2% over the same period. Energy prices have dropped sharply over the past month and the prices for many other commodities also have softened. And with the unemployment rate still high and capacity utilization low, resource slack is likely putting downward pressure on prices. In addition, market measures of longer-run inflation expectations are at the low end of the range they have been running since last November.\nPutting these factors together, my outlook is for overall inflation over the medium term to fall back towards core and remain below the 2% level I see as consistent with the price stability leg of the Fed’s dual mandate.\n\nMonetary Policy and the Dual Mandate\nIn my view, central banks should focus on medium-term inflation. Over shorter periods, measured inflation rates are affected by all sorts of short-term influences, such as fluctuations in food and energy prices that are beyond the control of monetary policy. Furthermore, there are significant lags before policy actions influence inflation. So reacting too strongly to short-run influences simply adds noise to the policy-making process.\nSo, by this appropriate standard I think inflation likely will be below our goal of 2%. And of course, unemployment is much above its natural rate. Thus, at the moment, there is little conflict between our two goals. Both suggest at least some additional monetary policy accommodation would be helpful. However, given how truly badly we are doing in meeting our employment mandate, I argue that the Fed should seriously consider actions that would add very significant amounts of policy accommodation. Such further policy accommodation does increase the risk that inflation could rise temporarily above our long-term goal of 2%.\nBut I do not think that a temporary period of inflation above 2% is something to regard with horror. I do not see our 2% goal as a cap on inflation. Rather, it is a goal for the average rate of inflation over some period of time. To average 2%, inflation could be above 2% in some periods and below 2% in others. If a 2% goal was meant to be a cap on inflation, then policy would result in inflation averaging below 2% over time. I do not think this would be a good implementation of a 2% goal.1\nWith this in mind, I want to discuss the nature of policymaking under a dual mandate when we are far from our goals.\n\nWhat’s a Central Banker to Do? (Warning: Math Ahead)\nNormally, the deviations of the real economy and inflation from our objectives are small enough that any conflicts are minor. And the well-known Taylor Rule captures normal policy adjustments well, appropriately weighting output gaps and inflation deviations in the setting of our policy rate. However, the Taylor Rule is a rule-of-thumb, whose claims of empirical validity are based on its ability to track policy during periods of relatively modest volatility.2 The current recession is outside of the empirical experience of Taylor Rules calibrated to describe Federal Reserve actions.\nWe need to look beyond heuristic descriptions like the Taylor Rule to a more complete analysis of optimal monetary policymaking within a dual mandate framework. This topic has been studied extensively in the macroeconomic literature. Interestingly, one of the first modern treatments is due to John Taylor in an article published in Econometrica in 1979.3 This framework continues to be a mainstay of optimal policy analysis, as evidenced by a large literature that includes work by Michael Woodford in recent years.4 Taylor expresses the central bank’s dual-mandate objective as monetary policymakers attempting to minimize the weighted sum of squared deviations of inflation and the level of output from their goal values. That is, a central bank attempts to minimize a simple quadratic loss function like the following:\nL = (π – π*)2 + λ * (y – y*)2\nHere π and y are inflation and the (natural) logarithm of output, and π* and y* are the policy goals for these variables. In most formulations, y* is the log of the level of potential output—the level of output at which resource slack has a neutral influence on the level of inflation. Thus, (given the properties of logarithms) y – y* is the usual output gap, the percentage difference between actual and potential output. And π – π* is the gap between the actual and desired rates of inflation. Ideally, we’d like both of these gaps to be zero, but this usually won’t be the case. We measure the costs associated with the overall deviation of actual outcomes from the ideal with the quadratic loss function L. Note that for each policy goal, this loss function equally weights same-sized misses above and below target. \nThe coefficient λ determines the relative weight policymakers give to their misses on real output versus those on inflation. If λ is equal to 1, then a 1 percentage point deviation of inflation from its target gets the same weight in computing the overall costs of being away from the optimum as a 1 percentage point deviation of output from its potential.\nHowever, Ken Rogoff (1985) and others have argued that, in order to avoid inflationary biases that might creep into policy, a good, conservative central banker ought to conduct policy as if λ were less than one. 5 It’s reasonably conservative to set λ equal to ¼. That means the costs of a 1 percentage point output gap are judged to be only one-quarter as high as the costs of a 1 percentage point deviation of inflation from its goal. So a λ of ¼ puts a good deal of weight on keeping inflation near its goal.\nGiven that the Fed’s mandate is expressed in terms of employment, it is helpful to recall Okun’s Law, which says that a 1 percentage point gap between actual and potential output corresponds to a one half percentage point gap between unemployment and its natural rate. Making this translation in the loss function, we see that the conservative central banker attempts to minimize the equally weighted sum of squared inflation and unemployment deviations:\nL = (π - π*)2 + 1 * (u – u*)2\nwhere u and u* are the actual and natural rates of unemployment 6;\nThe bottom line is that a conservative and tough-minded central banker can still value deviations in unemployment from the natural rate equally with deviations in inflation from its target. Accordingly, an inflation rate of 5% against an inflation goal of 2% presents this policymaker with an equal-sized loss as a 9% unemployment rate against a conservative estimate of 6% for the natural rate of unemployment. (I call this conservative, because while we think a number of factors such as increased job mismatch and extended unemployment insurance benefits have temporarily boosted the natural unemployment rate in the U.S., these factors are not expected to persist in the long-run).\nThere also is an immediate corollary: If you aren’t as riled up over 9% unemployment as you would be over 5% inflation, then you either put even less weight on unemployment deviations in your loss function or you think that the natural unemployment rate is substantially higher than 6%.\nI’ll address the latter possibility later. However, I now want to turn to reasons why the challenges to policymaking in the current situation are orders of magnitude larger than those we face during more normal times. To preview, these are because: (a) we find ourselves in the aftermath of a Reinhart-Rogoff type financial crisis, which has resulted in severe headwinds weighing on the recovery process; (b) the economic costs of the vast amounts of unused resources in the economy are very large; and (c) the zero lower bound is a constraint on standard monetary policy actions, requiring a broader monetary policy framework if we are to provide more policy accommodation.\n\nAdditional Challenge #1: Reinhart and Rogoff’s Great Contraction and Debt Overhang\nThe Financial Crisis of 2008 left an enormous obstacle in the path of the U.S. recovery. From peak to trough, $13 trillion of wealth was erased from household balance sheets. Although the value of households’ assets declined dramatically, their debt levels remained roughly the same. Many borrowers took on additional debt during the period of high and rising asset valuations, and high employment and income growth were key fundamentals for servicing these debt payments into the future. These debt burdens are key contributors to the headwinds I discussed earlier when I talked about the economic outlook. As I noted then, they appear to be substantially more onerous than we had expected.\nIn their book This Time is Different, Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff documented the substantially more detrimental effects that financial crises typically impose on economic recoveries.7 Recoveries following severe financial crises take many years longer than usual, and the risk of a second recession before the ultimate economic recovery returns to the previous business cycle peak is substantially higher. In a related study of the current U.S. experience, Reinhart and Rogoff show that the current anemic recovery is following the typical post-financial crisis path quite closely, given the size of the financial contraction.8 It would be nice to point to some features of the recovery that suggest greater progress relative to the Reinhart-Rogoff benchmark. But those are hard to come by.\nIt bears keeping in mind that the Reinhart-Rogoff predictions of a slow recovery are based on historical averages of macroeconomic performances across many different countries at many different times. They highlight a challenge we face today, but from the standpoint of the underlying economic analysis, there is nothing pre-ordained about these outcomes. They are not theoretical predictions—rather, they are reduced form correlations. The economy can perform better than it did in these past episodes if policy responds better than it did in those situations. In my opinion, maintaining the Fed’s focus on both of our dual-mandate responsibilities is a necessary and critical element of an appropriate response to the financial crisis that can produce better economic outcomes.\n\nAdditional Challenge #2: Trying New and Nontraditional Policy Responses when the Economic Stakes are Enormous\nThe second critical challenge is to take actions that respect both the feasibility of what monetary policy can accomplish and the enormous risks to the future prospects of the U.S. economy.\nFor me, these risks are clear. It is painfully obvious that the large quantities of unused resources in the U.S. are an enormous waste. And it’s not just the current loss—over substantial periods of time, the skills of long-term unemployed workers decline, their re-employment prospects for similar jobs fade, and these reductions in skills have a lasting effect on the future growth potential of the economy.\nAs I noted in the introduction, some argue that there currently are severe limits to what further accommodative monetary policies can do to address these risks. It is essential to delineate clear alternative scenarios in which this additional accommodation would be futile. Such scenarios clearly exist, but they are very dark and pessimistic interpretations of our current situation. I am personally much more optimistic and I don’t subscribe to this pessimistic view; but let me describe it as I understand it.\nEssentially, the hypothesis that limits aggressive policy actions assumes that the productive capabilities of the U.S. have declined markedly in recent years and that many workers who were productively employed just a few years ago are now essentially obsolete. In this scenario, either much of the past decade of prosperity was an illusion or, alternatively within the space of only a few years, the productive potential of the U.S. collapsed for some unexplained reason.\nI suppose it is natural to believe that some elements of the story are true. But for me, the evidence for this is minimal, and the implications for productive capacity are exceedingly pessimistic. And even if it is true, the market mechanism should cause wages and prices to adjust in order to reemploy unused resources. For example, there should be some lower real wage that would make it profitable for firms to fund the necessary on-the-job training for workers who need some modest acquisition of skills. According to this pessimistic hypothesis, something is preventing the market’s pricing mechanism from achieving such results within a satisfactory time frame.\nMy own view is more optimistic and, I believe, more consistent with the idea that our best days are ahead. Without a compelling explanation for the hypothesis that the productive capability of the U.S. has been diminished, I think the evidence favors the belief that aggregate demand is simply much too low today. After all, today there are roughly 14 million unemployed Americans. Only a few years ago, there were only about half that many. It is hard to believe that an additional 7 million Americans have suddenly lost the necessary skills to work in today’s economy, and I have not seen any evidence supporting such a dramatic and rapid loss of skills.\nIn the more optimistic case to which I subscribe, the productive capacity and potential wealth of the U.S. have not been permanently damaged and currently unused resources are still productive. Accordingly, in my opinion, monetary policy should be used more aggressively to increase aggregate demand. In time, a reduction in excessive risk aversion, supported by natural market forces would reestablish the fundamentals that previously supported stronger growth and full employment. In this way, large social losses would be mitigated. By stimulating aggregate demand, we can have \"Morning in America, again\" and our best days can still be ahead of us.\nBut the clock is ticking—the longer we wait, the more likely it is that unutilized skills diminish to the point that more permanent damage takes hold.\n\nChallenge #3: Monetary Policy Held Back by Zero Lower Bound\nBy now, the third obstacle is quite well-known: the federal funds rate in the U.S. is currently constrained by the zero lower bound on interest rates. Given the economic scenario and inflation outlook I have discussed, were it possible, I would favor cutting the federal funds rate by several percentage points. But since the federal funds rate is already near zero now, that’s not an option.\nTo date, the Fed’s policy-making committee, the FOMC, has used a number of nontraditional policy tools to impart greater financial accommodation. I have fully supported these policies. Today, however, I simply think we need to do more.\nIn a recent Financial Times comment, Michael Woodford of Columbia University discussed how greater clarity in policy communications would help.9 As I see it, current financial conditions are more restrictive than I favor, because households, businesses, and markets place too much weight on the possibility that Fed policy will turn restrictive in the near to medium term.\nThe FOMC’s announcement in August that it anticipates short-term rates remaining low through mid-2013 was certainly a step in the right direction, because it significantly raised the hurdle for early policy tightening. However, I think our dual mandate responsibilities and the strong impediments of the financial crisis argue for a more aggressive approach.\nOne way to provide more accommodation would be to make a simple conditional statement of policy accommodation relative to our dual mandate responsibilities. The goal would be to enhance economic growth and employment while maintaining disciplined inflation performance. This conditionality could be conveyed by stating that we would hold the federal funds rate at extraordinarily low levels until the unemployment rate falls substantially, say from its current level of 9.1% to 7.5% or even 7%, as long as medium-term inflation stayed below 3%.\nWith regard to the inflation marker, we have already experienced unduly low inflation of 1%; so against an objective of 2 percent, 3 percent inflation would be an equivalent policy loss to what we have already experienced. On the unemployment marker, a decline to 7.5% would be quite helpful. However, weighed against an overly conservative estimate for the natural rate of unemployment of 6%, it still represents a substantial policy loss—indeed, one that is higher than the policy loss from high inflation of 3%.\nAccordingly, these triggers remain quite conservatively tilted in favor of disciplined inflation performance over enhanced growth and employment, and it would not be unreasonable to consider an even lower unemployment threshold that would be enough progress to justify the start of policy tightening.\nThere are other policies that could give clearer communications of our policy conditionality with respect to observable data. For example, I have previously discussed how state-contingent, price-level targeting would work in this regard.10 Another possibility might be to target the level of nominal GDP, with the goal of bringing it back to the growth trend that existed before the recession. I think these kinds of policies are worth contemplating—they may provide useful monetary policy guidance during extraordinary circumstances such as we find ourselves in today.\nThe trigger policy I noted above and level-targeting policies may result in inflation running at rates that would make us uncomfortable during normal times. But we should not be afraid of such temporarily higher inflation results today. As I noted earlier, Ken Rogoff (1985) has written that in normal times, we may want conservative central bankers as institutional offsets to what would otherwise be inflationary biases in the monetary policy process. But these are not usual times—we are in the aftermath of a financial crisis with stubborn debt overhangs that are weighing on activity. And as Rogoff himself wrote in a recent piece in the Financial Times, higher inflation could aid the deleveraging process.11 To quote him: \"Any inflation above 2 per cent may seem anathema to those who still remember the anti-inflation wars of the 1970s and 1980s, but a once-in-75-year crisis calls for outside-the-box measures.\"\n\nConclusion\nLast year about this time economic conditions deteriorated to the point that we undertook discussions on how to provide further monetary accommodation—and we ended up with our second round of large scale asset purchases. Now, one year later, we again find ourselves with a weakened economic outlook and again trying to decide what further accommodation to provide. I’m sure everyone will agree that we seriously don’t want to be in this position again at this time next year. I believe that means we need to take strong action now.\nThanks.\n\nNotes\n1 The Committee's interpretation of its mandate often is expressed as inflation of \"2 percent, or a bit less.\" This does not mean keeping inflation in a narrow band capped by 2%. The \"2 percent, or a bit less\" interpretation of our price stability mandate comes from the responses to the Survey of Economic Projections which FOMC participants submit four times per year, and in which the majority of participants have said 2% is their long-run forecast under conditions that include appropriate monetary policy. Because inflation is determined in the long run by monetary policy, it follows that these long-run forecasts can be interpreted as participants' views on the level of inflation most consistent with the Committee's mandate. The \"or a bit less\" is added because a minority of participants submit long-run forecasts that are below 2%.\n2 The exercise is described in Taylor, John B., 1993, \"Discretion Versus Policy Rules in Practice,\" Carnegie-Rochester Series on Public Policy,Vol. 39, pp. 195-214; and Taylor, John B., 1999, \"An Historical Analysis of Monetary Policy Rules,\" in Monetary Policy Rules, John B.

            "content": "Thank you, Greg, for that kind introduction. It is a pleasure to be here.\nBefore offering my perspective on the U.S. economy and monetary policy, let me emphasize that the views that I am presenting today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or my other colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nDual Mandate\nAs you know, the Fed has a dual mandate from Congress to encourage conditions that foster both maximum employment and price stability. The FOMC conducts monetary policy with these objectives in mind. In normal times, the FOMC operates by appropriately setting the federal funds rate, which is the interest rate on overnight loans between banks. Other actions may be taken during unusual times, such as those we faced in the past several years.\nRegardless of the economic environment in which we operate, it is vital that the Fed communicate its strategies as clearly as possible. This issue of transparency in conducting monetary policy is not new. To paraphrase John Adams, “All the perplexities, confusion and distress in America arise … from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation.” For an institution that is so closely scrutinized, the Fed still strives to find ways to better communicate its views. Chairman Bernanke’s recent press conference is an example of this.\nAs we navigate the coming quarters and contemplate altering the stance of monetary policy someday, clear communication will play an even more important role. I am reminded of a story. In 1981 James Tobin won the Nobel Prize in economics for his contributions to portfolio selection theory. At a news conference, when asked to explain the sophisticated models underlying his analysis of risk and return in layman’s terms, the Nobel Laureate succinctly stated, “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.” He managed to condense a large body of complex work into language that most people could understand.\nI hope I can be as clear today in offering my viewpoints on the economy and monetary policy.\nSo, where do we stand relative to our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability?\nRecent Developments in Economic Activity\nLet me start with a discussion of output growth and employment. Following a deep and lengthy recession, the U.S. economy is now on firmer footing. There are many reasons to be optimistic. Over the past three months, job growth has averaged 233,000 per month, up from an anemic 104,000 over the previous three months. The unemployment rate has fallen from 9.8 percent last November to 9 percent in April. The improving jobs picture supports household income and with it household spending. Furthermore, low interest rates and higher saving have helped shore up household balance sheets, although net worth is still far below where it was prior to the recession. Businesses’ balance sheets have improved as well—indeed, the improvements here have been more dramatic, and many firms now hold ample cash reserves. In addition, those looking for external funding can obtain low-cost financing from capital markets, and the availability and terms of bank lending have improved notably from crisis levels. Business investment in equipment and software has been robust, and the hesitancy businesses have shown in hiring is slowly giving way to plans for moderate employment growth. Manufacturing is particularly strong, reflecting in part the solid demand for capital goods from both here and abroad. On the policy front, monetary policy remains accommodative and, on the fiscal side, payroll tax reductions and tax incentives for investment expensing help support business spending.\nNonetheless, areas of weakness remain. Both residential construction and commercial construction remain at very depressed levels of activity. Although improving, access to credit remains limited and may still constrain some borrowers. State and local governments are making deep cuts in spending as they struggle to balance their budgets. Higher energy prices represent a reduction in domestic purchasing power for both households and businesses—I will speak more about the impact of rising energy and commodities prices later. And the recent natural disaster in Japan may negatively affect certain segments of the U.S. economy that rely on Japanese imports. Iindeed, in April we saw parts shortages arising from the earthquake triggering a drop in motor vehicle production in the U.S.\nSo, given these upside and downside risks to economic activity, what is my outlook for growth?\nForecasts for Output and Unemployment\nAt our FOMC meetings, my colleagues and I discuss recent developments and provide forecasts for key measures of economic activity. These forecasts are reported four times a year; the most recent ones were released just after our April meeting. Most of the projections for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2011 were in the range of 3.1 to 3.3 percent. This is down about half a percentage point since our January projections were made. But the revision is largely due to a weak first-quarter GDP number, which in turn appears to have been substantially influenced by transitory factors such as the timing of weak defense spending. Growth is expected to pick up as we move forward, with most forecasts for 2013 falling between 3.5 and 4.3 percent.\nDespite these clear signs of progress, the roughly 3.75 percent growth we anticipate for the next couple years is too low to generate swift relief in the labor market. Simple calculations that relate real GDP growth to changes in the unemployment rate suggest this growth would reduce the unemployment rate by roughly three-quarters of a percentage point a year. Of course this calculation is based on historical averages and may not be a good approximation in the current economic environment for a number of reasons.1 Nevertheless, with the current unemployment rate standing at 9 percent, these calculations suggest that it could take quite some time for the unemployment rate to return to the 5.25 to 5.5 percent range that most FOMC participants see as being consistent with our dual mandate in the long run. Indeed, my colleagues project the unemployment rate will still be relatively high—in the range of 6.8 to 7.2 percent—at the end of 2013.\nSuch a forecast for moderate real GDP growth and its implications for slow improvement in the labor market lead me to believe that accommodative monetary policy continues to be warranted to address this part of our dual mandate.\nInflation\nNow let me turn to the inflation component of our dual mandate. Before discussing the outlook, let me start with some basics that should help clarify my reasoning.\nAt the risk of sounding like an economics professor (which I was), inflation is defined as a continuing increase in the general level of prices of all goods and services in the economy.\nThere are two important elements to this definition. First, inflation is broad-based. It is a tendency for the prices of most goods and services to rise more or less in concert. And second, inflation is a continuing increase in the price level over time: A one-off increase in the price level is not inflation. Price increases have to be sustained.\nAs corporate treasurers, you examine the yield curve to get an idea of how the market foresees developments in short-term rates continuing into the future. For example, events may reduce the slope of the yield curve by moving short-term rates up much more than longer-term rates. This would mean markets are not expecting the higher level of short-term rates to be sustained—they are not building in a change in the level of the yield curve. We policymakers face a similar puzzle in weighing the impact of inflationary developments today: We must evaluate the near-term influence and consider whether the entire path of future inflation also has been altered. Are we just seeing a change in the slope, or are we seeing a change in the level of inflation?\nKeep these ideas in mind as I turn to a discussion of the recent run-up in gasoline and commodities prices.\nGlobal Commodities Markets\nThe surge in prices paid at the pump and the headlines of rising food prices are striking. Such increases put a dent in consumers’ purchasing power, and many households have had to make difficult adjustments. \nWhat accounts for these sharp price increases? The markets for oil and commodities are global. Changes in demand and supply originating in far-off places have an immediate impact on prices everywhere. There is swelling demand from developing countries for food to feed an increasingly middle-class population, as well as increasing demand for industrial commodities to build infrastructure. At the same time, demand from rebounding economies is picking up. On the supply side, unique events have temporarily constrained output for many products. Drought in Russia and flooding in Australia have decreased global food supplies. And fear that turmoil in oil-producing countries may restrict the flow of petroleum has helped push up the price of crude oil.\nRelative Price Changes\nThese price increases have resulted in painful budget decisions for many households. But it is a mistake to point to an extraordinary rise in the price of any particular good—such as gasoline—and extrapolate that price increase as having broader inflationary relevance.\n\nChart 1\n\nAlthough gasoline and food prices dominate the headlines, the chart shows that almost 80 percent of the goods and services consumers purchase have had price increases of less than two percent over the past year. This is the highest percentage of expenditures with under 2 percent inflation since the mid-1960s, when total consumer inflation was a mere 1.5 percent. Furthermore, in periods of high inflation, one observes a large fraction of prices increasing more than two percent. That does not appear to describe the current situation.\nThe increase in the price of a single item makes it more expensive relative to all other goods and services—what economists call a change in a relative price. This is far different from the concept of inflation as a continuing increase in average prices. Indeed, changes in relative prices provide important signals to market participants, encouraging consumers to find ways to economize and giving suppliers an incentive to increase production. Moreover, in such cases, there is not a direct role for monetary policy: Monetary policy cannot affect the scarcity of resources that relative prices reflect.\nLimited Role for Relative Price Changes to Generate Inflation\nTo be sure, such relative price movements could evolve into sustained price increases for a broader base of goods and services—that is, they could possibly generate inflation. Historical evidence suggests that rising commodity prices will generate inflation only if certain conditions prevail: price increases have to be sustained; commodities have to account for a large share of costs of production or wages have to increase in tandem with commodity prices; and consumer demand has to be firm enough that firms are able to pass through higher production costs to consumers. Given the historical evidence and the current state of the economy, I don’t think those conditions exist today. Therefore, I believe the impact of rising commodities prices on inflation will be limited.\nLet me briefly elaborate on each of these points.\n\nChart 2\n\nThis chart shows the change in petroleum prices in a given year on the horizontal axis and the change in core inflation as measured by Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index the following year on the vertical axis. Core PCE inflation is a general measure of inflation that the FOMC tends to focus on. It has the benefit of stripping out the volatile food and energy components, leaving broad underlying trends. Each point on the graph represents a single year between 1981 and 2010.\nMost people seem to think that higher petroleum prices in one year are followed by higher prices for many goods and services the following year. And this certainly was the case in 1987, when petroleum prices rose about 30 percent. This rapid increase was followed by an increase in core PCE inflation of 0.6 percentage point in 1988. But this relationship between petroleum prices and subsequent inflation does not hold true at other times. In fact, there is very little evidence of petroleum price increases foretelling inflation.\n\nChart 3\n\nConsider 2009—a year in which we again had rapid oil price increases of about 30 percent. In the following year, rather than rising, core inflation actually declined 0.9 percentage point in 2010. History offers no clear patterns: Oil price increases are just as likely to be followed by lower core inflation in the coming year as they are to be followed by higher inflation.\n\nChart 4\n\nIn the chart this is shown by the solid regression line that describes the average relationship between the data. Rather than being positively sloped—indicating increasing oil prices are on average associated with increasing core inflation in the following year, the regression line is almost flat—indicating there is little systematic relationship between these data.\nIn addition, petroleum prices are quite volatile. For example, by the end of 2007 the price of West Texas Intermediate crude was just over 51 percent higher than it had been a year earlier. But the following year, all of that price increase was reversed. And think about the past few weeks: Oil prices fell about $15 per barrel in a matter of days early in May — and have stayed down since then.\nWage–Price Dynamics\nWhat about commodities in general? Although they are quite important for some products, commodities only contribute a minor portion to the total cost of bringing most items to market. And for commodity cost increases to influence consumer prices, firms must be able to pass cost increases on to customers. In today’s economy with many sectors still experiencing lax demand, many firms may not be able to pass on these cost increases. Instead, rising input costs will put a squeeze on their profit margins.\nIndeed, when talking about costs of production, the most important by far is the compensation paid to labor. In 2009, U.S. businesses spent about $480 billion on energy inputs, $250 billion on primary metals, and about $7.8 trillion on labor.\nThat same year a Wall Street Journal blog stated that in 2008, the purchasing power of the dollar had decreased by more than 95 percent since 1913.2 In isolation the fact that the price level is about 20 times higher now than it was just before World War I is quite disturbing. But it is important to remember that wages have more than kept pace so that the standard of living far exceeds 1913 levels. In fact, personal income is now 20 times higher since just 1967, at the height of the Vietnam War. The point is that over long periods of time wages and prices both tend to trend up. \nOn this point, an economist I know talks about having received a nickel as a weekly allowance. (This is obviously a long time ago. My kids would have scoffed at the idea of a nickel.) Each week this future economist would take her nickel and head to the local candy store to purchase a particular candy bar that cost exactly 5 cents. One week she was stunned to find the same candy bar—which only a week earlier had cost a nickel—now cost a dime. Realizing that she would need to consume less or earn more, she asked her parents to double her allowance. Fortunately for her, her parents agreed. Had they not, she would have cut her consumption in half.\nIndeed, when we have seen large and sustained bouts of inflation in the U.S., they have been accompanied by large and sustained increases in Iabor costs. It’s what we used to refer to as a “wage–price spiral” during periods of high inflation in the 1970s and 1980s. But the interactions between wages, prices, and inflation are complicated. A wage–price spiral—or the lack of one—reflects interactions from both the cost and demand sides. With regard to demand, suppose prices rise but consumers’ incomes do not. In order to maintain their consumption, they must lower saving (which may include spending out of assets). There is a limit to how much they would be willing to do so. To use an analogy, fires require oxygen to burn. Without it, the fire dies out and the damage is limited. So without rising wages and incomes, price increases may be difficult to sustain—and sustainability is an important aspect of inflation. But if wage growth keeps up with price increases, there is no such offsetting influence on demand. Furthermore, unless accompanied by gains in productivity, there is a corresponding increase in firms’ costs of production.\nSo what are the prospects for wages and labor costs? As I have already outlined, I believe there is substantial slack in labor markets. High unemployment, low labor force participation, and the large number of people working part time for economic reasons suggest weak overall labor demand. This is translating into very small increases in wages and salaries; as measured by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Employment Cost Index, they rose just 1-1/2 percent for the past year and are nearly the lowest recorded increase since the series began in 1983. At the same time, though slowing some recently, productivity growth generally has been fairly well maintained. Consequently, we are not seeing upward pressure on prices coming from labor costs, and modest wage growth may also be a dampening influence on demand and consumer prices.\nInflation Outlook\nUnder the forecasts for output and unemployment I just discussed, I expect significant resource slack to remain in the economy for some time to come, and I also am expecting that slack to exert an important downward influence on inflationary pressures.\n\nMost of us on the FOMC have said that a PCE inflation rate of about 2 percent is consistent with our price stability mandate. Yet, core inflation—as measured by the change in the index over the past year—has been running well below this 2 percent rate for about two years. It has been under 1 percent for the past several months, and even total inflation for the past 12 months has just reached 1.8 percent. \nSome of the recent readings on core measures have been somewhat higher than they were just a few months ago. The new information has caused me to bump up my personal forecast for core inflation in the near term. And while I think food and energy prices will push the total PCE index up faster this year—maybe to about a 2 to 2-1/2 percent rate—I do not see total inflation running very far from core for very long. In our most recent forecasts, FOMC participants’ projections were for total PCE inflation to fall in the 2 to 2-3/4 percent range in 2011 and the 1-1/2 to 2 percent range in 2013. My own forecasts are closer to the bottom of these ranges.\nRisks to Inflation Outlook\nI am constantly assessing my inflation forecast against the incoming data. Developments that would cause me to change my view would be much stronger growth in real GDP than predicted in current forecasts, strong improvements in the labor market, and evidence that wage pressures on labor costs were starting to build. And as I just noted, today, there is no evidence of such pressures.\nAnother thing that would make me reassess my inflation outlook would be if medium-term inflationary expectations were to rise. Future inflation is determined in part by expectations of future inflation. Expectations of future inflation are an important element in businesses’ and households’ planning for the future. Right now, professional forecasters’ expectations of long-run inflation are in the neighborhood of 2 percent. Such expectations are factored into current spending and investment decisions and the wage setting process. But if some surprise event were to lead to higher expected inflation, businesses and households would internalize this new belief and take actions consistent with it. These actions would, in turn, put actual inflation on a higher path. If inflation expectations were to start to creep up because of rising commodity prices or any other factor, the FOMC would consider this important development and act accordingly to keep inflation expectations well grounded.\nTo recap, current measures of underlying inflation are subdued and are running lower than what the FOMC judges to be consistent with long-run price stability. To be sure, we see some increase in headline inflation due to higher food and energy prices, but we do not expect these to materially boost underlying inflationary trends. Moreover, existing resource gaps are still exerting countervailing downward pressure on inflation.\nWe will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations, and we will adjust policy if developments move our forecast to rates incompatible with our inflation mandate.\nMonetary Policy\nSlow progress in closing resource gaps and a medium-term outlook for inflation that is too low lead me to conclude that substantial policy accommodation continues to be appropriate. This accommodative policy will foster a return of economic conditions consistent with our dual mandate. We are providing this accommodation in two ways. The first is our commitment to keep short-term nominal policy rates low for an extended period. The FOMC’s policy statements have been very clear on this and have included this characterization for the federal funds rate since March 2009. The second is our large-scale asset purchase programs (LSAP) through which, by June, we most likely will have purchased all told $2.35 trillion of long-term Treasury and government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) issues. These purchases are aimed at directly influencing longer-maturity interest rates. They also play an important and useful communications role—they signal our commitment to keep short-term rates low for an extended period of time.\nConclusion\nIn closing, monetary policy evolves as economic circumstances change. It is vital that we evaluate the impact of new information on our forecasts and reassess the stance of monetary policy as circumstances warrant. Contemplating such adjustments in advance will help prepare us for the eventual time when a change in the stance of monetary policy will be necessary. Despite recent improvements to the outlook, we are not yet at that point. At that time, communication and transparency will be even more essential.\n\nNotes\n1 Structural factors, such as extended unemployment insurance benefits, may keep the unemployment rate elevated for quite some time.\n2 David Wessell, 2009, \"Wessel answers questions on potential bubbles, Paulson’s conflicts, more,\" Real Time Economics: Economic Insights and Analysis from the Wall Street Journal, blog, August 10.",

            "content": "Four Lessons from the Financial Crisis\nGood morning. Thank you, Dimitri, for that very kind introduction. I’m delighted to be here today to be a part of this excellent conference. This year, as in years past, Federal Reserve policymakers have had the opportunity to participate in this distinguished event, and so it will come as no surprise to you that I must begin by saying that my remarks today are my own and do not represent the views of the FOMC or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nHyman Minsky’s Contributions\nThis conference honors the work of Hyman Minsky, a scholar who devoted much of his study to understanding the nature of financial crises. Minsky’s key insight was that times of economic quiescence can encourage behaviors that often lead to the next period of turbulence. During periods of quiet, market participants become inattentive to assessing, quantifying, and managing risk. The discipline of risk management atrophies; risks are underestimated and underhedged. As a result, the economy becomes less resilient to the next big shock.\nMinsky’s insights ring true today. The 23 years before the recent crisis were characterized by a low level of business cycle volatility that was virtually unprecedented. This period came to be known as the “Great Moderation,” a moniker that deliberately contrasts with the “Great Depression” of the 1930s. Financial participants I talk with acknowledge that during the Great Moderation, risk-management processes and procedures became less disciplined. The risk managers who had lived through the turmoil of the 1970s and early 1980s had retired. They were replaced by a generation of financial managers who grew up never seeing a full blown financial panic or a deep economic recession. This lack of historical perspective on risk was combined with a myopic focus induced by compensation heavily weighted towards short-term performance. As a result, long-term risks imbedded in balance sheets were not assessed, quantified or managed. The failure to appropriately value these risks meant that firms had not taken measures to mitigate the potential impact of a downturn. They were unprepared for the shocks of 2007 to 2009, which included a 30 percent decline in housing values and severe liquidity stresses. This lack of preparation, in turn, made the resulting panic much worse, contributing to a $13 trillion decline in aggregate wealth and the Great Recession, which has left us with huge resource gaps that have yet to close.\n\nThe Response to the Crisis of 2007–09\nBy any measure, the financial turmoil we endured from 2007 through 2009 ranks as a once-in-a-lifetime crisis. The unprecedented stresses during this crisis required unprecedented policy responses. The Fed’s monetary policy response pushed the federal funds rate down to zero and expanded the Fed balance sheet by $1.7 trillion in large-scale asset purchases. The Fed’s credit easing policy response created innovative facilities to provide liquidity and credit to those markets that needed it most. In doing so, Chairman Bernanke and the Fed drew on lessons from the Great Depression, from the Japanese experiences in the 1990s, and from a vast amount of economic research,1 all of which point to the critical role of central bank liquidity provision in managing financial crises.\nThe regulatory response from the Fed and the other bank supervisors raised the level of scrutiny on large complex banking organizations and increased transparency, most visibly through the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program. This program subjected the largest 19 banks to uniform stress tests to ensure that they would remain adequately capitalized should the economy encounter more difficult conditions than expected. And finally, the legislative response was to enact the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act which includes, among many other things, establishment of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, new failure resolution procedures, heightened prudential standards for large banking organizations and strengthened regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market.\nToday I would like to discuss four lessons that I have taken away from this time period. An undercurrent that runs through these lessons is, “Did we get this right?” These have been enormous policy responses to enormous disruptions to our economy. None of these policies are guaranteed to work perfectly. But taken together, they can provide stronger safeguards for the banking industry and the economy. We need to learn from the events of the last four years if we are to successfully combat future crises that might arise.\n\nLesson #1: The Importance of Market Discipline\nThe first lesson I want to highlight is that market discipline is probably the best line of defense against systemic instability. At a minimum, market discipline is a vital element in our defenses. A bottom-line message should be: Creditors need to expect losses if a firm they lend to gets in trouble.\nThere are many reasons why market discipline can fail. Some are inherent to the process of financial intermediation, and help justify the regulatory structures I will discuss in a moment. But one critical factor that does not fall in this category is the “too-big-to-fail” problem.\nMany observers recognized this long before the crisis, including former Minneapolis Fed president Gary Stern in his prescient book, aptly titled Too Big To Fail: The Hazards of Bank Bailouts.2 Gary wrote this book in 2004, a full three years before the onset of the crisis. His warnings hold true today. The fundamental defense against excessive risk-taking by financial intermediaries is that their creditors demand adequate risk premiums against those states of the world where the intermediaries take losses. The assumption of government intervention changes this calculus to the benefit of banks and their creditors, but to the detriment of society as a whole.\nMake no mistake: Risky debt must be more expensive, and all debt has risk. We know we’re in trouble when financial market participants take it for granted that the liabilities of large financial firms will ultimately be guaranteed by the government. We’ve seen striking examples of this problem. The most egregious example probably is the wafer thin spreads paid by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac over Treasuries. Clearly, investors expected that Fannie and Freddie would be bailed out in the event of a crisis, and these expectations were, of course, fulfilled to the tune of $154 billion to date.\nAn article in the New York Times3 from 2009 gives another striking example of this too-big-to-fail psychology. The article discusses how the huge asset management firm Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO) took large positions in General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC) bonds in 2008. PIMCO paid just pennies on the dollar for the bonds. The article describes the purchase as an explicit bet that the government would provide support to GMAC, ensuring that its debt would pay off at par. Needless to say, PIMCO won the bet. Given this market psychology, it’s no surprise that ratings agencies explicitly take into consideration the expectation of a government bailout when rating large financial corporations.\nWhat would market equilibrium look like without the too-big-to-fail psychology? How would we know that creditors of large financial institutions don’t expect to be rescued by the government? Clearly investors would continue to hold corporate bonds and securities, including those issued by large financial firms. The difference would be that the spreads of even highly rated securities would be larger than in a too-big-to-fail regime, reflecting their true levels of risk. Such bonds would be priced to reflect their appropriate place within the spectrum of risk, not as quasi-governmental liabilities priced at a modest premium over Treasuries.\nIn addition, ratings agencies would take minimal account of possible public bailouts in determining the probability of default or loss in the event of default. Finally, liabilities of large firms would continue to be used as collateral for repurchase agreements and derivatives transactions. But the risk of these liabilities would be recognized upfront, with substantial initial haircuts, even in “good times.”\nAs spot-on as Gary Stern’s insights were when he warned us of the danger of bailouts, the continued puzzle in all of this is, “How do we get there from here?” Market discipline is devilishly hard to achieve. How do we convince market participants that we really have made a transition to the better equilibrium without too-big-to-fail and that creditors of failing financial firms will bear real losses?\nThe transition to the equilibrium without bailouts means a reduction in the safety net and a market-driven adjustment in liquidity financing, just as markets today are recovering from the crisis. How can such a transition be made credible? The Dodd–Frank Act’s new failure resolution procedures could help. They are aimed at preventing any future taxpayer bailouts of a large financial institution through a liquidation process that will provide against a disorderly collapse. The act goes so far as to bar the use of public funds in a failure resolution. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has already begun this rule-writing; however, the complexity of the liquidation process requires that the FDIC maintain certain discretion in terms of the treatment of creditors But perhaps more importantly, the new resolution process requires an affirmative decision by banking regulators and the Secretary of the Treasury before the FDIC can even be appointed as receiver. Will creditors today believe that this discretionary process will force them to take losses in some future crisis? I’m not sure.\nWhat I’m looking for is evidence that there’s been a sea change in investor expectations. Sometimes looming risks will lay dormant. But sometimes events will help crystallize such latent challenges right on our doorstep. For example, regardless of one’s opinion on the public pension controversy that recently emerged in Wisconsin, the way public passions erupted on this issue is strong evidence that the rules of the game have changed and that decisions about public pension funding will be met with intense voter scrutiny in the future. I’m hoping some day to see this sort of dramatic clear and decisive evidence that bondholders of major institutions know that the rules of the game have changed. They need to come to the belief that future financial workouts will occur without special assistance from the government. To date, though, I haven’t seen very strong evidence that these investors get the message.\n\nLesson #2: Don’t Burden Monetary Policy with Too Many Mandates\nSo the first lesson is the importance of market discipline, and the practical difficulties of imposing such discipline on the markets. The second lesson I take from the crisis is that it’s best not to burden monetary policy with too many mandates. Under the Federal Reserve Act, the Fed has a statutory obligation to foster price stability and maximum employment. This is known as the dual mandate.\nThe dual mandate already requires the Fed to accomplish two objectives with a single tool which is the management of short-term interest rates. However, the correlation of our two objectives is high enough that this apparent insufficiency of tools is rarely a problem. For example, at present, we’re underrunning both our inflation objective and our employment objective—both call for monetary policy accommodation. But we would be faced with a much tougher job if we added a third objective to hit with only one tool—particularly if it were not well correlated with the first two.\nThis is why I’m concerned when some argue that monetary policy should pursue a third objective: to foster systemic stability by attacking incipient asset bubbles. Many observers argue that the current accommodative monetary policy stance, which is clearly called for by both elements of the dual mandate, may be “overheating” asset markets, possibly increasing the risk of a destabilizing asset bubble. Observers point to the impressive gains in equity markets over the past two years, narrowing junk bond spreads, and certain developments in the market for leveraged loans, such as the return of so-called covenant lite contracts. Are these developments evidence of an incipient bubble? I don’t think so.\nBut even if there were stronger evidence of a bubble, I’m not convinced that leaning against it is good policy. Even if the Fed could accurately detect a bubble in real time, and even if we decided that a bubble-pricking exercise would be warranted, monetary policy is too blunt an instrument for this task. An effort to do so would affect a whole range of macroeconomic and financial variables well beyond the targeted asset prices. That is, our attempts to counter a hypothetical future bubble would end up weakening our efforts to achieve the stabilization benefits embodied in the dual mandate.\nTo take a concrete example, consider the period following the end of the 2001 recession. Even after the recession had ended, both inflation and payroll employment dropped substantially for another 18 months. By mid-2003, inflation, as measured in real time, had fallen to 0.7 percent, a level low enough to raise worries of deflation. And over one million additional jobs had been lost since the end of the recession. The Fed responded by reducing interest rates, with rates reaching 1 percent in June 2003 and remaining there for a full year. Some observers believe that this policy accommodation exacerbated the subsequent housing bubble. They argue we should have increased rates in 2003 to choke it off. But in that macroeconomic environment, no Fed could have changed course without high degrees of certainty that a debilitating bubble existed, that monetary policy could successfully burst the bubble, and that the benefits of doing so outweighed the costs of higher unemployment and even lower inflation. Such evidence simply wasn’t present in 2003.\nIn fact, econometric studies of this period attribute very little of the surge in residential investment and house prices to unusually loose monetary policy. For example, one study that looked at what would have happened if the funds rate had been boosted by 200 basis points in 2004 found it would have only reduced residential investment by one-quarter percent of GDP. This, in turn, would have increased the unemployment rate by one-half percentage point. The authors conclude that a monetary policy intervention big enough to have significantly reduced housing would have done a good deal of damage to the economy.4 In retrospect, one might argue that the damage would have been less than what we ended up experiencing. Maybe this is so, but I have not seen supporting empirical analysis. But even if it were the case, this is using hindsight in the extreme.\nMy conclusion is that monetary policy is the right tool to achieve our goals for economic growth and price stability, and that its effectiveness at achieving these goals should not be compromised by additional mandates.\n\nLesson #3: Combating Systemic Instability with Prudential Regulation\nBut this certainly does not let us off the hook when it comes to fostering financial stability. Rather, the Federal Reserve and other governmental bodies have an additional tool—prudential regulation. That is the proper instrument to use against further financial disruption.\nThe critical importance of financial regulation is the third lesson I draw from the events of the past few years. Prudential regulation ensures that a financial organization has adequate financial safeguards, sound policies and procedures and robust internal controls, along with a strong governance structure to set clear objectives and to monitor those objectives. If these conditions are met, then the organization will have the tools to operate in a safe and sound manner. The role of bank examinations in verifying these outcomes is essential to make sure these objectives are fulfilled.\nBut with prudential regulation too there are caveats. Combating systemic instability with complex, forward-looking regulatory responses is tough to get right. Typically, risks and imbalances in financial markets take years to build up. In order to control these potential risks, policymakers must take resolute action, and this action must be taken early. However, indicators of potential problems are usually ambiguous, and the cost–benefit trade-offs of aggressive action are rarely clear.\nConsider, for example, the commercial real estate (CRE) market. In June of 2007, only 1.8 percent of these loans held by depository institutions were noncurrent. By the end of 2010 this fraction had increased sixfold. For the riskier construction and land development sector, things were even worse, with 16 percent of loans noncurrent at the end of 2010 compared to only 1.4 percent in June 2007.\nWhat could forward-looking prudential regulation have done to mitigate this deterioration in the commercial real estate market? When I asked my supervisory staff this question, their answers were a bit discouraging. The consensus was that we needed to act very early, probably in 2004 or 2005. But this was two or three years before the problems in this sector became clear. Realistically, it would have been very difficult to argue in 2005 that it was necessary to rein in this lending. The banks would give very good arguments why their business was well controlled. They would stress that the CRE loans on their books would be securitized and sold off in short order. Furthermore, real estate prices were rising, delinquencies were almost nonexistent, and various hedges were implemented. I wish it weren’t so, but given such arguments, it takes extraordinary confidence to make a contrarian call and rein in a profitable line of business that at the time faces negligible difficulties. In summary, prudential supervision is critical but can be difficult to implement perfectly.\n\nLesson #4: Keep It Simple\nSo this brings me to the fourth lesson: Additional safeguards are necessary, and the best of such safeguards are simple regulatory principles that require minimal discretion in their real-time execution.\nSuppose you were designing the defenses for a medieval fort. You could implement complex retractable gates and fences, but these might take time and decisive action to employ. Perhaps a more robust defense would be the simplest: Build a wall around the entire city, or build the city on a mountaintop.\nSimilarly, regulatory measures that rely less on judgment may prove to be more robust when a crisis hits. An obvious example would be substantial minimum capital requirements, perhaps increasing with the size of the firm. The simplest approach, involving the least discretion, would be to impose a minimal leverage ratio on the firm’s entire asset base. This sort of leverage ratio can be implemented as a backstop to the important, but more complex, risk-based capital standards, which require a discretionary process of risk assessment on an asset-by-asset basis.\nCapital protects the most senior debt of the firm, ensuring that it is low risk. Such low-risk debt serves a liquidity function in the shadow banking system analogous to that of insured deposits in retail banking in that it doesn’t require monitoring by the debt holder.5 It’s essential that senior debt serving this liquidity function be close to bulletproof. Adequate capital should achieve this.\nHowever, capital is not designed to similarly protect subordinated debt. Such debt provides an incentive for creditors to monitor the risk profile of the firm with its price signaling to the market important changes in their assessment. A somewhat more complicated way to apply capital standards would be to require state-contingent debt that automatically converts to equity in a crisis situation. In the spirit of not relying on regulatory discretion, the key would be to have the conversion triggered automatically by market events.\nIn addition to stronger capital requirements, we should consider other simple, nondiscretionary regulatory standards. I favor simple minimum-liquidity requirements to limit the degree to which long-term assets can be financed with short-term liabilities. (The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is currently considering such standards.) In mortgage markets, strong underwriting standards should be imposed. Stability in the over-the-counter derivative markets can be enhanced by requiring central clearing for most contracts, and minimum collateral for the remaining contracts. And in all markets, regulations that enhance transparency can go a long way toward promoting market discipline. All of these measures are relatively simple to implement, and don’t rely on regulators having perfect information (or perfect wisdom).\nMake no mistake: These additional regulatory mandates will be costly. I remember speaking at our International Bank Conference in 2009 about how we wanted to make sure we never encounter another crisis like the one we just faced. Somewhat surprisingly, a banking industry official at the conference disagreed, saying that this was exactly the wrong prescription. He was fearful that regulatory efforts to maintain systemic stability would be too costly. I think this is a short-sighted position. It focuses on the costs of regulation without acknowledging the real benefits. Strong prudential regulation enhances systemic stability and ensures stronger economic growth through more efficient provision of funding. And these stability and growth benefits accrue to everyone, including the banking industry.\n\nConclusion\n As policymakers and regulators begin the process of building a more stable financial system, it is clear that we cannot rely on a single line of defense but instead need a series of safeguards. Our charge is to wisely apply the lessons learned over the past four years. We have learned that we cannot rely on monetary policy alone to ensure economic and financial stability. We have learned that we need a credible system of market discipline in which investors recognize the real possibilities of loss and set prices accordingly. And we have learned that this system needs to be supported by strong prudential regulation that monitors the performance of individual institutions while also ensuring that there are sufficient buffers to protect the system as a whole in times of crisis. This is a tall order, indeed, but I believe that we are on a path to a more effective structure that will ultimately help us create a more stable and resilient financial system, which is better able to withstand a future crisis.\n\nNotes\n1 See, for example, Bryant (1980) and Diamond and Dybvig (1983).

            "content": "It is my pleasure to return to South Carolina to speak to you about my views on the progress of the recovery, inflation and the course of monetary policy. I would like to thank Dean Teegen for that kind introduction.\nBefore offering my perspective on the U.S. economy and monetary policy, let me emphasize that the views that I am presenting today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or my other colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Fed has a dual mandate from Congress to encourage conditions that foster both maximum employment and price stability, and monetary policy decisions are made by the FOMC with these objectives in mind. In normal times, the FOMC operates by appropriately setting the federal funds rate, which is the interest rate on overnight loans between banks. Other actions may be taken during unusual times, such as those we have faced over the past several years. The voting members of the FOMC are members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Washington and a rotating group of the 12 regional Fed presidents. Chairman Bernanke presides over the Committee, and I am currently a voting member.\nSo, where do we stand today relative to our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability?\nFollowing a deep and lengthy recession, the U.S. economy is now in its second year of recovery. The recent data have been encouraging. But when we look at the past two years as a whole, the improvements have been disappointing. Too many people remain unemployed — some for extended periods — and too many businesses have not yet returned to full operations. Over the course of the recession, the economy lost more output, shed more jobs and experienced more wealth destruction than at any other time since the Great Depression. U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) declined by more than 4 percent. Over 8.5 million jobs were lost; the unemployment rate doubled to 10 percent; and the household sector lost more than $13 trillion in wealth.\nRecent data indicate that growth has picked up and suggest a more sustainable, though still moderate, economic expansion. There are many reasons to be optimistic. Improvements in labor markets and reductions in debt burdens are supporting household spending. Businesses’ balance sheets have improved — indeed, many have ample cash reserves to finance spending. Those looking for external funding can obtain low-cost financing from capital markets, and the availability and terms of bank lending have improved notably from crisis levels. Monetary policy remains accommodative. And the recently enacted federal payroll tax reductions and investment expensing provisions help prop up spending.\nOf course, there are still weak spots. Both residential construction and commercial construction remain at very depressed levels of activity. Some borrowers who are dependent on bank lending might still be constrained in their access to credit. Budgetary concerns weigh on state and local governments’ capacity to spend. And higher energy prices represent a reduction in domestic purchasing power, though at current prices this effect is still a modest one.\nMore recently, the earthquake and tsunami in Japan have taken a tremendous human toll. It is too early to assess the ultimate economic cost of these events to the Japanese and U.S. economies. However, certain segments of the U.S. economy that rely on goods imported from Japan — such as the auto and electronics sectors — will see interruptions in their supply chains, at least in the short run.\nSo, given these upside and downside risks to economic activity, what is my outlook for growth and inflation?\nAt our FOMC meetings, my colleagues and I discuss recent developments and provide our forecasts for key measures of economic activity. These forecasts are reported four times a year in the minutes of the FOMC meetings. The most recent forecasts were published in January. Most of the projections for real GDP growth in 2011 were in the range of 3.4 to 3.9 percent. Growth is expected to move higher still in 2012, and most forecasts for 2013 fall between 3.7 and 4.6 percent.  Incoming information suggests slightly lower growth this year than what had been predicted in January, but not a marked difference in the outlook. This is a welcome improvement over the roughly 2-1/2 percent annual growth since the recession trough in the middle of 2009.\nDespite clear signs of progress, I am not yet satisfied with the pace of improvement. After all, my projection of about 4 percent growth is only moderately higher than the growth rate of potential output. It thus implies only a moderate improvement relative to the levels of activity that we would expect to see if the recession had not occurred.\nThis shows through in the outlook for the unemployment rate. To be sure, the unemployment rate has fallen almost 1 percentage point in just the past three months. Even so, at its current level of 8.9 percent, the unemployment rate is well above the 5 percent at which it stood shortly before the economy slipped into recession. Historical experience tells us that 4 percent GDP growth would chip away something on the order of three-quarters of a percentage point a year from the unemployment rate — meaning it could be quite a while before we near the pre-recession rate.1\nFurthermore, most of the recent reduction in the unemployment rate is due to fewer people losing jobs. This is a good thing, but not as good as if we were also seeing more unemployed people moving back onto payrolls. Indeed, employment growth has been disappointing throughout the recovery. Employment still stands about 7.5 million jobs below its peak at the onset of recession. And over the past three months, payrolls have risen at a rate of only 125,000 per month. In my view, unemployment will remain uncomfortably high for too long relative to our employment objective. So accommodative monetary policy continues to be warranted to address this part of our dual mandate.\nLet me now discuss the price stability element of our mandate. As the FOMC statement after the March meeting noted, “measures of underlying inflation continue to be somewhat low relative to the levels that the Committee judges to be consistent, over the long run, with its dual mandate.” Put more simply, the Committee considers the current level of underlying inflation to be too low.\nGiven the recent sharp increases in food and energy prices, the statement that inflation is too low might make some of you wonder if the Committee members ever eat or fill up their own gas tanks. Let me assure you that we do. Indeed, my daughter takes special pleasure in giving me daily updates on how much it costs to fill up her car.  Stepping back from my own family’s experiences, I do recognize that in the past three months, energy prices rose at an annual rate of 29 percent. And food prices are up nearly 14 percent. Such increases clearly put a dent in consumers’ purchasing power, and some households have had to make some difficult adjustments.\nWhat accounts for the recent run-up in these prices? Rising demand plays an important role. Economic development continues to reach more and more people throughout the world, pushing up their demand for food and industrial commodities. On the supply side of the ledger, we’ve experienced some unique conditions over the past year that temporarily constrained output. The list of events is extraordinary:  The flooding in Australia and drought in Russia all put upward pressure on food prices, and uncertainty over petroleum supplies due to the turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa have boosted oil prices.\nIn such cases, there is not a direct role for monetary policy. Monetary policy cannot affect the scarcity of resources. Indeed, think about what happens when the price of a commodity rises but other prices do not change. We call this a change in the relative price of the commodity. Changes in relative prices provide an important signal to market participants, encouraging consumers to find ways to economize and giving suppliers an incentive to increase production. Changes in relative prices are not inflation. Inflation, by definition, is a continuing increase in the general level of prices of all goods and services in the economy.\nSo relative price changes become inflationary only if they somehow spur price increases for a broader range of other goods and services.  And if this were to happen, monetary policy would have a critical role to play. I will return to this point in a moment.\nThe Committee considers a wide variety of inflation measures when it evaluates the appropriate stance of policy. For our long-run policy goal, we concentrate on the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), which measures prices for a broad basket of the goods and services that households purchase. In the shorter term, however, we tend to focus on what we call core PCE inflation, which removes the volatile food and energy components from the total index. This does not mean that we think these prices are irrelevant. But food and energy prices are very volatile — both up and down. Being free of this volatility makes the core measure a better indicator of underlying broad inflation trends — and therefore a better guide of where inflation is heading. Of course, as I just alluded to, we monitor food and energy prices carefully with a particular eye out for whether they are influencing the broader pricing decisions that affect all goods and services.\nMost of us on the FOMC have said that a PCE inflation rate of about 2 percent is consistent with our price stability mandate. Yet, core inflation — as measured by the change in the index over the past year — has been running well below this 2 percent rate for about two years. It has been under 1 percent for the past several months, and even total inflation has just reached 1.5 percent.\nA whole host of measures that attempt to exclude the volatile and transient components of price changes to focus on the persistent underlying trends in inflation — trimmed mean PCE, trimmed mean Consumer Price Index (CPI), adjusted trimmed mean CPI, median CPI, just to name a few — tell the same story.2 (These indexes do not exclude food and energy per se, but instead use various other methodologies to try to eliminate irrelevant statistical noise and get at the underlying trends in the data.) In the January FOMC forecasts, most participants predicted that both core and overall inflation would be in the range of 0.9 to 1.6 percent at the end of 2013 — still below the 2 percent mark. Of course, that was in January. Because we’ve seen further increases in food and gasoline prices since January, some of the recent readings on core measures have been a bit higher.  The new information has caused me to bump up my personal forecast for core inflation, but only by a couple of tenths. And while I think food and energy prices will push the total PCE index up faster this year — maybe at about a 2 percent rate — I do not see total inflation running very far from core for very long.\nHow do I come to this forecast? Forecasts of inflation depend on a number of factors. I will focus on three of them: commodity costs, resource gaps and inflation expectations.  Let me start with something that appears to be on everyone’s mind as a risk to the inflation outlook — commodity prices. How do the recent sharp increases in oil and other commodity prices influence my forecast for inflation?\nCommodity price increases do not necessarily portend future broad inflation. In fact, despite the views aired by pundits, the historical evidence is that today’s commodity price increases will likely have little discernible effect on future core inflation. Although they are quite important for some products, commodities only contribute a minor portion to the total cost of bringing most items to market. And for commodity cost increases to influence consumer prices, firms must be able to pass cost increases on to customers. In today’s economy with many sectors still experiencing lax demand, many firms may not be able to pass on these cost increases. Instead, rising input costs will put a squeeze on their profit margins.\nThis brings me to the second factor I mentioned: resource gaps. Prices tend to rise when increases in demand push up resource utilization and put broad-based pressure on firms’ costs of production. However, in today’s economy, resource gaps are large. Importantly, as I mentioned before, there is still substantial slack in labor markets — the high unemployment rate and other indicators, such as the low labor force participation rate and the high number of people working part time for economic reasons — all point to weak overall labor demand. This is translating into very small increases in wages and salaries; as measured by the Employment Cost Index, they rose just 1-1/2 percent for the past year — the lowest recorded increase since the series began in 1983. Consequently, we are not seeing any upward pressure on prices coming from labor costs. And for the economy as a whole, labor represents by far the largest component of production costs. Additionally, in order for price increases to be sustained, demand must keep pace. This means wages must grow. The logic is simple: If consumers cannot afford to pay higher prices, demand falls, putting downward pressure on prices.\nUnder the forecasts for output and unemployment I just discussed, I expect significant resource slack to remain in the economy for some time to come, and I also am expecting that slack to exert an important downward influence on inflationary pressures. To get me to reassess this view, I would have to see real GDP growing much stronger than my 4 percent forecast, strong improvements in the labor market, and evidence that wage pressures on labor costs were starting to build. Today, there is no evidence of such pressures.\nThis leads me to the third — and final — point about forecasting inflation. Future inflation is determined in part by expectations of future inflation. Let me explain. Expectations of future inflation are an important element in businesses’ and consumers’ planning for the future. Right now, professional forecasters’ expectations of long-run inflation are at about 2 percent. Such expectations are factored into current spending and investment decisions. But if some surprise event were to lead to higher expected inflation, businesses and consumers would internalize this new belief and take actions consistent with it. These actions would, in turn, put actual inflation on a higher path. This brings me back to our earlier discussion of commodity prices. One thing we look for when we monitor the reactions to unexpected movements in commodity and oil prices is their impact on inflation expectations. If unforeseen price increases alter inflation expectations and these expectations for higher prices boost longer-run underlying inflation, then it may become appropriate to adjust policy.\nThat said, our historical experience over the past 25 years suggests that such adverse developments are unlikely. While they have had short-lived direct effects on the prices of energy and commodity-intensive products, commodity price increases generally have not had a long-lasting effect on overall inflation.  Now, as a central banker, I’m paid to be cautious. The experience of the past 25 years might not accurately reflect what will occur today. And while the participants in futures markets for commodities currently do not expect a further run-up in prices (indeed, many expect price declines), they may be wrong. Unexpected supply disruptions or surges in demand could push up prices further. Recognizing these possibilities, the most recent FOMC statement noted that: “The recent increases in the prices of energy and other commodities are currently putting upward pressure on inflation. The Committee expects these effects to be transitory, but it will pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.”\nTo recap, current measures of underlying inflation are subdued and are running lower than what the FOMC judges to be consistent with long-run price stability. To be sure, we see some increase in headline inflation due to higher food and energy prices, but we do not expect these to materially boost underlying inflationary trends. Moreover, existing resource gaps are still exerting countervailing downward pressure on inflation. Nonetheless, we will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations, and we will adjust policy if developments move our forecast to rates incompatible with our inflation mandate.\nWith regard to policy today, slow progress in closing resource gaps and underlying inflation trends that are too low lead me to conclude that substantial policy accommodation continues to be appropriate. This accommodative policy will foster a return of economic conditions consistent with our dual mandate. We are providing this accommodation in two ways. The first is our commitment to keep short-term nominal policy rates low for an extended period. The FOMC’s policy statements have been very clear on this and have included this characterization for the federal funds rate since March 2009. The second is our large-scale asset purchase program (LSAP) through which, by June, we most likely will have purchased all told $2.35 trillion of long-term Treasury and GSE issues. These purchases are aimed at directly influencing longer-maturity interest rates. They also play an important and useful communications role—they signal our commitment to keep short-term rates low for an extended period of time.\nIn closing, monetary policy evolves as economic circumstances change. It is vital to evaluate the impact of new information on our forecasts and to reassess the stance of monetary policy as circumstances warrant. Contemplating such adjustments in advance will help prepare us for the eventual time when a change in the stance of monetary policy will be necessary. Despite recent improvements to the outlook, we are not yet at that point.\n\nNotes\n1 This calculation uses Okun’s Law, which is a simple summary of the historical relationship between GDP growth and the change in the unemployment rate. Even in normal times this relationship is a rough approximation, and in the current situation, it is also compounded by the presence of emergency unemployment insurance programs and other structural factors that may be affecting the functioning of labor markets.\n2The following websites provide details http://www.clevelandfed.org/Research/data/US-Inflation/cpi.cfm?DCS.nav=Local, http://www.kc.frb.org/Publicat/econrev/PDF/2q01clar.pdf and http://dallasfed.org/data/pce/index.html.",

            "content": "It is my pleasure to be here in Rockford today to speak to you about my views on the progress of the recovery and on the course of monetary policy. I would like to thank Andrea (Ward) for that kind introduction and Harris Bank for working with the Chamber to sponsor this event.\nBefore offering my perspective on U.S. monetary policy, let me emphasize that the views that I am presenting today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or my other colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe U.S. economy is now in its second year of recovery following the deepest recession since the Great Depression. However, to a lot of folks, it still doesn’t feel all that real. Too many people remain unemployed, and too many businesses still haven’t returned to the operating rates they were running at before the recession. (Chart 1)\n\nChart 1 - click for larger version.\n\nThe Fed has a dual mandate from Congress to encourage conditions that foster both maximum employment and price stability. The charts on this slide report historical data and the FOMC’s current outlook for each of these objectives. Monetary policy decisions are made by the FOMC with the goal of achieving these objectives over time.\nIn normal times, this is done by appropriately setting the federal funds rate, which is the interest rate on overnight loans between banks. Voting members of the FOMC are Chairman Bernanke, members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and a rotating group of the 12 regional Fed presidents. I am currently a voting member of the FOMC.\nWith that background, let me briefly describe the current economic situation and then discuss the outlook. Over the course of the recession, U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) declined by more than 4 percent. Over 8.5 million jobs were lost, 1 the unemployment rate doubled to 10 percent and the household sector lost more than $13 trillion in wealth.\nAided by improvements in financial markets, accommodative monetary policy and fiscal stimulus, real GDP has been growing since mid-2009 and private employment has been increasing for almost a year. Overall though, the pace of recovery has been disappointing.\nEarly in the recovery, we had strong growth, boosted in part by the 2009 fiscal stimulus and the rebuilding of inventories drawn down during the recession. With the effects of these factors winding down, output growth moderated in the second and third quarters of last year. More recent data have been coming in stronger. That’s encouraging. But, as I will discuss shortly, closing the existing large resource gaps within a reasonable period of time requires a marked and sustained pickup in growth.\nTo be sure, there are many bright spots on the horizon. Looking ahead, there is an increased sense of optimism among virtually all economic forecasters. Some of the caution that has been holding back household and business spending is abating. Consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of GDP, improved steadily throughout 2010 and increased at an annual rate of 4.4 percent last quarter.\nWhile growth in business investment in equipment and software slowed down a bit last quarter, new orders for capital goods and surveys of purchasing managers point to further strengthening this year. Furthermore, the passage of the new stimulus package should boost paychecks and encourage businesses to invest in equipment.\nThe continued improvements in overall financial market conditions should provide additional support to consumer and business spending and investment, and growth abroad should help improve U.S. exports. Tempering these positive developments are the continued weakness in the housing market, state and local budgetary concerns and still somewhat restrictive credit terms for some borrowers.\nThe minutes of the January FOMC meeting — which were released yesterday — provide a perspective on the views of the participants on the Committee, including a summary of our economic forecasts. These predict output growth to strengthen further over the next three years: The central tendency of our forecasts is for real GDP growth to increase from a range of 3.4 and 3.9 percent this year to between 3.7 and 4.6 percent in 2013.\nHowever, let’s not congratulate ourselves just yet: Even 4 percent is only moderately higher than the growth rate of potential output and thus represents a relatively muted recovery given the severity of the recession. In addition, this growth forecast is not strong enough to reduce unemployment very rapidly within a reasonable timeframe. As you can see on the chart, FOMC participants anticipate the unemployment rate being in the range of 6.8 to 7.2 percent at the end of 2013 — still above most estimates of what we would see in a healthy economy. I should note that these forecasts were made before last month’s data were published showing a four-tenths of a percentage point drop in the unemployment rate in January. But those data don’t change the fundamental message: We still have a long road ahead before we return to full utilization of the economy’s productive capacity and meet this piece of our policy goals.\nThe arithmetic is daunting. Employment now stands about 7.7 million below its peak three years ago as we entered the recession. The economy would have to generate over 210,000 new jobs per month for the next three years to make up for just these employment losses alone — and that doesn’t even cover any growth in the labor force (which is just under 1 percent per year). To date, job growth has been disappointing: On average, only about 80,000 new jobs were created monthly over the past three months. And looking forward, private forecasters expect average monthly job gains over the coming year of about 190,000. Although these improvements are welcome, the arithmetic implies only slow progress in returning to previous levels of employment. The chart of the unemployment rate captures this unfortunate reality.\nLet me turn now to a discussion of the price stability element of our dual mandate, which is addressed in the bottom chart of the slide. From my vantage point, we haven’t done well on this dimension either. Inflation is measured as the growth in prices for a broad basket of goods and services. The Federal Open Market Committee considers a wide variety of such measures when gauging inflation and evaluating the appropriate stance of monetary policy. In general, we tend to focus on core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation, which removes the volatile food and energy components. Being free of this volatility makes the core measure a better indicator of broad underlying inflation trends — and therefore a better guide of where inflation is heading.\nMost of us on the Federal Open Market Committee have said that a PCE inflation rate of about 2 percent is consistent with our price stability mandate. Yet, core inflation has been running well below this 2 percent rate for about two years. It has been roughly three-quarters of a percent for the past several months, and the FOMC forecasts have it reaching our mandate-consistent range only by the end of 2013. And my own assessment is that inflation will be lower than this path.\nBut wait. This seems like an unusual — and unpopular — viewpoint. With all the news about rising prices of crude oil, crops and other commodities over the past several months, you might reasonably wonder why I judge inflation to be too low. After all, I often hear people say, “Aren’t all prices really going up more than these inflation numbers say?”\nLet me explain. The broad PCE index is a weighted average of the prices paid for various goods and services. (Chart 2) The total index has risen at a three-month annual rate of 2.4 percent. True, gasoline prices have jumped over that period. But, on average, fuel accounts for only about 3.6 percent of expenditures. And despite the jump in meat and dairy prices, overall food prices have gone up only about 1-1/2 percent over the past 3 months (annual rate). In addition, the prices of many everyday categories of expenditures have increased very little or even have declined some.\n\nChart 2 - click for larger version.\n\nLet me highlight a few. The price of a new car has actually declined at a three-month annual rate of 1.8 percent. Although cotton prices rose sharply in the second half of 2010, prices for men’s apparel actually fell over 4 percent and women’s clothing prices rose by less than 1 percent over the past three months (annual rate).\nIn fact, over 80 percent of what consumers spend their money on increased at an annual rate of 2 percent or less over the past three months.\nFurthermore, when contemplating the inflation numbers, quality improvements are important to keep in mind. I am reminded of a comment once made by former Fed Governor Ed Gramlich that illustrates this point.2 Let's say someone gave you $10,000 and a choice of purchasing whatever you wanted out of one of two catalogs. One catalog has today’s goods at today’s prices. The other catalog is five years old. It has only goods that were available five years ago at those prices. Which would you choose? If you select from the older catalog, prices for most items would certainly be lower, but so would the selection of goods and the number and quality of their features. Would you prefer a five-year-old computer at five-year-old prices, or a 2011 computer that costs a bit more but has many more bells and whistles?\nIndeed, the prices of many popular items have fallen. Five years ago a 60-inch HDTV cost $6,000. The current, much more sophisticated model, costs only $1,500. The iPad had yet to be invented and smartphones were primitive and pricey. For me the answer is pretty clear — I’d take today’s catalog. And, appropriately so, statisticians try to incorporate such new and improved items into our price indexes such as the PCE data I just showed you.\nPrices that are falling because of improvements in technology are not a concern. But undershooting our overall inflation target because the economy is growing significantly below its potential is costly. Many people took on debt obligations two or three years ago, when they expected inflation would be nearer the 2 percent rate, which is approximately our price stability objective.\nAs such, the real burden of this debt is unexpectedly higher. Realigning inflation with these prior expectations — which were presumably held by both borrowers and lenders — would therefore be beneficial.\nAnother anecdote also illustrates an important point about inflation. Many years ago when I was a graduate student living on a tight budget, my wife, Ann and I were at a local grocery store picking up a few staples like peanut butter, bread and beer. At the checkout counter, we had a bit of sticker shock. Ann said to the teenager at the cash register, “Hey, this macaroni and cheese used to be four for a dollar, and now it’s 59 cents apiece!” Without looking up, the clerk said, “Yeah. And back then you were probably earning only $1 an hour, ma’am.\" Wow! That’s an A+ in Econ 101.\nThe link between wages and prices that this young cashier so clearly grasped suggests that unexpectedly low inflation can be costly in other ways as well. Businesses determine current hiring needs in anticipation of future revenues. Lower-than-expected product prices reduce revenues. If they persist and wages do not fall, then too-low prices increase real labor costs — that is, the cost of hiring a worker relative to the value of his/her output. Higher real labor costs reduce the incentive for hiring and may even generate layoffs. Again, validating businesses’ expectations of appropriate inflation would eliminate this source of negative feedback.\nNow that I have set the stage, let me turn to my views on future monetary policy. (Chart 3) As I noted earlier, the Federal Reserve’s actions are driven by our dual mandate: We set policies to help foster both maximum sustainable employment and price stability. The current settings of U.S. monetary policy are intended to better achieve these mandates over time.\n\nChart 3 - click for larger version.\n\nTo put it bluntly, with unemployment too high and inflation too low — and both forecasted to stay that way over the next two years — we have missed on both of our policy objectives. There is currently no policy conflict between improving the employment and inflation outcomes. This leads me to conclude that accommodative monetary policy continues to be beneficial for achieving each of these goals.\nTo foster a return of economic conditions consistent with our dual mandate, we still need to keep short-term nominal policy rates low for an extended period. The FOMC’s policy statements have been very clear on this and have included this characterization for the federal funds rate since March 2009. In addition to directly influencing longer maturity interest rates, our recently expanded program of large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs) plays an important and useful communications role.\nIt clearly demonstrates the FOMC’s commitment to keeping the federal funds rate extraordinarily low for an extended period of time. Although long-term inflation expectations — those five to ten years out — are not too far from our informal 2 percent target, current overall inflation is near 1 percent, and private forecasters generally expect it to run under 2 percent for the next couple of years.\nSo, all else being equal, bringing expectations of inflation back more quickly to 2 percent could translate into a helpful decline in real short-term interest rates. Economists believe that real interest rates are important determinants of economic decisions. That is because they adjust for the change in purchasing power between the time the borrower takes out the loan and the time he or she pays back the interest. So raising short term inflation expectations would be a modest but helpful step in realizing a more accommodative policy stance. Furthermore, with inflation below target, creating expectations of appropriately higher inflation in the short term is consistent with our price stability objective.\nOf course, at some point the outlook for inflation will signal the appropriate time to remove policy accommodation. And should our strategy prove to be a little too successful and inflation rise faster than we expect, we have the tools to tighten quickly as needed.\nLet me conclude with a final thought on the importance of communicating the Fed’s objectives clearly. Ambiguity in our message can undermine our ability to achieve our goals. We can make our existing tools more effective by explicitly stating our objectives and the likely course of future policy that would achieve them. I hope that my remarks here today have helped explain the issues we face and the complexities of implementing monetary policy to address them.\nAlthough it will take time for monetary policy to succeed in reaching our goals, I am optimistic that we are moving forward in the right direction.\nThank you. I look forward to taking your questions.\n\nNotes\n1 This relationship is often referred to as the “Beveridge curve.”\n2 See http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20050202meeting.pdf.",

            "content": "It is my pleasure to participate in this panel discussion on the future of monetary policy. I would like to offer a special note of thanks to Benoit Mojon and the Bank of France for organizing this session.\nOver the past three years, the U.S. economy has faced a wide range of challenges. Some were unique to the U.S. economy and policy environment, and others were global in scope. I look forward to hearing the perspectives of my co-panelists as they deliberate the future of monetary and regulatory policy from their points of view.\nBefore offering my thoughts on U.S. monetary policy, let me emphasize that the views that I am presenting today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or my other colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe U.S. economy is now in its second year of recovery following the deepest recession since the Great Depression. The financial crisis that engulfed economies around the world required bold and innovative policy actions and, at times, close coordination and cooperation among central bankers worldwide. These unprecedented actions have stabilized the financial system. Yet, we in the U.S. have a considerable ways to go before we meet either of the Federal Reserve’s policy mandates of maximum employment and price stability.\nLet me first briefly describe the current economic situation. Over the course of the recession, U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) declined by more than 4 percent, over 8 million jobs were lost, the unemployment rate doubled to 10 percent and the household sector lost more than $13 trillion in wealth. Aided by improvements in financial markets, accommodative monetary policy and fiscal stimulus, real GDP has been growing since mid 2009 and private employment has been increasing for about a year. However, given the depth of the recession — and even allowing for a modest reduction in the level of potential output — we still have a long road ahead before we return to full utilization of the economy’s productive capacity.\nOverall, the pace of recovery has been disappointing. With the boost in spending from the first fiscal stimulus winding down and inventory accumulation fading in the spring and summer, output growth moderated in the second and third quarters. More recent data have been coming in somewhat stronger. But they do not yet point to the kind of robust, self-perpetuating recovery that we need in order to close today’s large resource gaps within a reasonable amount of time. Furthermore, underlying inflation has fallen to a level well below the 2 percent rate that I, and most FOMC policymakers, consider consistent with effective price stability.\nLooking ahead, I expect output growth to strengthen in 2011 and 2012: averaging somewhere near 4 percent. Indeed, there is an increased sense of optimism among virtually all economic forecasters. However, even 4 percent is only modestly higher than the growth rate of potential output and thus represents a quite muted recovery given the severity of the recession. In addition, this growth forecast is not strong enough to reduce unemployment significantly within a reasonable timeframe; it would likely result in the unemployment rate remaining in the neighborhood of 8 percent at the end of 2012.\nNow let me turn to my views on future monetary policy. The Federal Reserve’s actions are driven by our dual mandate: We set policies to help foster both maximum sustainable employment and price stability. The current settings of U.S. monetary policy are intended to better achieve these mandates over time.\nMy primary message today about prospective policy is this: In order to foster a return of economic conditions consistent with our dual mandate we need to keep short-term nominal policy rates low for an extended period — the implications of this for the yield curve should then stimulate spending by households and businesses. The FOMC’s policy statement has included this characterization for the federal funds rate since March, 2009. I view our recently expanded program of asset purchases as a complementary policy tool in this regard as it solidifies our commitment to keeping short term rates low for an extended period.\nIt is vitally important for our policy actions to be judged relative to the mission that Congress has laid out for us in the Federal Reserve Act. Accountability is a critical obligation for any central bank that requires substantial independence to be effective. Accordingly, it is of utmost importance to continually evaluate our policy record against our objectives and communicate our actions and the results. Frankly, that’s why I am here today.\nSo, where do we stand on our employment mandate? In weighing the evidence, I am convinced that a sizable output gap exists, which, of course, is consistent with the unemployment rate currently being well above the level consistent with maximum sustainable employment. I arrive at this conclusion even after having considered arguments that structural changes (as opposed to cyclical factors) in labor markets may be keeping the unemployment rate unusually high. True, factors such as the need to reallocate labor across industries, house lock and the extension of unemployment insurance benefits have likely increased the natural rate of unemployment, at least temporarily. But attempts to quantify such effects suggest there is still a good deal of labor market slack. The strongest evidence of structural change comes from the uptick in vacancies, as reported in the Job Openings and Labor Survey (JOLTS) over the last year, that has so far not been matched by a drop in unemployment. This might be taken as evidence of a drop in the efficiency of job matching, which would be associated with an unfavorable shift of the Beveridge curve. Some of the observed decline in job match efficiency is likely associated with cyclical and other temporary factors. However, even if you thought it was all permanent, my staff did some calculations that provide an upper bound on the increase in the natural rate of unemployment that would result in a standard specification of the Mortensen–Pissarides search model. Those results would still leave us with about 2 percentage points of unemployment slack. As I said, this is after using an upper bound for the importance of structural unemployment. The bulk of the evidence I’ve seen suggests the true amount of slack is at least 3 percentage points. So, I don’t think there’s much question that we’re missing badly on our employment mandate.\nMost of us on the Federal Open Market Committee have said that a core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) inflation rate of about 2 percent is consistent with our price stability mandate. Yet, core PCE inflation has been running below this 2 percent rate for about two years. It has been roughly 1 percent for the past several months, and I currently expect it will remain close to 1 percent through the end of 2012. In light of stable inflation expectations and the large resource gaps I previously mentioned, there is little pressure for inflation to move much higher in the current economic environment. Now suppose you were inclined to down-weight the contributions from large resource gaps for inflation forecasts. You would then likely turn to the empirical evidence that a random-walk forecast for inflation is difficult to beat. In the current environment, this forecasting philosophy points to the same qualitative assessment as my forecast does; namely, that inflation is likely to remain well below 2 percent over the next year or two.\nWith unemployment too high and inflation too low — and both forecast to stay that way over the next two years — we have missed on both of our policy objectives. Even if the Fed were charged with achieving price stability alone, as are many other central banks, undershooting our inflation target would dictate a highly accommodative monetary policy stance. There is currently no policy conflict between improving the employment and inflation outcomes — accommodative monetary policy continues to be necessary for achieving each of these goals.\nNext, in weighing future monetary policy, policymakers should have a sturdy foundation for thinking about the current economic situation. I find the modern economic literature on liquidity traps to be particularly compelling for assessing matters today. Currently, spending is being held back by extremely cautious behavior by businesses and households. Firms are willing to let cash sit on their books instead of investing in new projects or expanding their work forces. Households are holding back on spending to reduce debt and build their stock of precautionary savings. At prevailing interest rates, households and businesses have an excess of savings relative to the investment demands for these funds. Normally, monetary policy could reduce the incentives to save and stimulate spending by lowering short term nominal interest rates. But with the federal funds rate already essentially at zero, we are in a liquidity trap. There is no room for further reductions in short-term nominal rates to help re-equilibrate the market for loanable funds.\nA variety of typical linear Taylor rules suggest that, given current resource gaps and inflation, a real federal funds rate of around minus 4 percent would be appropriate. A primary justification for putting weight on Taylor rules — which are generally suboptimal in any particular model — is that these reaction functions yield policy prescriptions that are robust across a variety of specifications. Given my views on reasonable measures of resource gaps, negative rates are a robust policy recommendation in the current setting. In addition, some optimal monetary policy simulations indicate that pursuing such negative real rates for the next couple of years would significantly boost aggregate demand. This would be enough to deliver much lower unemployment and raise inflation to near 2 percent by the end of 2012. Applying these rules of thumb for monetary policy would indicate that substantial policy accommodation continues to be warranted. Our policies are striving to achieve this appropriate accommodation.\nOne channel is to lower real short-term interest rates by raising inflationary expectations. In the current environment, our policies should aim to moderately raise inflation expectations while maintaining low short-term nominal interest rates. When inflation increases, the opportunity cost of holding cash (and close cash substitutes) goes up, tipping incentives towards higher spending and lending.\nMoreover, undershooting our inflation target is costly. Many people took on debt obligations two or three years ago, when they expected inflation would be nearer the 2 percent rate that is approximately our price stability objective. As such, the real burden of this debt is unexpectedly higher. Realigning inflation with these prior expectations — which were presumably held by both borrowers and lenders — would therefore be beneficial.\nAlthough long-term inflation expectations arguably are not far from our target, shorter-term Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)-based expectations are nearer to 1 percent. So, all else equal, bringing these expectations back more quickly to 2 percent could translate into something like a 100 basis point decline in real short-term rates. This would be a modest but helpful step towards relieving liquidity trap conditions. In the current situation, with inflation at 1 percent, creating expectations of appropriately higher inflation in the short term is consistent with our price stability objective. Furthermore, it recognizes a symmetry in policy losses whenever inflation deviates above or below our implicit target. Of course, at some point the outlook for inflation will signal the appropriate time to remove policy accommodation. And should our strategy prove to be a little too successful and inflation rise faster than we expect, we have the tools to tighten quickly as needed.\nNo doubt, lowering short-term real interest rates successfully would help us achieve both our policy goals. Yet, putting such a strategy into practice is complex, and challenges us to communicate our intentions effectively. As the FOMC has repeatedly stated, the Fed is committed to keeping the federal funds rate low for an extended period of time. We also have our recently expanded program of large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs). Everything else equal, these purchases are aimed at reducing long-term interest rates. Other events have intervened and long-term rates are now higher than at our November FOMC meeting. In part, it is reasonable to attribute a portion of this increase to lower probabilities of deflationary tail events.\nNevertheless, LSAPs are continuing to play an important and useful communications role in demonstrating the FOMC’s commitment to keeping the federal funds rate extraordinarily low for an extended period of time.\nLet me conclude by offering a few remarks on the importance of communicating the Fed’s objectives clearly. Ambiguity in our message can undermine our ability to achieve our goals. We can make our existing tools more effective by explicitly stating our objectives and the likely course of future policy that would achieve them. Our communication challenges would be much reduced if we had an explicit numerical inflation objective. Knowing our target, the public and markets could make reliable inferences about the future path of monetary policy. Moreover, a credible inflation target would give the Fed more flexibility in its near-term policies and help achieve our goals sooner and with less risk of unintended consequences.\nThank you.",

            "content": "Thank you for that kind introduction. I’m delighted to be here in Toronto tonight to offer my perspective on the state of the U.S. economy. This is my first official visit to Canada as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and I am most appreciative of this opportunity presented by the C.D. Howe Institute. I hope to be able to offer some insight into U.S. monetary policy and I look forward to hearing from you during our question and answer period.\nBefore I begin, let me say that the views I express here are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System.\nAt the conclusion of last September’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, we announced two important policy actions that have been much talked about since. The first was the initiation of a new open-ended program to buy mortgage-backed securities that will continue until the outlook for the labor market improves substantially. The second was a clear statement that we expect to maintain a highly accommodative policy stance for a considerable time after the recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee expects that short-term interest rates near zero will be appropriate at least through mid-2015.1\nTonight, I’d like to discuss these innovative actions in some detail, especially in terms of how they might inform future policy actions and in light of the growing concern over a variety of long-run issues facing the U.S. and other advanced economies.\n\nLong-Run Issues Facing the U.S. and Other Advanced Economies\nThe recent global downturn began in the United States in late 2007, and accelerated sharply following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. The U.S. economy bottomed in the summer of 2009. However, the following economic recovery has been modest by any standard. The near-term obstacles to growth are numerous and much discussed; but looking forward, I see even more complex challenges confronting the United States over the next three to four years and beyond.\nSome of these issues also affect other major industrial economies in the world, and many of these challenges imply difficult decisions for fiscal policymakers. Tonight, I will touch on a few of these issues.\nLet me be very clear about something at the outset: As a monetary policymaker in the United States, my only responsibility regarding fiscal policy is to have an understanding of how alternative fiscal choices influence the trajectories of economic growth and inflationary pressures and thus what these choices may imply for monetary policy—our job at the Federal Reserve.\nAt the risk of oversimplifying the long-term challenges for the U.S., it seems to me to be characterized by two important features. First, the current level of debt-to-GDP (gross domestic product) of about 70 percent is high by historical standards; and in the absence of changes in taxes or spending, the projections are that it will continue to climb. Second, a critical long-term driver of higher future debt is the need to fund and deliver large benefits to an increasingly aging population. Baby boomers are beginning to retire, and it is imperative to ask whether old-age pensions and safety nets are adequate. With the added responsibilities of caring for the elderly being borne by fewer people, will we be able to finance the pension and health care demands that come with aging?\nThe U.S. long-run fiscal imbalance is quite significant, and it is important that we soon develop plans for controlling the long-run increase in our debt. Of course, there are several policy levers the U.S. government might use to return to a more sustainable fiscal path. None of these choices are painless. For example, future beneficiaries may be forced to pay higher out-of-pocket expenses or face greater limits on available care (that is, lower benefits). Another possibility is to ask younger workers to pay more during their working lifetimes to finance programs for their retirements. Other strategies would increase general taxes and/or lower a variety of public expenditures today in order to save resources to pay for obligations tomorrow.\nWhen the United States settles on effective policies to close the fiscal financing gap, these policies will result in an increase in either current or prospective government saving—which is the same as reducing government fiscal deficits. Moreover, with most people expecting to receive lower future benefits or pay higher future taxes, it is likely that current workers will want to save more for their retirements. Regardless of how these matters are resolved, national saving must rise.\n\nFour Messages to Emphasize Regarding Long-Run Challenges\nAn aging population places obvious strains on fiscal finances over the long run. At the same time, the recent financial downturn and a prolonged period of high unemployment have complicated the process that would allow us to adjust to a new sustainable fiscal path. In this context, I want to emphasize four important messages that I think are implied by trends in the U.S. and global economies.\nFirst, the U.S consumer is no longer in a position to be the engine of world growth. It should be evident that long-term demographic changes of the sort we face require increases in personal or government saving. Furthermore, over the near term, many U.S. households continue to be challenged by a debt overhang and large losses of wealth that were incurred during the financial crisis. All of these factors point to lower rates of personal consumption in the United States. Moreover, many advanced economies face their own fiscal challenges and unfavorable demographics that also will likely weigh on total world consumption. Some of the resulting drop in global aggregate demand could be taken up by consumers in emerging market economies. In many cases, past growth in such economies has been largely export driven. With reduced aggregate demand expected from their trading partners, emerging market economies will need to endorse policies that encourage domestic consumption and demand. Making that transition will be challenging.\nThe second point I want to emphasize is that the United States must consolidate its finances gradually over time if we are to avoid further economic turmoil or another downturn. Of immediate concern is the looming fiscal cliff, which some have labeled “the austerity bomb.” Under current law, many tax and spending provisions enacted in various past stimulus packages are scheduled to expire on January 1, 2013. In addition, in the absence of a budget deal, automatic sequestration of spending goes into effect. If not quickly reversed, the effects on the economy could be huge. The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that the full suite of scheduled budget actions could shrink real GDP in 2013 by 2-1/4 percent. It would also raise the unemployment rate by about a percentage point relative to the less draconian scenario in which only the payroll tax cut and extended unemployment insurance benefits were allowed to expire.2\nMore generally, economic growth is already weak in many advanced economies throughout the world. Indeed, Europe is in a recession. And fiscal policy in several European countries is currently restrictive. Certainly, progress needs to be made on reducing outsized deficits. But too much austerity too soon could be very damaging to near- and medium-term growth. Economic theory tells us that in times when central banks have lowered short-term nominal interest rates to essentially zero, fiscal multipliers are likely quite high.3 This means that overly abrupt moves to increase taxes or reduce government spending could have an amplified effect on reducing real growth. Furthermore, such fiscal moves could cause longer lasting damage to already fragile economies—by reducing the growth in productive capital stock and by keeping the long-term unemployed out of jobs, resulting in the erosion of their job skills.\nWith so much hanging in the balance, one way to reduce the impact of an austerity bomb would be for policymakers to delay the strongest negative effects of fiscal consolidation today, but still credibly commit to reducing deficits later as their economies recover more robustly. This is no easy task.\nAs a central banker, I am always careful in assessing the interest rate environment that will influence the short- and longer-run growth prospects for the economy. This is a key aspect of calibrating monetary policy. Let me state the third message very frankly: The longer-term implications for market interest rates are complex and ambiguous. If policymakers punt on making tough fiscal choices or choose too little fiscal consolidation with continued high fiscal deficits, it is likely that the overall demand for so-called loanable funds will be very high relative to the supply. This will be especially evident once the United States is past the worst of our current liquidity trap conditions. In this setting, large increases in real interest rates would discourage capital investment and dampen long-run growth. However, a large fiscal consolidation could lead to higher private precautionary saving, along with higher national saving. This scenario could also dampen growth; but it would be associated with lower real interest rates, reminiscent of deeper liquidity trap conditions. Where market interest rates end up is not obvious. Central bankers and monetary policymakers will need to be attentive to assessing the market’s implication for real interest rates in deciding the appropriate benchmark for nominal policy interest rates.\nMy fourth message may be obvious, but it is still worth highlighting: All of the long-term challenges we face become easier to meet if we can increase the underlying growth potential of our economies. Many public policy choices are relevant here, and so I offer only a few modest suggestions. In the United States, we can improve our educational system, leading to a more productive work force. In peripheral Europe, economic liberalization, particularly of labor markets, can produce a more efficient allocation of resources and increased potential. And in all countries, smart regulation, efficient tax codes and support for free international trade can increase our productive capacities.\nThe payoff here can be quite large. Increasing long-run average rates of output growth, even by a few tenths of a percent, can make the budget calculus much easier. In the United States, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that if growth of real GDP each year were only 0.1 percentage point higher for the next ten years than is assumed in its baseline projections, the cumulative deficit for 2012 through 2022 would fall by over $300 billion. Permit me to adapt a saying attributed to the late Senator Everett Dirksen from Illinois: When it comes to growth, a tenth here and a tenth there, and pretty soon, you’re talking about real money! Having said this, we need real, bona fide growth policies — not simply fanciful budget assumptions that tomorrow will bring a better future.\n\nEconomic Outlook: A Modest Recovery and Contained Inflation\nIn the United States, the fiscal and economic strains due to our aging population will occur over a long time horizon. That said, monetary policymakers must formulate policy for today. In the United States, forecasts by both private analysts and FOMC participants see real GDP growth in 2012 coming in at a bit under 2 percent. Growth is expected to move moderately higher in 2013, but only to a pace that is just somewhat above potential. Such growth would likely generate only a small decline in the unemployment rate. For example, the latest Survey of Professional Forecasters projection had the unemployment rate at 7.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013—just 0.3 percentage points below where it is today. Against this backdrop of modest growth and still elevated unemployment, inflation is expected to run at or a bit under the FOMC’s stated goal of 2 percent.\nThe reasons for sluggish U.S. growth are well known. The 2008 financial crisis destroyed trillions of dollars of wealth, forcing consumers and businesses to deleverage. This process has not yet been completed. Fiscal policy is probably a slight drag on growth now; and as I just discussed, further consolidation could be coming soon. And as I also just noted, global growth has been disappointing. There is no shortage of uncertainty as I look at the economic situation in the United States and around the world, and the insecurity it creates is weighing heavily on the spending decisions of businesses and households.\nHaving said all that, most forecasters are predicting that the pace of growth will pick up as we move through next year and into 2014. Underlying these projections is an assumption that fiscal disaster will be avoided—and with this, that some important uncertainties restraining growth should come off the table. Also, deleveraging will run its course, and as it does, the economy’s more-typical cyclical recovery dynamics will take over. As the FOMC indicated in its policy moves last September, the current highly accommodative stance for monetary policy will be kept in place for some time to come.\n\nRecent Monetary Policy Actions\nAt the September meeting, faced with evidence that the recovery was not proceeding fast enough, the FOMC decided to provide additional policy accommodation in order to make more rapid progress toward our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability. There were two important parts of this additional policy accommodation that bear closer examination.\nFirst, we announced a new open-ended round of large-scale purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities. This was on top of our existing program of extending the maturity of our Treasury security holdings. As with previous large scale asset purchases (LSAPs), these purchases are aimed at putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and helping to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, thereby stimulating business and household spending.\nAn important new aspect of current round of purchases was to tie its length to economic outcomes, rather than announcing a fixed amount of purchases over a predetermined period as we have done in the past. In particular, the FOMC said that the purchases will continue until there is substantial improvement in labor markets. This is subject, of course, to a continued environment of price stability. Tying the length of time over which our purchases will be made to economic conditions is an important step. Because it clarifies how our policy decisions are conditional on progress made toward our dual mandate goals, markets can be more confident that we will provide the monetary accommodation necessary to close the large resource gaps that currently exist; additionally, markets can be more certain that we will not wait too long to tighten if inflation were to become an important concern.\nThe natural question at this point is to ask: What constitutes substantial improvement in labor markets? Personally, I think we would need to see several things. The first would be increases in payrolls of at least 200,000 per month for a period of around six months. We also would need to see a faster pace of GDP growth than we have now — something noticeably above the economy’s potential rate of growth. Such concurrent gains should be enough to produce sustainable downward momentum in the unemployment rate and to make us more confident that the improvements are sustainable. Once we established that there has been this substantial improvement in labor markets, we would stop adding to our balance sheet. But we would keep the funds rate near zero for some time longer.\nThe second major policy action at the FOMC meeting in September was to make it clear that the highly accommodative stance of monetary policy would remain in place for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens. According to our statement, the funds rate would likely stay near its current level until mid-2015.\nWhy should policy remain accommodative even after we have a stronger recovery? The delay is a feature of what modern macroeconomic theory tells us is the optimal policy response to the extraordinary circumstances we have faced over the past four years.4 As you know, in response to the severe recession and weak recovery, the Fed brought down the federal funds rate to near zero in 2008 and has kept it there since then. Economic conditions have been bad enough that if we could have, we would have lowered the fed funds rate to below zero. But we cannot do that. So instead, modern theory tells us that we should promise that once economic activity recovers, for a time we will hold rates below what they typically would be. This makes up for the period when we were constrained from taking rates negative. In other words, the average path is right over time.\nSome people claim we are trying to lower real rates by purposely boosting inflation above the central bank’s target. While it is certainly true that we are trying to stimulate activity by lowering long-term real interest rates, higher inflation isn’t necessarily part of the story.\nFor illustrative purposes, suppose inflation was constant at our target of 2 percent. Now consider two paths for short-term rates: one in which they are zero for a year and then rise and another in which they are zero for two years and then rise. Obviously, the second scenario implies a lower average path for short-term rates. So, given that long-term rates tend to move with average expected short-term rates, the second scenario implies lower current long-term rates. Such lower long-term rates would provide a boost to real economic activity today and bring unemployment down more rapidly. Yet, by assumption, under both paths, inflation would be the same, so the channel for these beneficial effects comes from lower long-term nominal interest rates, not higher inflation.\nIn addition, there is another way for policy to influence long-term real rates. If the extended period of low policy rates is well communicated, then uncertainty regarding future interest rate movements can be reduced. And lower uncertainty will result in lower risk premium being built into longer-term rates.\nOf course, we will not maintain low rates indefinitely. For some time, I have advocated the use of specific, numerical thresholds to describe the economic conditions that would have to occur before it might be appropriate to begin raising rates. I am not alone in this view. As the minutes of our FOMC meetings have indicated, we had a vigorous discussion about numerical thresholds at our October meeting, and many participants said they saw important benefits in adopting them. My colleagues on the Committee, Narayana Kocherlakota, Eric Rosengren and Janet Yellen have all said in public that they support adopting such markers.\nIn the past, I have said we should hold the fed funds rate near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate is above 7 percent and as long as inflation is below 3 percent. I now think the 7 percent threshold is too conservative. Our latest actions put us on a better policy path than we had when I first proposed the 7/3 markers a year ago. At the same time, there still are few signs of substantial inflationary pressures. If we continue to have few concerns about inflation along the path to a stronger recovery there would be no reason to undo the positive effects of these policy actions prematurely just because the unemployment rate hits 6.9 percent — a level that is still notably above the rate we associate with maximum employment.\nThis logic is supported by a number of macro-model simulations I have seen, which indicate that we can keep the funds rate near zero until the unemployment rate hits at least 6-1/2 percent and still generate only minimal inflation risks. Even a 6 percent threshold doesn’t look threatening in many of these scenarios. But for now, I am ready to say that 6-1/2 percent looks like a better unemployment marker than the 7 percent rate I had called for earlier.\nWith regard to the inflation safeguard, I have previously discussed how the 3 percent threshold is a symmetric and reasonable treatment of our 2 percent target.5 This is consistent with the usual fluctuations in inflation and the range of uncertainty over its forecasts. But I am aware that the 3 percent threshold makes many people anxious. The simulations I mentioned earlier suggest that setting a lower inflation safeguard is not likely to impinge too much on the policy stimulus generated by a 6-1/2 percent unemployment rate threshold. Indeed, we’re much more likely to reach the 6-1/2 percent unemployment threshold before inflation begins to approach even a modest number like 2-1/2 percent.6\nSo, given the recent policy actions and analyses I mentioned, I have reassessed my previous 7/3 proposal. I now think a threshold of 6-1/2 percent for the unemployment rate and an inflation safeguard of 2-1/2 percent, measured in terms of the outlook for total PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index) inflation over the next two to three years, would be appropriate.\nThe fact that this inflation safeguard is in terms of a forecast is important. A threshold based on the forecast for inflation would avoid triggering a policy reaction in response to transitory movements in prices — say, to some temporary swing in energy prices. It would also take into account everything we are seeing in the economy in terms of cost pressures and inflationary expectations — factors that influence the inflation outlook before they show up in actual inflation data. The forecast therefore provides a better safeguard than a backward-looking measure.\n\nConclusion\nTo conclude, I believe that the U.S. and other advanced economies are facing significant long-term challenges in credibly controlling future debt levels. At the same time, we are also confronting the immediate challenge of not imposing too much austerity on our fragile economies. Clearly our fiscal authorities must find the appropriate balance between meeting these two challenges. As most everyone agrees, this implies putting in place policies that slowly but surely bring the prospects of future revenues into balance with future spending.\nUnder this scenario, monetary policy also has an important contribution to make. In my mind, this contribution should provide financial conditions that help produce the most robust demand growth we reasonably can achieve, with appropriate measures in place to safeguard price stability. As I’ve explained, the FOMC has recently taken important steps in this direction. And I believe we have the ability to go even further in reassuring financial markets and the general public that policy will stay appropriately accommodative and that such steps would provide the stimulus to growth that can benefit our future well-being in the United States and around the world.\nThank you.\n\nNotes\n1 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012).\n2 See Congressional Budget Office (2012).\n3 See Christiano, Eichenbaum and Rebelo (2011) and Batini, Callegari and Melina (2012).\n4 See, for instance, Eggertsson and Woodford (2003 and Werning (2011).\n5 See, for example, Evans (2012).\n6 Yellen (2012).\n\nReferences\nBatini, Nicoletta, Giovanni Callegari and Giovanni Melina, 2012, Successful Austerity in the United States, Europe and Japan, International Monetary Fund, working paper, July.\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 2012, press release, September 13.\nCongressional Budget Office, 2012, An Update to the Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2012 to 2022, Washington, DC, August.\nChristiano, Lawrence, Martin Eichenbaum and Sergio Rebelo, 2011, \"When is the government spending multiplier large?,” Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 119, No. 1, February, pp. 78–121.\nEggertsson, Gauti B., and Michael Woodford, 2003, “The zero bound on interest rates and optimal monetary policy,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Vol. 34, No. 1, pp. 139–211.\nEvans, Charles L., 2012, “Some thoughts on global risks and monetary policy,” speech, Market News International seminar, Hong Kong, China, August 27.\nWerning, Ivan, 2011, “Managing a liquidity trap: Monetary and fiscal policy,” National Bureau of Economic Research, working paper, No. 17344, August.\nYellen, Janet L., 2012, “Revolution and evolution in central bank communications,” speech, University of California, Berkeley, Haas School of Business, November 13.",

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you for that kind introduction. I’m delighted to be here today at the Lakeshore Chamber of Commerce to offer my perspective on the state of the U.S. economy. Before I begin I must state that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System.\nEarlier this month, in response to accumulating evidence that we were not achieving a significant and substantial improvement in U.S. labor markets, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) took some important policy actions. First, it initiated a new program to buy mortgage backed securities that will continue—and, if necessary, be augmented by other policy actions—until the outlook for the labor market improves substantially. Second, the Committee stated that it expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for policy for a considerable time after the recovery strengthens. In particular, it expects that near zero short-term interest rates will be appropriate at least through mid-2015.1\nFor more than two years, I have vigorously supported strongly accommodative monetary policy measures as the appropriate response to the unacceptable state of the U.S. labor market and benign outlook for inflation. I believe the combination of new asset purchases and enhanced forward guidance about future policy should provide an important added stimulus to economic activity and hiring. However, as I’ll explain later, I think there are additional steps the Fed can take to further strengthen its positive effects on the economy.\nThe context for our recent actions is an economy that has been growing, but not at a pace fast enough to restore it to its productive potential in anything close to a reasonable amount of time. And today, even the growth we do see faces some big risks — risks that further bolster the argument for strong accommodation.\nI regularly talk to a large number of chief executive officers (CEOs) about business conditions. Many of these executives run big firms with an international presence. Throughout the summer, they increasingly pointed to the U.S. as the bright spot in the global economy. Their comments, however, were not a testament to the U.S. recovery, but an indication that global economic activity was weakening — first in Europe and later elsewhere around the world. In addition, at home, we could face substantially more restrictive fiscal conditions if federal budget negotiations fail to resolve the issues surrounding the so-called fiscal cliff. And for both the global situation and the U.S. fiscal cliff, there is a lot of uncertainty over what the eventual outcomes will be.\nMore monetary accommodation and greater confidence in the future mean a stronger U.S. economy. A stronger economy would be more resilient to a large-scale decline in global growth or a sharp fiscal retrenchment. In contrast, piling these risk-events on a weak economy could throw us back into recession.\nOur economy today is simply not resilient enough. The damage from the Great Recession was substantial; and to date, the recovery has been disappointing. The real value of goods and services produced in the U.S. today is probably more than 5 percent below what economists call potential — that is, the economy’s ability to produce goods and services without generating inflationary pressures. The unemployment rate has been stuck at around 8 percent for nearly a year — well above the 5 percent to 6 percent level we would see if all of our resources were fully engaged. In the absence of further monetary stimulus or fiscal repair, the outlook would be for more of the same: moderate growth that is not strong enough to generate substantial improvement in the labor market; an unemployment rate that is likely to remain above its long-run level for a long time to come; and an economy that would be vulnerable to shocks at home and abroad.\nNow, I am an optimist. I think we can do better than this gloomy outlook. That is why action is important. A great deal of state-of-the-art analysis — done both inside and outside of the Fed — indicates that the severe downturn in 2008–09 was mainly the result of a large drop in aggregate demand which left the economy operating below its potential. Research also shows that better and more accommodative policies have the power to reverse these setbacks and raise employment, output and incomes.2 In other words, more accommodative policy can deliver a stronger economy and the resiliency we are seeking. Furthermore, appropriate policy can deliver these better outcomes without generating inflation that is significantly higher than the Fed’s long-run goal of 2 percent.\nThere are many who believe otherwise. In their view, our current low output and high unemployment are the hallmarks of an economy that has lost its competitiveness — an economy that experienced permanent disruptions in its infrastructure, the skills base of its work force and its technological capability. In such a dismal view of the economy, monetary policy is powerless and cannot generate a stronger, more robust expansion. Any attempt to increase aggregate demand through more accommodative monetary policy would simply lead to higher inflation rather than better resource allocation.\nI see little evidence to support such a pessimistic view of the world. And I refuse to be so nihilistic in the absence of strong evidence of permanent disruptions. It is very hard to believe that millions of people who were working productively just a few years ago have suddenly become unemployable. And while many of the pessimists have been predicting higher inflation for several years, it hasn’t materialized. Indeed, core inflation has been under 2 percent since the end of 2008; and except for some near-term transitory movements in food and energy prices, most forecasters do not see any major change in inflation over the next few years.\n\nForces Restraining Growth\nBefore I discuss the risks to the economy, let me explain forces that have been restraining growth for some time.\nReviewing the historical record from around the world, Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff and others find that, given the monetary and fiscal policies that are typically pursued, a prolonged period of slow growth following a financial crisis is the unfortunate norm.3 And, despite the fact that the Federal Reserve has turned to many atypical monetary policy responses, the current U.S. experience is following the typical pattern. The recent financial crisis set in motion powerful forces that generated huge losses in wealth, greatly restrained aggregate demand and created difficult credit conditions. The effects have lingered, notably through a long period of deleveraging as many households and businesses seek to repair their damaged balance sheets.\nThere are a number of facets to this process. The financial sector is still recovering from its losses during the crisis and realizes the need — partly because of new regulatory standards — to hold larger liquidity and capital cushions against potential shocks. Many nonfinancial firms see weak or erratic demand for their products and few profitable investment opportunities. Moreover, these businesses are well-attuned to the downside risks to the economy. These factors lead them to reduce debt burdens and save cash. In addition, households still face high unemployment risk and slow wage growth, while holding a stock of wealth that has yet to return to its pre-crisis level. Furthermore, for many families, credit conditions are still tight. As a result, growth in consumer spending has been sluggish.\nThis is important because the ultimate end-user for all production is the consumer. For example, intermediate goods ultimately go toward the production of consumer goods. Likewise, investment expands businesses’ productive capacity to make even more consumer goods. And U.S. exports to other countries provide goods and services to consumers abroad. Therefore, deleveraging by domestic households and less robust consumption by our trading partners both eventually translate into weaker overall aggregate demand in the U.S.\nWhenever the economy operates below its potential, the key mechanism that returns the economy back to potential is a fall in real interest rates. This decline reduces the supply of saving and boosts the demand for investment, resulting in increased spending. This equilibrating process has been made more difficult because our traditional interest rate policy tool, the federal funds rate, has already been lowered to essentially zero.4 We can’t lower it any further. Instead, we have turned to nontraditional policies, such as providing forward guidance about future policy rates and making large-scale purchases of longer-dated Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. These policies have helped support growth — the economy would be in much worse shape if we had not made these moves. That said, they were not enough to generate robust growth in the face of unexpectedly strong and persistent headwinds throughout this recovery period. In part, the FOMC’s additional monetary policy actions were a response to the disappointing pace of the recovery. However, they were also intended to increase the resiliency of the economy in the face of the increasing headwinds and greater downside risks posed by the slowdown in global economic growth, the economic turmoil in Europe and the fast-approaching U.S. fiscal cliff.\nLet me now go into some more detail on each of these risks.\n\nA Slowing Global Economy\nIn the first couple years following the 2008–09 recession, we saw a two-speed global recovery: moderate growth in the U.S. and other advanced economies and strong growth in emerging economies, such as China, Brazil and India. But today, Europe is in recession, and other advanced economies are growing only modestly. Growth in the emerging economies has slowed; notably, gross domestic production (GDP) in China appears to be rising at about an 8 percent pace this year. This sounds like a big number, but it is well below the more than 11-1/2 percent rate it averaged in the five years prior to the global recession. According to the latest projections by the International Monetary Fund, growth in overall world output is expected to be about 3-1/2 percent in 2012; this compares with gains that averaged roughly 5 percent prior to the recession.5\nAs I noted earlier, my conversations with CEOs, as well as the recent earnings reports of international firms more generally, indicate that the impact of slower growth abroad is already evident in sales of U.S. firms that operate in global markets. This means that we can’t count on a boost to U.S. output from robust exports. And this dynamic is true for the world as a whole. Demand has to come from somewhere. No country can count on export growth if their trading partners aren’t economically healthy. Since the global balance of trade must by definition balance, the math is straightforward: It is impossible for every country to run a trade surplus and export their way to better economic health.\nOver the past couple of decades, world economic growth has depended heavily on U.S. consumers. Our consumer spending was a critical driver of growth in auto sales, electronics, housing and technology — all of which not only benefited the U.S. economy, but also supported growth beyond our borders. Given the forces holding back U.S. consumers, the world economy can no longer count on U.S. households to drive growth. Other countries need to take steps to stimulate their own domestic demand.\nHopefully, the recession in Europe will be confined to Europe. And hopefully, other advanced and emerging market economies will spur vibrant recoveries that allow them to achieve their full potential. But for the moment, there’s a significant risk that the global recovery might weaken further. One only has to think about the statement that the U.S. is the bright spot for growth to infer the sense of pessimism many business leaders have about prospects around the rest of the world.\n\nEuropean Crisis\nThe second risk we face is the potential for serious fallout on the U.S. economy from the ongoing crisis in Europe.\nEurope is in an extremely difficult situation: Not only is the euro area in recession, but there are existential questions about the viability of the currency union itself. Clearly, the eurozone’s periphery countries, such as Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy, face great economic difficulties. The problems for these periphery countries are many and vary from the excessive government spending and the inability to collect taxes in Greece to the hangover of insolvent banks resulting from past exuberance in Spain and Ireland.\nMost of the focus has been on the immediate ability of the periphery countries to finance their debt. Of course, the fundamental problem in these countries is the lack of growth and competitiveness. These problems are manifest in their large trade deficits, which are mostly with other countries in the eurozone. For such countries this requires an increase in competitiveness. For a country with its own currency, a quick channel for achieving improved competitiveness is currency depreciation. As Milton Friedman said “It is far simpler to allow one price to change, namely, the price of foreign exchange, than to rely upon changes in the multitude of prices that together constitute the internal price structure.\".6 This automatically increases the country’s international competitiveness, provides immediate support to growth and gives the country more time to institute the structural and regulatory reforms needed to permanently increase its productive capacity and competitiveness.\nThe experiences of the United Kingdom (UK) and Italy in 1992 are classic examples of such an adjustment process. At the time, a number of European countries were part of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), in which members agreed to maintain their exchange rates within a narrow band around the anchor set by the strong deutsche mark. To do so, members’ monetary policy rates could not stray too far from each other. At the time, German policy rates were kept high to address domestic inflationary pressures arising from the reunification of East and West Germany. In contrast, other ERM members, such as the UK and Italy were dealing with high unemployment and trade imbalances. Germany’s high interest rates were too restrictive for them. Eventually, the UK and Italy abandoned the ERM, lowered policy rates, and let the pound and lira depreciate significantly. With a lower exchange rate, their products became more competitive and growth rebounded relatively quickly.\nToday, however, within the eurozone, a currency realignment is impossible because every country uses the same currency. Periphery countries must find other means to increase productivity and regain competitiveness. These could include large nominal wage cuts and substantial product price reductions, as well as structural labor and regulatory reforms. At the moment, the expectation is that a combination of liquidity support for banks and sovereigns will reduce financial restraint, allowing sovereigns the time to address individual imbalances and deficits. But regardless of how the adjustment occurs, the periphery countries will almost certainly experience a great deal of pain.\nThe U.S. is largely a bystander to European policies. But we are not immune to the developments in Europe. In the past two years, our trade with Europe has grown at a significantly slower pace than our trade with the rest of the world. Some of this reflects weaker demand for U.S. goods due to lower income growth in Europe, and some of this reflects the appreciation of the dollar against the euro. Should economic and financial conditions in Europe deteriorate further, they could have significant adverse effects on our growth and in our financial markets. And just the uncertainty over the downside scenarios is likely already putting a damper on investment and spending decisions in the U.S.\n\nFiscal Cliff\nThis brings me to the third risk on my list: the U.S. fiscal cliff.\nUnder current law, tax and spending provisions enacted in various stimulus packages dating as far back as 2001 are scheduled to expire on January 1, 2013. These include the expiration of the so-called Bush tax cuts, the expiration of the payroll tax holiday and the conclusions of numerous other provisions. In addition, under current law, in the absence of a budget deal, there will be automatic sequestration of spending amounting to $1 trillion over a 10-year period.\nThe impact of permitting these programs to all expire at once would be huge. The Congressional Budget Office recently compared the full force of the current law with a scenario in which only the payroll tax cut and extended unemployment insurance benefits were allowed to expire. Their central estimate was that the full suite of scheduled budget actions could shrink real GDP in 2013 by 2-1/4 percent and increase the unemployment rate by about a percentage point relative to the less draconian scenario.7 \nSuch fiscal contraction would be a serious threat to our fragile recovery. And it would be an unusual response to economic weakness. Normally, fiscal policy acts as an economic stabilizer as it did in the 1970s, 1980s and 2000s, when robust government spending boosted real GDP growth as we recovered from recession. However, as in other aspects, the current recovery does not fit the usual mold. Although policy was stimulative in 2008 and 2009, over the course of the expansion the government’s purchases of goods and services as a share of GDP has fallen by more than 2 percentage points, with state and local government spending having a large negative effect on growth.\nThere is a great deal of uncertainty as to how these fiscal issues will be resolved. With the presidential campaign in full swing, a solution is unlikely until after the outcome of the election. And unfortunately, a political stalemate that triggers slated spending cuts — an extreme outcome — cannot be ruled out. So it comes as no surprise that business people who must plan for 2013 and beyond are nervous and unsure how to proceed.\n\nThe Case for More Accommodation\nAll of this was the setting for our September FOMC meeting. Given the slow and fragile recovery, the large resource gaps that still exist, and the large risks we face, it remains clear that we needed a more resilient economy that can withstand the headwinds that might come its way. Earlier this month, the FOMC provided a more accommodative monetary policy that can help us achieve such resilience. I strongly supported the Committee’s policy actions. These actions, along with Chairman Bernanke’s powerful commentary that the employment situation remained a “grave concern,” moved quite a ways toward my preference for providing more explicit forward guidance with respect to monetary policy reactions to changes in labor market conditions.\nIn many venues over the past couple years I have laid out my preferred way to provide additional accommodation.8 Specifically, I believe we should adopt an explicit state-contingent policy rule that commits the Fed to providing accommodation at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 7 percent and the outlook for inflation over the medium term is under 3 percent. If our progress toward this unemployment marker falters, then we should expand our balance sheet to increase the degree of monetary support. Indeed, we took such an action. Note the importance of the inflation trigger — it is a safeguard against unacceptable outcomes with regard to price stability. I also believe we should be more explicit about what it means for the inflation target to be symmetric, as Chairman Bernanke has stated. Namely, symmetry means that the costs of an inflation rate above our 2 percent goal are the same as the costs of equal-sized miss in inflation below 2 percent. Its implication is that we should not be resistant to policies that could move the unemployment rate closer its longer-run level, but run the risk of inflation running only a few tenths above our 2 percent goal. Such accommodative polices could further improve the employment picture, even beyond our recent highly beneficial actions.\nWhile our policy actions earlier this month don’t exactly match my preferred policy structure, I support them wholeheartedly. Tying the period of time over which we will purchase assets to the achievement of significant improvement in the labor market is a strong step towards economic conditionality — that is, it conditions our actions to the economy’s performance instead of a calendar date. And stating that we expect to keep a highly accommodative stance for policy for a considerable time after the recovery strengthens is an important reassurance to households and businesses that Fed policy will not tighten prematurely. A large body of economic research says that committing to such a delay is a key feature of optimal policies during periods when policy rates are constrained to be zero, such as we have experienced in the U.S. since late 2008.\n\nConclusion\nLet me be clear. This was the time to act. With the problems we face and the potential dangers lying ahead, it is essential to do as much as we can now to bolster the resiliency and vibrancy of the economy. We cannot be complacent and assume that the economy is not being damaged if no action is taken. I am optimistic that we can achieve better outcomes through more monetary policy accommodation.\nSome have argued that the circumstances we find ourselves in today are so different from the way in which monetary policy normally operates that we must tread cautiously. They argue that more monetary policy accommodation may lead to unintended consequences. Yet, being timid and unduly passive can also lead to unintended consequences. If we continue to take only modest, cautious, safe policy actions, we risk suffering a lost decade similar to that which Japan experienced in the 1990s. Underestimating the enormity of our problems and the negative forces holding back growth itself exposes the economy to other potentially more serious unintended consequences. That type of passivity is a gamble that is not worth taking. Thank you.\n\nNotes\n1 Federal Open Market Committee (2012).\n2 A number of articles and working papers estimate that the role of structural factors in explaining recent high unemployment rates is relatively modest.

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you for that kind introduction. I’m delighted to be here today at the Bank of Ann Arbor to offer my perspective on the state of the U.S. economy. Before I begin I must state that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System.\nLast week, in response to accumulating evidence that we were not achieving a significant and substantial improvement in U.S. labor markets, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) took some important policy actions. First, it initiated a new program to buy mortgage backed securities that will continue—and, if necessary, be augmented by other policy actions—until the outlook for the labor market improves substantially. Second, the Committee stated that it expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for policy for a considerable time after the recovery strengthens. In particular, it expects that near zero short-term interest rates will be appropriate at least through mid-2015.1\nFor more than two years, I have vigorously supported strongly accommodative monetary policy measures as the appropriate response to the unacceptable state of the U.S. labor market and benign outlook for inflation. I believe the combination of new asset purchases and enhanced forward guidance about future policy should provide an important added stimulus to economic activity and hiring. However, as I’ll explain later, I think there are additional steps the Fed can take to further strengthen its positive effects on the economy.\nThe context for our recent actions is an economy that has been growing, but not at a pace fast enough to restore it to its productive potential in anything close to a reasonable amount of time. And today, even the growth we do see faces some big risks — risks that further bolster the argument for strong accommodation.\nI regularly talk to a large number of chief executive officers (CEOs) about business conditions. Many of these executives run big firms with an international presence. Throughout the summer, they increasingly pointed to the U.S. as the bright spot in the global economy. Their comments, however, were not a testament to the U.S. recovery, but an indication that global economic activity was weakening — first in Europe and later elsewhere around the world. In addition, at home, we could face substantially more restrictive fiscal conditions if federal budget negotiations fail to resolve the issues surrounding the so-called fiscal cliff. And for both the global situation and the U.S. fiscal cliff, there is a lot of uncertainty over what the eventual outcomes will be.\nMore monetary accommodation and greater confidence in the future mean a stronger U.S. economy. A stronger economy would be more resilient to a large-scale decline in global growth or a sharp fiscal retrenchment. In contrast, piling these risk-events on a weak economy could throw us back into recession.\nOur economy today is simply not resilient enough. The damage from the Great Recession was substantial; and to date, the recovery has been disappointing. The real value of goods and services produced in the U.S. today is probably more than 5 percent below what economists call potential — that is, the economy’s ability to produce goods and services without generating inflationary pressures. The unemployment rate has been stuck at around 8 percent for nearly a year — well above the 5 percent to 6 percent level we would see if all of our resources were fully engaged. In the absence of further monetary stimulus or fiscal repair, the outlook would be for more of the same: moderate growth that is not strong enough to generate substantial improvement in the labor market; an unemployment rate that is likely to remain above its long-run level for a long time to come; and an economy that would be vulnerable to shocks at home and abroad.\nNow, I am an optimist. I think we can do better than this gloomy outlook. That is why action is important. A great deal of state-of-the-art analysis — done both inside and outside of the Fed — indicates that the severe downturn in 2008–09 was mainly the result of a large drop in aggregate demand which left the economy operating below its potential. Research also shows that better and more accommodative policies have the power to reverse these setbacks and raise employment, output and incomes.2 In other words, more accommodative policy can deliver a stronger economy and the resiliency we are seeking. Furthermore, appropriate policy can deliver these better outcomes without generating inflation that is significantly higher than the Fed’s long-run goal of 2 percent.\nThere are many who believe otherwise. In their view, our current low output and high unemployment are the hallmarks of an economy that has lost its competitiveness — an economy that experienced permanent disruptions in its infrastructure, the skills base of its work force and its technological capability. In such a dismal view of the economy, monetary policy is powerless and cannot generate a stronger, more robust expansion. Any attempt to increase aggregate demand through more accommodative monetary policy would simply lead to higher inflation rather than better resource allocation.\nI see little evidence to support such a pessimistic view of the world. And I refuse to be so nihilistic in the absence of strong evidence of permanent disruptions. It is very hard to believe that millions of people who were working productively just a few years ago have suddenly become unemployable. And while many of the pessimists have been predicting higher inflation for several years, it hasn’t materialized. Indeed, core inflation has been under 2 percent since the end of 2008; and except for some near-term transitory movements in food and energy prices, most forecasters do not see any major change in inflation over the next few years.\n\nForces Restraining Growth\nBefore I discuss the risks to the economy, let me explain forces that have been restraining growth for some time.\nReviewing the historical record from around the world, Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff and others find that, given the monetary and fiscal policies that are typically pursued, a prolonged period of slow growth following a financial crisis is the unfortunate norm.3 And, despite the fact that the Federal Reserve has turned to many atypical monetary policy responses, the current U.S. experience is following the typical pattern. The recent financial crisis set in motion powerful forces that generated huge losses in wealth, greatly restrained aggregate demand and created difficult credit conditions. The effects have lingered, notably through a long period of deleveraging as many households and businesses seek to repair their damaged balance sheets.\nThere are a number of facets to this process. The financial sector is still recovering from its losses during the crisis and realizes the need — partly because of new regulatory standards — to hold larger liquidity and capital cushions against potential shocks. Many nonfinancial firms see weak or erratic demand for their products and few profitable investment opportunities. Moreover, these businesses are well-attuned to the downside risks to the economy. These factors lead them to reduce debt burdens and save cash. In addition, households still face high unemployment risk and slow wage growth, while holding a stock of wealth that has yet to return to its pre-crisis level. Furthermore, for many families, credit conditions are still tight. As a result, growth in consumer spending has been sluggish.\nThis is important because the ultimate end-user for all production is the consumer. For example, intermediate goods ultimately go toward the production of consumer goods. Likewise, investment expands businesses’ productive capacity to make even more consumer goods. And U.S. exports to other countries provide goods and services to consumers abroad. Therefore, deleveraging by domestic households and less robust consumption by our trading partners both eventually translate into weaker overall aggregate demand in the U.S.\nWhenever the economy operates below its potential, the key mechanism that returns the economy back to potential is a fall in real interest rates. This decline reduces the supply of saving and boosts the demand for investment, resulting in increased spending. This equilibrating process has been made more difficult because our traditional interest rate policy tool, the federal funds rate, has already been lowered to essentially zero..4 We can’t lower it any further. Instead, we have turned to nontraditional policies, such as providing forward guidance about future policy rates and making large-scale purchases of longer-dated Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. These policies have helped support growth — the economy would be in much worse shape if we had not made these moves. That said, they were not enough to generate robust growth in the face of unexpectedly strong and persistent headwinds throughout this recovery period. In part, last week’s additional monetary policy actions were a response to the disappointing pace of the recovery. However, they were also intended to increase the resiliency of the economy in the face of the increasing headwinds and greater downside risks posed by the slowdown in global economic growth, the economic turmoil in Europe and the fast-approaching U.S. fiscal cliff.\nLet me now go into some more detail on each of these risks.\n\nA Slowing Global Economy\nIn the first couple years following the 2008–09 recession, we saw a two-speed global recovery: moderate growth in the U.S. and other advanced economies and strong growth in emerging economies, such as China, Brazil and India. But today, Europe is in recession, and other advanced economies are growing only modestly. Growth in the emerging economies has slowed; notably, gross domestic production (GDP) in China appears to be rising at about an 8 percent pace this year. This sounds like a big number, but it is well below the more than 11-1/2 percent rate it averaged in the five years prior to the global recession. According to the latest projections by the International Monetary Fund, growth in overall world output is expected to be about 3-1/2 percent in 2012; this compares with gains that averaged roughly 5 percent prior to the recession.5\nAs I noted earlier, my conversations with CEOs, as well as the recent earnings reports of international firms more generally, indicate that the impact of slower growth abroad is already evident in sales of U.S. firms that operate in global markets. This means that we can’t count on a boost to U.S. output from robust exports. And this dynamic is true for the world as a whole. Demand has to come from somewhere. No country can count on export growth if their trading partners aren’t economically healthy. Since the global balance of trade must by definition balance, the math is straightforward: It is impossible for every country to run a trade surplus and export their way to better economic health.\nOver the past couple of decades, world economic growth has depended heavily on U.S. consumers.

Given the forces holding back U.S. consumers, the world economy can no longer count on U.S. households to drive growth. Other countries need to take steps to stimulate their own domestic demand.\nHopefully, the recession in Europe will be confined to Europe. And hopefully, other advanced and emerging market economies will spur vibrant recoveries that allow them to achieve their full potential. But for the moment, there’s a significant risk that the global recovery might weaken further. One only has to think about the statement that the U.S. is the bright spot for growth to infer the sense of pessimism many business leaders have about prospects around the rest of the world.\n\nEuropean Crisis\nThe second risk we face is the potential for serious fallout on the U.S. economy from the ongoing crisis in Europe.\nEurope is in an extremely difficult situation: Not only is the euro area in recession, but there are existential questions about the viability of the currency union itself. Clearly, the eurozone’s periphery countries, such as Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy, face great economic difficulties. The problems for these periphery countries are many and vary from the excessive government spending and the inability to collect taxes in Greece to the hangover of insolvent banks resulting from past exuberance in Spain and Ireland.\nMost of the focus has been on the immediate ability of the periphery countries to finance their debt. Of course, the fundamental problem in these countries is the lack of growth and competitiveness. These problems are manifest in their large trade deficits, which are mostly with other countries in the eurozone. For such countries this requires an increase in competitiveness. For a country with its own currency, a quick channel for achieving improved competitiveness is currency depreciation. As Milton Friedman said “It is far simpler to allow one price to change, namely, the price of foreign exchange, than to rely upon changes in the multitude of prices that together constitute the internal price structure.\".6 This automatically increases the country’s international competitiveness, provides immediate support to growth and gives the country more time to institute the structural and regulatory reforms needed to permanently increase its productive capacity and competitiveness.\nThe experiences of the United Kingdom (UK) and Italy in 1992 are classic examples of such an adjustment process.

These include the expiration of the so-called Bush tax cuts, the expiration of the payroll tax holiday and the conclusions of numerous other provisions. In addition, under current law, in the absence of a budget deal, there will be automatic sequestration of spending amounting to $1 trillion over a 10-year period.\nThe impact of permitting these programs to all expire at once would be huge. The Congressional Budget Office recently compared the full force of the current law with a scenario in which only the payroll tax cut and extended unemployment insurance benefits were allowed to expire. Their central estimate was that the full suite of scheduled budget actions could shrink real GDP in 2013 by 2-1/4 percent and increase the unemployment rate by about a percentage point relative to the less draconian scenario.7 \nSuch fiscal contraction would be a serious threat to our fragile recovery. And it would be an unusual response to economic weakness. Normally, fiscal policy acts as an economic stabilizer as it did in the 1970s, 1980s and 2000s, when robust government spending boosted real GDP growth as we recovered from recession.

Tying the period of time over which we will purchase assets to the achievement of significant improvement in the labor market is a strong step towards economic conditionality — that is, it conditions our actions to the economy’s performance instead of a calendar date. And stating that we expect to keep a highly accommodative stance for policy for a considerable time after the recovery strengthens is an important reassurance to households and businesses that Fed policy will not tighten prematurely. A large body of economic research says that committing to such a delay is a key feature of optimal policies during periods when policy rates are constrained to be zero, such as we have experienced in the U.S. since late 2008.\n\nConclusion\nLet me be clear. This was the time to act. With the problems we face and the potential dangers lying ahead, it is essential to do as much as we can now to bolster the resiliency and vibrancy of the economy. We cannot be complacent and assume that the economy is not being damaged if no action is taken. I am optimistic that we can achieve better outcomes through more monetary policy accommodation.\nSome have argued that the circumstances we find ourselves in today are so different from the way in which monetary policy normally operates that we must tread cautiously. They argue that more monetary policy accommodation may lead to unintended consequences. Yet, being timid and unduly passive can also lead to unintended consequences. If we continue to take only modest, cautious, safe policy actions, we risk suffering a lost decade similar to that which Japan experienced in the 1990s. Underestimating the enormity of our problems and the negative forces holding back growth itself exposes the economy to other potentially more serious unintended consequences. That type of passivity is a gamble that is not worth taking. Thank you.\n\nNotes\n1 Federal Open Market Committee (2012).\n2 A number of articles and working papers estimate that the role of structural factors in explaining recent high unemployment rates is relatively modest.

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you for the invitation to speak to you today. I am very happy for the opportunity to participate in Market News International seminar and to offer my thoughts on the U.S. and world economies.\nWe live in an amazingly interconnected world — a world in which financial markets are linked by the instantaneous transmission of information and business activity is intertwined among nations. For a long time, U.S. consumers and firms have been an important source of demand for Asian economies. This comes with pluses and minuses: Without the robust growth in the U.S. in 1997–98, the Asian financial crisis may well have been much worse than it actually was; in contrast, the recession and sluggish growth in the U.S. over the past five years have weighed heavily on the demand for products from Asia.\nMy comments today will focus primarily on the outlook for the U.S., but with an eye on its potential impact on Asian economies. Of course, here I have to cover the substantial downside risks to the forecast stemming from both the European debt situation and the U.S. fiscal cliff. I will also discuss how this outlook and other economic analyses shape my views for the appropriate stance of monetary policy.\nBefore I turn to the focus of today’s discussion, I would like to remind you that the views expressed are my own and do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System. \nOutlook\nLet’s start with the economic outlook. We are all too familiar with the fact that the financial crisis that unfolded in 2007 and 2008 precipitated a global recession that was unusually deep and lengthy in the U.S. and other advanced economies. Perhaps this shouldn’t have been surprising. The detailed analysis by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff (2009) concludes that recessions caused by financial crises generally are severe and are followed by anemic recoveries. By any yardstick, this certainly describes the U.S. recovery to date: Output growth has averaged only 2-1/4 percent annually, and resource gaps remain huge. In particular, the unemployment rate remains over 8 percent — well above the 5-1/4 to 6 percent rate most FOMC participants view as being consistent with a fully employed labor force over the longer run.\nBoth public and private sector forecasts see relatively modest rates of growth over the next few years. For example, most recent forecasts by the private sector have 2012 gross domestic product (GDP) growth at less than 2 percent; a pace that may not even be enough to keep up with potential.1 Growth in 2013 is expected to be only moderately higher. Moreover, both the European debt situation and the looming U.S. fiscal cliff impart substantial downside risks to the forecast.\nEven absent any negative shocks, such tepid growth rates would close the large existing resource gaps only very gradually. Indeed, I expect that we will face unemployment well above sustainable levels for some time to come. \nImplications for Asia\nIn the aftermath of the Great Recession, most Asian economies enjoyed a return to solid levels of growth. Today, however, growth in Asia faces some new challenges. One of these challenges is that Asian economies will not be immune to the tepid growth prospects facing the world’s advanced economies. Forecasts for growth in Asia have been marked down over the past year, reflecting in part the impact of the downgrade in the outlook for Asian exports for the U.S. and the euro area. For example, the U.S. and the euro area account for about one-third of China’s merchandise exports. The recession and weak recoveries in those economies were big factors in the Chinese current account surplus falling from about 10 percent of GDP in 2007 to less than 3 percent in 2011. This weakness remains a consideration as we look forward; indeed, it is an important reason why the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is projecting that the Chinese current account surplus will fall even more by 2013.2 \nInternational trade is an excellent thing: Exploiting comparative advantages raises living standards for all nations. However, all countries can’t simultaneously export their way out of their problems. For the world as a whole, the current account has to balance. Thus, countries with large external surpluses face risks to their economies posed by slowdowns in their trading partners. Aggregate world growth must reflect aggregated domestic demands. So if demand is going to be sluggish in a large share of the world economy, other nations must take up the slack, or world growth will fall.\nInflation\nWith regard to inflation, as you know, the FOMC’s long-run inflation objective is 2 percent as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE). For a number of reasons, I don’t foresee much risk that inflation will rise above reasonable tolerance levels relative to this objective. First, we see evidence of low expectations for inflation and growth in the today’s historically low Treasury yields. If there were warning signs of dangerous inflationary pressures, the ten-year rate wouldn’t be in the neighborhood of 1-3/4 percent! Second, even with the latest increase in oil prices, energy and commodity prices remain well off their recent peaks as the global outlook dims. Third, as I just noted, the output gap remains large and is likely to close only slowly. In this economic environment, wage pressures are practically nonexistent. And it is hard to envision how major persistent inflation pressures will emerge without a parallel increase in wage costs. Such parallel price and wage increases were a big part of the 1970s inflation, a scenario some fear repeating today. Fourth, inflationary dynamics depend in large part on the momentum generated by people’s expectations of future inflation; currently, inflation expectations are well anchored, which will tend to keep inflation from moving either up or down. Putting all of these factors together along with the fact that core inflation averaged 1.8 percent over the past year, I conclude that inflation will likely remain near or below our 2 percent target over the medium term.\nSources of Risk and Their Implications\nI would now like to turn to two important downside risks to the outlook for growth. This will be a bit of a U.S.-centric view, but clearly these risks also have important implications for growth here in Asia and the rest of the world. \nEurope\nLet me begin with the European debt situation. Obviously, the developments in Europe pose a significant downside risk to the U.S. economy and world economic growth more broadly. The direct effects of slower European growth on the U.S. economy would be relatively small. The eurozone nations account for less than 15 percent of U.S. merchandise exports.3 Thus, according to standard elasticity estimates, even a moderate eurozone recession would reduce U.S. exports by only a couple of tenths of GDP.4\nThe indirect effects of eurozone developments could, however, be more severe, both in the U.S. and Asia. One possible channel would be through financial contagion. If losses on euro-centric assets put a large enough dent in the balance sheets of financial institutions that lend to U.S. households and businesses, the increases in the cost and availability of credit would reduce growth in the U.S. with possible spillover effects into Asia as well. Clearly, this is a risk worth monitoring. Fortunately, though, U.S. financial institutions are in much better shape to handle such potential losses than they were in 2008. Recognizing the risks posed by the European debt situation, U.S. institutions have reduced their direct exposure to European assets and tightened lending standards to European banks.5  On the regulatory front, the most recent stress tests made large U.S. banks demonstrate that they would have adequate capital even in the event of a sharp European recession with contagion to global financial markets.\nA second possible channel would be through the effects of uncertainty on current demand. Throughout the recovery, U.S. business and household sentiment has been very fragile. Every hint of bad news seems to generate a wave of increased caution and an associated pullback in spending as firms and families seek to protect their individual balance sheets. After what the U.S. economy went through in the Great Recession, this skittishness is understandable — particularly if one can envision a very large downside to the news event. And, as I just noted, given developments in Europe, there certainly are some serious downside scenarios one can envision, even if they are not the most likely outcomes. So it would be no surprise if yet another wave of uncertainty put a further dent in consumption and investment.\n\nU.S. fiscal cliff\nAnother risk to the U.S. economy comes from the so-called fiscal cliff. Under current U.S. law, numerous tax and spending provisions enacted in various stimulus packages dating as far back as 2001 are scheduled to expire on January 1, 2013. In addition, if no budget agreement is reached by Congress, there will be significant automatic spending sequestration and other spending cuts in January. According to projections made by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO),6 if all these things took place, real GDP growth would be reduced by about 4 percentage points in 2013.\nI’m not saying that a pullback of this magnitude should be the base-case scenario. The orders of magnitude are just too big to be a base case. But when you go through the various items and make guesses at which may stay and which may go, it is easy to envision scenarios that include a marked increase in fiscal restraint in 2013. In addition, given the political process, it seems unlikely that we will know much about the size or composition of the cuts until late in the process. It’s also easy to see how the rhetoric of public negotiating stances could produce an atmosphere that causes already jittery households and businesses to put some spending plans on hold. In sum, a messy resolution to the fiscal cliff problems presents an important downside risk to U.S. growth prospects and, by extension, to world economic growth. And even the possibility of such an outcome could be a drag in the second half of the year.\n\nPolicy Choices\nLet me now switch gears and talk about my views regarding the choices facing monetary policymakers in the U.S. Yes, we have substantial liquidity already in place in our financial system. On the surface, this looks like substantial monetary accommodation. But as a large body of economic theory tells us, for this liquidity to be sufficiently accommodative, the public needs to expect that we will keep it in place for as long as is necessary to restore the economy to a sound footing. This is why I believe we should clarify the Fed’s forward guidance with regard to the future course of policy. Let me now go into the details behind these thoughts.\nAn explicit economic state-contingent policy \nIn weighing alternative policy approaches, I think the best way to provide forward guidance is by tying our policy actions to explicit measures of economic performance. There are many ways of doing this, including setting a target for the level of nominal GDP. But recognizing the difficult nature of that policy approach, I have a more modest proposal: I think the Fed should make it clear that the federal funds rate will not be increased until the unemployment rate falls below 7 percent. Knowing that rates would stay low until significant progress is made in reducing unemployment would reassure markets and the public that the Fed would not prematurely reduce its accommodation.\nBased on the work I have seen, I do not expect that such policy would lead to a major problem with inflation. But I recognize that there is a chance that the models and other analysis supporting this approach could be wrong. Accordingly, I believe that the commitment to low rates should be dropped if the outlook for inflation over the medium term rises above 3 percent.\nThe economic conditionality in this 7/3 threshold policy would clarify our forward policy intentions greatly and provide a more meaningful guide on how long the federal funds rate will remain low. In addition, I would indicate that clear and steady progress toward stronger growth is essential. Because we are not seeing that now, I support further use of our balance sheet to provide even more monetary accommodation. In June we decided to continue our Maturity Extension Program, which puts downward pressure on long-term interest rates by extending the average maturity of the Federal Reserve’s securities portfolio. I thought that was a useful step. However, I believe it is time to take even stronger steps, such as the purchase of more mortgage-backed securities, to increase the degree of monetary support for the recovery. As suggested recently by my colleagues Eric Rosengren and John Williams, these could be open-ended purchases, meaning that they would continue at a certain rate until there was clear evidence of improvement in economic conditions. To me, one example of clear evidence would be a resumption of relatively steady monthly declines in unemployment for two or three quarters. Once this momentum was confidently established, the Fed could stop adding to our balance sheet but keep the funds rate at zero. The funds rate would remain unchanged in my thinking, until the unemployment rate hit at least 7 percent or the medium-term inflation outlook deteriorated dramatically and rose above 3 percent. Later, reductions in the Fed’s balance sheet assets would occur sometime after the first increase in the funds rate. This corresponds to the general exit principles the FOMC agreed upon last year. Presumably, the pace of asset reductions would be measured and consistent with a continued, robust recovery in the context of price stability.\n\nAccommodation in the Context of a Symmetric Inflation Target and Balanced Policy\nI can’t tell you how often people look at me in horror when I say that we should adopt a conditional policy that tolerates the risk of inflation exceeding our target by as much as 1 percentage point. How can I accept inflation rising above our stated target? Isn’t this blasphemy for a central banker?\nIn January, in the same framework document that announced our 2 percent inflation target, we also stated a number of principles for the conduct of monetary policy. One was that policy would take a balanced approach in achieving the two legs of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate — maximum employment and price stability. An explicit real-side mandate makes the Federal Reserve different than most central banks. While just about all central banks follow a flexible inflation targeting approach, in which they seek to minimize real-side fluctuations in pursuit of their inflation objective, most are explicitly charged only with an inflation objective. But for the Fed, maximum employment is an explicit part of our policy mandate.\nI strongly support the policy principles document we released in January. But we’re still hearing questions about whether our inflation goal is symmetric and about the specifics of how policy will be implemented under the balanced approach articulated in this framework.\nAs Chairman Bernanke (2012) stated at his April press conference, the 2 percent inflation goal is a symmetric objective and not a ceiling on inflation. Symmetry means that inflation below 2 percent should be viewed as the same policy miss as if inflation overran 2 percent by equal amount.\nWe need to take symmetry seriously. If we disproportionately recoil at inflation a little above 2 percent versus a little below, then we are not symmetrically weighing policy misses. And we will not average 2 percent inflation, which is our goal. There is some risk of this misperception taking hold. Consider the FOMC’s latest Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which includes the projections of all FOMC participants, voters and non-voters alike. In it, several forecasts have the funds rate rising before 2014, even though throughout the projection period most see inflation at or below 2 percent and unemployment well above the sustainable rate indicated by the long-run projections. Without further explanation, it’s difficult to see how this is consistent with a symmetric inflation goal and a balanced approach to achieving the two legs in our dual mandate.\nI believe the FOMC can do better at describing our thinking with respect to tolerance bands around our long-run inflation and unemployment goals. Clarification would increase both transparency and accountability. Importantly, it would reassure economic agents that Fed policy would not tighten prematurely.\nTo me, a symmetric inflation goal and a balanced approach to policy mean that if we are missing our employment mandate by a large amount, but are close to our inflation target, then we should be willing to undertake policies that could substantially reduce the employment gap even if they run the risk of a modest, transitory rise in inflation that remains within a reasonable tolerance range of our target. I believe such actions, such as the 7/3 threshold policy I have been advocating, would produce smaller net losses relative to our dual mandate goals than would current policy.\n\nConclusion: The Need for a Vibrant Economy to Cushion Risks\nFinding a way to deliver more accommodation — whether it is monetary or fiscal — is particularly important now because delays in reducing unemployment are costly. An unusually large percentage of the unemployed have been without work for quite an extended period of time; their skills can become less current or even deteriorate, leaving affected workers with permanent scars on their lifetime earnings. And any resulting lower aggregate productivity also weighs on potential output, wages and profits for the economy as a whole. The damage intensifies the longer that unemployment remains high. Failure to act aggressively now could lower the capacity of the economy for many years to come.\nSuch potential costs would come with the continuation of a subpar pace of economic recovery. The significant risks I discussed earlier – financial disruption from a worsening of the situation in Europe or a messy resolution of U.S. fiscal policy – raise the specter of an even more worrisome outcome. At the moment economic growth is not much above stall speed. Another negative shock could send the economy into recession. And if a recessionary dynamic takes hold, it would be especially difficult to regain momentum.\nI have outlined some policy actions that I think can take us in the direction of a more vibrant and resilient economy. Given the risks we face, I think it is vital that we make such moves today. I don’t think we should be in a mode where we are waiting to see what the next few data releases bring. We are well past the threshold for additional action; we should take that action now. Thank you.\n\nNotes\n1 Note that many analysts believe that a number of factors—such as reduced capital formation and dislocations in the labor market—have temporarily lowered the rate of potential output growth relative to its longer-run rate. For example, the Congressional Budget Office (2012a) estimates the rate of potential output growth in 2011–12 to be about 1-3/4 percent per annum, but sees it picking up to about 2-1/2 percent in 2015–16.\n2 Between September 2011 and April 2012, the International Monetary Fund revised down its 2012 growth projections for both advanced and emerging Asian economies by more than 0.5 percentage point, partly because of a deterioration of growth prospects in Europe (see figure 2.1 in International Monetary Fund, Research Department, 2012). The IMF's July 2012 forecast update lowered the growth forecast for developing and newly industrialized Asia economies in 2012 by 0.3 and 0.6 percentage point, respectively. The July update did not contain updated details on current accounts; the projection for the Chinese current account surplus in the text refers to the April IMF forecast.\n3 According to data reported by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the euro area received 13.9 percent of U.S. merchandise exports in 2010. See UNCTAD.\n4 Crane, Crowley and Quaayum (2007) estimate U.S. export elasticity with respect to income to be 2.34 on data from 1981 through 2006. Cardarelli and Rebucci (2007) estimate it to be 1.85 using data from 1973 to 2006.\n5 See the Federal Reserve's Senior Loan Survey website.\n6 See Congressional Budget Office (2012b).\n\nReferences\nBernanke, Ben S., 2012, press conference, Board of the Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC, April 25.\nCardarelli, Roberto, and Alessandro Rebucci, 2007, “Exchange rates and the adjustment of external imbalances,” in World Economic Outlook, Washington DC: International Monetary Fund, April, pp. 81–120.\nCongressional Budget Office, 2012a, \"Key Assumptions in Projecting Potential GDP -- January 2012 Baseline,\" January 31.\nCongressional Budget Office, 2012b, \"Economic effects of reducing the fiscal restraint that is scheduled to occur in 2013,\" report, Washington, DC, May.\nCrane, Leland, Meredith Crowley and Saad Quayyum, 2007, “Understanding the evolution of trade deficits: Trade elasticities of industrialized countries,” Economic Perspectives, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Vol. 31, Fourth Quarter, pp. 2–17.\nEggertsson, Gauti B., and Michael Woodford, 2003, “The zero bound on interest rates and optimal monetary policy,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Vol. 34, No. 1, pp. 139–211.\nKrugman, Paul R., 1998, “It’s baaack: Japan’s slump and the return of the liquidity trap,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Vol. 29, No. 2, pp. 137–206.\nInternational Monetary Fund, Research Department, 2012, \"Growth resuming, dangers remain,\" World Economic Outlook: April 2012, report, Washington DC, April 17.\nReifschneider, David L., and John C.

Indeed, I expect that we will face unemployment well above sustainable levels for some time to come.\nImplications for Asia\nGrowth in most Asian economies has picked back up in recent years, though not quite back to the very robust rates seen prior to the recession. Of course, going forward, they will not be immune to the tepid growth prospects that the U.S. and other advanced economies are now facing. Indeed, the weaker outlook for the U.S. and euro area has already contributed to reduced growth forecasts in Asia.2 For example, the U.S. and euro area account for about one-third of China’s merchandise exports. The recession and weak recoveries in those economies were big factors in the Chinese current account surplus falling from about 10 percent of GDP in 2007 to under 3 percent in 2011. The International Monetary Fund’s April World Economic Outlook is projecting that in 2013, the Chinese current account surplus will still be just 2.6 percent of GDP. For example, the U.S. and euro area account for about one-third of China’s merchandise exports. The recession and weak recoveries in those economies were big factors in the Chinese current account surplus falling from about 10 percent of GDP in 2007 to under 3 percent in 2011. The International Monetary Fund’s April World Economic Outlook is projecting that in 2013, the Chinese current account surplus will still be just 2.6 percent of GDP. Not much export-led growth there. And this forecast was conditioned on only a small recession in the euro area (–0.2 percent fourth quarter to fourth quarter) and 2 percent growth in the U.S.3\nInternational trade is a great thing: Exploiting comparative advantages raises living standards for all nations. However, all countries can’t simultaneously export their way out of their problems. For the world as a whole, the current account has to balance.

For a number of reasons, I don’t foresee much risk that inflation will rise above reasonable tolerance levels relative to this objective. First, the ten-year Treasury rate is in the neighborhood of 1-1/2 percent! And its decomposition into a long-run real rate and an inflation expectation is flashing something very different than warnings of dangerous inflationary pressures. I’ll have more on this later. Second, energy and commodity prices have fallen well off their recent peaks as the global outlook dims. Third, as I just noted, the output gap remains large and is likely to close only slowly. In this economic environment, wage pressures are practically nonexistent. And it is hard to envision how we could see major persistent inflation pressures without a parallel increase in wage costs. Such parallel price and wage increases were a big part of the 1970s inflation, a scenario some fear repeating today. Fourth, inflationary dynamics depend in large part on the momentum generated by people’s expectations of future inflation; currently, inflation expectations are well anchored, which will tend to keep inflation from moving either up or down. Putting all of these factors together along with the fact that core inflation averaged 1.8 percent over the past year, I conclude that inflation will likely remain near or below our 2 percent target over the medium term.\n\nSources of Risk and Their Implications\nI would now like to turn to two important downside risks to the outlook for growth. I’ll be taking a bit of a U.S.-centric view to these, but clearly they also have important implications for growth here in Asia and the rest of the world.\nEurope\nLet me begin with the European debt situation. Obviously, the developments in Europe pose a significant downside risk to the U.S. economy and world economic growth more broadly. The direct effects of slower European growth on the U.S. economy would be relatively small. The eurozone nations account for less than 15 percent of U.S. exports.4 Thus, according to standard elasticity estimates,5 even a moderate eurozone recession would reduce U.S. exports by only a couple of tenths of GDP. The direct export exposures to Europe of Asian economies vary relative to that of the U.S. economy, but they are generally of the same order of magnitude.6 Elasticity estimates are harder to nail down and some might be larger than for the U.S. Nonetheless, overall, the direct effects of a slowing in the euro area on Asian economies probably would be manageable.\nThe indirect effects of eurozone developments could, however, be more severe, both in the U.S. and Asia. One possible channel would be through financial contagion. If losses on euro-centric assets put a large enough dent in the balance sheets of financial institutions that lend to U.S. households and businesses, increases in the cost and availability of credit would reduce growth in the U.S. and could spill over into Asia as well. Clearly, this is a risk worth monitoring. Fortunately, though, U.S. financial institutions are in much better shape to handle such potential losses than they were in 2008. Recognizing the risks posed by the European debt situation, U.S. institutions have reduced their direct exposure to European assets. For example, the largest U.S. prime money market funds have trimmed their exposure to eurozone banks to under 15 percent of their assets, about half their allocation prior to the eurozone crisis.7 U.S. banks have also tightened lending standards to European banks.8 On the regulatory front, the most recent stress test administered to large U.S. banks included the possibility of a sharp European recession with contagion to global financial markets, and major U.S. banks demonstrated that they had capital plans in place that were adequate to weather this hypothetical scenario. \nA second possible channel would be through the effects of uncertainty on current demand. Throughout the recovery, U.S. business and household sentiment has been very fragile. Every hint of bad news seems to generate a wave of increased caution and an associated pullback in spending as firms and families seek to protect their individual balance sheets. After what the U.S. economy went through in the Great Recession, this skittishness is understandable — particularly if one can envision a very large downside to the news event. And, as I just noted, given developments in Europe, there certainly are some serious downside scenarios one can envision, even if they are not the most likely outcomes. So it would be no surprise if yet another wave of uncertainty put a further dent in consumption and investment.\nU.S. fiscal cliff\nAnother risk to the U.S. economy comes from the so-called fiscal cliff. Under current law, numerous tax and spending provisions enacted in various stimulus packages dating as far back as 2001 are scheduled to expire on January 1, 2013. In addition, if no budget agreement is reached by Congress, then significant automatic spending sequestration will take place. There also are some other miscellaneous cuts scheduled to occur in January. According to the Congressional Budget Office’s projections,9 if these cuts all took place, real GDP growth would be reduced by about 4 percentage points in 2013.\nI’m not saying that a pullback of this magnitude should be the base-case scenario. The orders of magnitude are just too big. But when you go through the various items and make guesses at which may stay and which may go, it is easy to envision scenarios that include a marked increase in fiscal restraint in 2013. In addition, given the political process, it seems unlikely that we will know much about the size or composition of the cuts until late in the process. It’s also easy to see how the rhetoric of public negotiating stances could produce an atmosphere that causes already jittery households and businesses to put some spending plans on hold. In sum, a messy resolution to the fiscal cliff problems presents an important downside risk to U.S. growth prospects and, by extension, to world economic growth.\n\nPolicy Choices\nLet me now switch gears and talk about my views regarding the choices facing monetary policymakers in the U.S. Yes, we have substantial liquidity already in place in our financial system. On the surface, this looks like substantial monetary accommodation. But as a large body of economic theory tells us, for this liquidity to be sufficiently accommodative, the public needs to expect that we will keep it in place as long as is necessary to restore the economy to a sound footing. This is why I believe we should clarify our forward guidance with regard to the future course of policy. Let me now go into the details behind these thoughts.\nOptimal policy and Taylor rules\nSince the summer of 2010, I have consistently argued for the strongest policy accommodation available. With huge resource gaps, slow growth and low inflation, the economic circumstances warrant extremely strong accommodation. Many of my views were well captured in the macro-model analyses discussed in a speech given by Vice Chair Janet Yellen (2012) this past April.\nGovernor Yellen compared two approaches to evaluating the stance of monetary policy to a baseline constructed from the midpoint of FOMC participants’ forecasts made in January. The first was an optimal control policy — which prescribes the interest rate path that, in a well-specified econometric model for the U.S. economy, minimizes the deviations in inflation and unemployment from their policy goals. The optimal monetary policy in that analysis kept the federal funds rate near zero into early 2015 — a year later than in the baseline — in order to keep the cost of capital extremely low. Even with the additional accommodation under the optimal control exercise, the unemployment rate does not reach 5-1/2 percent until mid-2016; that’s pretty late, but it is still at least two years earlier than in the baseline scenario.\nFurthermore, the outlook for inflation remains benign: The highest that inflation rises in any simulation is 2.3 percent — only 0.3 percentage point above the highest rate in the baseline. In my view, this is within any reasonable tolerance band around our 2 percent long-run objective for inflation, especially given that the unemployment rate currently is 2 to 3 percentage points above its sustainable rate.\nOf course, economic models, at best, are only approximations to real-world behavior. So it’s also prudent to look at policy prescriptions other than the optimal control policy. The most familiar of these are interest rate rules, like the Taylor rule (1993). These interest rate policy prescriptions are relatively simple empirical descriptions of the Fed’s historical reactions to misses from its policy goals. If we apply the 1999 version of John Taylor’s rule, we see the funds rate rising in early 2015. This lift-off is about 1-1/2 years after that in the 1993 version of the rule. But even the Taylor 1999 rule does not take account of the prolonged period that policy rates have been constrained to be higher than they could have been because of the zero lower bound on the federal funds rate. Taking account of this additional condition would delay the Taylor rule’s liftoff towards the optimal control policy.10 Furthermore, these analyses were constructed from projections made in January; not only has the baseline forecast dimmed since then, but neither exercise considers the now more evident asymmetric downside balance of risks coming from Europe and the U.S. fiscal cliff. Considering all of these factors, I conclude that both policy prescriptions support the need for a high degree of monetary accommodation.\nAn explicit economic state-contingent policy\nThis message is similar to what I have been consistently advocating for some time — specifically, additional monetary accommodation is needed to more quickly boost output to its full potential level.\nIn weighing alternative policy approaches, I do recognize the risk that these economic model analyses could be wrong. Accordingly, I have proposed that any further accommodative policies should contain a safeguard against an unreasonable increase in inflation. In my judgment, nominal income level targeting is an appropriate policy choice and has such a safeguard. But recognizing the difficult nature of that policy approach, I have a more modest proposal: I support a conditional approach, whereby the federal funds rate is not increased until the unemployment rate falls below 7 percent, at least, or until inflation rises above 3 percent over the medium term. The economic conditionality in my 7/3 threshold policy would clarify our forward policy intentions greatly and provide a more meaningful guide on how long the federal funds rate will remain low. In addition, I would indicate that clear and steady progress toward stronger growth is essential. Because we are not seeing that now, I support using our balance sheet to provide additional accommodation. I think our action in June that continued our Maturity Extension Program was useful; but I would have preferred an even stronger step, such as the purchase of more mortgage-backed securities.\nFinding a way to deliver more accommodation — whether it is monetary or fiscal — is particularly important now because delays in reducing unemployment are costly. An unusually large percentage of the unemployed have been without work for quite an extended period of time; their skills can become less current or even deteriorate, leaving affected workers with permanent scars on their lifetime earnings. And any resulting lower aggregate productivity also weighs on potential output, wages and profits for the economy as a whole. The damage intensifies the longer that unemployment remains high. Failure to act aggressively now will lower the capacity of the economy for many years to come.\n\nAccommodation in the Context of a Symmetric Inflation Target and Balanced Policy\nI can’t tell you how often people look at me in abject horror when I say that we should adopt a conditional policy that tolerates the risk of inflation exceeding our target by as much as 1 percentage point. How can I accept inflation rising above our stated target? Isn’t this blasphemy for a central banker?\nAs you know, in January we announced a specific number — 2 percent — for our inflation objective. At the same time, we also said that policy would take a balanced approach in achieving the two legs of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate — maximum employment and price stability. The explicit recognition of a real-side mandate is something different about the Federal Reserve. Most central banks are explicitly charged only with an inflation objective. Of course, just about all follow a flexible inflation targeting approach, in which they seek to minimize fluctuations in pursuit of their inflation objective. But for the Fed, maximum employment is an explicit part of our mandate.\nI strongly support the principles document we released in January. But questions still remain about the specifics of how policy will be implemented under this framework.\nAs Chairman Bernanke (2012) stated at his April press conference, the 2 percent inflation goal is a symmetric objective and not a ceiling on inflation. Symmetry means that inflation below 2 percent should be viewed as the same policy miss as if inflation overran 2 percent by equal amount. However, if we disproportionately recoil at inflation a little above 2 percent versus a little below, then we are not symmetrically weighing policy misses. And there is some risk of this misperception taking hold, since in the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), several participants’ forecasts have the funds rate rising before 2014, even though throughout the projection period most see inflation at or below 2 percent and unemployment well above the sustainable rate indicated by the long-run projections.\nI believe the FOMC can do better at describing our thinking with respect to tolerance bands around our long-run inflation and unemployment goals. Clarification would increase both transparency and accountability. Importantly, it would help markets better anticipate Fed actions, creating one less source of risk for economic agents to manage.\nTo me, a symmetric inflation goal and a balanced approach to policy mean that if we are missing our employment mandate by a large mark, but are close to our inflation target, then we should be willing to undertake policies that could substantially reduce the employment gap even if they run the risk of a modest, transitory rise in inflation that remains within a reasonable tolerance range. The 7/3 threshold policy I have been advocating is such a plan under which I expect the sum of the resulting two misses would be less than the one miss under a less accommodative policy.\n\nThe Signal from Nominal Long-term Treasury Rates\nAnother objection I often hear when making the case for more monetary accommodation is that higher inflation is inevitable. After all, there’s another important elephant in the room, right? The Fed’s balance sheet has ballooned from a mere $800 billion in August 2007 to almost $3 trillion today: With an explosion in the monetary base like this, inflation must be just around the corner, right? Despite the fact that this prediction has been around since mid-2009 and three years later it has not come close to fruition, it’s still early days, right?\nThe argument that inflation is imminent faces an enormous uphill battle these days, and a single number captures this concern very well: 1.45 percent. The ten-year Treasury rate was 1.45 percent as of June 1. And it is only 1.60 percent today. This is unprecedented in the post-World War II economy, and it is wildly inconsistent with rising inflation over the time frame that monetary policy is concerned with, such as the next ten years.\nWhat do such low rates signify? To start, the nominal short-term interest rate is the sum of the real interest rate plus expected inflation. In turn, long-term interest rates are the average of expected future short-term rates plus a term premium, or risk premium. There are a variety of ways to estimate this decomposition; and they all indicate that today all three pieces — expected real rates, expected inflation and the risk premia — appear to be quite low.\nWhat do these estimates imply? First, real interest rates reflect the expected return to saving and investing today in order to obtain more real goods and services tomorrow. Low long-term real rates imply that agents are expecting such returns to be low for a long time — which is consistent with them expecting economic activity to be relatively weak over the coming years. Next, low expected inflation means that market participants are building in little chance of a breakout in inflation. Indeed, if markets were expecting, say, 5 percent inflation for the U.S., then real rates would be on the order of negative 2 percent or negative 3 percent — implausibly low unless you expected an extraordinary economic meltdown. And if you believed this, you also would probably not think that Treasury securities were a safe bet, and their risk premia would be quite high. These Treasury premia, however, are quite low, reflecting a high demand for safe assets. Economic agents are cautious, and there is little appetite for risk-taking at the moment.\nWhat does this add up to? Well, low long-term Treasury rates support the view that markets are looking for only modest economic growth with low inflation, and a there is a high degree of caution out there — which itself is an important factor holding back economic activity today.\n\nConclusion: Low Policy Rates Are Appropriate Policy\nOf course, underlying these low long-term rates, too, are expectations that short-term policy rates will remain low for an extended period of time. The job of U.S. monetary policy, according to the Federal Reserve Act, is to provide monetary and financial conditions to support maximum employment and stable prices. As I noted earlier, we have an explicit dual mandate. Monetary policy thus aims to set short-term rates so that the supply of saving equals the demand for investment in a way that facilitates the U.S. economy reaching maximum employment and price stability.\nCurrently, the forces of supply and demand require very low rates. The supply of saving is high as households delever and repair their balance sheets. Furthermore, the demand for investment is low because most firms have much unused capacity and are unsure about the economic path forward. Therefore, equilibrium real rates are quite low. Indeed, today they are lower than actual rates because nominal short-term rates are constrained by the zero lower bound and can go no lower. Economists refer to this as a liquidity trap because interest rates cannot fall low enough to reemploy the economy’s unused productive resources. And the mainstream remedy to this dilemma — as articulated clearly in academic work by Krugman (1998), Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), Werning (2011) and others — is to commit to highly accommodative monetary policy now, and for an extended period into the future.\nThere are those who disagree with these prescriptions; they say that our low-rate policy isn’t doing any good — or even hurting the economy — and that we would be better off if we began to remove some accommodation.\nSuppose the FOMC immediately undertook a program to raise short-term interest rates. In other words, monetary policy could exogenously turn more restrictive. Would this help the economy? In my judgment, that would be a very bad policy. More restrictive credit would further reduce investment and job creation and limit the supply of credit to small business entrepreneurs, resulting in growth even slower than it is now. True, some savers and investors would receive higher returns on some of their investments. But we would not be left with higher returns on the whole. Weaker growth would generate lower real returns to many projects, and other sources of income, such as employment and entrepreneurial income, would be reduced.\nBut there will be a time when higher rates will be appropriate. If the FOMC and other policymakers could engineer stronger growth policies so that the economy boomed again and unemployment fell, this would organically lead to higher real rates of return on investment and higher interest rates in general, which would benefit savers and investors throughout the world. A more vibrant economy would benefit owners of unused resources, bring unused factory capacity back on line and reengage unemployed workers. This is the policy path that is most desirable in my opinion. I also think it is most consistent with the accommodative policies I have been advocating.\nThank you.\n\nNotes\n1 Note that many analysts believe that a number of factors — such as reduced capital formation and dislocations in the labor market — have temporarily lowered the rate of potential output growth relative to its longer-run rate. For example, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the rate of potential output growth in 2011–12 to be about 1-3/4 percent per annum, but sees it picking up to about 2-1/2 percent in 2015–16.\n2 For instance, between September 2011 and April 2012, the International Monetary Fund revised down its 2012 growth projections for both advanced and emerging Asian economies by more than 0.5 percentage point, partly because of a deterioration of growth prospects in Europe (see figure 2.1 in International Monetary Fund, 2012).\n3 International Monetary Fund, (2012), pp. 43, 191, 211.\n4 According to data reported by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the euro area received 13.9 percent of U.S. exports in 2010.\n5 Crane, Crowley and Quayyum (2007) estimate the U.S. export elasticity with respect to income to be 2.34 on data from 1981 through 2006. Cardarelli and Rebucci (2007) estimate it to be 1.85 using data from 1973 to 2006.\n6 UNCTAD reports that in 2010 the euro area accounted for 14.8 percent of China’s exports, 8.3 percent of Japan’s, 8.3 percent of Korea’s and 7.5 percent of Thailand’s.\n7 See Fitch Ratings website.\n8 See the Federal Reserve's Senior Loan Survey website.\n9 Congressional Budget Office (2012).\n10 Reifschneider and Williams (2000) show how taking account of the zero lower bound would delay liftoff in the Taylor 1993 rule; they did not investigate the Taylor 1999 rule, but the logic of their analysis would hold for the 1999 rule as well.\n\nReferences\nBernanke, Ben S., 2012, press conference, Board of the Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC, April 25.\nCardarelli, Roberto, and Alessandro Rebucci, 2007, “Exchange rates and the adjustment of external imbalances,” in World Economic Outlook, Washington DC: International Monetary Fund, April, pp. 81–120.\nCongressional Budget Office, 2012, \"Economic effects of reducing the fiscal restraint that is scheduled to occur in 2013,\" report, Washington, DC, May.\nCrane, Leland, Meredith Crowley and Saad Quayyum, 2007, “Understanding the evolution of trade deficits: Trade elasticities of industrialized countries,” Economic Perspectives, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Vol. 31, Fourth Quarter, pp. 2–17.\nEggertsson, Gauti B., and Michael Woodford, 2003, “The zero bound on interest rates and optimal monetary policy,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Vol. 34, No. 1, pp. 139–211.\nKrugman, Paul R., 1998, “It’s baaack: Japan’s slump and the return of the liquidity trap,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Vol. 29, No. 2, pp. 137–206.\nInternational Monetary Fund, Research Department, 2012, \"Growth resuming, dangers remain,\" World Economic Outlook: April 2012, report, Washington DC, April 17.\nReifschneider, David L., and John C.

            "content": "I. Introduction\nThank you so much for the invitation to speak to you tonight. It's a pleasure to appear before the Money Marketeers, a group whose members are very well acquainted with issues affecting the broad economy, including the unprecedented situation in which we find ourselves today. Over the years, this distinguished group has attracted an impressive number of speakers, Federal Reserve presidents and Governors among them, who have shared their insight and understanding of the economy.\nSo tonight I don’t intend to retread overly familiar ground. Instead, I hope to build on the conversation that Fed Vice Chair Janet Yellen started here just a few weeks ago. First, I will briefly discuss my economic outlook. Then I will point to the elements of Governor Yellen’s speech that capture my own policy prescriptions so well. Finally, I will address a few issues that have come up repeatedly during sessions such as this one.\nBefore I turn to the focus of today’s discussion, I would like to remind you that the views expressed are my own and do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nII. Outlook\nLet’s start with the economic outlook. We are all too familiar with the fact that the financial crisis that unfolded in 2007 and 2008 precipitated an unusually deep and lengthy recession. According to the detailed analysis by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff (2009), in their recent book titled This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly, recessions caused by financial crises generally are followed by anemic recoveries. By any yardstick, this certainly describes the U.S. recovery to date: Output growth has averaged only 2-1/2 percent annually, and resource gaps remain huge. In particular, the unemployment rate remains over 8 percent—well above the 5-1/4 to 6 percent rate most FOMC participants view as being consistent with a fully employed labor force over the longer run.\nBoth public and private sector forecasts are projecting relatively moderate rates of growth over the next few years. For example, the midpoint of the FOMC participants’ forecast made in April was for growth to average a bit under 3 percent over the next three years—only modestly above the longer-run trend. And I’d have to say the incoming data since those forecasts were made have been on the soft side.\nWith such growth rates, we would close the large existing resource gaps only gradually. Indeed, I expect that we will face unemployment well above sustainable levels for some time to come.\nWith regard to inflation, as you know, the FOMC’s long-run inflation objective is 2 percent as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE). For a number of reasons, I don’t foresee much risk that inflation will rise above reasonable tolerance levels for this objective. First, the ten-year Treasury rate is below 1-1/2 percent! And its decomposition into a long-run real rate and an inflation expectation is flashing something very different than dangerous inflationary pressures. I’ll have more on this later. Second, energy and commodity prices have fallen well off their recent peaks as the global outlook dims. Third, as I just noted, the output gap remains large and is likely to close only slowly. In this economic environment, wage pressures are anemic. And it is simply hard to see how any persistent outsized inflation pressures could occur without some parallel building of wage costs. That was the case in the 1970s inflation, a scenario some fear repeating today. Fourth, inflationary dynamics depend in large part on the momentum generated by people’s expectations of future inflation. Currently, inflation expectations are well anchored, and so they impart little pull on inflation one way or the other. Putting all of this together (and given that inflation has stood at 1.8. percent over the past year), I conclude that inflation will likely remain near or below our 2 percent target over the medium term.\n\nIII. Policy Choices\nSince the summer of 2010, I have consistently argued for the strongest policy accommodation available. With huge resource gaps, slow growth and low inflation, the economic circumstances warrant extremely strong accommodation. Many of my views were well captured in the macro-model analyses discussed here last April by Janet Yellen (2012).\nIf you recall, Governor Yellen compared two approaches to evaluating the stance of monetary policy to a baseline constructed from the midpoint of FOMC participants’ forecasts made in January. The first was an optimal control policy, which prescribes the interest rate path that, in a well-specified econometric model for the U.S. economy, minimizes the deviations in inflation and unemployment from their policy goals. The optimal monetary policy in that analysis kept the federal funds rate near zero into early 2015—a year later than in the baseline—in order to keep the cost of capital extremely low.\nOf course, economic models, at best, are only approximations to real-world behavior. So it’s also prudent to look at policy prescriptions other than the optimal control policy. The most familiar of these are interest rate rules, like the Taylor rule (1993). These interest rate policy prescriptions are relatively simple empirical descriptions of the Fed’s historical reactions to misses from its policy goals. If we apply the 1999 version of John Taylor’s rule, we see the funds rate rising in early 2015. But even this delayed interest rate liftoff relative to the 1993 Taylor rule does not take additional account of the prolonged period that policy rates have been constrained to be higher than where they could have been because of the zero lower bound on the federal funds rate. Taking account of this additional condition would delay the Taylor Rule's lift-off towards the optimal control policy.1 \nFurthermore, neither exercise considers the asymmetric downside balance of risks to the forecast coming from Europe and the U.S. fiscal cliff. Considering all of these factors, I conclude that both policy prescriptions support the need for a high degree of monetary accommodation.\nThese two conclusions highlighted in Governor Yellen’s speech are not much different from the policy recommendation that I have been consistently advocating. Specifically, additional monetary accommodation is needed to more quickly elevate output to its full potential level. In fact, even under the optimal control exercise, the unemployment rate does not reach 5-1/2 percent until mid-2016; that’s pretty late, but because of the lower funds rate path in the optimal control policy, it is still at least two years earlier than in the baseline scenario.\nFurthermore, even with such additional accommodation, the outlook for inflation remains well contained: The highest that inflation rises in any simulation is 2.3 percent—only 0.3 percentage points above the highest rate in the baseline. This is within any reasonable tolerance band around our 2 percent long-run objective for inflation, especially given that the unemployment rate currently is 2 to 3 percentage points above its sustainable rate.\nIn weighing alternative policy approaches, I do recognize the risk that these economic model analyses could be wrong. Accordingly, I have proposed that any further accommodative policies should contain a safeguard against an unreasonable increase in inflation. In my judgment, nominal income level targeting is an appropriate policy choice and has such a safeguard. But recognizing the difficult nature of that policy approach, I have a more modest proposal: I support a conditional approach, whereby the federal funds rate is not increased until the unemployment rate falls below 7 percent, at least, or if inflation rises above 3 percent over the medium-term. The economic conditionality in my 7/3 threshold policy would clarify our forward policy intentions greatly and provide a more meaningful guide on how long the federal funds rate will remain low. In addition, I would indicate that steady progress toward stronger growth is essential, and I would be willing to buy mortgage-backed securities to do so.\nFinding a way to deliver more accommodation—whether it is monetary or fiscal—is particularly important now because delays in reducing unemployment are costly. An unusually large percentage of the unemployed have been without work for quite an extended period of time; their skills can become less current or even deteriorate, leaving affected workers whose productivity has eroded with permanent scars on their lifetime earnings. And any resulting lower aggregate productivity also weighs on potential output, wages and profits for the economy as a whole. The damage intensifies the longer that unemployment remains high. Failure to act aggressively now will lower the capacity of the economy for many years to come.\n\nIV. Recurring Themes\nAt this point, I would like to briefly touch on several recurring questions and themes that come up whenever I discuss my views on the economy and monetary policy.\nA. Symmetric inflation target and balanced policy\nLet’s start with policy. I can’t tell you how often people look at me in abject horror when I say that we should adopt a conditional policy that tolerates the risk of inflation exceeding our target by as much as 1 percentage point. How can I accept inflation rising above our stated target? Isn’t this blasphemy for a central banker?\nAs you know, in January we announced a specific number—2 percent—for our inflation objective. At the same time, we also said that policy would take a balanced approach in achieving the two legs of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate—maximum employment and price stability. I strongly support these announcements. But questions still remain about the specifics of how policy will be implemented under this framework.\nAs Chairman Bernanke (2012) stated at his last press conference, the 2 percent inflation goal is a symmetric objective and not a ceiling on inflation. Symmetry means that inflation below 2 percent should be viewed as the same policy miss as if inflation overran 2 percent by equal amount. However, if we disproportionately recoil at inflation a little above 2 percent versus a little below, then we are not symmetrically weighing policy misses. And there is some risk of this misperception taking hold, since in the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), several participants’ forecasts have the funds rate rising before 2014, even though throughout the projection period inflation is at or below 2 percent and unemployment is well above the sustainable rate indicated by the long-run projections.\nTo me, a symmetric inflation goal and a balanced approach to policy means that if we are missing by a large mark on our employment mandate, but are close to our inflation target, then we should be willing to undertake policies that could substantially reduce the employment gap but run the risk of a modest, transitory rise in inflation that remains within a reasonable tolerance range. The 7/3 threshold policy I have been advocating is such a plan under which I expect the sum of the resulting two misses would be less than the one miss under a less accommodative policy.\nI believe the FOMC can do better at describing our thinking with respect to tolerance bands around our long-run inflation and unemployment goals. Clarification would increase both transparency and accountability. Importantly, it would help markets better anticipate Fed actions, creating one less source of risk for economic agents to manage.\nB. Inflation\nNow let’s turn to the measurement of inflation. As I mentioned earlier, over the past year consumer price inflation, as measured by the PCE index for total consumption expenditures, has been 1.8 percent. Nevertheless, many, many people express disbelief over these small reported numbers: Surely inflation is much higher! For example, I recall Chairman Bernanke being quizzed by Congressman Ron Paul not too long ago. Ron Paul said something like, Mr. Chairman, you say that inflation is about 2 percent, and I say that it is about 9 percent—OK, let’s split the difference and say that inflation is 5 percent!\nThe sentiments expressed by this exchange resonate with many people.\nSome prices have gone up by quite a lot: Gas prices are high, food prices have increased and deals are hard to find. But the official data say that when you add up all the numbers, weighted by the appropriate expenditure shares, the total PCE inflation was 1.8 percent over the past year.\nI could go on at length on these issues. But the brief points I wish to make are these:\nWe use the term “inflation” to refer to the effects of monetary phenomena; this means inflation is a broad-based and sustained growth in prices.\nAn increase in the relative price of a single good, like oil, against all other prices is then not monetary inflation.\nBehavioral finance shows that retail investors prefer to avoid the pain of losses even more than they enjoy the satisfaction of similarly sized investment gains. Likewise, consumers wish to avoid the recurring ache of higher gas and food prices. Prices of many goods and services have declined—like those for televisions, computers and entertainment options in general—but the satisfaction that consumers feel from these infrequent purchases isn’t enough to offset the losses they perceive in their daily shopping.\nAlthough you might have concerns about a variety of government entities, the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis are among the best statistical organizations around. They are responsible for collecting and publishing high-quality inflation data.\nAnd when researchers do come up with quibbles, they are not on the order of percentage points, and more often, they are in terms of overstating, not understating, inflation.\nC. Nominal long-term Treasury rates\nAt this point in the evening, experience tells me that many folks who were initially skeptical that inflation pressures are low are still skeptical. And after all, there’s another important elephant in the room, right? The Fed’s balance sheet has ballooned from a mere $800 billion in August 2007 to almost $3 trillion today: With an explosion in the monetary base like this, inflation must be just around the corner, right? Despite the fact that this prediction has been around since mid-2009 and three years later it has not come close to fruition, it’s still early days, right?\nThe argument that inflation is imminent faces an enormous uphill battle these days, and a single number captures this concern very well: 1.45 percent. The ten-year Treasury rate was 1.45 percent as of June 1. This is unprecedented in the post-World War II economy, and it is wildly inconsistent with rising inflation over the timeframe that monetary policy is concerned with, such as the next ten years.\nWhat do such low rates signify? To start, the nominal short-term interest rate is the sum of the real interest rate plus expected inflation. In turn, long-term interest rates are the average of expected future short-term rates plus a term premium, or risk premium. There are a variety of ways to estimate this decomposition; and they all indicate that today all three pieces—expected real rates, expected inflation and the risk premia—appear to be quite low.\nWhat do these estimates imply? First, real interest rates reflect the expected return to saving and investing today in order to obtain more real goods and services tomorrow. Low long-term real rates imply that agents are expecting such returns to be low for a long time—which is consistent with them expecting economic activity to be relatively weak over the coming years. Next, low expected inflation means that market participants are building in little chance of a breakout in inflation. Indeed, if markets were expecting very high inflation, say, 5 percent, then real rates would be on the order of negative 2 or negative 3 percent, implausibly low unless you expected an extraordinary economic meltdown. And if you believed this, you also would probably not think that Treasury securities were a safe bet, and their risk premia would be quite high. These Treasury premia, however, are quite low, reflecting a high demand for safe assets. Economic agents are cautious, and there is little appetite for risk-taking at the moment.\nWhat does this add up to? Well, low long-term Treasury rates support the view that markets are looking for only modest economic growth with low inflation, and a there is a high degree of caution out there—which itself is an important factor holding back economic activity today.\nD. Not punishing savers\nNext, let me try to address one of the toughest questions I am asked about our stance of monetary policy. Current interest rates are very, very low. Many have expressed concern that the Federal Reserve’s low interest rate policy is bad for the economy because it punishes savers. This is an old story with respect to monetary policy when rates are low. My uncle first expressed this view to me in 1992, frustrated that the federal funds rate had been slashed to 3 percent.\nThe argument goes as follows: Low interest rates reduce the return to savers, and they punish individuals who have played by the rules and worked hard to be fiscally prudent. Clearly, policies like this disadvantage the savers. In order to meet their saving goals in such a low interest rate environment, some claim that these households will consume less and save even more, and that this reduced consumption in turn will lower real gross domestic product (GDP).\nI am certainly not going to try to dispute this obvious fact: savers are earning dramatically reduced interest income on their accumulated savings. Unfortunately, throughout the U.S. economy, there is a tremendous amount of pain and hardship. The job of monetary policy, according to the Federal Reserve Act, is to provide monetary and financial conditions to support maximum employment and stable prices. Monetary policy aims to set short-term rates so that the supply of saving equals the demand for investment in a way that facilitates the economy reaching maximum employment and price stability.\nCurrently, the forces of supply and demand require very low rates. The supply of saving is high as households delever and repair their balance sheets. Furthermore, the demand for investment is low because most firms have much unused capacity and are unsure of the economic path forward. Therefore, equilibrium real rates are quite low. Indeed, today they are lower than actual rates because nominal short-term rates are constrained by the zero lower bound and can go no lower. Economists refer to this as a liquidity trap because interest rates can’t fall low enough to reemploy the economy’s unused productive resources. And the mainstream remedy to this dilemma, as articulated clearly in the academic work by Krugman (1998), Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), Werning (2011) and others, is highly accommodative monetary policy.\nBut if I were bound and determined to address the concerns that savers are being disadvantaged by low interest rates, there are three prescriptions that I could imagine undertaking. And let me tell you, two of them are bad.\nFirst, the FOMC could immediately undertake a program to raise short-term interest rates. In other words, monetary policy could exogenously turn more restrictive. Would this help savers and the economy? In my judgment, that would be a very bad policy. More restrictive credit would further reduce investment and job creation and limit the supply of credit to small business entrepreneurs, resulting in growth even slower than it is now. Savers would not be left with higher returns. And savers’ other sources of income would be reduced, like employment and entrepreneurial income. I have few doubts that policy would need to quickly retrace such a misguided increase.\nAlternatively, the FOMC could decide to undertake expansionary policies to the point of “recklessness” by pursuing an extremely high rate of inflation. Persistently higher rates of inflation—outside of reasonable tolerance bands around our long-run inflation objective—would indeed lead to higher interest rates for all. Savers would receive higher nominal interest income; but as Chairman Bernanke said recently, the FOMC would clearly view this as reckless and would not choose to pursue such a policy. Again, this is a case where higher nominal interest rates would be bad for savers and the entire public.\nBut third, if the FOMC and other policymakers could engineer stronger growth policies so that the economy boomed again and unemployment fell, this would organically lead to higher real rates of return on investment and higher interest rates in general, which would benefit savers and the entire public. A more vibrant economy would benefit owners of unused resources, like unused factory capacity and unemployed workers. This is the policy path that is most desirable in my opinion. I also think it is most consistent with the accommodative policies I have been advocating.\n\nV. Conclusion\nTo explore the effects of forward guidance in the current policy environment, we make forecasts with the Chicago Fed’s New Keynesian DSGE model. This is an adaptation of a model created by Justiniano and two co-authors and, as such, is essentially an off-the-shelf model. In the model, business cycles are primarily demand determined. The length of the delayed recovery in the model is importantly influenced by “deleveraging behavior.” To have a chance at capturing the improvements due to monetary accommodation so far, we introduce Odyssean forward guidance shocks into the model’s interest rate policy rule and impose a parsimonious factor structure. To capture the current “late 2014” language, we extend the horizon for forward guidance from four to ten quarters.\n\nNote\n1 Reifschneider and Williams (2000) show how taking account of the zero lower bound would delay liftoff in the Taylor 1993 rule; they did not investigate the Taylor 1999 rule, but the logic of their analysis would hold for the 1999 rule as well.\n\nReferences\nBernanke, Ben S., 2012, press conference, Board of the Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC, transcript, April 25.\nEggertsson, Gauti B., and Michael Woodford, 2003, \"The zero bound on interest rates and optimal monetary policy,\" Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Vol. 34, No. 1, pp. 139–211.\nKrugman, Paul R., 1998, \"It’s baaack: Japan’s slump and the return of the liquidity trap,\" Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Vol. 29, No. 2, pp. 137–206.\nReifschneider, David L. and John C.

            "content": "Introduction\nThe setting for this paper is the current monetary policy environment. The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability. At 8.3 percent, the unemployment rate is substantially above reasonable measures of the natural rate; the output gap is probably 5 to 6 percent; and underlying inflation measures are projected to be below our 2 percent objective for a number of years.\nClearly, more accommodation would be appropriate. For example, Chung, Laforte, Reifschneider and Williams (2011)1 use the FRB/U.S. model (a macroeconometric model developed and maintained at the Federal Reserve Board) to show how optimal monetary policy that is unconstrained by the zero lower bound (ZLB) would call for substantially more accommodation than anything we have tried to date. Today, however, we can only use non-standard tools. Recently, the Federal Reserve has employed new language and tools to communicate the likely nature of future monetary policy accommodation. The most prominent developments have manifested themselves in the formal statement that follows each meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). In January we said, the FOMC “currently anticipates that economic conditions … are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.”\nIt seems safe to say that it is not a first-best policy tool to use calendar-dates alone for forward guidance. After all, is “late 2014” a promise to keep the funds rate at the ZLB beyond the time that policy would normally begin raising the federal funds rate? That would be moving in the direction of the optimal policy of Eggertsson-Woodford2 and Werning.3 Alternatively, is “late 2014” simply a policy expectation based on forecasts of low inflation and high unemployment? Jeff Campbell, Jonas Fisher, Alejandro Justiniano and I use economic theory and empirical methods to disentangle these two views and examine the potential roles of forward guidance in the current policy environment.4 Specifically, our paper looks at simple regression analyses to argue that forward guidance has been an effective tool of monetary policy during the crisis. Then, we use our Chicago dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model to analyze macroeconomic forecasts under different policies. In an attempt to better clarify calendar-date forward guidance, we will compare our model simulation results against what we refer to as \"bright-line economic thresholds.\" I have argued in many speeches that more policy accommodation can be delivered in a risk-controlled fashion if the federal funds rate remains exceptionally low as long as the unemployment rate is above 7 percent or medium-term inflation stays below 3 percent. This is an example I refer to as a bright-line 7/3 threshold rule.\n\nTaxonomy of Forward Guidance\nJust to be clear regarding “late 2014,” the key questions are: Is the Committee offering a forecast of economic activity and indicating it will follow its usual behavior in that environment? Or is the FOMC instead committing itself to a particular course of action different from its usual approach? To make progress in answering these questions, we need to impose more discipline on the analysis.\nThroughout, we assume there is an interest rate reaction function that describes the typical FOMC response to economic conditions and projections. In addition, there are deviations from this response. We use this to distinguish between two classes of forward guidance. In John Taylor’s seminal 1993 article,5 he provides a lengthy discussion of both of these types of policy actions.\nOdyssean forward guidance originates in the term labeled deviations from interest rate rule. Odyssean forward guidance publicly commits the FOMC to future deviations from its underlying policy rule, and this guidance changes private expectations. Eggertsson-Woodford and Werning have shown that optimal monetary policy at the ZLB requires a commitment to keep rates lower than they otherwise would be after the economy begins its recovery. These actions are deviations from a more normal rule. We label these policies Odyssean forward guidance for the following reason: As the economy accelerates and inflation rises, circumstances will tempt any conservative central banker to renege on these promises. This is precisely because the normal policy rule describes its truly preferred behavior. Hence, this forward guidance resembles Odysseus commanding his sailors to tie him to the ship’s mast so that he won’t be tempted by the Sirens’ musical calls for an early exit.\nDelphic forward guidance focuses on descriptions of the normal monetary policy response function. Delphic forward guidance encompasses statements that describe only the economic outlook and the typical monetary policy stance. Such forward guidance about the economic outlook influences expectations of future policy rates only by changing market participants’ views about the likely outcomes of variables that enter the FOMC’s policy rule. The introduction of the “considerable period” language in 2003 exemplifies Delphic forward guidance, if the FOMC was most likely motivated by its (ultimately correct) forecast of lower-than-usual inflation coming out of a recession.\nWith these definitions firmly in mind, we first examine the FOMC’s use of forward guidance in the past. The punchline is: The FOMC has used forward guidance in the past; and this builds confidence for our macro-policy simulations that use Odyssean forward guidance.\n\nFOMC Experience with Forward Guidance\nThe FOMC has used forward guidance since mid-1999, when the statement first included explicit forward-looking language. There is a literature showing that forward guidance had significant effects on asset prices before the crisis, particularly on Treasury yields. Work since the crisis has focused on large-scale asset purchase announcements. Our analysis here uses the Gurkaynak-Sack-Swanson6 (GSS) event-study methodology applied to the post-crisis period. We find that forward guidance has had similar effects during the crisis period. We interpret this as saying that “markets listen” to the FOMC, and thereby forward guidance influences interest rates relevant for household and firm decisions.\n\nDo Markets Hear the Oracle of Delphi or Odysseus?\nSince optimal monetary policies like Eggertsson-Woodford and Werning have a strong Odyssean forward-guidance component, we are particularly interested in documenting their history and effects. However, the GSS/event-study methodology alone does not separate Odyssean from Delphic forward guidance. To do so, we need to place more structure on the previously noted deviations from interest rate rule. We model Odyssean forward guidance with a sequence of shocks, which we label “nu,” (ν). Here, the public learns νt-j,t in quarter t–j, but it gets applied to the interest rate rule in quarter t. We estimate these shocks using: 1) the interest rate rule, 2) expectations of future fed funds rates from markets and 3) expectations of economic conditions from the Blue Chip consensus forecasts. We assume forward guidance goes out four quarters from the present.7\nFigure 1 plots the residual for the interest rate rule versus its forward guidance component. It is mostly future forward guidance, not just the contemporaneous shock. Our results show that the public anticipates about 80 percent of deviations from the interest rate rule at least one quarter in advance. Forty percent of the deviations are anticipated two to four quarters in advance. Apparently, the FOMC and the public together have experience with Odyssean forward guidance. We find significant effects of forward guidance on Treasuries. Also, corporate bond rates respond in the direction suggested by theory.\nNow that we have established statistical examples of Odyssean forward guidance, we move to analyzing a strong commitment to future accommodation within the context of an empirically viable dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model of the U.S. economy.\n\nForecasts from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago New Keynesian DSGE Model\nTo explore the effects of forward guidance in the current policy environment, we make forecasts with the Chicago Fed’s New Keynesian DSGE model. This is an adaptation of a model created by Justiniano and two co-authors and, as such, is essentially an off-the-shelf model. In the model, business cycles are primarily demand determined. The length of the delayed recovery in the model is importantly influenced by “deleveraging behavior.” To have a chance at capturing the improvements due to monetary accommodation so far, we introduce Odyssean forward guidance shocks into the model’s interest rate policy rule and impose a parsimonious factor structure. To capture the current “late 2014” language, we extend the horizon for forward guidance from four to ten quarters.\n\nForecast for Baseline Scenario\nAs in prior work, the ZLB binds from the onset of the crisis because households are unusually patient. Households have a larger than usual incentive to accumulate savings, so we think of this as a proxy for the deleveraging that has been going on since the crisis. In the analysis, the rate of impatience slowly returns to its steady state level (half life of 3.4 years). We set Odyssean forward guidance in the model to match the expected federal funds rates from futures markets through mid-2014. So policy roughly conforms to the “late 2014” language. As you can see, forecasted real gross domestic product growth exceeds 3 percent for 2012, and (quarterly) core inflation (based on personal consumer expenditures) starts well below 1 percent but rises to 1.5 percent by the end of 2014. Hours worked start well below their average level and make only modest progress toward recovery.\n\nInflation and Unemployment in the Baseline Forecast\nIn figure 2, we have translated our baseline forecast into the unemployment-inflation space. The green bar represents our policy objectives: 2 percent inflation and a 5.25 to 6 percent range for the natural rate of unemployment (from January Summary of Economic Projections).The blue dot is data from 2011:Q4. The forecast follows in sequence from that point. Grey dots indicate the period of a near zero federal funds rate and red dots indicate forecast dates where the federal funds rate has risen above the zero lower bound. The dashed red lines are the bright-line 7 percent unemployment/3 percent inflation thresholds.\nBy the end of 2014, core inflation is closer to our explicit objective. However, the endpoint for unemployment seems high relative to any rate that would be consistent with the FOMC’s mandated goal of maximum sustainable employment.\nCompared with this baseline scenario, extending the time the FOMC keeps the federal funds rate at zero would bring policy closer to the optimum identified by Eggertsson-Woodford and Werning. However, it is well known that central bankers are genetically disinclined to push the limit of monetary accommodation very far in this direction. Although calendar-date communications may have an Odyssean component, most market analyses seem to interpret the dates as Delphic communications. What would another conditioning set look like?\nFinding acceptable bright-line economic thresholds might better impart a larger commitment to accommodation. The 7/3 threshold rule I have advocated is an alternative “second-best” policy that conditions on economic outcomes. Notice that in our baseline forward-guidance scenario, our forecast does not breach either the 7 percent unemployment threshold or the 3 percent inflation threshold. In this case, the funds rate could remain low for a longer period, according to the threshold rule. There are important details to work through with this analysis, but this chart is encouraging. It has the feel of a frugal person’s nominal income targeting strategy.\nHaving suggested that 7/3 rules can provide additional Odyssean forward guidance, I want to mention that bright-line economic thresholds also offer a risk-management approach to guarding against unforeseen adverse circumstances. How can we use this analysis to shed light on alternative specifications that impart more inflation risk?\n\nRisk Assessment\nNow we consider two alternatives that give rise to greater inflation concerns. In each case, monetary policy remains Odyssean and conforms to the “late 2014” language. In one scenario, we lower the half-life of the natural rate of interest from about 3.5 years to about one half year. We interpret this scenario as capturing a shorter deleveraging period. The second scenario embodies an unanticipated rise in long-run inflation expectations. We do not impose the bright-line 7/3 threshold policy in either scenario. Rather, we simply monitor the boundaries to examine whether such conditional 7/3 forward guidance would call for a liftoff from the ZLB sooner than currently anticipated.\n\nShorter Deleveraging or Higher Expected Inflation\nBoth risks are “upside” risks, in the sense that the economy expands and inflation rises. “Shorter deleveraging” delivers the boom-expansion and acceleration of inflation that is evident in Eggertsson-Woodford and Werning’s optimal policy with overshooting.\n\nInflation and Unemployment in the Alternative Scenarios\nUnder faster deleveraging, unemployment falls faster and inflation rises by more. In that scenario, the economy crosses the 7 percent unemployment threshold in 2012:Q3, and reaches the 3 percent inflation threshold in late 2013. Therefore, adherence to the 7/3 threshold policy dictates liftoff from the ZLB in late 2012. Given the improvement in the economy and labor markets, an earlier exit seems palatable. Even without the 7/3 exit, the endpoint with 3 percent quarterly inflation and below 6 percent unemployment is a potentially better dual mandate outcome than today’s situation.\nWhen the 10-year average inflation expectation rises, the unemployment rate skirts the 7 percent threshold without hitting it. The inflation rate remains well below the 3 percent inflation threshold through the end of 2014. While the 7/3 threshold policy would dictate keeping rates at the ZLB, the turn in direction of unemployment is quite worrisome. Monitoring long-run inflation expectations for evidence of substantial deterioration remains an important safeguard against unforeseen adverse developments.\n\nNotes\n1 Krugman (1998).\n2 See, for example, Bernanke, Reinhart and Sack (2004) and Eggertsson and Woodford (2003).\n3 See FOMC (2005).\n4 Taylor (1979), Svensson (1997) and Woodford (2003).\n5 Note a weight of 1 on the unemployment rate is equivalent to a weight of about ¼ on the output gap. Of course, policymakers could debate the relative weights to put on inflation and the real-side goal variable in their loss function.\n6 Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), Werning (2011) and Krugman (1998).\n7 Note that if inflation had fallen to 1 percent (below our 2 percent objective) while unemployment improved to 7 percent, it would be against both our employment and price stability objectives to tighten at that point.\n\nReferences\nCampbell, Jeffrey R., Charles L.

It is mostly future forward guidance, not just the contemporaneous shock. Our results show that the public anticipates about 80 percent of deviations from the interest rate rule at least one quarter in advance. Forty percent of the deviations are anticipated two to four quarters in advance. Apparently, the FOMC and the public together have experience with Odyssean forward guidance. We find significant effects of forward guidance on Treasuries. Also, corporate bond rates respond in the direction suggested by theory.\n  Now that we have established statistical examples of Odyssean forward guidance, we move to analyzing a strong commitment to future accommodation within the context of an empirically viable dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model of the U.S. economy.\n\nForecasts from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago New Keynesian DSGE Model\nTo explore the effects of forward guidance in the current policy environment, we make forecasts with the Chicago Fed’s New Keynesian DSGE model. This is an adaptation of a model created by Justiniano and two co-authors and, as such, is essentially an off-the-shelf model. In the model, business cycles are primarily demand determined. The length of the delayed recovery in the model is importantly influenced by “deleveraging behavior.” To have a chance at capturing the improvements due to monetary accommodation so far, we introduce Odyssean forward guidance shocks into the model’s interest rate policy rule and impose a parsimonious factor structure. To capture the current “late 2014” language, we extend the horizon for forward guidance from four to ten quarters.\n\nForecast for Baseline Scenario\nAs in prior work, the ZLB binds from the onset of the crisis because households are unusually patient. Households have a larger than usual incentive to accumulate savings, so we think of this as a proxy for the deleveraging that has been going on since the crisis. In the analysis, the rate of impatience slowly returns to its steady state level (half life of 3.4 years). We set Odyssean forward guidance in the model to match the expected federal funds rates from futures markets through mid-2014. So policy roughly conforms to the “late 2014” language. As you can see, forecasted real gross domestic product growth exceeds 3 percent for 2012, and (quarterly) core inflation (based on personal consumer expenditures) starts well below 1 percent but rises to 1.5 percent by the end of 2014. Hours worked start well below their average level and make only modest progress toward recovery.\n\nInflation and Unemployment in the Baseline Forecast\nIn figure 2, we have translated our baseline forecast into the unemployment-inflation space. The green bar represents our policy objectives: 2 percent inflation and a 5.25 to 6 percent range for the natural rate of unemployment (from January Summary of Economic Projections).The blue dot is data from 2011:Q4. The forecast follows in sequence from that point. Grey dots indicate the period of a near zero federal funds rate and red dots indicate forecast dates where the federal funds rate has risen above the zero lower bound. The dashed red lines are the bright-line 7 percent unemployment/3 percent inflation thresholds.\n  By the end of 2014, core inflation is closer to our explicit objective. However, the endpoint for unemployment seems high relative to any rate that would be consistent with the FOMC’s mandated goal of maximum sustainable employment.\n  Compared with this baseline scenario, extending the time the FOMC keeps the federal funds rate at zero would bring policy closer to the optimum identified by Eggertsson-Woodford and Werning. However, it is well known that central bankers are genetically disinclined to push the limit of monetary accommodation very far in this direction. Although calendar-date communications may have an Odyssean component, most market analyses seem to interpret the dates as Delphic communications. What would another conditioning set look like?\n  Finding acceptable bright-line economic thresholds might better impart a larger commitment to accommodation. The 7/3 threshold rule I have advocated is an alternative “second-best” policy that conditions on economic outcomes. Notice that in our baseline forward-guidance scenario, our forecast does not breach either the 7 percent unemployment threshold or the 3 percent inflation threshold. In this case, the funds rate could remain low for a longer period, according to the threshold rule. There are important details to work through with this analysis, but this chart is encouraging. It has the feel of a frugal person’s nominal income targeting strategy.\n  Having suggested that 7/3 rules can provide additional Odyssean forward guidance, I want to mention that bright-line economic thresholds also offer a risk-management approach to guarding against unforeseen adverse circumstances. How can we use this analysis to shed light on alternative specifications that impart more inflation risk?\n\nRisk Assessment\nNow we consider two alternatives that give rise to greater inflation concerns. In each case, monetary policy remains Odyssean and conforms to the “late 2014” language. In one scenario, we lower the half-life of the natural rate of interest from about 3.5 years to about one half year. We interpret this scenario as capturing a shorter deleveraging period. The second scenario embodies an unanticipated rise in long-run inflation expectations. We do not impose the bright-line 7/3 threshold policy in either scenario. Rather, we simply monitor the boundaries to examine whether such conditional 7/3 forward guidance would call for a liftoff from the ZLB sooner than currently anticipated.\n\nShorter Deleveraging or Higher Expected Inflation\nBoth risks are “upside” risks, in the sense that the economy expands and inflation rises. “Shorter deleveraging” delivers the boom-expansion and acceleration of inflation that is evident in Eggertsson-Woodford and Werning’s optimal policy with overshooting.\n\nInflation and Unemployment in the Alternative Scenarios\nUnder faster deleveraging, unemployment falls faster and inflation rises by more. In that scenario, the economy crosses the 7 percent unemployment threshold in 2012:Q3, and reaches the 3 percent inflation threshold in late 2013. Therefore, adherence to the 7/3 threshold policy dictates liftoff from the ZLB in late 2012. Given the improvement in the economy and labor markets, an earlier exit seems palatable. Even without the 7/3 exit, the endpoint with 3 percent quarterly inflation and below 6 percent unemployment is a potentially better dual mandate outcome than today’s situation.\n  When the 10-year average inflation expectation rises, the unemployment rate skirts the 7 percent threshold without hitting it. The inflation rate remains well below the 3 percent inflation threshold through the end of 2014. While the 7/3 threshold policy would dictate keeping rates at the ZLB, the turn in direction of unemployment is quite worrisome. Monitoring long-run inflation expectations for evidence of substantial deterioration remains an important safeguard against unforeseen adverse developments.\n\n\n\nNotes\n[1] Krugman (1998).\n[2] See, for example, Bernanke, Reinhart and Sack (2004) and Eggertsson and Woodford (2003).\n[3] See FOMC (2005).\n[4] Taylor (1979), Svensson (1997) and Woodford (2003).\n[5] Note a weight of 1 on the unemployment rate is equivalent to a weight of about ¼ on the output gap.

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you, Chris, for that generous introduction. And thanks to Matt, Günter, Chris and Thomas for organizing such a great conference. I always enjoy being able to step back into the research world for a while—as things are going these days, it falls in the category of rest and relaxation! But another reason I enjoy doing so is that I, like most modern central bankers around the world, feel strongly about guiding policy with good theoretical and empirical economics. As you will see by my comments tonight, these linkages have been especially helpful in dealing with the difficult circumstances policymakers find themselves in today. Of course, these views will be my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\nI left graduate school in the late 1980s. U.S. monetary policy rates were around 9 percent. At the time, this restrictive stance was aimed at lowering inflation, which was running about 4 percent, though there was active public debate about how hard policy should press to bring inflation down. It never crossed my mind back then that one day I would be working on the problem of how to provide monetary accommodation in an economy with massive unemployment, very low inflation (perhaps even too low) and a policy rate stuck at the zero lower bound. With the exception of scholars of the Great Depression, back in the 1980s today’s policy challenges were not on anyone’s radar screen.\nOf course, that changed with the developments in Japan during the 1990s. More macroeconomists began thinking about liquidity traps and the monetary policy tools to help escape from them. These analyses gained momentum following Paul Krugman’s Brookings paper in 1998.1 They focused both on the use of the central bank’s balance sheet to provide accommodation and on communication about policy goals and forward guidance about the path for policy instruments. Much of this latter work was done within the New Keynesian paradigm, since communications are central to the policy transmission mechanism in those models.2 For obvious reasons, such research has come back into vogue today.\nThe nonstandard policies emphasized by these lines of research have been important elements in the Federal Reserve’s toolkit over the past four years. The Federal Reserve engaged in two waves of large-scale asset purchases (March 2009 and November 2010), and, more recently, extended the maturity of the assets on our books (September 2011). In August 2011, we added a particular type of forward guidance to our policy, first saying we would likely keep rates low until mid-2013 and then, in January, indicating that sub-par economic performance would likely warrant exceptionally low rates until at least late 2014. Working to complement these efforts and to improve FOMC communications more generally, we also added two major communications initiatives: A statement of our monetary goals and long-run strategies, and publication of FOMC participants’ projections for the federal funds rate.\nI have strongly supported each of these developments, believing that they improved transparency and also provided welcome further monetary accommodation for the U.S. economy. However, as I have been talking about in public for some time, I think there are additional tools we could use to deliver more effective policy accommodation. In particular, I would like to see our forward guidance take a different form—one that explicitly ties liftoff in the funds rate to observable economic outcomes (You can think of this as a Ulysses-type forward guidance: We tie ourselves to the mast to avoid the siren calls of premature tightening.) As I will talk about shortly, I believe such policy could provide more clarity about our attitudes toward providing monetary accommodation—and would be more in line with a structure I would have preferred to have seen in our August 2011 and January 2012 actions. This policy also can be structured in a way that would represent a balanced risk-management approach to achieving the dual goals of maximum employment and stable prices that the United States Congress has mandated to the Federal Reserve.\n\nCommunications Enhancements\nFirst, though, I’d like to discuss the Fed’s latest initiatives to enhance communications. As an accountable central bank in a democratic society, the Federal Reserve has an obligation to clearly articulate what it is trying to achieve with monetary policy. I believe that our latest communications efforts are an important step in further increasing such accountability to the public, as they reaffirm our commitment to both legs of the dual mandate and describe the ways in which we will seek to achieve those objectives.\n\nThe Framework Statement\nLet’s start with the framework statement of our policy goals and long-run strategy. The framework clarifies how the FOMC interprets our statutory responsibilities for facilitating maximum employment and price stability in terms of measurable and achievable economic goals that we aim for over the longer run. We say that the Committee sees a rate of inflation of 2 percent over the long run as being consistent with the price stability leg. There are two important ingredients: Our explicit inflation objective is 2 percent, and this is to be achieved over the long run. As recently as 2005, many FOMC participants preferred to describe a range of inflation outcomes as being consistent with our inflation mandate instead of stating it as a single number.3 Our current statement narrows our objective to 2 percent. It also sees this as an average that we aim to achieve over the long run, in recognition of the obvious realism that inflation may deviate from this goal from time to time owing to economic challenges, conflicts in achieving the dual mandate objectives and difficulties in the policy transmission channels.\nThe statement also notes that maximum employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors, which are difficult to measure and may change over time. Hence, we cannot and do not specify a fixed, time-invariant goal for it. But FOMC participants can provide their current assessments of goal variables related to the achievement of maximum employment. We do so using the central tendency of FOMC participants’ projections for the rate that unemployment would converge to in the absence of further shocks to the economy. As of January 2012, this rate is 5-1/4 to 6 percent.\nThe statement also indicates that policy will seek to mitigate deviations in inflation and unemployment from these longer-run goals, and addresses the weighting of relevant costs and benefits when trying to close these gaps. Namely, if the policy prescriptions for achieving the inflation and unemployment goals are in conflict, we will take a balanced approach promoting the return to each, taking into account the size of the deviations and the relative speeds at which convergence can be expected. As we all know in this audience, there is an enormous literature related to characterizing the monetary policy loss function for a central bank with a dual mandate—such as work by John Taylor, Lars Svensson and Michael Woodford.4 For me, our Federal Reserve dual mandate responsibilities are well captured by a quadratic loss function that equally weights squared deviations of inflation and unemployment from their period goal values. In the U.S. today, that would be 2 percent for inflation and 5-1/4 to 6 percent for unemployment given today’s structural challenges in the labor market.5\nJust about every major central bank around the world publishes something akin to such a framework statement. In one way, the Federal Reserve is different because, unlike other countries, we have a dual mandate, and so our framework explicitly addresses goals for both inflation and the real side of the economy. But just about every bank with a single price stability mandate also says that it will avoid undue disruptions to the real side of the economy when pursing its inflation goal. Indeed, some are quite clear about following a flexible inflation targeting strategy.\n\nPolicy Projections\nWhat about the policy projections? The forecasts for growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation that FOMC participants have been submitting since 1979 have always been conditioned on each participant’s views of the future path of policy most likely to foster outcomes consistent with our dual mandate responsibilities—what we refer to as the appropriate path for policy. As of last January, our quarterly Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) now include the projected paths for the federal funds rate and qualitative information about the balance sheet that make up these views.\nI believe this move significantly enhances policy accountability. For example, suppose inflation were running higher than we would like, and the economic projections in the SEP showed it coming down over the next couple of years. In the absence of policy projections, the public would not know whether the FOMC thought inflation would simply come down on its own or whether it thought that a monetary tightening would be required to reduce inflationary pressures. The inclusion of participants’ policy projections will help communicate such judgments.\nFurthermore, households and businesses will be able to make better informed decisions if they have a clearer notion of future policy rates; the potential for reduced uncertainty could also lower the risk premium embedded in longer-term interest rates. Now, clearly, our forecasts of what rates are going to be three years from now will often be wrong—and sometimes by a good deal. Some say this means our projections are worthless, or, even worse, will cause people to underweight interest rate risk in making economic decisions. I disagree. The accuracy of the early forecasts we write down is not so important as how the public can observe the forecasts change over time. As the economy is hit by shocks or the data come in contrary to expectations, we will change our forecasts for both the economic variables and the policy rate. As we do, households and businesses will be able to learn more about the monetary policy reaction function. And it is this knowledge that will help them make better informed decisions.\nAnother criticism we heard on the day the projections were published was that they seemed to be inconsistent with the FOMC policy statement released a couple of hours earlier. The statement indicated that the Committee thought economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014, but six of the 17 policy projections showed that the funds rate would be 1-1/2 percent or higher at the end of that year. Well, by the next day, the markets had figured it out; the projections are made by all FOMC participants, while the statement reflects the policy views agreed upon at the meeting by the voting members of the Committee. We all come into the meeting with our projections, but we then do have a real meeting: All of the participants exchange ideas and argue points of views, and then the voters on the Committee come to a consensus and make a collective policy decision. The information regarding the federal funds rate in the SEP does not substitute for this formal decision of the voting members of the FOMC.\nThat said, the diversity of views is a fact of life. Policymakers may well have differing judgments on the appropriate stance of monetary policy in the particular economic circumstances of the moment. These communications initiatives cannot eliminate these differences of opinion. But they further discipline the parameters of our discussions, clarify the judgments that underlie our policy decisions and enhance transparency and the public’s ability to evaluate current monetary policy with alternative approaches.\n\nForward Guidance and Policy Commitment in an Explicit State-Contingent Policy\nThe Macroeconomic Environment\nThe new policy tools can also complement the kinds of accommodative policies I have been advocating for some time. The U.S. is now more than two and a half years into its modest and uneven recovery from the Great Recession. Real gross domestic product growth has averaged just 2-1/2 percent. The unemployment rate is 8-1/4 percent—well above the rate anyone on the FOMC sees as being consistent with our longer-run goal; in my view, this is a substantially higher rate than one might attribute to supply-side factors, such as extended unemployment insurance and a heightened degree of mismatch in labor markets. Realistically, this is a 2-1/4 to 3 percentage point deviation from our current maximum employment objective. Because this occurred with nominal interest rates stuck at the zero lower bound since December 2008, I believe it’s hard to say that we are not in a liquidity trap. Recently, the U.S. data have been more encouraging, with the labor market improving and private demand showing a little more traction. Without a doubt, these are welcome developments. But even the more optimistic forecasts see output increasing only moderately above its potential growth rates; no one has an expectation for a surge in activity that would quickly close resource gaps.\nAt the same time, the outlook for inflation is subdued, with most FOMC participants’ forecasts for increases in total personal consumption expenditures prices averaging roughly between 1-1/2 and 2 percent over the next three years. Furthermore, private sector long-run inflation expectations are quite well anchored.\nAs we know from the work of Michael Woodford and Gauti Eggertsson, Ivan Werning, Paul Krugman6 and others, the optimal policy response to a liquidity trap may involve a commitment to keep policy rates quite low for a period of time after the real equilibrium rate has risen enough so that the zero lower bound is no longer binding. This is a strong form of forward guidance akin to Ulysses tying himself to the mast to avoid changing his mind upon hearing the siren’s seductive music. Of course, in the real world, we cannot observe the equilibrium real rate, and so we cannot directly implement such a policy. We can capture the spirit of these recommendations, however, by committing to keep policy rates exceptionally low until certain observable economic triggers are met that would be consistent with the economy being well past the liquidity trap.\nAt the same time, some worry that the output gap and overall resource slack is small. I don’t subscribe to this view. But what if it were true? What kind of new information might we learn that would change our views about the magnitude of resource slack? Well, in the 1970s, we learned the hard way that underestimating resource slack and running full out accommodative monetary policies will lead to unacceptably high inflation. So, in designing a policy to close resource gaps, I am going to take a careful look at the evolution of inflation and inflationary expectations to tell me if I am wrong about my assessment of the real-side shortfalls we need to fill.\n\nAn Explicit State-Contingent Policy\nLet me outline how this approach might work in practice. The Fed could sharpen its forward guidance by pledging to keep policy rates near zero until one of two events occurs. The first event would be if the unemployment rate moved below a 7 percent threshold. Reductions in the unemployment rate below this level would represent good progress toward the natural rate of unemployment; depending upon the state of inflation expectations, it might be time to lessen policy accommodation.7\nThe second event that would commit us to raise rates would be if inflation rises above a particular threshold that is clearly unacceptable. This trigger would be a safeguard against the possibility that our assessments of economic conditions and resource slack are wrong and the natural rate of unemployment is higher than 7 percent. If this were so, our experience from the 1970s suggests that a continuation of the low-rate policy would generate a further unexpected increase in inflation; by adjusting policy according to this trigger, the Fed would begin exiting from what would now evidently be excessive policy accommodation. We would not have the desired reductions in unemployment, but then again, there wouldn’t be anything that monetary policy could do about it.\nI would argue that this inflation-safeguard threshold needs to be well above our current 2 percent inflation objective. This is consistent with the theoretical work showing that extraction from a liquidity trap requires the central bank, if necessary, to allow inflation to run higher than its target over the medium term. My preferred inflation threshold is a forecast of 3 percent over the medium term. For a central bank like the Federal Reserve that has a statutory dual mandate, this seems like a risk that we should be willing to accept. We would suffer some net policy loss if the gains in employment did not occur. But we certainly have experienced inflation rates near 3 percent in the recent past and have weathered them well. Such an experience would not be anything close to the debilitating higher inflation rates we saw in the 1970s or 1980s. And 3 percent isn’t high enough to unhinge long-run inflation expectations. Indeed, I think our new framework commitment to a 2 percent long-run inflation goal would help anchor inflation expectations if we undertook this policy strategy.\nLet me also emphasize that under this policy proposal, inflation reaching 3 percent is only a risk—and not a certainty. Indeed, simulations of standard models suggest that inflation is likely to remain below 3 percent even under a policy of extended monetary accommodation.\n\nWhy I Prefer the State-Contingent Policy to Calendar-Date Guidance\nI voted for the mid-2013 guidance we put forward last August and supported the extension to late 2014 made in January because I felt these actions would provide a greater degree of accommodation than markets were pricing in at the time. But I think a 7/3 threshold policy would more clearly convey a commitment to the degree of accommodation I think we need. There has been much talk about the economic conditionality underlying our calendar-year guidance—the phrase in our FOMC statement that says the Committee “anticipates that economic conditions … are likely to warrant” that precedes the late 2014 forward-guidance date. But those conditions have not been spelled out. Suppose as we move through next year that our projections for 2014 have an unemployment rate above 7 percent and inflation close to 2 percent. Some might argue then that the economic conditionality in the statement has been met and we should begin to remove accommodation. To me, in the absence of some new compelling evidence about the natural rate of unemployment or an unhinging of inflation expectations, this would represent an unwarranted tightening of policy. (Indeed, the mere chance that this may occur may be diminishing the degree of accommodation in place today.) The economic thresholds I am proposing put a higher and more predictable standard on the removal of accommodation.\n\nConclusion\nI would like to conclude by noting that I have undoubtedly generated some discomfort in the room tonight by saying that even with the large degree of accommodation already in place, monetary policy can and should take additional steps to facilitate a more robust economic expansion.\nCentral bankers naturally worry about such statements. We think back to the 1970s, when our failure to appreciate the changing structure of the economy led to over-stimulative policy and eventually to stagflation. It’s in our DNA to have these concerns; and they remind us of the need to continually do our best to calibrate important markers such as the natural rate of unemployment, keep close tabs on inflation expectations and have our eyes open for early warning signs of financial instability.\nBut I believe a greater risk today is that we buy too quickly into thinking that the equilibrium rate of unemployment has jumped 2 or 3 percentage points or that long-run inflation expectations have become so fragile that they are on the verge of spiking well above 2 percent. I just don’t see the evidence out there supporting this view. But if we do buy into it, then we’ll end up following overly restrictive policies that could unnecessarily risk condemning the U.S. economy to a lost decade—or even more. And the costs of taking this route would be unacceptable.\n\nNotes\n1 Krugman (1998).\n2 See, for example, Bernanke, Reinhart and Sack (2004) and Eggertsson and Woodford (2003).\n3 See FOMC (2005).\n4 Taylor (1979), Svensson (1997) and Woodford (2003).\n5 Note a weight of 1 on the unemployment rate is equivalent to a weight of about ¼ on the output gap.

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you for that kind introduction. This seems to be the time of year when both businesses and individuals focus on planning for the year ahead, and I’m delighted to be here this morning to share my perspective on the current economy. In doing so, I will discuss my views on the progress of the recovery and on the likely course of monetary policy.\nThose of you who follow monetary policy developments may be aware that I was the lone dissenter at the last two Fed policy meetings. So it should come as no surprise when I say that the views that I am presenting today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or my other colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nLately, it has become extremely important for Federal Reserve policymakers to get out from behind our desks and into the communities we serve. Doing this gives me the opportunity to explain how I think about the economy, but it’s also important for me to learn from your questions and comments. I really do value the opportunity to interact with business people within our Fed District, which comprises most of the Midwest and stretches from Detroit to Des Moines and on down to Indianapolis. So it really is a pleasure for me to be here today, to have the chance to “get out” and yet still be close to home.\n\nDual Mandate\nThe Federal Reserve is charged by Congress with fostering economic conditions consistent with maximum employment and price stability. These two objectives are commonly referred to as our “dual mandate.”\nThe Fed is different from most other central banks in that it has an explicit dual mandate. Although many central banks are instructed to mitigate disturbances to the real economy, most have a mandate to achieve only one goal—maintaining price stability. Usually, this is not an important distinction, since monetary policies that promote price stability are generally consistent with those that support full employment.\nHowever, in the rare occasion when tension arises between these two goals, policy must be formulated with careful consideration of the relative performance of one objective against the other and of the risks to the outlooks for both policy goals.\nKeeping this in mind, I’ll turn now to a discussion of my outlook for the economy and then offer my views on how best to chart a course for monetary policy.\n\nReal Output Gap\nFour years ago the U.S. economy entered what developed into the deepest downturn since the Great Depression; indeed, many are now referring to 2008–09 as the “Great Recession.”\nDuring recoveries from severe recessions, we usually see solid job and output growth, with the improvements in one fostering gains in the other. We are not seeing this today. It is now two and a half years since the Great Recession ended and the recovery began.\nYet, despite both accommodative monetary policy and fiscal stimulus, the pace of improvement has been painstakingly slow. Real gross domestic product (GDP) is only just back to where it stood at its pre-recession peak. Employment growth is barely enough to keep pace with the natural growth in the labor force and the unemployment rate remains extraordinarily high.\nHowever, recent news about the performance of the economy has been more promising. Motor vehicle sales have returned to their upward trend following supply disruptions caused by last spring’s horrible Japanese tsunami. U.S. manufacturing is expanding—boosted by the recovery in the automotive sector, as well as growing worldwide demand for materials and equipment in the energy, mining and agricultural sectors.\nConsumer spending outside of autos appears to be rising at a moderate rate, and employment growth, although still tepid, is showing signs of improvement. Initial unemployment insurance claims are down and layoffs have fallen, contributing to a decline in the unemployment rate of 0.5 percent over the past quarter. So, the economy is looking somewhat better than it did a few months ago.\nBut this does not mean we are seeing a massive surge in economic activity. The data shows only modest improvement in growth to rates that are near or just somewhat above the economy’s longer-run potential.\nMoreover, the pace of economic activity needs to accelerate further to boost confidence. After all, we have seen our hopes for a more rapid improvement in the economy dashed several times in this recovery. For instance, early last year most forecasters thought that the recovery was gaining traction and that economic activity would increase at a solid—though not spectacular—pace through 2012.\nThen, as now, the labor market was beginning to show some long-awaited improvement, and households and businesses seemed to be making good progress in repairing their balance sheets following the huge losses in wealth sustained during the recession. Analysts thought that higher prices for energy and other commodities would weigh on output growth, as would the supply-chain disruptions from the disaster in Japan. But these factors were expected to be transitory, and most forecasters thought growth would improve significantly once these influences had passed.\nUnfortunately, this forecast proved to be too optimistic. Revised data indicate that annualized real GDP growth was only 1 percent in the first half of 2011 and improved only modestly to 2 percent in the third quarter. Consumer spending was particularly sluggish, weighed down by slow growth in employment, income, and household wealth, as well as some continued limits in access to credit.\nFurthermore, the weakness in GDP growth began before the bulk of the effects of higher energy prices hit the economy and before the disaster in Japan happened. This timing, along with the continued softness of most economic indicators into the early summer, indicates that the slowing in output growth was not all due to temporary factors.\nPeriodically, the FOMC publishes participants’ projections for several key economic variables. Our latest forecasts were made in early November. Our outlook then was for real GDP growth to be around 1.75 percent in 2011 and then rise to 2.75 percent in 2012.\nThough an improvement, this 2012 pace is not far above most analysts’ views of the potential rate of output growth for the economy. Thus, such growth rates are not strong enough to make much of a dent in the unemployment rate and other measures of resource slack. Indeed, the FOMC’s latest forecasts are for the unemployment rate to remain above 8.5 percent through 2012 and to fall only to about 8 percent in 2013.\nAs I just noted, the somewhat firmer tone of recent economic data suggest some welcome traction, but the data are not strong enough, or uniform enough, to assert that momentum for growth is building. The headwinds that we face are still substantial.\nMoreover, the problems in Europe now loom larger. Careful analysis suggests that the direct impact of slower European growth on U.S. net exports likely would be small. However, there is a risk that substantial financial disruptions in Europe could impinge on the cost and availability of credit in the U.S. or induce a new wave of cautious behavior by households and businesses. If that were to occur, then we could see a larger adverse impact on economic activity in the U.S.\nAfter I balance these factors, my outlook for real GDP growth remains largely unchanged from the November forecast, and my forecast for the unemployment rate is only slightly lower. However, I am concerned about the downside risks.\n\nInflation Outlook under 2 Percent\nWhat about inflation? Large increases in energy prices pushed headline inflation—as measured by the 12-month change in the total Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index—up from about 1.25 percent last fall to almost 3 percent this summer. One-time events that were well beyond the control of monetary policy—such as the Arab Spring—drove prices higher and took a bite out of households’ budgets. But they did not result in a permanent ratcheting up of inflation.\nPrices for energy and many other commodities have softened of late, and the earlier increases did not pass much into core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy components. Notably, recent numbers show core inflation is now lower than last summer. Keep in mind, this is a better predictor of future overall inflation than total inflation itself.\nAnd with the unemployment rate still high and capacity utilization low, resource slack will continue to exert downward pressure on prices. In addition, measures of longer-run inflation expectations are at the low end of the range they have been running since last November.\nPutting these factors together, I would argue that the outlook for inflation is likely to remain low for the foreseeable future. The November FOMC forecasts for core inflation in 2012 were concentrated near 1.8 percent, and the forecasts for total inflation in 2013 and 2014 were in the range of 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent. My own assessment is that inflation will be at the lower end of these ranges.\n\nFed Performance\nGiven the high unemployment rate and low job growth, I think it is clear that the Fed has fallen short in achieving its goal of maximum employment.\nAs for the price stability component of our dual mandate, the majority of FOMC participants—including me—judge that our objective is for overall inflation to average 2 percent over the medium term. With my own view that inflation is likely to run below this rate over the next few years, I believe we will miss on our inflation objective as well.\n\nWhat is the Right Course for Policy?\nThe traditional course of action when inflation is below target and real output is expected to be below potential is to run an accommodative monetary policy. I support such accommodation today. And I believe the degree of accommodation should be substantial.\nI believe that the disappointingly slow growth and continued high unemployment that we confront today reflects the fact that we are in what economists call a “liquidity trap.” Let me explain. In normal times, real interest rates—that is, nominal interest rates adjusted for expected inflation—rise and fall to bring desired savings into line with investment and to keep productive resources near full employment.\nThis market dynamic is thwarted in the case of a liquidity trap. That is, when desired savings increase a great deal, nominal interest rates may fall to zero and then can go no lower. Real interest rates become “trapped” and may not be able to become negative enough to equilibrate savings and investment. That is where we seem to be now—short-term, risk-free nominal interest rates are close to zero and actual real rates are modestly negative, but they are still not low enough to return economic activity to its potential.\nA liquidity trap presents a clear and present danger of a prolonged period of economic weakness—today that means a risk of repeating the experience of the U.S. in the 1930s or that of Japan over the past 20 years.\nBut we need not resign ourselves to such an outcome. Because of the dire implications of liquidity traps, economists have studied them over the years in rigorous analytical models.\nImportantly, variants of these models have successfully explained past business cycle developments in the U.S. These studies conclude that economic performance can be vastly improved by employing monetary policies that commit to keeping short-term rates low for a prolonged period.\n\nA Balanced Policy Approach\nAs I weigh the evidence, I believe we are in a liquidity trap and favor the prescription of continued accommodation. But I recognize that I could be wrong. Central bankers have incomplete information, and sometimes are confronted with very different views of the forces driving the economy. This is especially true in the difficult circumstances we currently face.\nInstead of a liquidity trap, some have posited that we are in an economic malaise that reflects “structural factors” (such as a job skills mismatch) and that the economy today is actually functioning close to a new, more dismal productive capacity. I have discussed this very pessimistic “structural impediments scenario” in other forums.1 If this scenario is true, then further monetary accommodation will only lead to rising inflation without much improvement in unemployment.\nThose subscribing to this view warn of repeating the mistakes of the 1970s. At that time, the Fed did not understand that the changing structure of the economy had caused the natural rate of unemployment to rise. Too much accommodation during that time only served to raise inflation and inflation expectations.\nAlthough I do not find this structural impediments scenario compelling, as a prudent policymaker, I must at least consider its possibility. Without a clearer picture of whether we are in the midst of structural change or a liquidity trap, I favor a monetary policy strategy that balances the two risks of dismally slow growth on the one hand and creeping inflation on the other.\nLet me outline how this balanced policy approach might work in practice. The Fed could sharpen its forward guidance by pledging to keep policy rates near zero until one of two events occurs.\nFirst, this policy would account for the liquidity trap risk by communicating that we intend to keep the federal funds rate at exceptionally low levels as long as the unemployment rate is above a 7 percent threshold.\nReductions in the unemployment rate below this level would represent meaningful progress toward the natural rate of unemployment and might be a reason to lessen policy accommodation. Second, this policy would account for the risk of higher inflation —that is, we would be committed to pulling back on accommodation if inflation rises above a particular threshold.\nI would argue that this policy’s inflation-safeguard threshold needs to be above our current 2 percent inflation objective. My preferred threshold is a forecast of 3 percent over the medium term. Now, calling for tolerance of inflation up to 3 percent may seem shocking coming from a conservative central banker.\nHowever, the most recent research shows that improved economic performance during a liquidity trap requires the central bank, if necessary, to allow inflation to run higher than its target over the medium term. Such policies can generate the above-trend growth necessary to reduce unemployment and return overall economic activity to its productive potential.\nLet me emphasize that under this policy proposal, core inflation reaching 3 percent is only a risk—and not a certainty.\nIndeed, simulations of standard models suggest that core inflation is likely to remain below 3 percent even under a policy of extended monetary accommodation. But the economy may behave differently than expected. Still, 3 percent inflation is a risk that we should be willing to accept.\nIf, contrary to most evidence, the natural rate of unemployment is higher than 7 percent, then under this policy inflation will rise more quickly and without any improvements to the real side of the economy. In such an adverse situation, the inflation safeguard triggers an exit from what would be evidently excessive policy accommodation. And it would do so before inflation expectations would be in much danger of becoming unhinged.\nWe would not have the desired reductions in unemployment, but then again, there wouldn’t be anything that monetary policy could do about it. We would suffer some policy loss in that a 3 percent inflation rate is above our 2 percent target. But we certainly have experienced inflation rates near 3 percent in the recent past and have weathered them well. And 3 percent won’t unhinge long-run inflation expectations.\nWe are not talking about anything close to the debilitating higher inflation rates we saw in the 1970s or 1980s. Most importantly, we would also know that we had made our best effort.\nBut let me be clear: There is a natural tendency for policymakers to pull back on accommodation too early before the real rate of interest has fallen to low enough levels. Such errors happened in 1937 when the Fed prematurely withdrew accommodation. This was documented in Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz’s 1971 book, A Monetary History of the United States. More recently, the Bank of Japan made the same mistake. Therefore, it is essential that the Fed clearly commit to a policy action that is measurable against our goals.\n\nPolicy Projections and a Monetary Policy Framework\nRegardless of whether such explicit forward guidance is adopted, the effectiveness of monetary policy can be enhanced by clear communication of the Fed’s ultimate goals and of the strategies that it will use to achieve those goals. The minutes from the December FOMC meeting, which were released last Tuesday, noted that the Committee discussed two initiatives to enhance our communications about monetary policy. First, we agreed to begin publishing participants’ projections for the appropriate path for the federal funds rate and qualitative information about their outlooks for the Fed’s balance sheet in our quarterly Summary of Economic Projections (or SEP). Second, we discussed formulating a consensus statement on the Committee’s longer-run goals and monetary policy strategies.\nUntil now, participants have provided forecasts for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation, but not the policy assumptions that underlie these projections. The forecasts were made under each participant’s unspecified views of appropriate policy, which is defined in true Fedspeak as: “the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s dual objectives of maximum sustainable employment and stable prices.”\nBeing more explicit about appropriate policy can clear up a lot of uncertainty. For example, suppose inflation were running higher than we would like, and the economic projections in the SEP showed it coming down over the next couple of years. In the absence of information on participants’ policy projections, the public would not know whether the FOMC thought inflation would simply come down on its own or whether it thought that a monetary tightening would be required to reduce inflationary pressures. Including policy projections will help clarify such judgments.\nIn my opinion, this is a substantial, first-order improvement in policy communications, and this greater clarity may have significant additional value for improving how the economy operates. Expectations of the future path for policy and the degree of uncertainty surrounding those expectations are key determinants of private borrowing rates and other asset prices. These play an important role in the spending and saving decisions of households and businesses. Households and businesses will be able to make better-informed decisions if they have a clearer notion of future policy rates; the potential for reduced uncertainty could also lower the risk premium embedded in longer-term interest rates.\nThe second new communications initiative—a more explicit consensus framework for monetary policy—is still a work-in-progress. Thus I can only talk about it in generalities and give you my personal views about what it should say and why it would be very helpful.\nIn my view, a framework statement should help clarify what the dual mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability mean in terms of measurable economic outcomes. It should also convey the extent to which monetary policy can be expected to deliver particular long-run outcomes. And it should better enable the public to form expectations about how policy will react to economic disturbances that move employment and inflation away from levels consistent with the dual mandate. As I noted earlier, our goals of maximum employment and price stability usually are not in conflict; but when they are, a more explicit framework can provide a better idea of how the Committee will weigh the relevant costs and benefits that enter this more difficult decision-making process.\nI have strongly supported the publication of our policy projections, and I strongly support the adoption of a more explicit consensus framework statement. In my opinion, my current policy views and prescriptions continue to be appropriate in light of these new communications vehicles. The threshold policy I discussed earlier advocates keeping the federal funds rate near zero until either the unemployment rate falls below 7 percent (at least) or until medium-term inflation breaches 3 percent. The FOMC’s adoption of an explicit policy framework can underscore the distinction between these policy thresholds vs. our longer-run objectives. In particular, we would convey that the longer-run sustainable rate of unemployment is substantially lower than the threshold of 7 percent, while the inflation threshold of 3 percent is higher than the longer-run inflation objective. Consequently, even if inflation runs somewhat above its goal for a while, the public would understand that we intend to bring inflation down to the goal over time, and hence longer-run inflation expectations would remain firmly anchored.\nThe communication of policy projections also works well in conjunction with the thresholds. By publishing projections for future short-term interest rates along with unemployment and inflation, the public can evaluate the Committee’s thinking about which combinations of unemployment and inflation will likely lead to a lift-off of policy rates. In comparing these projections against my thresholds, the public can evaluate how much more policy accommodation could potentially be allowed under my proposal.\nProviding these additional forecasts enhances transparency and the public’s ability to evaluate current monetary policy with alternative approaches. And a framework that explicitly clarifies the Committee’s commitment to both price-stability and achievable real-side mandate responsibilities will, I believe, often allow monetary policy to respond more strongly in the medium-term when adverse economic shocks impede growth and employment. Indeed, I think these additional communications vehicles can provide further clarification and increase the effectiveness of the types of additional accommodation that I have advocated in recent months, as well as earlier in 2010. Consequently, I am an enthusiastic supporter of these enhancements to Fed transparency.\nLet me conclude by saying that I do not see these enhanced communications vehicles as being inherently “hawkish” or “dovish.” Participants may well have differing views on the appropriate stance of monetary policy in the particular economic circumstances of the moment. In being more explicit about our framework, we would not eliminate these differences of opinion. But we would further discipline the parameters of our discussions and clarify the judgments that lie behind our policy decisions.\nAs the central bank in a democratic society, the Federal Reserve has an obligation to articulate what it is trying to achieve with monetary policy. I believe that these latest communications efforts are an important step in further increasing such accountability to the public. The Committee equally respects both legs of the dual mandate, and I feel these communications enhancements will help articulate the ways in which we will seek to achieve both objectives.\nThank you and I look forward to your questions.\n\nNotes\n1 Evans, Charles, 2011, “A risk management approach to monetary policy,” Remarks delivered at the Ball State University Center for Business and Economic Research, Muncie, Indiana on December 5.\n\nReferences\nFriedman, Milton, and Anna Jacobson Schwartz, 1971, A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960, Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.",

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you for that kind introduction. This seems to be the time of year when both businesses and individuals focus on planning for the year ahead, and I’m delighted to be here this morning to share my perspective on the current economy. In doing so, I will discuss my views on the progress of the recovery and on the likely course of monetary policy.\nThose of you who follow monetary policy developments may be aware that I was the lone dissenter at the last two Fed policy meetings. So it should come as no surprise when I say that the views that I am presenting today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or my other colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nLately, it has become extremely important for Federal Reserve policymakers to get out from behind our desks and into the communities we serve. Doing this gives me the opportunity to explain how I think about the economy, but it’s also important for me to learn from your questions and comments. I really do value the opportunity to interact with business people within our Fed District, which comprises most of the Midwest and stretches from Detroit to Des Moines and on down to Indianapolis. So it really is a pleasure for me to be here today, to have the chance to “get out” and yet still be close to home.\n\nDual Mandate\nThe Federal Reserve is charged by Congress with fostering economic conditions consistent with maximum employment and price stability. These two objectives are commonly referred to as our “dual mandate.”\nThe Fed is different from most other central banks in that it has an explicit dual mandate. Although many central banks are instructed to mitigate disturbances to the real economy, most have a mandate to achieve only one goal—maintaining price stability. Usually, this is not an important distinction, since monetary policies that promote price stability are generally consistent with those that support full employment.\nHowever, in the rare occasion when tension arises between these two goals, policy must be formulated with careful consideration of the relative performance of one objective against the other and of the risks to the outlooks for both policy goals.\nKeeping this in mind, I’ll turn now to a discussion of my outlook for the economy and then offer my views on how best to chart a course for monetary policy.\n\nReal Output Gap\nFour years ago the U.S. economy entered what developed into the deepest downturn since the Great Depression; indeed, many are now referring to 2008–09 as the “Great Recession.”\nDuring recoveries from severe recessions, we usually see solid job and output growth, with the improvements in one fostering gains in the other. We are not seeing this today. It is now two and a half years since the Great Recession ended and the recovery began.\nYet, despite both accommodative monetary policy and fiscal stimulus, the pace of improvement has been painstakingly slow. Real gross domestic product (GDP) is only just back to where it stood at its pre-recession peak. Employment growth is barely enough to keep pace with the natural growth in the labor force and the unemployment rate remains extraordinarily high.\nHowever, recent news about the performance of the economy has been more promising. Motor vehicle sales have returned to their upward trend following supply disruptions caused by last spring’s horrible Japanese tsunami. U.S. manufacturing is expanding—boosted by the recovery in the automotive sector, as well as growing worldwide demand for materials and equipment in the energy, mining and agricultural sectors.\nConsumer spending outside of autos appears to be rising at a moderate rate, and employment growth, although still tepid, is showing signs of improvement. Initial unemployment insurance claims are down and layoffs have fallen, contributing to a decline in the unemployment rate of 0.5 percent over the past quarter. So, the economy is looking somewhat better than it did a few months ago.\nBut this does not mean we are seeing a massive surge in economic activity. The data shows only modest improvement in growth to rates that are near or just somewhat above the economy’s longer-run potential.\nMoreover, the pace of economic activity needs to accelerate further to boost confidence. After all, we have seen our hopes for a more rapid improvement in the economy dashed several times in this recovery. For instance, early last year most forecasters thought that the recovery was gaining traction and that economic activity would increase at a solid—though not spectacular—pace through 2012.\nThen, as now, the labor market was beginning to show some long-awaited improvement, and households and businesses seemed to be making good progress in repairing their balance sheets following the huge losses in wealth sustained during the recession. Analysts thought that higher prices for energy and other commodities would weigh on output growth, as would the supply-chain disruptions from the disaster in Japan. But these factors were expected to be transitory, and most forecasters thought growth would improve significantly once these influences had passed.\nUnfortunately, this forecast proved to be too optimistic. Revised data indicate that annualized real GDP growth was only 1 percent in the first half of 2011 and improved only modestly to 2 percent in the third quarter. Consumer spending was particularly sluggish, weighed down by slow growth in employment, income, and household wealth, as well as some continued limits in access to credit.\nFurthermore, the weakness in GDP growth began before the bulk of the effects of higher energy prices hit the economy and before the disaster in Japan happened. This timing, along with the continued softness of most economic indicators into the early summer, indicates that the slowing in output growth was not all due to temporary factors.\nPeriodically, the FOMC publishes participants’ projections for several key economic variables. Our latest forecasts were made in early November. Our outlook then was for real GDP growth to be around 1.75 percent in 2011 and then rise to 2.75 percent in 2012.\nThough an improvement, this 2012 pace is not far above most analysts’ views of the potential rate of output growth for the economy. Thus, such growth rates are not strong enough to make much of a dent in the unemployment rate and other measures of resource slack. Indeed, the FOMC’s latest forecasts are for the unemployment rate to remain above 8.5 percent through 2012 and to fall only to about 8 percent in 2013.\nAs I just noted, the somewhat firmer tone of recent economic data suggest some welcome traction, but the data are not strong enough, or uniform enough, to assert that momentum for growth is building. The headwinds that we face are still substantial.\nMoreover, the problems in Europe now loom larger. Careful analysis suggests that the direct impact of slower European growth on U.S. net exports likely would be small. However, there is a risk that substantial financial disruptions in Europe could impinge on the cost and availability of credit in the U.S. or induce a new wave of cautious behavior by households and businesses. If that were to occur, then we could see a larger adverse impact on economic activity in the U.S.\nAfter I balance these factors, my outlook for real GDP growth remains largely unchanged from the November forecast, and my forecast for the unemployment rate is only slightly lower. However, I am concerned about the downside risks.\n\nInflation Outlook under 2 Percent\nWhat about inflation? Large increases in energy prices pushed headline inflation—as measured by the 12-month change in the total Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index—up from about 1.25 percent last fall to almost 3 percent this summer. One-time events that were well beyond the control of monetary policy—such as the Arab Spring—drove prices higher and took a bite out of households’ budgets. But they did not result in a permanent ratcheting up of inflation.\nPrices for energy and many other commodities have softened of late, and the earlier increases did not pass much into core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy components. Notably, recent numbers show core inflation is now lower than last summer. Keep in mind, this is a better predictor of future overall inflation than total inflation itself.\nAnd with the unemployment rate still high and capacity utilization low, resource slack will continue to exert downward pressure on prices. In addition, measures of longer-run inflation expectations are at the low end of the range they have been running since last November.\nPutting these factors together, I would argue that the outlook for inflation is likely to remain low for the foreseeable future. The November FOMC forecasts for core inflation in 2012 were concentrated near 1.8 percent, and the forecasts for total inflation in 2013 and 2014 were in the range of 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent. My own assessment is that inflation will be at the lower end of these ranges.\n\nFed Performance\nGiven the high unemployment rate and low job growth, I think it is clear that the Fed has fallen short in achieving its goal of maximum employment.\nAs for the price stability component of our dual mandate, the majority of FOMC participants—including me—judge that our objective is for overall inflation to average 2 percent over the medium term. With my own view that inflation is likely to run below this rate over the next few years, I believe we will miss on our inflation objective as well.\n\nWhat Is the Right Course for Policy?\nThe traditional course of action when inflation is below target and real output is expected to be below potential is to run an accommodative monetary policy. I support such accommodation today. And I believe the degree of accommodation should be substantial.\nI believe that the disappointingly slow growth and continued high unemployment that we confront today reflects the fact that we are in what economists call a “liquidity trap.” Let me explain. In normal times, real interest rates—that is, nominal interest rates adjusted for expected inflation—rise and fall to bring desired savings into line with investment and to keep productive resources near full employment.\nThis market dynamic is thwarted in the case of a liquidity trap. That is, when desired savings increase a great deal, nominal interest rates may fall to zero and then can go no lower. Real interest rates become “trapped” and may not be able to become negative enough to equilibrate savings and investment. That is where we seem to be now—short-term, risk-free nominal interest rates are close to zero and actual real rates are modestly negative, but they are still not low enough to return economic activity to its potential.\nA liquidity trap presents a clear and present danger of a prolonged period of economic weakness—today that means a risk of repeating the experience of the U.S. in the 1930s or that of Japan over the past 20 years.\nBut we need not resign ourselves to such an outcome. Because of the dire implications of liquidity traps, economists have studied them over the years in rigorous analytical models.\nImportantly, variants of these models have successfully explained past business cycle developments in the U.S. These studies conclude that economic performance can be vastly improved by employing monetary policies that commit to keeping short-term rates low for a prolonged period.\n\nA Balanced Policy Approach\nAs I weigh the evidence, I believe we are in a liquidity trap and favor the prescription of continued accommodation. But I recognize that I could be wrong. Central bankers have incomplete information, and sometimes are confronted with very different views of the forces driving the economy. This is especially true in the difficult circumstances we currently face.\nInstead of a liquidity trap, some have posited that we are in an economic malaise that reflects “structural factors” (such as a job skills mismatch) and that the economy today is actually functioning close to a new, more dismal productive capacity. I have discussed this very pessimistic “structural impediments scenario” in other forums.1 If this scenario is true, then further monetary accommodation will only lead to rising inflation without much improvement in unemployment.\nThose subscribing to this view warn of repeating the mistakes of the 1970s. At that time, the Fed did not understand that the changing structure of the economy had caused the natural rate of unemployment to rise. Too much accommodation during that time only served to raise inflation and inflation expectations.\nAlthough I do not find this structural impediments scenario compelling, as a prudent policymaker, I must at least consider its possibility. Without a clearer picture of whether we are in the midst of structural change or a liquidity trap, I favor a monetary policy strategy that balances the two risks of dismally slow growth on the one hand and creeping inflation on the other.\nLet me outline how this balanced policy approach might work in practice. The Fed could sharpen its forward guidance by pledging to keep policy rates near zero until one of two events occurs.\nFirst, this policy would account for the liquidity trap risk by communicating that we intend to keep the federal funds rate at exceptionally low levels as long as the unemployment rate is above a 7 percent threshold.\nReductions in the unemployment rate below this level would represent meaningful progress toward the natural rate of unemployment and might be a reason to lessen policy accommodation. Second, this policy would account for the risk of higher inflation —that is, we would be committed to pulling back on accommodation if inflation rises above a particular threshold.\nI would argue that this policy’s inflation-safeguard threshold needs to be above our current 2 percent inflation objective. My preferred threshold is a forecast of 3 percent over the medium term. Now, calling for tolerance of inflation up to 3 percent may seem shocking coming from a conservative central banker.\nHowever, the most recent research shows that improved economic performance during a liquidity trap requires the central bank, if necessary, to allow inflation to run higher than its target over the medium term. Such policies can generate the above-trend growth necessary to reduce unemployment and return overall economic activity to its productive potential.\nLet me emphasize that under this policy proposal, core inflation reaching 3 percent is only a risk—and not a certainty.\nIndeed, simulations of standard models suggest that core inflation is likely to remain below 3 percent even under a policy of extended monetary accommodation. But the economy may behave differently than expected. Still, 3 percent inflation is a risk that we should be willing to accept.\nIf, contrary to most evidence, the natural rate of unemployment is higher than 7 percent, then under this policy inflation will rise more quickly and without any improvements to the real side of the economy. In such an adverse situation, the inflation safeguard triggers an exit from what would be evidently excessive policy accommodation. And it would do so before inflation expectations would be in much danger of becoming unhinged.\nWe would not have the desired reductions in unemployment, but then again, there wouldn’t be anything that monetary policy could do about it. We would suffer some policy loss in that a 3 percent inflation rate is above our 2 percent target. But we certainly have experienced inflation rates near 3 percent in the recent past and have weathered them well. And 3 percent won’t unhinge long-run inflation expectations.\nWe are not talking about anything close to the debilitating higher inflation rates we saw in the 1970s or 1980s. Most importantly, we would also know that we had made our best effort.\nBut let me be clear: There is a natural tendency for policymakers to pull back on accommodation too early before the real rate of interest has fallen to low enough levels. Such errors happened in 1937 when the Fed prematurely withdrew accommodation. This was documented in Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz’s 1971 book, A Monetary History of the United States. More recently, the Bank of Japan made the same mistake. Therefore, it is essential that the Fed clearly commit to a policy action that is measurable against our goals.\n\nPolicy Projections and a Monetary Policy Framework\nRegardless of whether such explicit forward guidance is adopted, the effectiveness of monetary policy can be enhanced by clear communication of the Fed’s ultimate goals and of the strategies that it will use to achieve those goals. The minutes from the December FOMC meeting, which were released last Tuesday, noted that the Committee discussed two initiatives to enhance our communications about monetary policy. First, we agreed to begin publishing participants’ projections for the appropriate path for the federal funds rate and qualitative information about their outlooks for the Fed’s balance sheet in our quarterly Summary of Economic Projections (or SEP). Second, we discussed formulating a consensus statement on the Committee’s longer-run goals and monetary policy strategies.\nUntil now, participants have provided forecasts for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate and inflation, but not the policy assumptions that underlie these projections. The forecasts were made under each participant’s unspecified views of appropriate policy, which is defined in true Fedspeak as: “the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s dual objectives of maximum sustainable employment and stable prices.”\nBeing more explicit about appropriate policy can clear up a lot of uncertainty. For example, suppose inflation were running higher than we would like, and the economic projections in the SEP showed it coming down over the next couple of years. In the absence of information on participants’ policy projections, the public would not know whether the FOMC thought inflation would simply come down on its own or whether it thought that a monetary tightening would be required to reduce inflationary pressures. Including policy projections will help clarify such judgments.\nIn my opinion, this is a substantial, first-order improvement in policy communications, and this greater clarity may have significant additional value for improving how the economy operates. Expectations of the future path for policy and the degree of uncertainty surrounding those expectations are key determinants of private borrowing rates and other asset prices. These play an important role in the spending and saving decisions of households and businesses. Households and businesses will be able to make better-informed decisions if they have a clearer notion of future policy rates; the potential for reduced uncertainty could also lower the risk premium embedded in longer-term interest rates.\nThe second new communications initiative—a more explicit consensus framework for monetary policy—is still a work-in-progress. Thus I can only talk about it in generalities and give you my personal views about what it should say and why it would be very helpful.\nIn my view, a framework statement should help clarify what the dual mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability mean in terms of measurable economic outcomes. It should also convey the extent to which monetary policy can be expected to deliver particular long-run outcomes. And it should better enable the public to form expectations about how policy will react to economic disturbances that move employment and inflation away from levels consistent with the dual mandate. As I noted earlier, our goals of maximum employment and price stability usually are not in conflict; but when they are, a more explicit framework can provide a better idea of how the Committee will weigh the relevant costs and benefits that enter this more difficult decision-making process.\nI have strongly supported the publication of our policy projections, and I strongly support the adoption of a more explicit consensus framework statement. In my opinion, my current policy views and prescriptions continue to be appropriate in light of these new communications vehicles. The threshold policy I discussed earlier advocates keeping the federal funds rate near zero until either the unemployment rate falls below 7 percent (at least) or until medium-term inflation breaches 3 percent. The FOMC’s adoption of an explicit policy framework can underscore the distinction between these policy thresholds vs. our longer-run objectives. In particular, we would convey that the longer-run sustainable rate of unemployment is substantially lower than the threshold of 7 percent, while the inflation threshold of 3 percent is higher than the longer-run inflation objective. Consequently, even if inflation runs somewhat above its goal for a while, the public would understand that we intend to bring inflation down to the goal over time, and hence longer-run inflation expectations would remain firmly anchored.\nThe communication of policy projections also works well in conjunction with the thresholds. By publishing projections for future short-term interest rates along with unemployment and inflation, the public can evaluate the Committee’s thinking about which combinations of unemployment and inflation will likely lead to a lift-off of policy rates. In comparing these projections against my thresholds, the public can evaluate how much more policy accommodation could potentially be allowed under my proposal.\nProviding these additional forecasts enhances transparency and the public’s ability to evaluate current monetary policy with alternative approaches. And a framework that explicitly clarifies the Committee’s commitment to both price-stability and achievable real-side mandate responsibilities will, I believe, often allow monetary policy to respond more strongly in the medium-term when adverse economic shocks impede growth and employment. Indeed, I think these additional communications vehicles can provide further clarification and increase the effectiveness of the types of additional accommodation that I have advocated in recent months, as well as earlier in 2010. Consequently, I am an enthusiastic supporter of these enhancements to Fed transparency.\nLet me conclude by saying that I do not see these enhanced communications vehicles as being inherently “hawkish” or “dovish.” Participants may well have differing views on the appropriate stance of monetary policy in the particular economic circumstances of the moment. In being more explicit about our framework, we would not eliminate these differences of opinion. But we would further discipline the parameters of our discussions and clarify the judgments that lie behind our policy decisions.\nAs the central bank in a democratic society, the Federal Reserve has an obligation to articulate what it is trying to achieve with monetary policy. I believe that these latest communications efforts are an important step in further increasing such accountability to the public. The Committee equally respects both legs of the dual mandate, and I feel these communications enhancements will help articulate the ways in which we will seek to achieve both objectives.\nThank you and I look forward to your questions.\n\nNotes\n1 Evans (2011).\n\nReferences\nEvans, Charles, 2011, “A risk management approach to monetary policy,” Remarks delivered at the Ball State University Center for Business and Economic Research, Muncie, Indiana on December 5.\nFriedman, Milton, and Anna Jacobson Schwartz, 1971, A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960, Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.",

This annual event is a key resource for community development financial institution banks that use their local knowledge for critical services like repurposing foreclosed property, aiding in natural disaster recovery efforts and serving borrowers who cannot access mainstream credit. The challenge these institutions face is in balancing financial health and capital concerns with mission goals and social impact. Let me note that these are my own views and not necessarily the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System.\nThe U.S. economy has struggled to generate sufficient growth to sustain a strong recovery due to a combination of issues.\nFirst, fiscal restraint has been a massive drag on the economy since 2011. Reduced government spending and higher tax rates have had a significant negative effect on gross domestic product growth. These come on top of other headwinds holding back growth, such as the lingering effects of the financial crisis and sluggish international economic conditions.\nSecond, inflation is running well below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target. Inflation is low not just in the U.S., but around the world as well. Unexpectedly low inflation makes it more difficult for households and businesses to pay back debt; in turn unexpectedly high debt burdens can reduce borrowing and spending and slow the economy.\nThird, monetary policy has had limited room to maneuver in working to counteract these headwinds. The \"zero lower bound\" on interest rates has constrained the use of the traditional policy tool, the federal funds rate. Accordingly, the Federal Reserve has turned to other tools to stimulate the economy — namely large scale purchases of treasuries and agency mortgage backed securities and forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate. On the latter point, the Fed has stated it will keep interest rates at their current level at least as long the unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent and the outlook for inflation is below 2.5 percent. If appropriate, rates could be held down even longer.\nThese nontraditional policies have increased the Fed's balance sheet to an unprecedented level and resulted in expectations that interest rates will be low for an unprecedented length of time. Some worry about possible inflationary or financial stability risks associated with these developments. The Fed is carefully monitoring the economy for such risks. Today they seem low; nonetheless, I believe that there are ample safeguards in place should problems arise.\nUltimately — with the continued support of highly accommodative monetary policy — the economy will recover. More customers will show up in stores; as businesses see the higher demand, they will expand and create more jobs. Incomes will grow, leading to more consumption, and the process will form a self-reinforcing upward spiral. There is still a long way to go, but 2014 may be the year that we see the breakout to more solid and sustained economic growth.",

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you Franklin for that kind introduction. It is a great honor to be the recipient of the Financial Management Association’s (FMA) Outstanding Financial Executive Award and join distinguished past recipients, such as my Fed colleague and our new Chair-designate, Janet Yellen. It is also a great pleasure to welcome the FMA back to Chicago.\nIt has been six years since the onset of the financial crisis that painfully illustrated how excessive risk-taking in financial markets can have persistent negative spillovers to the macroeconomy. More than four years into the recovery, the unemployment rate is much higher than the economy’s normal long-run rate and there is still a substantial output gap. The crisis’s lasting negative effects on the economy highlight the complex web of interactions between financial markets and real economic activity. As a result, financial stability issues now play a more prominent role in monetary policy deliberations around the world than they did prior to the crisis.\nToday, I would like to share with you my approach as a policymaker to the juxtaposition of monetary policy and financial stability objectives. Let me note that these are my own views and not necessarily the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System.\n\nTargets and Tools of Monetary Policy\nThe monetary policy mandates of the Federal Reserve are clear: to foster monetary and financial conditions that support maximum employment and price stability. During normal times, the two objectives of monetary policy are generally complementary while the relationship between maximum employment, inflation and our traditional policy tool — the target federal funds rate — is well understood and time-tested.\nClearly, the economy has been far from normal in recent years. The country has struggled through a serious financial crisis, a deep recession and what, so far, has been an unsatisfactory recovery. The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy mission has been put to the test.\nIn response, the FOMC has acted decisively to provide extraordinary monetary policy accommodation to help the economy regain its footing. The target fed funds rate has been near zero for nearly five years. Nonetheless, massive shortfalls in aggregate demand have left the unemployment rate persistently above the 5 to 6 percent range that characterizes a well-functioning labor market. At the same time, inflation has been well below our 2 percent long-run target.\nWith the fed funds rate pinned down at its zero lower bound, the FOMC has turned to nontraditional tools — namely, forward guidance on short-term interest rates and large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs). Our strategy is to promote a faster recovery by lowering long-term interest rates. A classic textbook decomposition of long-term rates is to view them as the sum of expected future short-term rates and a premium that compensates for interest rate risk. The new tools are aimed at influencing both of these components of long-term rates. Forward guidance reduces expected future short-term rates by ensuring that the fed funds rate will remain low until we reach specific thresholds with respect to the dual mandate goals. The LSAPs are intended to reduce term premiums by removing duration risk from private portfolios. This combination of unconventional tools demonstrated our willingness to take extraordinary measures to restore the economy to full employment.\nWhile these policy tools lower interest rates in an unconventional way, their transmission to real economic activity is quite conventional. Through arbitrage and portfolio rebalancing, lower rates in one market — whether it’s the fed funds market or the Treasury and the agency mortgage-backed securities markets — are transmitted to other rates faced by investors, nonfinancial firms and consumers, as well as across the asset and maturity spectrum. There is significant evidence that the FOMC’s policies have been helpful in lowering rates paid by firms and consumers and, more generally, in supporting aggregate demand in the face of substantial economic headwinds over the past six years.\n\nFinancial Stability and Monetary Policy\nThe Federal Reserve Act is clear in giving the Federal Reserve a dual mandate to support price stability and maximum employment. Where does financial stability fit in monetary policy? There is clearly an interdependent relationship between the two. A strong and robust economy with low inflation provides a key stabilizing force for financial markets. At the same time, stable and well-functioning financial markets are essential to achieving the goals of monetary policy. The past six years reinforce this critical interplay between monetary and financial conditions.\nHowever, beyond these basic tenets, what is the appropriate policy stance for achieving both financial stability and the dual mandate?\nThese are particularly important issues in the current environment of low interest rates. A bedrock principle of modern central banking is that low and stable inflation provides the best outcomes for society. Typically, this principle also implies low and stable nominal interest rates that reflect the underlying inflation rate and a relatively stable equilibrium real interest rate. Of course, this real rate is the one that matches the supply of savings to the demand for investment. Today, however, the forces of demand and supply have pushed down equilibrium real interest rates to very low levels. The supply of savings is high as households work down their debt overhang and repair their balance sheets. The demand for such savings is low as long-term, real-money investors face an already abundant supply of housing, substantial unused productive capacity and uncertainty over the path of the economy going forward. As a result, equilibrium real interest rates are currently quite low. Low equilibrium real interest rates, combined with a low inflation rate, mean equilibrium nominal interest rates also are quite low — indeed, they are likely negative at shorter maturities. (This, of course, is another way of describing the policy dilemma posed by the zero lower bound on interest rates.)\nWhen faced with shortfalls in aggregate demand, large resource gaps and low equilibrium interest rates, highly accommodative monetary policies are needed to stimulate demand. One way this works is by encouraging households and entrepreneurs to take on some additional risk in their borrowing and spending decisions. This may sound odd at first. But during a period of economic weakness, overall risk-taking is often reduced well below normal levels. That appears to be the case today. The Fed’s accommodative policies are meant to help restore a more normal level of real risk-taking — a level more naturally associated with typical spending and investment behavior in a vibrant economy.\nWith inflation running below our 2 percent long-run target and the unemployment rate still unacceptably high, appropriate monetary policy dictates that low real interest rates should prevail until the economy is further along on a sustainable path to its potential level. This assertion is made from a mainstream macroeconomic perspective. Nonetheless, it is common to hear the argument that these highly accommodative monetary policies might sow the seeds of financial instability. How should we evaluate this argument?\nWithout adequate safeguards, excessive and persistently low interest rates could lead to excessive risk-taking by some investors. For instance, some firms, such as life insurance companies and pension funds, are under pressure to meet a stream of fixed liabilities incurred when interest rates were higher. (And perhaps these liabilities were offered at somewhat generous terms to begin with.) To meet commitments like these in the current low interest rate environment, the incentive exists to reach for yield by investing in excessively risky assets. Furthermore, with the costs of borrowing at historically low levels, other investors might simply decide that this is a good time to cheaply amplify the risk and return in their portfolios by taking on more leverage.\nSo, one could reach the conclusion that historically low and stable interest rates pose a threat to financial stability. This creates a seeming paradox for policymakers. The existing large shortfalls in aggregate demand call for highly accommodative monetary policies and historically low interest rates. Yet, such policies have the potential to raise the likelihood of financial instability in the future. How should regulators and the Fed mitigate this potential financial risk? Should the FOMC step away from what we thought was the best monetary policy with respect to our dual mandate? Should we discard our nonconventional tools and raise the fed funds rate in order to reduce the possibility of undesirable financial imbalances in the future?\nI don’t believe that is the right approach. I think the inference that persistently low interest rates pose a danger to financial stability is based on a partial equilibrium analysis and is unlikely to survive a general equilibrium approach. If more restrictive monetary policies were pursued to generate higher interest rates, they would likely result in higher unemployment and a sharp decline in asset prices, choking the moderate recovery. Such an adverse economic outcome is unlikely to set a favorable foundation for financial stability. Moreover, our short-term interest rate tools are too blunt to have a significant effect on those pockets of the financial system prone to inappropriate risk-taking without, at the same time, significantly damaging other markets, as well as the growth prospects for the economy as a whole. Therefore, stepping away from otherwise appropriate monetary policy to address potential financial stability risks would degrade progress towards maximum employment and price stability. This approach would be a poor choice if other tools are available, at lower social costs, to address financial stability risks.\nLet me be clear. I am not saying that financial stability concerns are not relevant for the economy or that policymakers should not take decisive action against developments that threaten financial stability. Rather, I am saying that the macroprudential tools available to policymakers are better suited to addressing financial risks directly. These macroprudential actions can be dialed up or down given the appropriate setting of monetary policy tools, so undesirable macroeconomic outcomes are less likely than if we were to resort to premature monetary tightening. After all, any decision to rely on more-restrictive interest rate policies to achieve financial stability at the expense of poorer macroeconomic outcomes must pass a cost–benefit test. Such a test should clearly illustrate that the economic outcomes from more-restrictive interest rate policies — which could include much higher unemployment and even lower inflation than at present — would be better and more acceptable to society than the outcomes that can be achieved by using enhanced supervisory tools alone to address financial instability risks.\n\nMacroprudential Tools\nEven before the recent financial crisis, central bankers were well aware of the key role played by stable financial markets in economic activity. The FOMC has always followed financial market developments closely. Since the crisis, however, the analysis of financial stability issues has been greatly expanded and given a more prominent role in the FOMC’s deliberations.\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve has revamped its supervisory approach substantially to focus on financial risks. Today, traditional bank supervisory tools are being used more intensively, and new tools have been developed. The Fed also has increased its involvement outside its traditional role as a banking regulator. Let me give you a few examples.\nOne of the lessons learned from the financial crisis was that the extensive interconnectedness of the financial system can generate important systemic risks. Traditionally, the Federal Reserve’s supervisory efforts were focused on analyzing an individual institution’s activities to understand the strengths and challenges of that particular company. This microprudential approach continues to provide supervisors a sound working knowledge of the institutions. However, it lacks what Chairman Bernanke has described as a macroprudential “field of vision.”1 Accordingly, since the crisis, the Fed has taken a broader, cross-firm approach. Taking such a wide-angle view of the industry helps identify common trends and emerging concentrations of risks that might pose systemic threats to the broad financial system. It also allows supervisors to better identify sound practices among firms and incorporate them into supervisory reviews and the feedback provided in them.\nThis broader view is also reflected in the changes made to the Federal Reserve System’s supervisory infrastructure in recent years. For instance, the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee (LISCC) was formed in 2010 to incorporate an integrated, macroprudential approach to the supervision of the largest financial firms in the nation. Through better data collection and quantitative analysis, the LISCC seeks to identify concentrations of risk not only at the firm level, but also in the industry as a whole. When needed, these efforts also provide input into developing the broader supervisory approach for these complex organizations.\nThe Federal Reserve has also greatly expanded its surveillance efforts to financial markets outside of the traditional banking sector, such as the insurance industry. Insurance companies hold 20 percent of all corporate and foreign bonds, as well as approximately 12 percent of all municipal debt in the market.2 Clearly, disruptions at these companies could have ramifications to broader markets and institutions — just think AIG (American International Group Inc.). The Federal Reserve now serves as the supervisor of savings and loan holding companies that have significant insurance businesses. It also has a role in the oversight of organizations deemed systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), which currently include the insurers Prudential Financial and AIG. Here at the Chicago Fed, we have set up an initiative to better understand the role of the insurance industry in the financial sector and the economy as a whole. For example, our staff is studying how the life insurance industry is responding to the current low interest rate environment. Furthermore, the Chicago Fed’s insurance surveillance efforts support the Federal Reserve System’s supervisory roles and help to provide insights into special risks inherent to insurance companies. Another insight from the financial crisis was the importance of financial market utilities, or FMUs. These are institutions that function in the background of the financial markets and include clearinghouses, securities depositories and payments and settlement systems. FMUs generally functioned well during the crisis, and it is critical for these utilities to function well under stress. Otherwise, financial instabilities could be magnified. The Financial Stability Oversight Council has designated eight FMUs as systemically important.3 Three are in Chicago: the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, ICE Clear Credit and the Options Clearing Corporation. All three are central counterparties that clear derivative contracts. Our Chicago-based supervisory team and staff members at the Board of Governors have actively engaged in the FMU supervisory efforts, which are led by the FMUs’ primary regulators, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAs a result, regulators have developed a deeper understanding of the central clearing mechanisms for derivatives contracts, including inherent credit and liquidity risks associated with banks’ off-balance-sheet activities.\nAn example of such FMU analysis includes recent outreach performed by our Chicago team, in conjunction with our New York supervisory colleagues, in assessing the impact of mandatory swap clearing rules on banks.\nAnother set of financial stability issues involves the role of high-frequency computerized trading in securities and derivatives markets. Technological advances have allowed trading to become faster, with trades completed in time frames measured in milliseconds. High-frequency trading can enhance market liquidity, provide automated audit trails and narrow bid–offer spreads. However, given the speed with which these transactions are executed, errors such as unintended accumulation of large positions, out-of-control algorithms and trades at incorrect prices can rapidly spread through and across markets.\nStaff from the Chicago Fed is actively engaged in assessing the high-speed trading environment and issues that arise within it. We continue to work with the industry and other regulators to identify risks, address policy concerns and suggest best practices for error controls at all levels of the trade life cycle, from order submission through trade matching, clearing and settlement.\nMost of what I have highlighted thus far covers the ways the Federal Reserve has reoriented its supervisory efforts to control potential financial risks and increase the resiliency of financial markets. I think it’s also important to talk about new tools put in place at the firm level to foster stability in the financial markets. Capital stress tests are one example. The first testing exercise in 2009 resulted in roughly $75 billion in equity capital being raised at ten of the 19 largest bank holding companies and helped to calm financial markets at a crucial period during the crisis. In each successive year, the tests have been refined, and capital stress testing is now a mainstay in supervision for large firms. In addition, U.S. banks will soon be subject to Basel III rules that increase both the quantity and quality of capital they hold. Upon full implementation, banks will be required to hold capital conservation buffers and, if these buffers are deemed insufficient, will have their dividends, stock buybacks and discretionary bonuses restricted. In addition, if the evidence points to an overheating in credit markets, regulators will be able to require the largest companies to hold countercyclical capital buffers — which would dial up the capital requirements for these firms during good times as a buffer against shocks during bad times.\nThese are just a few examples of regulatory tools available to monitor and promote financial stability. There are a host of additional instruments in our toolkit, such as resolution plans, liquidity requirements and single counterparty credit limits. All are examples of improvements in supervisory practices aimed at reducing the likelihood of systemic disruptions and containing the impact should such disruptions occur.\n\nConclusion\nSome have questioned the ability of these supervisory and regulatory tools to adequately address potential financial stability risks, arguing that a broad interest-rate policy might be more effective in catching incipient risks that might fall through the cracks. It is certainly true that higher interest rates would permeate the entire financial system. But this is just another way of saying that raising interest rates is a blunt tool. Higher interest rates would reduce risk-taking where it is excessive; but they also would result in a pullback in economic activity in sectors where risk-taking might already be overly restrained. That’s how a blunt tool works.\nIf you believe that financial stability can only be achieved through higher interest rates — interest rates that would do immediate damage to meeting our dual mandate goals at a time when unemployment is still unacceptably high — then we ought to at least ask ourselves if the financial system has become too big and too complex. This conclusion is particularly vexing if supervisory, macroprudential and market-discipline tools are inadequate. If the only way we can achieve financial stability is to raise interest rates above where the forces of demand and supply in the real economy put them, then the cost-benefit calculus of our policy choices becomes much more complex. The possible benefit of such a restrictive rate move would be to reduce risks that might potentially be forming in the nooks and crannies of a highly complex financial system. But the cost would be higher unemployment; a risk of choking off the economic recovery; even lower inflation below our objective; and, somewhat paradoxically, the introduction of new financial risks by reducing asset values and credit quality. When weighing the costs and benefits of alternative policy actions under these circumstances, I would have to question whether the financial system has become too complex — perhaps complex enough to generate negative marginal social value. Rather than degrading our macroeconomic performance through suboptimal monetary policies, I also would have to consider whether we should contemplate big changes to the financial system — a lot more rules, substantially higher capital requirements for all institutions and maybe even fewer financial products.\nHowever, I have a more favorable view of the social value of our financial system and the efficacy of supervision and regulation. Since the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has expanded its macroprudential toolkit and enhanced its microprudential tools. We have also reoriented our approach to supervision to take full advantage of Federal Reserve System staff’s wide-ranging expertise on macroeconomic and financial developments and risks. I believe that these regulatory efforts can effectively minimize the risks of another crisis and increase the resiliency of the financial system. We can achieve these objectives without having to resort to wholesale changes to the financial system and without degrading our monetary policy goals. Maintaining the effectiveness of the financial system for generating stronger and more robust economic growth continues to be a crucial objective for public policy.\n\nNotes\n1 Bernanke (2008).\n2 Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago staff calculations from the Flow of Funds.

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you Morris Davis for that kind introduction and also for the invitation to speak today to the 2013 Wisconsin Real Estate and Economic Outlook Conference.\nBefore I begin, let me say that the views I express here are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System.\nThe mission of the Federal Reserve is to foster monetary and financial conditions that support maximum employment and price stability. Since the beginning of 2008, that mission to fulfill our dual mandate has been put to the test. The country has struggled through a very serious financial crisis, a two-year recession and what, so far, has been a most unsatisfying recovery. The economy continues to perform below capacity, and inflation remains lower than our 2 percent target.\nIn response, the FOMC has acted decisively to provide extraordinary monetary policy accommodation to help the economy regain its footing. The target fed funds rate has been near zero for the past five years. Nonetheless, massive shortfalls in aggregate demand have left the unemployment rate persistently above the 5 to 6 percent range that characterizes a well-functioning labor market. At the same time, inflation has been well below our 2 percent long-run target.\nWith the federal funds rate pinned down at its zero lower bound, the FOMC has turned to nontraditional tools — namely, forward guidance on short-term interest rates and large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs). Our strategy is to promote a faster recovery by lowering long-term interest rates. A classic textbook decomposition of long-term rates is to view them as the sum of expected future short-term rates and a premium that compensates for interest rate risk. The new tools are aimed at influencing both of these components of long-term rates. Forward guidance reduces expected future short-term rates by ensuring that the fed funds rate will remain low until we reach specific thresholds with respect to the dual mandate goals. The LSAPs are intended to reduce term premiums by removing duration risk from private portfolios. This combination of unconventional tools demonstrated our willingness to take extraordinary measures to restore the economy to full employment.\nWhile these policy tools lower interest rates in an unconventional way, their transmission to real economic activity is quite conventional. Through arbitrage and portfolio rebalancing, lower rates in one market — whether it’s the fed funds market or the Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities markets — are transmitted to other rates faced by investors, nonfinancial firms and consumers, as well as across the asset and maturity spectrum. There is significant evidence that the FOMC’s policies have been helpful in lowering rates paid by firms and consumers and, more generally, in supporting aggregate demand in the face of the substantial economic headwinds over the past six years. These highly accommodative policies — which I expect will continue to be in place for some time — are an important reason why I have a relatively optimistic forecast for the U.S. economy. I expect that in 2014 economic growth will pick up to a pace of around 3 percent, that by the end of the year unemployment will fall to a bit below 7 percent and inflation will be moving back toward our 2 percent target.\n\nPolicy Conditionality\nBefore I turn to the details of this forecast, I would like to talk more about the nontraditional monetary policies supporting this outlook. An important feature of both forward guidance and the current LSAP program is that they are tied to the performance of the economy. I’m often asked questions like the following: How big is the Fed balance sheet going to get?, and exactly when is the first increase in the fed funds rate going to take place? Some days I wish I could answer these questions with a single number, a firm date and a confident fist pump. But that’s not possible. Instead, the size of our current quantitative easing (QE) program and the timing of future changes in the fed funds rate depend on the progress that the economy makes toward our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability. Only the data can tell us how much progress we’ve made, and they aren’t saying much right now: The data available in September were inconclusive, and since then, incoming information has been silenced with the federal government shutdown.\nLet me start with our current asset purchase program. I believe this program should continue until we are confident that there has been a sustainable improvement in the labor market. Unfortunately, it’s difficult to describe what this means in terms of a single number, such as the unemployment rate. One reason is that the labor force participation rate (that is, the percent of the working-age population either employed or actively searching for a job) has been falling dramatically — and by more than what can be explained by the aging population or other long-term demographic factors. This means that the drop of 3/4 percentage points in the unemployment rate we’ve seen over the past year is not as indicative of a strong labor market as would otherwise be the case, since a sizable portion of the decline is due to fewer people looking for work. For me to be confident that we in fact have achieved substantial, sustainable improvement in labor conditions, I would need to see the lower unemployment rate accompanied by cyclical improvement in the participation rate. And I also would need to see more steady, solid growth in gross domestic product (GDP) to be confident that the labor market gains would not be undone by a drop in businesses’ demand for labor.\nWith regard to forward guidance on the federal funds rate, the FOMC’s policy statements since December 2012 have formally indicated that we will keep the fed funds rate near zero at least until the unemployment rate is 6-1/2 percent, so long as the outlook for inflation remains below 2-1/2 percent over the medium term. Now, 6-1/2 percent is a threshold, not a trigger; even after reaching this threshold, if the outlook for growth is not consistent with further improvements in labor markets or the outlook for inflation is too far below 2 percent, we would likely delay increasing rates even longer. I will talk more about this decision process later on.\n\nMixed News on Economic Activity\nLet me turn now to a broader discussion of my economic outlook. Since we began our open-ended approach to asset purchases last fall, the labor market has definitely improved. When we initiated that program in September 2012, the available data showed the unemployment rate at 8.1 percent and job growth over the previous three months averaging a pace of 135,000.\nSince then, the unemployment rate has fallen to 7.3 percent and job growth has averaged around 185,000 per month. These are certainly important positive developments. Still, the U.S. economy has a long way to go to return to healthy normality. The unemployment rate is well above the 5.2 to 5.8 percent range that covers most FOMC participants’ views of its long-run normal level. Payrolls remain on the order of about 4.7 million below where they should be. And as I just noted, an unusually high number of productive, potential workers are not even looking for jobs right now.\nWhile the labor market has been improving since last fall, overall growth in production and spending has been quite modest. Most private sector forecasters think GDP grew at about a 2 percent pace last quarter; this would put average GDP growth over the past year at just 1.4 percent.\nThere is a long list of issues holding back the recovery. The higher income tax rates and the end of the 2 percent payroll tax holiday, which went into effect at the beginning of the year, are restraining household spending. Furthermore, some households are still coping with the effects of lower house prices and the erosion in their stock market wealth that occurred during the recession. With only modest demand from consumers, businesses have not been eager to add capacity.\nIn addition to the tax increases, fiscal policies — which, of course, include the mandatory sequestration — are also weighing on spending. The federal government shutdown only adds to this burden, and the debt ceiling debacle — if not adequately resolved — could have potentially large negative effects on the economy. Another headwind is that growth in many of our trading partners’ economies appears likely to remain on the soft side, holding back demand from abroad for U.S. goods and services.\nGiven this economic setting, one certainly could ask why I expect growth to pick up. Indeed, in 2009, I predicted that it would, and I did the same in 2010, 2011 and 2012. Of course, I was wrong. I was not alone — most FOMC participants and many outside analysts shared this overly optimistic view. Undaunted, I make my intrepid forecast: I anticipate growth will be in the neighborhood of 3 percent next year and the unemployment rate will fall somewhat below 7 percent by the end of 2014.\nWhy do I think this year’s projection is going to be more accurate?\nThe principal reason is that the economic fundamentals are much improved. The cyclical repair process is well under way. Although many households are still distressed, the housing sector as a whole is much better off than it was earlier in the recovery. Housing prices have risen noticeably over the past year.1 The number of mortgages under water is down from 12.1 million in early 2010 to 7.1 million in the second quarter of 2013.2\nEquity markets have largely recovered and are now around 10 percent above their pre-recessionary peaks. After several years of restraint, there is pent-up demand for consumer durables. Businesses that had generally delayed capital expenditures are in a relatively favorable position today to finance these outlays. Most big businesses’ balance sheets are in good shape. Surveys show that fewer small businesses see access to credit as a major concern. And, at the same time, there has been an increase in demand for loans from small firms.\nAnother factor behind my forecast is that it appears there will be less fiscal restraint in 2014 and 2015, provided that the government shutdown and debt ceiling limit are resolved quickly without significant near-term spending cuts as a condition. Fiscal restraint will still have a negative impact on GDP growth, but the effect should be smaller than it has been recently. The tax hikes that occurred at the beginning of this year won’t be repeated in 2014. Furthermore, under current law, much of the impact of the sequestration on government spending occurs in 2013. Accordingly, the fiscal retrenchment over the next few years will be smaller than in 2013, so the negative impact on growth will be less. I reemphasize, though, that this assumes a benign resolution of the current debates.\nThus, I feel the stage is set for what we economists like to refer to as “virtuous cyclical dynamics.” Continued growth in jobs and income as well as greater confidence in the labor market will lead to higher household spending. As firms see actual demand rising, they have an incentive to expand capacity, undertake previously delayed capital expenditures and increase hiring. This further improves the well-being of households and continues the virtuous cycle that feeds upon itself.\nOne challenge to this self-reinforcing mechanism is that there is a chicken-and-egg problem: Who will start first? In order to dramatically increase spending, households need more employment and income certainty. To expand hiring, businesses need more customers walking through their doors. Who will first “ratchet up” these spending cycles to the next level?\nThe process is more likely to get rolling if the economy experiences more positive impulses and fewer negative jolts. And, indeed, there are a number of downside risks that could produce such jolts. I have already outlined the U.S. fiscal situation. Although Europe appears to finally be in recovery mode, the outlook for growth there is still weak, and the level of economic activity there remains substantially below the previous business cycle peak. Furthermore, growth in emerging market economies has slowed. It’s difficult to gauge how structural transformations in China and developments in other emerging markets will affect global economic growth over the next few years.\nThese international downside risks take on greater prominence when we consider them in the context of weaker U.S. consumer demand. For most of the past 15 years, the American consumer has been the strongest engine of world growth. However, that American consumer has been knocked down several rungs. In order to speed up the economic recovery across the globe and in the United States, consumers elsewhere need to step up to fill the gap left by reduced American consumer demand.\n\nContinued Monetary Policy Accommodation Is Necessary\nThis brings me to an important point about my relatively upbeat projections for both growth and inflation — and returns me to the issues about policy that I opened with here today. These forecasts are based on the assumption that we will continue to provide the economy with substantial monetary policy accommodation. With our traditional instrument for conducting monetary policy, the fed funds rate, effectively at its zero lower bound, this accommodation now takes the form of our forward guidance about what we will do with the funds rate in the future and our open-ended purchases of longer duration assets.\nForward guidance refers to the conditions under which we will begin to raise the fed funds rate that I talked about earlier. Namely, the FOMC has said that the current fed funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than 2-1/2 percent and longer term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. An important feature of this policy is that it holds rates lower for longer than we normally would if the funds rate had not been stuck at zero. We would have liked to lower the funds rate further over the past four-and-a-half years, but we couldn’t. The forward guidance says we will make up for that lost time. In other words, by postponing the time of policy liftoff, the lower path for rates generates an average path that is closer to what would have been selected if lower and negative rates had been possible.\nOur asset purchases of U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) provide additional accommodation by further lowering longer term interest rates. They also serve as an important communication device in reinforcing our forward-guidance commitment to maintaining low interest rates into the future.\nLow interest rates provide a necessary support for economic activity at this stage of the recovery. Think about some of the better fundamentals for the economy that I discussed earlier. Lower mortgage rates have allowed qualifying households to refinance at very favorable rates. And more households are “in the money” for refinancing as lower interest rates help support higher house prices. I continually hear from automakers how low financing rates have helped boost motor vehicle sales, which are getting within shouting distance of their pre-recession levels. On the business side, companies with access to bond markets have been able to restructure into substantially lower cost debt. With lots of cash and lower debt-service burdens, they are well positioned to increase capital spending and hiring when they decide to do so. And even small businesses face a more attractive borrowing environment than they did earlier in the recovery.\nContinued monetary accommodation also is key to my forecast that inflation will gradually return to 2 percent. Part of the effect comes through the reduced resource gaps engendered by higher growth. Part of it also comes through a signal to markets of our commitment to achieving our inflation target of 2 percent. With enough accommodation, monetarist arithmetic will eventually gain traction and inflation will rise to meet our target. But it could take time.\n\nInflation Is Running Low\nWhat about inflation? Providing financial conditions that deliver low and stable inflation is an important part of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. However, inflation has been running well below our 2 percent long-run objective for some time. Low wage growth and low interest rates are other indicators that confirm our low inflation experience. To many Fed critics, this low inflation environment has been a big surprise. Let’s think back about five years. Recall that in December of 2008, we had brought the federal funds rate down to zero, as low as it can go. In November 2008, we had embarked on our first asset purchases, which we then expanded in March 2009 to a $1.75 trillion asset program. When we took these measures, many critics claimed that the United States was headed for double-digit inflation. I’m from Chicago, home of the well-known monetarist Milton Friedman. Some of the critics invoked his name when issuing warnings that with this kind of balance-sheet growth, higher inflation will surely come soon! Actually, a couple of nice folks mailed me worthless $100 trillion Zimbabwe notes to warn me of the inflationary consequences of our policies.\nWhat a difference a few years makes! Instead of skyrocketing, inflation now stands at 1-1/4 percent, which is 3/4 percentage point below our long-run target of 2 percent. Indeed, it has averaged well below 2 percent since this all began back in 2007. Inflationary expectations have not risen at all. And there are simply no signs of cost pressures building. Most importantly, wage growth has been quite modest, and there is no evidence of labor cost pressures. Without rising labor costs, a 1970s-style cycle of price increases cannot be sustained. That would be a set of price increases feeding through to higher wages that then again fuel further price increases, and the wage–price spiral would continue.\nIncidentally, despite what some critics have said, this benign outcome for inflation is actually quite consistent with my reading of Milton Friedman’s analysis. The measures of money he associated with inflation were broad measures that include money created by the banking system. The increases we have seen in those measures have been much more moderate. One of the big points from his Monetary History of the United States3 was that focusing too much on the size of the Fed’s balance sheet was a bad idea. Indeed, in the early 1930s, the Fed increased the size of its balance sheet quite substantially. But it wasn’t enough. Given the struggles of the banking system, broad measures of money actually declined, leading to deflation. The conclusion was that the Fed needed to have increased its balance sheet even more. That’s a lesson the Bernanke Fed has taken to heart this time around.\nLet me just remind everyone that inflation falling below our target of 2 percent is costly. If inflation is lower than expected, then debt financing is more burdensome than borrowers expected. Problems of debt overhang become that much worse for the economy. Conversely, if inflation is higher than expected, lenders are disadvantaged. So, that is why it is important for the Fed to provide for inflation that averages over time to our 2 percent long-run objective.\nI see us making gradual progress in returning inflation to 2 percent over the next few years. Some of this reflects the unwinding of some temporary factors, such as the effect of the sequestration on Medicare payments and some unusually low readings for some components of the Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index, for which prices are measured indirectly. But these factors aren’t big parts of the story. More importantly, as the real economy improves, the large resource gaps we have will close. Sustained over time, this closing of gaps will feed through to higher wage and price growth. Also, inflation expectations are well anchored and above the current inflation rate, and thus, they are providing an upward pull to prices. However, it could take several years for us to return to our 2 percent inflation objective, and I will be monitoring our progress closely when making my decision about appropriate monetary policy.\n\nContinued Monetary Policy Accommodation Is Necessary\nThis brings me to an important point about my relatively upbeat projections for both growth and inflation — and returns me to the issues about policy that I opened with here today. These forecasts are based on the assumption that we will continue to provide the economy with substantial monetary policy accommodation.\nThe degree of accommodation will depend on the data; neither changes in the pace of asset purchases or, further down the road, changes in the fed funds rate are on a preset course. The September meeting provides a window into FOMC decision-making. We viewed the data available at that meeting as being too ambiguous — and the near-term risks to growth as being too large — to slow the pace of LSAPs. We concluded that we had not yet clearly passed the economic markers that would justify a reduction in purchases. Of course, this conclusion was in contrast to the predictions of many observers.\nI’d like to note here that the exact pattern of the reduction in purchases eventually taken isn’t so critical because the path is likely to have only a marginal impact on what is most important — the total amount of purchases that are eventually made. The assumption underlying my current forecast is that by the time we end the program, total asset purchases since January 2013 will be in the neighborhood of $1.25 trillion. This is a very substantial program — one that is about double the size of our QE2 program that we ran between the fall of 2010 and the summer of 2011.\nFurthermore, when we ultimately end the current purchase program, we won’t be doing anything to reduce the balance sheet. Even though it will no longer be expanding, the balance sheet won’t actually begin to shrink until sometime much later when we make the decision to stop reinvesting maturing assets. Even then, it will only gradually decline as assets mature. Accordingly, our expanded balance sheet will be providing accommodation for a long time after we have ceased adding assets to our portfolio.\nSimilarly, our policies with regard to the federal funds rate will depend on the course of the economy. I want to reiterate the point that the Chairman and other members of the Federal Open Market Committee have made recently and that I talked about earlier in my remarks. The unemployment rate hitting 6-1/2 percent will not automatically result in an increase in the federal funds rate. When we cross the 6-1/2 percent unemployment rate threshold, we will closely evaluate the available information. When evaluating policy, we will take into account a couple of basic principles. One is that our 2 percent inflation goal is a symmetric target, not a ceiling. We’re shooting for inflation to average 2 percent over the medium term. This is different from aiming to keep it no higher than 2 percent.\nAnother principle is that when setting policy, we will take a balanced approach to achieving our dual mandate objectives. These principles will govern our judgment of whether or not it will be appropriate to raise the fed funds rate when we hit an unemployment rate of 6-1/2 percent.\nSuppose the unemployment rate reached 6-1/2 percent and inflation were 1-1/2 percent. One-and-a-half percent strikes me as much too low relative to our 2 percent target, especially since inflation has been running below 2 percent for quite a long time. I think that in this situation, it would be appropriate to hold the fed funds rate near zero to get inflation confidently moving back up toward 2 percent. I can easily envision certain circumstances in which the unemployment rate could go below 6 percent before we moved the fed funds rate up.\n\nConclusion\nAs we move closer to the time when we begin to pare back the flow of additional accommodation and contemplate eventually returning to a more normal monetary policy environment, the need for clear and effective communication is essential. In answer to the questions of how much longer and whether we are near the endpoint for policy accommodation, I decidedly say no. It is not yet time to remove accommodation. The data are still not definitive enough to say that now is time to adjust the QE3 flow purchase rate. And we are a long way from seeing an unemployment rate below 6-1/2 percent in the context of inflation moving surely toward our target. Accordingly, I expect our overall stance of monetary policy to remain highly accommodative for some time to come. My colleagues on the FOMC and I have laid out certain markers that should help gauge the timing of when we will begin to change the stance of policy. When those markers are reached, we will carefully weigh incoming data to determine if we can improve economic activity and bring inflation in at our 2 percent objective.\n\nNotes\n1 The Federal Housing Finance Agency’s (FHFA) Quarterly House Price Purchase-Only Index.is 7.2 percent higher than in the second quarter of 2012.

            "content": "Introduction\nGood morning. Thank you, John, for that kind introduction and the invitation to speak as part of the AgFirst Summit Meeting this week. It’s always a pleasure to return to South Carolina.\nBefore I begin, let me say that the views I express here are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System.\nThe mission of the Federal Reserve is to foster conditions in the economy that support maximum employment and price stability. Since the beginning of 2008, that mission has been put to the test as the country struggled through a very serious financial crisis, a two-year recession and what, so far, has been a most unsatisfying recovery. In response, the Fed has acted decisively to provide extraordinary monetary policy accommodation to help the economy regain its footing.\nAlmost five years ago, we reduced our short-term policy rate to zero, and since then, we have repeatedly indicated that this low short-term interest rate will continue for a very long period of time. We also have undertaken a series of large-scale asset purchase (LSAP) programs — including our open-ended quantitative easing (QE3) program that is still in progress.\nThese initiatives have resulted in the Fed’s balance sheet increasing from $800 billion in August 2007 to more than $3.5 trillion today.\nNotwithstanding the Fed’s policy responses, many are still concerned that the economy has not yet arrived at a path to sustainable growth. This begs the question, “Are we there yet?” and the inevitable follow up, “If not now — when?”\nIn the face of substantial economic headwinds over this period, the FOMC has taken aggressive monetary policy actions, which have been aimed at shortening our country’s long period of unacceptably high unemployment and at getting our current low rate of inflation back up toward our long-run objective of 2 percent. There is significant evidence that our policies have helped a great deal, and this is part of the reason that I have a relatively optimistic forecast. Namely, I expect that by 2014, economic growth will pick up to a pace of better than 3 percent and that inflation will be moving back toward our 2 percent target.\nNow, having presented this background and recognizing the financial sophistication of this audience, I can imagine a few questions that are on your minds.\nHow much longer will the Fed continue with QE3 purchases?\nHow large will the Fed’s balance sheet become by the time these asset purchases end?\nAnd will the balance sheet ever shrink?\nWell, some days I wish that questions like these could be answered with a firm date, a single number and a confident “yes,” accompanied by a fist pump. Unfortunately, the answer to the first question is not as simple as giving a calendar date. Instead, uncertainty over the pace of the recovery means all of this depends on the progress that the economy makes toward our goals of maximum employment and price stability. In my view, this means continuing our current QE3 asset purchase program until three conditions are met. First, the unemployment rate must be in the vicinity of 7 percent with expectations for it to continue falling in a self-sustaining fashion. Second, other important labor market indicators must show a commensurate improvement. And third, we must have considerable confidence that inflation is moving back toward our target of 2 percent. Currently, my best assessment is that by the time these conditions have been met, our QE3 asset purchases since January of this year will total at least $1.25 trillion. By comparison, that would be twice the size of our QE2 purchases made in 2010 and 2011. This would mean that our System Open Market Account (SOMA) balance sheet will reach approximately $4 trillion.\nOnce our monthly QE3 flow purchase rate is substantially reduced and we approach the $4 trillion SOMA mark, the composition and efficacy of our policy tools will shift more importantly to our forward guidance regarding to the federal funds rate. We have said we will keep the funds rate at zero at least until the unemployment rate is 6-1/2 percent, so long as the outlook for inflation remains below 2-1/2 percent over the medium term. Now, 6-1/2 percent is a threshold, not a trigger; even after reaching this threshold, if the outlook for growth is not consistent with further improvements in labor markets or the outlook for inflation is too far below 2 percent, we would likely delay increasing rates even longer.\nOK, I have done my best to provide you with my central banker responses. How long will QE3 last? It depends on the data. Of course, the person on the street would prefer a time, date and place. When, in calendar time, do I see these economic conditions being reached? For asset purchases, my current forecast has that occurring sometime in mid-2014. For the interest rate thresholds, my outlook is for the unemployment rate to be 6-1/2 percent sometime in early to mid-2015. But I also think there is a very good chance that at that time inflation will still be far enough below our 2 percent target that it will be appropriate to wait longer before increasing the funds rate; currently, I think it’s more likely that conditions for the first funds rate increase will be met in late 2015.\nOf course, these are just some possibilities. Is it possible that it might be appropriate to end QE3 earlier? Yes — absolutely — if the labor market improved faster and that was supported by stronger growth. Under these conditions, if the unemployment rate fell to 7 percent by December 2013, labor force participation was healthy and inflation was running higher than today, then I would endorse a quicker end to our asset purchases. This would be an excellent outcome. But my current optimism does have its limits. So let me turn now to a broader discussion of my economic outlook.\n\nMixed News on Economic Activity\nSince we began our open-ended approach to asset purchases last September, the labor market has definitely improved. When we initiated that program, the available data showed the unemployment rate at 8.1 percent and job growth over the previous three months averaging 135,000. Since then, the unemployment rate has fallen to about 7.5 percent and job growth has averaged around 192,000 per month. These are certainly important positive developments. Still, the U.S. economy has a long way to go to return to healthy normalcy. The unemployment rate is well above the 5-1/4 to 6 percent range that covers most FOMC participants’ views of its long-run normal level. Payrolls remain on the order of about 5 million below where they should be. In addition, an unusually high number of productive, potential workers are not even looking for jobs right now. In economist-speak, the labor force participation rate is quite low, and I should note that this is true even after accounting for structural factors such as the aging of the baby boomers and other long-run trends that are holding down the rate.\nWhile the labor market has been improving since last fall, overall growth in production and spending has been quite modest. Over the past three quarters real gross domestic product (GDP) has grown at an annual rate of around 1-1/4 percent. The higher income tax rates and the end of the 2 percent payroll tax holiday, which went into effect at the beginning of the year, are holding back household spending. Furthermore, some households are still coping with the effects of lower house prices and the erosion in their stock market wealth that occurred during the recession. With only modest demand from consumers, businesses have not been eager to add to capacity. Additionally, fiscal expenditure restraint — which, of course, includes mandatory sequestration — is also weighing on spending. And international growth appears likely to remain on the soft side, holding back demand from abroad for U.S. goods and services.\nGiven this economic setting today, how soon before we can grow our way out of this slow recovery? This has been the ongoing dilemma for four years running. In 2009, I predicted that growth would pick up. I did the same in 2010, 2011 and 2012. And I was not alone — most FOMC participants and many outside analysts shared this overly optimistic view. Undaunted, I make my intrepid forecast: I anticipate growth to average about 2-1/2 percent in the second half of the year and to be in the neighborhood of 3 percent next year. I expect the unemployment rate to be somewhat below 7 percent by the end of 2014.\nGiven our collective difficulties and the downbeat description of growth over the past few quarters, you might well ask why is this year’s projection going to be more accurate.\nThe principal reason is that the economic fundamentals are much improved. The cyclical repair process is well under way. Although many households are still distressed, the housing sector as a whole is much better off than it was earlier in the recovery. Housing prices have risen noticeably over the past year.1 The number of mortgages underwater is down from 12.1 million in early 2010 to 9.7 million in the first quarter of 2013.2 Equity markets have largely recovered and are now around 5 percent above their pre-recession peaks. After several years of restraint, there is pent-up demand for consumer durables. Businesses that had generally delayed capital expenditures are in a relatively favorable position today to finance these outlays. Most big businesses’ balance sheets are in good shape, and surveys show that fewer small businesses see access to credit as a major concern and that there has been an increase in demand for loans from small firms.\nAnother factor behind my forecast is that it appears there will be less fiscal restraint in 2014 and 2015. Specifically, fiscal restraint will still have a negative impact on GDP growth, but it is expected to be smaller for the next few years. The tax hikes that occurred at the beginning of this year won’t be repeated in 2014. Furthermore, under current law, much of the impact of the sequester on government spending occurs in 2013; so, fiscal reductions in the next few years will be smaller, and the negative impact on growth will be less.\nThus, the stage is set for what we economists like to refer to as “virtuous cyclical dynamics.” Continued growth in jobs and income as well as greater confidence in the labor market will lead to higher household spending. As firms see actual demand rising, they have an incentive to expand capacity, undertake previously delayed capital expenditures and increase hiring. This then further improves the well-being of households and continues the self-reinforcing virtuous cycle. One challenge to this self-reinforcing mechanism is that there is a chicken-and-egg problem: Who will start this first? In order to dramatically increase households’ spending, they need more employment and income certainty. To expand businesses’ hiring, they need more customers walking through their doors. Who will first ratchet these spending cycles up to the next level?\nThe process is more likely to get rolling if the economy experiences more positive impetuses and fewer negative jolts. And, indeed, there are a number of downside risks that could produce such jolts. The U.S. fiscal situation has not been fully resolved. It is possible that Congress will enact further belt-tightening measures, which would further depress growth over the next year. Although Europe may finally be in recovery mode, the outlook for growth there is still weak and the level of activity remains substantially below the previous business cycle peak. Furthermore, growth in emerging market economies has slowed. It’s difficult to gauge how structural transformations in China and developments in other emerging markets will affect overall world growth over the next few years. These downside risks take on greater prominence when we consider them in the context of weaker U.S. consumer demand. For most of the past 15 years, the American consumer has been the strongest engine of world growth. However, that American consumer has been knocked down several rungs. In order to speed up the economic recovery across the globe and in the U.S., someone else needs to step up to fill the gap left by reduced American consumer demand. If 2014 U.S. growth comes in at a lackluster pace or worse, I expect that one or more of these downside risk story lines will be the culprit.\n\nInflation Risks Are Low\nWhat about inflation? Providing financial conditions that deliver low and stable inflation is an important part of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. However, recent inflation data have been unusually low and well below our 2 percent long-run objective. Low wage growth and low interest rates are other indicators that confirm our low inflation experience. To many Fed critics, this low inflation environment has been a big surprise.\nLet’s think back about five years. Recall that in December of 2008, we had brought the federal funds rate down to zero, as low as it can go. In November 2008 we had embarked on our first asset purchases, which we then expanded in March 2009 to a $1.75 trillion asset program. When we took these measures, many critics claimed that the U.S. was headed for double-digit inflation. I’m from Chicago, home of the well-known monetarist Milton Friedman. Some of the critics invoked his name when issuing warnings that with this kind of balance-sheet growth, inflation will surely come soon! Actually, a couple of nice folks mailed me worthless $100 trillion Zimbabwe notes to warn me of the inflationary consequences of our policies.\nWhat a difference a few years makes. As I mentioned before, instead of skyrocketing, inflation now stands at 1-1/4 percent, which is 3/4 percentage points below our long-run target of 2 percent. Indeed, it has averaged well below 2 percent since this all began back in 2007. Inflationary expectations have not risen at all. And there are simply no signs of cost pressures building. Most importantly, wage growth has been quite modest and there is no evidence of labor cost pressures. Without rising labor costs, a 1970s-style cycle of price increases cannot be sustained. That would be a set of price increases feeding through to higher wages that then again fuel further price increases, and the wage–price spiral would continue.\nIncidentally, despite what some of the critics have said, this benign outcome for inflation is actually quite consistent with my reading of Milton Friedman’s analysis. The measures of money he associated with inflation were broad measures that include money created by the banking system. The increases in those measures have been much more moderate. One of the big points from his Monetary History of The United States,3 which Friedman wrote with Anna J. Schwartz, was that focusing too much on the size of the Fed’s balance sheet was a bad idea. Indeed, in the early 1930s, the Fed increased the size of its balance sheet quite substantially. But it wasn’t enough. Given the struggles of the banking system, broad measures of money actually declined, leading to deflation. The Fed needed to have increased its balance sheet even more. That’s a lesson we’ve taken to heart this time around.\nInflation falling below our target of 2 percent is costly. If inflation is lower than expected, then debt financing is more burdensome than borrowers expected. Problems of debt overhang become that much worse for the economy. This is a symmetric problem: If inflation is higher than expected, lenders are disadvantaged. So, that is why it is important for the Fed to provide for inflation that averages over time to our 2 percent long-run objective.\nI see us making gradual progress in returning inflation to 2 percent over the next few years. However, in the near term, inflation appears to be held down by some temporary factors, such as the effect of the sequester on Medicare payments and some unusually low readings for some components of the Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index for which prices are measured indirectly. That said, these aren’t a big part of the story. More importantly, as the real economy improves, the large resource gaps we have will close. Sustained over time, this closing of gaps will feed through to higher wage and price growth. Also, inflation expectations are well anchored and above the current inflation rate and, thus, provide another upward pull to prices. However, it could take a long time for us to return to our 2 percent inflation objective, and I will be monitoring our progress closely when making my decision about appropriate monetary policy.\n\nContinued Monetary Policy Accommodation Is Necessary\nThis brings me to an important point about my relatively upbeat projections for both growth and inflation — and returns me to the issues about policy that I opened with here today. These forecasts are based on the assumption that we will continue to provide the economy with substantial monetary policy accommodation. With our traditional instrument for conducting monetary policy, the fed funds rate, effectively at its zero lower bound, this accommodation now takes the form of our forward guidance about what we will do with the funds rate in the future and our open-ended purchases of longer duration assets.\nForward guidance refers to the conditions under which we will begin to raise the fed funds rate that I talked about earlier. Namely, the FOMC has said that the current fed funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than 2-1/2 percent and longer term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. An important feature of this policy is that it holds rates lower for longer than we normally would if the funds rate had not been stuck at zero. We would have liked to lower the funds rate further over the past four-and-a-half years, but we couldn’t. The forward guidance says we will make up for that lost time. In other words, by postponing the time of policy liftoff, the lower path for rates generates an average path that is closer to what would have been selected if lower and negative rates had been possible.\nOur asset purchases of U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) provide additional accommodation by further lowering longer term interest rates. They also serve as an important communication device in reinforcing our forward-guidance commitment to maintaining low interest rates into the future.\nLow interest rates provide a necessary support for economic activity at this stage of the recovery. Think about some of the better fundamentals for the economy that I discussed earlier. Lower mortgage rates have allowed qualifying households to refinance at very favorable rates. And more households are “in the money” for refinancing as lower interest rates help support higher house prices. I continually hear from automakers how low financing rates have helped boost motor vehicle sales, which are getting within shouting distance of their pre-recession levels. On the business side, companies with access to bond markets have been able to restructure into substantially lower cost debt. With lots of cash and lower debt-service burdens, they are well positioned to increase capital spending and hiring when they decide to do so. And even small businesses face a more attractive borrowing environment than they did earlier in the recovery.\nContinued monetary accommodation also is key to my forecast that inflation will gradually return to 2 percent. Part of the effect comes through the reduced resource gaps engendered by higher growth. Part of it also comes through a signal to markets of our commitment to achieving our inflation target of 2 percent. With enough accommodation, monetarist arithmetic will eventually gain traction and inflation will rise to meet our target. But it could take time.\n\nMonetary Policy Is Data Dependent\nAs I noted in the introduction, adjustments to asset purchases and changes in the federal funds rate will depend on the data; we are not on a preset course.\nI do expect, however, that the outlook will materialize in such a way that we’d likely reduce the LSAP rate starting later this year and subsequently wind down these purchases over a couple of stages. For me, to start the wind-down, it will be best to have confidence that the incoming data show that economic growth gained traction during the third quarter of this year and that the transitory factors that we think have held down inflation really do turn out to be transitory. I’d note, too, that the exact pattern of the reduction in purchases that we eventually take isn’t so critical because the path is likely to have only a marginal impact on what is important — the total amount of purchases that we eventually get to. As I mentioned earlier, under my current forecast, total asset purchases since January 2013 would be in the neighborhood of $1.25 trillion. This is a very substantial program — one that is about double the size of our QE2 program that we ran between the fall of 2010 and the summer of 2011.\nFurthermore, when we ultimately end the current purchase program, we won’t be doing anything to reduce the balance sheet. Even though it will no longer be expanding, the balance sheet won’t actually begin to shrink until sometime much later when we make the decision to stop reinvesting maturing assets. Even then, it will only gradually decline as assets mature. As you may recall, Chairman Bernanke announced at his June press conference that it was most likely that the FOMC would simply let the MBS on our books run off and not actively sell them during the period of policy normalization. Accordingly, our expanded balance sheet will be providing accommodation for a long time after we have ceased adding assets to our portfolio.\nSimilarly, our policies with regard to the federal funds rate will depend on the course of the economy. I want to reiterate the point that the Chairman and other members of the Federal Open Market Committee have made recently and that I talked about in the introduction. The unemployment rate hitting 6-1/2 percent will not automatically result in an increase in the federal funds rate. When we cross the 6-1/2 percent unemployment rate mark, we will closely evaluate the available information. When evaluating policy, we will take into account a couple of basic principles. One is that our 2 percent inflation goal is a symmetric target, not a ceiling — we’re shooting for inflation to average 2 percent over the medium term, not for it to go no higher than 2 percent. Since we have averaged well below 2 percent for several years, there is no urgent inflation risk as long as inflation expectations remain anchored near 2 percent. Another principle is that when setting policy, we will take a balanced approach to achieving our dual mandate objectives. These principles will govern our judgment of whether or not it will be appropriate to raise the funds rate when we hit an unemployment rate of 6-1/2 percent.\nSuppose the unemployment rate reached 6-1/2 percent and inflation were 1-1/2 percent. One-and-a-half percent strikes me as much too low relative to our 2 percent target, especially since inflation has been running below 2 percent for quite a long time. I think that in this situation, it would be appropriate to hold the funds rate at zero to get inflation confidently moving back up toward 2 percent. I can easily envision certain circumstances in which the unemployment rate could go below 6 percent before we moved the funds rate up.\n\nConclusion\nAs we move closer to the time when we begin to pare back the flow of additional accommodation and contemplate eventually returning to a more normal monetary policy environment, the need for clear and effective communication is essential. In answer to the question of are we there yet, I decidedly say no. It is not yet time to remove accommodation. I expect our policies to remain highly accommodative for some time to come. My colleagues on the FOMC and I have laid out certain markers that should help gauge the timing of when we will begin to change the stance of policy. When those markers are reached, we will carefully weigh incoming data to determine if we can improve economic activity and bring inflation in at our 2 percent objective.\n\nNotes\n1 The Federal Housing Finance Agency’s (FHFA) Quarterly House Price Purchase-Only Index.is 7.2 percent higher than in the second quarter of 2012.

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you for the invitation to speak to the CFA Society of Iowa this evening. I always look forward to having an opportunity to share my views on the economy and monetary policy. In return, your feedback is of great help to me when shaping my thinking about the economy, and I look forward to hearing your comments and answering your questions at the end of my prepared remarks.\nTonight I’m going to talk about my outlook for the economy. I’ll also explain how monetary policy supports the improvements I expect to see. Before I begin, though, I would like to remind you that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily represent those held by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System.\n\nOutlook: The Pace of Economic Growth Should Accelerate\nLet me begin with my outlook for the economy. Needless to say, the pace of growth coming out of the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009 has been disappointing, and the recovery certainly continues to face important headwinds. Nonetheless, I am cautiously optimistic about the future. An important reason is that I think we have the appropriate monetary policies in place to help the recovery reach escape velocity. So, after rising a disappointing 1-1/2 percent in 2012, real gross domestic product (GDP) should increase in the range of 2-1/2 to 3 percent this year and then grow between 3-1/2 and 4 percent in 2014, according to my forecast. This growth ought to be sufficient to bring the unemployment rate close or maybe even a little below 7 percent by the end of next year.\nThis outlook hinges critically on continuing our current highly accommodative stance for monetary policy. Of course, one aspect of that accommodation is the exceptionally low level of our primary policy tool, the federal funds rate. But there are two other important tools I would like to highlight. One is the open-ended large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs) we currently are undertaking. Each month, we are buying $85 billion of mortgage-backed securities and long-term Treasury securities. These purchases are open-ended, meaning that the program will continue until the FOMC is highly confident that we are seeing a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, which is both a prerequisite to and an indication of a broader, self-sustaining recovery. The second tool is our forward guidance about the fed funds rate—that is, our commitment to leave the rate at essentially zero until adequate progress is made toward economic recovery.\nNow, in one form or another we’ve had a commitment keep the fed funds rates low for some time now. First, the statement used words to say that we thought economic conditions would merit keeping the funds rate exceptionally low “for some time.” Then we switched to giving a calendar date through which we expected it would be appropriate to hold the funds rate at zero. Finally, at the FOMC meeting this past December, we made an important change when we linked the possible timing of the first increase in the funds rate to specific economic conditions. Namely, we committed to keeping rates near zero at least as long as unemployment remains above 6-1/2 percent, provided that inflation projections over the medium term remain less than 2-1/2 percent.\n\nNumerical Thresholds: An Important New Feature of Monetary Policy\nWhy change to this type of conditionality? The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate to foster financial conditions that help the economy achieve maximum employment and price stability. Progress toward our dual mandate goals is measured by the state of economic conditions, not calendar time. So our policy position should also be dependent on economic conditions, rather than a calendar date.\nUnforeseen events always prompt us to reassess and revise our forecasts for economic activity and inflation and hence, the time when we would expect to reach a threshold. In turn, these events should also automatically move the expected date for the liftoff in policy. For example, in my current forecast, I expect the economy will hit the 6-1/2 percent unemployment rate threshold in mid-2015. But suppose we had some pleasant surprises that led the economy to progress faster than I currently expect; well, we would then hit 6-1/2 percent unemployment at an earlier date, and if the inflation outlook was not uncomfortably below 2 percent, we could begin increasing rates. There would be no change in the economic conditions governing the liftoff in rates, only in the timing of when those conditions are met. Accordingly, there also would be no change in how long exceptional monetary accommodation was provided relative to the state of the economy.\nThis last point relates to another important feature of the economic conditionality in our policy. The thresholds for increasing the fed funds rate were chosen so that rates will remain near zero even after the recovery becomes more firmly entrenched. This delay is a feature of what modern macroeconomic theory tells us is the optimal policy response to the extraordinary circumstances we have faced over the past four years. Given the weak state of the economy, we would have liked to take policy rates negative. Of course we can’t do that; so, instead, the federal funds rate has been stuck at zero since December 2008. Because of this constraint, theory says that a central bank should promise that even when economic activity recovers, it will hold rates below what they typically would be for some additional time. This makes up for the period of time when we could not drive rates negative. In other words, by postponing the time of policy liftoff, the average path for rates is closer to being right over time.\n\nEconomic Conditionality in Our Asset Purchases\nLet me return now to the first policy tool I mentioned: our open-ended large-scale asset purchase (LSAP) programs. This is another conditional policy. Originally, our LSAP programs bought predetermined quantities of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities over a fixed period of time. Their aim was to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates by lowering the term premiums. Last September, we began a new program of open-ended asset purchases. The important new aspect of this program is that the length of time over which we will buy assets is tied to economic outcomes. In particular, the purchases will continue until there is substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, subject, of course, to a continued environment of price stability. To me, this means job growth of around 200,000 per month over a six-month period. However, that alone is not sufficient. We also need to see output growth above potential reinforcing that job growth; together, these improvements also ought to lead to a steady decline in the unemployment rate.\n\nPolicies Are Working\nToday, we are seeing evidence that our accommodative policies are working. Financial markets recognize that low returns on the safest fixed-income assets are an economic reality that will continue for a long time. Not being satisfied with these low returns, investors are repositioning into other asset classes that will more directly bolster spending. The stock market has rebounded significantly and is back near its pre-recessionary level. In an encouraging development, commercial and industrial lending by banks is picking up while their credit terms, which had been quite restrictive during the recession, are easing. Indeed, from a variety of sources, markets are increasingly channeling money to promising projects that had previously lacked funding.\nAccommodative monetary policies also are supporting some more-familiar cyclical recovery mechanisms that lead to a virtuous cycle of growth in economic activity. Although bottlenecks certainly remain for many households (particularly those whose home mortgages are under water or those that have imperfect credit scores), low mortgage rates have facilitated a pickup in refinancing and a slow but steady rise in new residential construction. Some further increase in demand will spill over from the improvement in housing markets, coming in the form of higher demand for construction materials and appliances. Furthermore, for years now, consumers and businesses have made do with old household durable goods and capital equipment, and there likely is much pent-up demand for replacing such items with new ones. Low interest rates are helping to support some pickup in this demand to replace old items; for example, I’ve heard from several carmakers how low-interest financing has contributed to an improvement in auto sales.\nIn general, low rates have helped many households and businesses pare debt burdens and restructure their balance sheets. This has particularly been true for businesses with access to the bond market. And so today many firms have plenty of cash on hand and are well-positioned to ramp up activity when more and more customers show up at their doors.\nNow, all investment projects carry some degree of risk. And so, by their very nature, increased lending and investment activity entail some economic players taking on greater risk profiles. But this is not a bad thing per se. In fact, it’s a normal channel through which accommodative monetary policy encourages better growth during a recovery from a period of economic weakness. And I believe what we are seeing today is such a restoration of a more balanced approach to risk-taking after an extended period during which a heightened sense of precaution meant that many promising ventures were left unfunded.\nOf course, there is no easy way to measure when markets are underpricing risk or when such mis-valuation poses a meaningful threat to financial stability. To date, concerns about a degree of froth in the financial markets that would pose a significant risk at the macroeconomic level seem to me to be largely speculative. However, one result of the financial crisis is that we at the Federal Reserve are much more attuned to monitoring financial markets, risk pricing and potential stress points in the financial system. We will continue to monitor the situation closely. Indeed, with the work being done by the new Office of Financial Stability Policy and Research (OFSPR) at the Board of Governors and the increased efforts by the regional Reserve Banks, the Fed is devoting significantly more resources to assessing financial conditions. I would note that if we do find significant stresses, the Fed has a number of macroprudential tools, such as supervisory approval of capital plans, to shore up potential sources of weakness by using a targeted approach. And I would favor the use of these tools when and where they are appropriate.\n\nRestraints on Growth\nAs I weigh the most recent data, I believe that there are many reasons to be optimistic. Nevertheless, I am mindful of the significant risks to the outlook that remain, emanating from both here and abroad.\nDomestically, although the immediate threats from the turn-of-the-year fiscal cliff were avoided, there still are many issues to resolve regarding the course of government spending and tax policy. The present projected path for federal debt is not sustainable and needs to be addressed. But this should be done carefully over time, and not front-loaded on an economy that is less than robust. Current estimates of the economic drag in 2013 coming from fiscal consolidation without the sequester are on the order of 1 percent, and I am concerned about the risk that Washington might jam the recovery at the line of scrimmage by piling some more unhelpful near-term fiscal restraint on top of this already sizable effect.\nOverseas, our trading partners confront their own economic and financial difficulties. The eurozone currently is in recession, and the most recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts look for only modest growth during 2013 as a whole.1 While Europe has made strides in reducing immediate financial tail risks, other downside risks remain. The eurozone’s peripheral countries must still overcome the fundamental problem of their lack of competitiveness. To do so while remaining in the common currency zone of the euro requires difficult and painful adjustments. Much hard work has been done, but there is more to go.\nIn Asia, growth in China appears to be gaining momentum after slowing down somewhat last year. But analysts are not forecasting a return to the heady double-digit growth rates China experienced a few years ago. Furthermore, emerging market and other export-oriented economies can’t be counting on a huge rebound in demand from the advanced economies of the world. Notably, the U.S. consumer is no longer in a position to be the engine of world growth. The demands of reducing high levels of federal government debt while also providing funding for future retirees will require lower consumption. Consequently, foreign economies that currently are largely export-driven will need to find more internal sources of growth.\n\nInflation Risks Are Low\nI’ve spent a lot of time this evening talking about economic growth and monetary policy. But I have barely mentioned inflation. I assure you that this is not because I think inflation is unimportant. On the contrary, as a central banker, I am committed to our goal of price stability, and so I evaluate the outlook for inflation carefully in gauging monetary policy. That is why I see the 2-1/2 percent inflation threshold in our forward guidance as an appropriate safeguard against the possibility that our current policies might generate unwanted inflation.\nHowever, I see high inflation as quite unlikely under the unusual circumstances we face. Currently, inflation is running a bit below 1-1/2 percent. This needs to be measured against the FOMC target for inflation of 2 percent.2 I expect inflation to move up some with the improvements in the real economy, but I also see a risk that it will remain below 2 percent for the next several years. There are no cost pressures to speak of. In particular, wage growth and increases in unit labor costs have been quite modest. And inflation expectations have remained well anchored—if anything, they are helping prevent inflation from falling even further below our 2 percent target.\nThis subdued outlook for inflation means that as economic growth improves, we are likely to hit our unemployment threshold before we hit our inflation threshold. This returns me to an important point I alluded to earlier: Our contingent policy does not mean that once we see unemployment below 6-1/2 percent, we will automatically begin to raise short term rates. Six-and-a-half percent is a threshold and not a trigger. It also is above the 5-1/4 or 5-1/2 percent rate that I think is the long-term equilibrium rate of unemployment. Generally, because of the time it takes for policy to affect the economy, we would want to begin to remove accommodation before we reached 5-1/2 percent unemployment. So 6-1/2 percent probably would be a good spot. But suppose we reach that threshold and the outlook for inflation is uncomfortably below 2 percent. Then I believe that it would still be appropriate to keep the funds rate at an exceptionally low level. The extra accommodation would serve two purposes—enabling further reductions in the unemployment rate more quickly and restoring inflation to our longer-run target.\n\nConclusion\nI am optimistic that we have appropriate policies in place to help the economy achieve escape velocity by 2014. Even so, there remain plenty of headwinds and downside risks that can impede our progress. Our numerical thresholds go a long way in lessening policy uncertainty. Households and businesses can now base their spending decisions on clearer information about how long interest rates will remain at their current low levels. But we need to be careful not to undermine our own policies and remove accommodation prematurely, as the Japanese did. It is the specter of repeating the Japanese experience that now keeps me up at night. Mindful of this danger, we must guard against complacency and not deviate in our approach.\n\nNotes\n1 The International Monetary Fund forecast is for the eurozone’s GDP to increase 0.5 percent between 2012:Q4 and 2013:Q4; this follows an estimated 0.7 percent decline in output over the four quarters of 2012. See International Monetary Fund, 2013, World Economic Outlook Update, Washington, DC, January 23, available online.\n2 The Committee judges that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate.",

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you for that kind introduction. I’m delighted to be here in Hong Kong tonight to offer my perspective on challenges facing the global economy and some insights into U.S. monetary policy. And I look forward to hearing from you during our question-and-answer period.\n  Before I begin, let me say that the views I express here are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System.\n  Recently, the FOMC has made significant changes in its communications by providing economic guidelines for the conduct of future monetary policy. This is part of a larger strategy intended to make monetary policy more transparent and predictable to the public — which we feel can increase the efficacy of our efforts to achieve our dual mandate goals of price stability and maximum sustainable employment. In the current setting, such efforts have meant maintaining a highly accommodative monetary policy well after the end of the financial crisis and steep recession. We have had to do so because the economic recovery has been quite modest by any standard and because we continue to face numerous near-term obstacles to growth.\n  Before discussing the U.S. monetary policy situation in more detail, I’d like to mention some longer-run challenges facing the U.S. and many other advanced economies throughout the world, with an eye on their implications for the medium-term economic outlook.\n\nLong-Run Issues Facing the U.S. and Other Advanced Economies and Their Implications for the Economic Outlook\nThese issues revolve around demands on the United States’ fiscal resources. At the risk of oversimplifying, I would say that the situation seems to be characterized by three important features. First, the current level of federal government debt to gross domestic product (GDP) in the U.S. is about 70 percent and quite high by our historical standards .[1] Second, we face a critical driver that, if unaddressed, points to higher debt in the future — this is the need to fund and deliver large benefits to an increasingly aging population. Third, the recent downturn and prolonged period of high unemployment have complicated the formulation of policies aimed at adjusting to a new sustainable fiscal path.\n  As a result, no matter how our fiscal problems are resolved, the U.S. consumer is no longer in a position to be the engine of world growth. Funding the future requirements of retired workers likely will require increases in personal saving or government taxation at some point in the not-too-distant future.\n  Furthermore, over the near term, many U.S. households will continue to be challenged by a debt overhang and large losses of wealth that were incurred during the financial crisis. Together, these factors point to lower rates of personal consumption in the United States. Moreover, many advanced economies face their own fiscal imbalances and unfavorable demographics that also will likely weigh on total world consumption. This means that emerging markets, faced with reduced aggregate demand from many of their trading partners, will need to endorse policies that encourage domestic consumption and demand. Making that transition will be challenging.\n  Another important point I want to emphasize is that timing matters. The United States must consolidate its public sector finances; but it must do so gradually if we are to avoid further economic turmoil or another downturn. And looking beyond the U.S. experience, I see that economic growth is already weak in many advanced economies throughout the world. Indeed, Europe is in a recession. And fiscal policy in several European countries is currently restrictive. Certainly, progress needs to be made on reducing outsized deficits. But too much austerity too soon could be very damaging to near- and medium-term growth. Abrupt moves to increase taxes or lower government spending when the economy is already weak could have an amplifying effect on reducing real growth. Indeed, such fiscal moves could cause longer-lasting damage if they result in lower growth in the physical productive capital stock and even more time out of work for the long-term unemployed, whose job skills would be further eroded.\n  Of course, all of the long-term challenges we face become easier to meet if we can increase the underlying growth potential of our economies. Many public policy choices are relevant here. In the United States, we can improve our educational system, leading to a more productive work force. In the European periphery, economic liberalization, particularly of labor markets, can produce a more efficient allocation of resources and increased potential. And in all countries, smart regulation, efficient tax codes and support for free international trade can increase productive capacities.\n\nEconomic Outlook: A Modest Recovery and Contained Inflation\nLet me now turn to monetary policy in the United States. When making their projections in early December, FOMC participants projected real GDP growth in 2013 to be moderately higher than in 2012, but still only modestly above potential. Such growth would likely generate only a small decline in the unemployment rate from its current level of 7.8 percent. Against this backdrop of modest growth and still elevated unemployment, most FOMC participants expected inflation to run a bit under the FOMC’s stated goal of 2 percent. And though I can only speak for the Chicago Fed, based on what we have seen so far, it does not appear that the effects of fiscal policy on growth this year will be much different from when we made our forecast in December.\n\nRecent Monetary Policy Actions\nOrdinarily, the normal monetary policy response to high unemployment and contained inflation would be to reduce short-term nominal interest rates. However, the federal funds rate, which is the short-term rate the FOMC targets, is for all practical purposes already set as low as feasible. Consequently, nontraditional means of providing additional monetary policy accommodation must be used. And we certainly have used them.\n  First, there were our large-scale asset purchase programs with pre-announced purchase amounts. These programs bought predetermined quantities of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities over a fixed period of time. Their aim was to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and help make broader financial conditions more accommodative, thereby stimulating business and household spending. Last September, we began a new program of open-ended asset purchases. The important new aspect of this program is that the length of time over which we will buy assets is tied to economic outcomes. In particular, the purchases will continue until there is substantial improvement in labor markets, subject, of course, to a continued environment of price stability.\n  Another unconventional tool we’ve used is to provide forward guidance on how long the federal funds rate is expected to remain near zero. Beginning in August 2011, this was in the form of a calendar date. Then, last September, the FOMC added its intent to maintain a highly accommodative stance after the economic recovery strengthens. And just last month, we changed from using a calendar date to indicating that the federal funds rate is anticipated to remain at its current levels at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-½ percent, inflation in the medium term is projected to be no more than 2-½ percent and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. We also noted that when the FOMC does begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.\n  These policy adjustments have been particularly innovative and require careful explanation. Why should policy remain accommodative even after we have a stronger recovery? The delay is a feature of what modern macroeconomic theory tells us is the optimal policy response to the extraordinary circumstances we have faced over the past four years.[2] Because short-term rates are constrained by the zero lower bound, modern theory says a central bank should promise that once economic activity recovers, it will for a time hold rates below what they typically would be. This makes up for the period when it was constrained from taking rates negative. In other words, the average path for rates is closer to being right over time.\n  Why tie the open-ended asset purchases and the funds rate liftoff to specific economic conditions? Well, doing this clarifies how our policy decisions are conditional on making adequate progress toward our dual mandate goals — which is measured by economic conditions, not calendar time. Indeed, because we cannot foresee all of the developments affecting the outlook, we simply can’t commit firmly to a date when those economic conditions will be achieved. And, of course, some may still interpret a far-distant date for the policy liftoff as a forecast that economic conditions will remain poor for a long time, rather than an intention to keep rates near zero even after the recovery is firmly entrenched.\n  I also would note that the 2-½ percent inflation threshold is not a restatement of our long-run inflation goal — that goal is still 2 percent. The slightly higher threshold value simply captures how our symmetric view of that long-run goal allows for inflation at times to run modestly above 2 percent.\n  Given more explicit conditionality, markets can be more confident that we will provide the monetary accommodation necessary to close the large resource gaps that currently exist. Additionally, the public can be more certain that we will not wait too long to tighten if inflation were to become a substantial concern. More explicit forward guidance provides additional accommodation by reducing longer-term interest rates through a lower expected path for short-term rates. Also, clarifying conditionalities can help households and businesses better plan for the future, and so boost the effectiveness of our current policies by reducing risk premia.\n\nConclusion\nTo conclude, I believe that the U.S. and other advanced economies are facing significant long-term challenges in credibly controlling future debt levels. At the same time, we are also confronting the immediate challenge of not imposing too much austerity on our fragile economies. Clearly our fiscal authorities must find the appropriate balance between meeting these two challenges. As almost everyone agrees, this implies putting in place policies that slowly but surely bring the prospects of future revenues into balance with future spending.\n  Under this scenario, monetary policy has an important contribution to make. It should provide financial conditions that help produce the most robust demand growth we reasonably can achieve, with appropriate measures in place to safeguard price stability. As I’ve explained, the FOMC has recently taken important steps in this direction. And I believe that such steps can help provide the stimulus to growth that can benefit our future well-being in the United States and around the world.\n  Thank you.\n\nNotes\n[1] The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that at the end of fiscal year 2012 the ratio of federal debt held by the public to GDP was 72.8 percent.\n[2] See, for instance, Reifschneider and Willams (2000), Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) and Werning (2011).\n\nReferences\nReifschneider, David, and John C.

            "content": "Introduction\nI would like to thank National Council on Teacher Retirement for inviting me to speak this afternoon. It’s always refreshing to reach directly into the communities in our District to gain valuable personal insights into what is going on in the economy and pick up information that sometimes get missed in dry reports and statistics. Opportunities such as this also give me a chance to talk to you about the state of the economy, the progress we have seen in repairing the damage from the Great Recession, and how Federal Reserve policy fits into the picture.\n  Of course, to gauge progress, we must measure economic performance. It’s natural for us at the Federal Reserve to do so against the objectives that Congress has set out for us — what are known as the Fed’s dual mandate. Namely, the Federal Reserve is charged with fostering financial conditions consistent with full employment and price stability.\n  Needless to say, the past seven years have been very challenging and we have struggled to achieve both our employment and inflation objectives. To accomplish our goals, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) cut its traditional policy tool, the target federal funds rate, essentially to zero — what economists refer to as its zero lower bound, or ZLB. And when achieving the dual mandate called for additional monetary policy accommodation, the FOMC turned to other less conventional approaches, such as large-scale asset purchase programs — what many of you have heard referred to as “QE,” or quantitative easing — and forward guidance about how long the fed funds rate is likely to remain near zero. I believe these efforts have been very beneficial in helping the economy make significant progress and bringing us back closer to our policy goals.\n  Today, with economic conditions much improved, many people are asking when Fed policy will return to normal. That is an excellent question. So in my remarks this afternoon. I will discuss my outlook for the economy and how that outlook and the risks around it shape my views about the appropriate timing and pace of eventual policy normalization.\n  In particular, I expect that there will be further improvements in economic activity over the next three years and that these will be accompanied by additional declines in the unemployment rate toward more normal levels. At the same time, I expect inflation to rise gradually toward the FOMC’s 2 percent target.\n  These forecasts are predicated on maintaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for a considerable time. Indeed, given our recent experience, I feel that before the Fed raises rates, we should have a great deal of confidence that we won’t be forced to backtrack on our moves and face another painful period at the ZLB. And once we start, at least initially, we should raise rates slowly to make sure the economy can weather less accommodative financial conditions. In sum, we should be exceptionally patient in adjusting the stance of U.S. monetary policy — even to the point of allowing a modest overshooting of our inflation target to appropriately balance the risks to our policy objectives.\n  Before I expand on these thoughts, let me note that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the FOMC or within the Federal Reserve System.\n\nOutlook\nImproving Growth but Slack Remains\nAfter many years of false starts, the economy now seems to be in the midst of more sustained solid growth. My forecast is that real gross domestic product (GDP) will increase at an average rate of about 3 percent over the next year and half.\n  The incoming data support this outlook. In the second quarter, consumer spending grew at a solid but unspectacular 2-1/2 percent pace, and it appears to have risen at roughly the same rate during the third quarter. The news from the business sector generally has been good. Reports from our business contacts have been improving for some months and are now almost uniformly positive. Underscoring this more positive sentiment, the data on new orders and shipments of machinery and other capital goods have been increasing at a good clip and surveys of business purchasing managers point to growth in both the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sectors.\n  However, there are still some sectors — such as single-family housing markets — that continue to struggle. Starts of new single family houses are only about half of the way back to where they were even before the housing boom. In part, the weakness here reflects continued fallout from the financial crisis, as it is still the case that mortgage credit is hard to come by for those without the most pristine credit ratings.\n  So what does this economic outlook mean for the achievement of the Fed’s dual mandate objectives?\n  Underutilization in the Labor Market\nLet’s consider labor markets first.\n  Output growth is key for producing healthier labor market conditions. Although the economic recovery generally has been weak, there has been enough cumulative progress to generate considerable improvement in the labor market. So where do we stand today? How much further do we have to go to fulfill our employment mandate?\n  We can point to several measures to mark the progress we have made to date. Employment has been growing over 200,000 per month for quite some time. With expanding employment, the unemployment rate has fallen relatively rapidly. In fact, now standing at 5.9 percent, the unemployment rate has fallen about 4 percentage points from its high — and a full percentage point over the last year. Other measures of labor market health also suggest significant improvements: Notably, layoff rates are low and job opening rates are back to their pre-recession levels.\n  But we still aren’t back to full labor market health. Our 5.9 percent unemployment rate remains above what most people think of as its long-run neutral level. For example, according to the central tendency in the FOMC’s latest Summary of Economic Projections,1 the estimate of the neutral unemployment rate is between 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, with my own judgment at the bottom of this range. This leaves a significant gap between our goal and current conditions.\n  Moreover, the labor force participation rate has dropped a good deal. Most of the decline in labor force participation since 2000 is due to factors such as baby boomers moving into retirement age and long-running reductions in male and teenage labor force participation. These developments are structural in nature, and as such monetary policy is not the appropriate policy tool to address them. Nonetheless, the labor force participation rate has fallen somewhat more than what would be expected given these structural trends. The rate is also lower than what would be expected from its historical relationship with the unemployment rate. Other indicators — such as long-term unemployment, the rate of involuntary part time work and the job finding rate — also point to more slack in labor markets than that indicated by the unemployment rate alone.\n  In addition, it is hard to imagine a robust labor market without solid growth in wages. With productivity growth of around 1 to 2 percent and an inflation target of around 2 percent, we should be seeing wages and benefits rising at around a 3 to 4 percent rate. But that is clearly not the case. Although some in-demand occupations may be experiencing stronger wage growth, overall compensation growth has been around 2 percent over the past six years. Taken altogether, these and other measures lead me to conclude that there remains significant underutilization of labor resources — and likely somewhat more slack than what is indicated by the unemployment rate alone. So, while good progress has been made, we have yet to achieve our full-employment goal.\n  Too-Low Inflation\nThe other element of our dual mandate is stable prices. The Fed defines its target as 2 percent inflation over the medium term, with inflation being measured as the rate of change in the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index. Earlier in the year, the inflation rate had been well below that target, at 1-1/4 percent. It has moved up a little since then, but inflation is still only 1-1/2 percent, still leaving a significant gap from our 2 percent target.\n  Of course, there are alternative measures of inflation, such as the widely reported Consumer Price Index (CPI). The FOMC has set its inflation target in terms of the PCE Price index because relative to the CPI it covers a wider range of items that households consume and because it better adjusts for changes in the spending patterns of households. The CPI inflation is currently around 2 percent. But CPI inflation generally runs three to five tenths of a percentage point higher than PCE inflation, and so the CPI’s performance should be measured against a higher inflation objective, such as 2-1/2 percent. So, an inflation gap remains for the CPI as well.\n  Looking ahead, I am concerned about the possibility that inflation will not return to our 2 percent PCE target within a reasonable period of time. First, the recent monthly inflation numbers have been low, so there is not much upward momentum. Second, as I mentioned earlier, wage growth has been relatively low for some time. While wages don’t predict future inflation, the two often move together. And, third, it does not appear as if inflationary expectations are exerting much of an upward pull on actual inflation at the moment.\n  That said, I expect inflation to rise slowly over the next three years toward the FOMC’s 2 percent target. And as I mentioned earlier, I am expecting further improvements in economic activity, with real GDP growing at around 3 percent over the next 18 months and the unemployment rate declining further to a little over 5 percent by the end of 2016 — in line with what I think is its long-run neutral level. So I do see us getting back close to our policy goals over the next two to three years.\n\nA Balanced Approach to Monetary Policy\nIt is important for me to say that this forecast is predicated on the assumption that the FOMC takes a very patient approach to reducing policy accommodation — that is, we will be patient about when we first increase the federal funds rate and be patient about setting the pace of rate increases once we have begun to move. Let me elaborate on why I think this is appropriate.\n  I see two important and divergent ways my forecast could go wrong. One is that I may be overestimating the underlying strength in the real economy, so that a successful and sustained exit from the ZLB may be more difficult than I currently believe. Guarding against this risk calls for slower removal of accommodation. The second is that I may be wrong about the inflation outlook, and we could be poised for a much larger rise in inflation than I am forecasting. This risk calls for more aggressive rate hikes.\n  How do I think policy should balance these divergent risks? How should they affect the FOMC’s strategy of pursuing a balanced approach to achieving our policy goals?\n  Proceed Cautiously in Normalizing Policy\nThe first factor entering my analysis is that I see a number of downside risks to the growth and inflation forecasts.\n  For instance, as I look around the globe, I see many economies facing slow growth and low inflation. Europe and Japan are well-known cases among the advanced economies. Of course, slow or stagnant growth in advanced countries has negative spillovers onto emerging markets that are highly dependent on exports for their growth. Indeed, today China is confronting slower growth, and the Brazilian economy has fallen into recession.\n  For the United States, slower growth abroad reduces demand for our exports and, with it, U.S. production. In addition, weakness abroad could translate into a higher exchange value for the dollar against other currencies, further reducing net exports. A higher dollar also would result in lower prices for imports, which, in turn would hold down inflation and delay progress toward our 2 percent inflation target.\n  While the risks to the U.S. outlook emanating from abroad are worthy of notice, they are not the biggest thing on my mind. For me, the biggest and costliest downside risk is that in our haste to get back to “business as usual” monetary policy, we could stall progress and backtrack to the economic circumstances of recent years — an economy mired in the ZLB.\n  To say the least, conducting monetary policy at the ZLB has been a difficult experience that we all want to avoid repeating unnecessarily. In the winter of 2009, with the unemployment rate soaring to double digits, the Fed would have very much liked to lower the nominal federal funds rate an additional 300 basis points; but we couldn’t because the rate was already at zero.\n  Faced with a pressing need to provide additional accommodation, we were forced to turn to innovative, but controversial, unconventional monetary policies. These policies have been extremely helpful. But there is no denying that they were second-best options; the ZLB had made lowering the fed funds rate, which is our first-best interest rate tool, infeasible.\n  Everyone will welcome a return to more normal times and a reliance on the traditional policy framework of adjustments to the federal funds rate. But the decision about when to begin to raise rates shouldn’t be made prematurely. Rather, the decision for policy liftoff has to be made for the right reasons — that is, it should be dictated by economic conditions.\n  Like my colleague Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota,2 I think that policy at all times must be goal-oriented. Our experiences since the crisis began and current economic conditions are highly unusual. The FOMC should not simply set its policy instruments by mechanically aligning them with historical norms if those norms are not currently relevant for the conditions needed to attain both of our dual mandate goals. Rather, our policy instruments should be set to achieve our ultimate goals as efficaciously as possible given current and prospective economic conditions, all the while with an eye on managing against important risks to the outlook.\n  I believe that the biggest risk we face today is prematurely engineering restrictive monetary conditions. In this scenario, the FOMC could misjudge the presence and magnitude of economic impediments and misread the recent progress we have made as evidence of sounder economic trends. If we were to presume prematurely that the U.S. economy has returned to a more business-as-usual position and reduce monetary accommodation too soon, we could find ourselves in the very uncomfortable position of falling back into the ZLB environment. Such an outcome could be a serious setback to the timely attainment of our dual mandate policy objectives.\n  This risk consideration means that the decision to lift the funds rate from zero should be made only when we have a great deal of confidence that growth has enough momentum to reach full employment and that inflation will return to a sustainable 2 percent rate. We should also proceed cautiously and keep the path of rate increases relatively shallow for some time after we begin to raise rates. This approach will allow us time to assess how the economy is performing under less accommodative financial conditions and reduce the odds of overaggressive rate hikes choking off progress toward our policy goals.\n  History Shows That Premature Exit Is a Risk\nPast experience with the ZLB also counsels this strategy. History has not looked kindly on attempts to prematurely remove monetary accommodation from economies that are in or near a liquidity trap. Three occasions come readily to mind: the Great Depression (which was resolved only with the massive fiscal expansion of World War II), Japan over the past 20 years, and the recent European experience. Indeed, both of the more recent episodes are ongoing today, though Japan finally appears to be making important headway toward raising inflation and eventually exiting the ZLB.\n  The U.S., Japanese and European lessons from monetary history strongly suggest that there are great risks to premature liftoff from the ZLB or near-ZLB conditions. Unless the economy is fundamentally strong and the previous impediments to growth have receded sufficiently, the odds remain high that some unforeseen shock could cause the monetary authority to retreat right back into the ZLB.\n  And the costs of being mired in the ZLB are simply very large. The ZLB prevents using our very best policy tools to address negative shocks. The ZLB means that interest rates cannot fall low enough to equate the supply of saving with the demand for investment, which, of course, significantly impedes capital formation, future economic growth, and the health of labor markets. And the ZLB often comes hand in hand with undesirably low inflation or even a falling price level, carrying with it the associated costs of debt deflation on the real economy.\n  The Risk of Too-High Inflation\nWhat about the other risk to our policy goals that I mentioned — the risk that the U.S. economy could face pricing pressures that accelerate rapidly and ultimately leave inflation far above our 2 percent target for an unacceptably long period?\n  At some point, when the economy has clearly overcome the remaining impediments from the largest economic and financial downturn since the Great Depression, the odds of inflation rising noticeably above target could become palpable. But such a breakout is just not at all very likely today. Indeed, many Fed critics have been voicing this concern since 2009, and it hasn’t even come close to happening.\nWhat if inflation just ran moderately above target for some time? Well, I see the costs of this outcome as clearly being much smaller than the costs of falling back into the ZLB. First, I believe the U.S. economy could weather the modest increases in interest rates that would be needed to keep inflation in check. Such rate increases would be manageable for the real economy; this is particularly true if industry and labor markets have already made the most difficult reallocations of jobs and overcome other factors so that productive resources are more efficiently and fully employed. Second, as I’ve noted many times in the past, a symmetric inflation target means we should be averaging 2 percent inflation over time. We’ve averaged well under that 2 percent mark for the past six and a half years. With a symmetric inflation target, one could imagine moderately above-target inflation for a limited time as simply the flip side of our recent inflation experience — and hardly an event that would impose great costs on the economy.\n  The murky state of inflation expectations is another factor that enters my risk-management considerations. For inflation to take off rapidly, we would have to see a jump in inflationary expectations. But inflationary expectations certainly have not taken off. Indeed, we may be facing a quite different problem.\n  Many forecasters — myself included — assume that stable 2 percent inflation expectations will be an important factor helping to pull actual inflation up. Over the past five years, professional forecasters’ projections for long-run inflation have been at the 2 percent target and the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) break-evens generally have been flat. Yet actual inflation has only just recently made it back up to 1-1/2 percent. Moreover, we still have not seen much at all in the way of higher inflation compensation being built into interest rates or wages. So there is cause for concern that expectations might not produce as strong a pull on inflation as we hope. This unusual situation has precedent, for example, in Japan, where inflation expectations have remained stable, while inflation itself has lagged for a prolonged period. Of course, there is a risk, too, that inflation expectations themselves could fall—indeed, I would note that longer-dated TIPS break-evens have recently dropped to the lower end of their post-crisis range.\n\nConclusion\nAs I think about the process of normalizing policy, I conclude that today’s risk-management calculus says we should err on the side of patience in removing highly accommodative policy. We need to solidify our confidence that our ultimate exit from the ZLB will occur smoothly — and that our escape can be sustained. A corollary to this conclusion is that we should not shy away from policy prescriptions that imply forecasts of inflation that moderately overshoot our 2 percent target for a limited time.\nSuch a policy strategy more properly balances expected costs and benefits. And it would leave me with much more confidence that inflation will not stall out below target once we start raising rates.\nI agree with Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart in thinking that we ought to be \"whites of their eyes\" inflation fighters.3 The last thing we want to do is regress back into the ZLB. Indeed, such a relapse would be a sign there was something else going on that was preventing the economy from being as vibrant as we thought possible.\nTo summarize, I am very uncomfortable with calls to raise our policy rate sooner than later. I favor delaying liftoff until I am more certain that we have sufficient momentum in place toward our policy goals. And I think we should plan for our path of policy rate increases to be shallow in order to be sure that the economy’s momentum is sustainable in the presence of less accommodative financial conditions. I look forward to the day when we can return to business-as-usual monetary policy, but that time has not yet arrived.\n\nNotes\n1Federal Open Market Committee (2014).\n2See, for example, Kocherlakota (2013).\n3Lockhart (2014).\n\nReferences\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2014, Summary of Economic Projections, Washington, DC, September 17.\nKocherlakota, Narayana, 2013, “A time of testing,” speech, St. Paul Chamber of Commerce, St. Paul, MN, November 12.\nLockhart, Dennis, 2014, “Thoughts on liftoff,” speech, Global Interdependence Center, Sixth Annual Rocky Mountain Economic Summit, Jackson Hole, WY, July 11.",

My forecast is that real gross domestic product (GDP) will increase at an average rate of about 3 percent over the next year and half.\nThe incoming data support this outlook. In the second quarter, consumer spending grew at a solid but unspectacular 2-1/2 percent pace, and it appears to have risen at roughly the same rate during the third quarter. The news from the business sector generally has been good. Reports from our business contacts have been improving for some months and are now almost uniformly positive.

Starts of new single family houses are only about half of the way back to where they were even before the housing boom. In part, the weakness here reflects continued fallout from the financial crisis, as it is still the case that mortgage credit is hard to come by for those without the most pristine credit ratings.\nSo what does this economic outlook mean for the achievement of the Fed’s dual mandate objectives?\nUnderutilization in the Labor Market\nLet’s consider labor markets first.\nOutput growth is key for producing healthier labor market conditions. Although the economic recovery generally has been weak, there has been enough cumulative progress to generate considerable improvement in the labor market. So where do we stand today? How much further do we have to go to fulfill our employment mandate?\nWe can point to several measures to mark the progress we have made to date. Employment has been growing over 200,000 per month for quite some time. With expanding employment, the unemployment rate has fallen relatively rapidly. In fact, now standing at 5.9 percent, the unemployment rate has fallen about 4 percentage points from its high — and a full percentage point over the last year. Other measures of labor market health also suggest significant improvements: Notably, layoff rates are low and job opening rates are back to their pre-recession levels.\nBut we still aren’t back to full labor market health. At 5.9 percent, the unemployment rate remains above what most people think of as its long-run neutral level. For example, according to the central tendency in the FOMC’s latest Summary of Economic Projections,1 the estimate of the neutral unemployment rate is between 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, with my own judgment at the bottom of this range. This leaves a significant gap between our goal and current conditions.\nMoreover, the labor force participation rate has dropped a good deal. Most of the decline in labor force participation since 2000 is due to demographic trends, such as baby boomers moving into retirement age, and long-running trends, such as reductions in male and teenage labor force participation. These trends are structural in nature, and monetary policy is not the appropriate policy tool to address them. Nonetheless, the labor force participation rate has fallen somewhat more than what would be expected given these structural trends. And it is also lower than what would be expected from its historical relationship with the unemployment rate. Other indicators — such as long-term unemployment, the rate of involuntary part time work, and the job finding rate — also point to more slack in labor markets than that indicated by the unemployment rate alone.\nIn addition, it is hard to imagine a robust labor market without solid growth in wages. With productivity growth of around 1 to 2 percent and an inflation target of around 2 percent, we should be seeing wages and benefits rising at around a 3 to 4 percent rate. But that is clearly not the case. Although some in-demand occupations may be experiencing stronger wage growth, overall compensation growth has been around 2 percent over the past six years. Taken altogether, these and other measures lead me to conclude that there remains significant underutilization of labor resources — and likely somewhat more slack than what is indicated by the unemployment rate alone. So, while good progress has been made, we have yet to achieve our full-employment goal.\nToo-Low Inflation\nThe other element of our dual mandate is stable prices. The Fed defines its target as 2 percent inflation over the medium term, with inflation being measured as the rate of change in the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index. Earlier in the year, the inflation rate had been well below that target, at 1-1/4 percent. It has moved up a little since then, but inflation is still only 1-1/2 percent, still leaving a significant gap from our 2 percent target.\nOf course, there are alternative measures of inflation, such as the widely reported Consumer Price Index (CPI). The FOMC has set its inflation target in terms of the PCE Price index because relative to the CPI it covers a wider range of items that households consume and because it better adjusts for changes in the spending patterns of households. CPI inflation is currently around 2 percent. But CPI inflation generally runs three to five tenths of a percentage point higher than PCE inflation, and so the CPI’s performance should be measured against a higher inflation objective, such as 2-1/2 percent. So, an inflation gap remains for the CPI as well.\nLooking ahead, I am concerned about the possibility that inflation will not return to our 2 percent target within a reasonable period of time. First, recent monthly inflation numbers have been low, so there is not much upward momentum. Second, as I mentioned earlier, wage growth has been relatively low for some time. While wages don’t predict future inflation, the two often move together. So the subpar growth in wages we see today is consistent with continued subdued inflation. And, third, it does not appear as if inflationary expectations are exerting much of an upward pull on actual inflation at the moment.\nThat said, I expect inflation to rise slowly over the next three years toward the FOMC’s 2 percent target. And as I mentioned earlier, I am expecting further improvements in economic activity, with real GDP growing at around 3 percent over the next 18 months and the unemployment rate declining further to a little over 5 percent by the end of 2016 — in line with what I think is its long-run neutral level. So I do see us getting back close to our policy goals over the next two to three years.\n\nA Balanced Approach to Monetary Policy\nIt is important for me to say that this forecast is predicated on the assumption that the FOMC takes a very patient approach to reducing policy accommodation. Let me elaborate on why I think this is appropriate.\nI see two important and divergent ways my forecast could go wrong. One is that I may be overestimating the underlying strength in the real economy, so that a successful and sustained exit from the ZLB may be more difficult than I currently believe. Guarding against this risk calls for a more patient removal of accommodation. The second is that I may be wrong about the inflation outlook, and we could be poised for a much larger rise in inflation than I am forecasting. This risk calls for more aggressive rate hikes.\nHow do I think policy should balance these divergent risks? How should they affect the FOMC’s strategy of pursuing a balanced approach to achieving our policy goals?\nIn my mind, current circumstances and a weighing of alternative risks mean that a balanced policy approach calls for being extraordinarily patient in reducing accommodation — that is, being patient about when we first increase the federal funds rate and being patient about setting the pace of rate increases once we have begun to move.\nProceed Cautiously in Normalizing Policy\nThe first factor entering my analysis is that I see a number of downside risks to the growth and inflation forecasts.\nFor instance, as I look around the globe, I see many economies facing slow growth and low inflation. Europe and Japan are well-known cases among the advanced economies. Of course, slow or stagnant growth in advanced countries has negative spillovers onto emerging markets that are highly dependent on exports for their growth. Indeed, today China is confronting slower growth, and the Brazilian economy has fallen into recession. \nFor the United States, slower growth abroad reduces demand for our exports and, with it, U.S. production. In addition, weakness abroad could translate into a higher exchange value for the dollar against other currencies, further reducing net exports. A higher dollar also would result in lower prices for imports, which, in turn would hold down inflation and delay progress toward our 2 percent inflation target.\nWhile the risks to the U.S. outlook emanating from abroad are worthy of notice, they are not the biggest thing on my mind. For me, the biggest and costliest downside risk is that in our haste to get back to “business as usual” monetary policy, we could stall progress and backtrack to the economic circumstances of recent years — an economy mired in the ZLB.\nTo say the least, conducting monetary policy at the ZLB has been a difficult experience that we all want to avoid repeating unnecessarily. In the winter of 2009, with the unemployment rate soaring to double digits, the Fed would have very much liked to lower the nominal federal funds rate an additional 300 basis points; but we couldn’t because the rate was already at zero.\nFaced with a pressing need to provide additional accommodation, we were forced to turn to innovative, but controversial, unconventional monetary policies. These policies have been extremely helpful. But there is no denying that they were second-best options; the ZLB had made lowering the fed funds rate, which is our first-best interest rate tool, infeasible.\nEveryone will welcome a return to more normal times and a reliance on the traditional policy framework of adjustments to the federal funds rate. But the decision about when to begin to raise rates shouldn’t be made prematurely. Rather, the decision for policy liftoff has to be made for the right reasons — that is, it should be dictated by economic conditions.\nLike my colleague Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota,2 I think that policy at all times must be goal-oriented. Our experiences since the crisis began and current economic conditions are highly unusual. The FOMC should not simply set its policy instruments by mechanically aligning them with historical norms if those norms are not currently relevant for the conditions needed to attain both of our dual mandate goals. Rather, our policy instruments should be set to achieve our ultimate goals as efficaciously as possible given current and prospective economic conditions, all the while with an eye on managing against important risks to the outlook.\nI believe that the biggest risk we face today is prematurely engineering restrictive monetary conditions. In this scenario, the FOMC could misjudge the presence and magnitude of economic impediments and misread the recent progress we have made as evidence of sounder economic trends. If we were to presume prematurely that the U.S. economy has returned to a more business-as-usual position and reduce monetary accommodation too soon, we could find ourselves in the very uncomfortable position of falling back into the ZLB environment. Such an outcome could be a serious setback to the timely attainment of our dual mandate policy objectives.\nThis risk consideration means that the decision to lift the funds rate from zero should be made only when we have a great deal of confidence that growth has enough momentum to reach full employment and that inflation will return to a sustainable 2 percent rate. We should also proceed cautiously and keep the path of rate increases relatively shallow for some time after we begin to raise rates. This approach will allow us time to assess how the economy is performing under less accommodative financial conditions and reduce the odds of overaggressive rate hikes choking off progress toward our policy goals.\nHistory Shows That Premature Exit Is a Risk\nPast experience with the ZLB also counsels patience. History has not looked kindly on attempts to prematurely remove monetary accommodation from economies that are in or near a liquidity trap. Three occasions come readily to mind: the Great Depression (which was resolved only with the massive fiscal expansion of World War II), Japan over the past 20 years, and the recent European experience. Indeed, both of the more recent episodes are ongoing today, though Japan finally appears to be making important headway toward raising inflation and eventually exiting the ZLB.\nThe U.S., Japanese and European lessons from monetary history strongly suggest that there are great risks to premature liftoff from the ZLB or near-ZLB conditions. Unless the economy is fundamentally strong and the previous impediments to growth have receded sufficiently, the odds remain high that some unforeseen shock could cause the monetary authority to retreat right back into the ZLB.\nAnd the costs of being mired in the ZLB are simply very large. The ZLB prevents using our very best policy tools to address negative shocks. The ZLB means that interest rates cannot fall low enough to equate the supply of saving with the demand for investment, which, of course, significantly impedes capital formation, future economic growth, and the health of labor markets. And the ZLB often comes hand in hand with undesirably low inflation or even a falling price level, carrying with it the associated costs of debt deflation on the real economy.\nThe Risk of Too-High Inflation\nWhat about the other risk to our policy goals that I mentioned — the risk that the U.S. economy could face pricing pressures that accelerate rapidly and ultimately leave inflation far above our 2 percent target for an unacceptably long period? \nAt some point, when the economy has clearly overcome the remaining impediments from the largest economic and financial downturn since the Great Depression, the odds of inflation rising noticeably above target could become palpable. But such a breakout is just not at all very likely today. Indeed, many Fed critics have been voicing this concern since 2009, and it hasn’t even come close to happening.\nWhat if inflation just ran moderately above target for some time? Well, I see the costs of this outcome as clearly being much smaller than the costs of falling back into the ZLB. First, I believe the U.S. economy could weather the modest increases in interest rates that would be needed to keep inflation in check. Such rate increases would be manageable for the real economy; this is particularly true if industry and labor markets have already made the most difficult reallocations of jobs and overcome other factors so that productive resources are more efficiently and fully employed. Second, as I’ve noted many times in the past, a symmetric inflation target means we should be averaging 2 percent inflation over time. We’ve averaged well under that 2 percent mark for the past six and a half years. With a symmetric inflation target, one could imagine moderately above-target inflation for a limited time as simply the flip side of our recent inflation experience — and hardly an event that would impose great costs on the economy.\nThe murky state of inflation expectations is another factor that enters my risk-management considerations. For inflation to take off rapidly, we would have to see a jump in inflationary expectations. But inflationary expectations certainly have not taken off. Indeed, we may be facing a quite different problem.\nMany forecasters — myself included — assume that stable 2 percent inflation expectations will be an important factor helping to pull actual inflation up. Over the past five years, professional forecasters’ projections for long-run inflation have been at the 2 percent target and the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) break-evens generally have been flat. Yet actual inflation has only just recently made it back up to 1-1/2 percent. Moreover, we still have not seen much at all in the way of higher inflation compensation being built into interest rates or wages. So there is cause for concern that expectations might not produce as strong a pull on inflation as we hope. This unusual situation has precedent, for example, in Japan, where inflation expectations have remained stable, while inflation itself has lagged for a prolonged period. Of course, there is a risk, too, that inflation expectations themselves could fall—indeed, I would note that longer-dated TIPS break-evens have recently dropped to the lower end of their post-crisis range.\n\nConclusion\nAs I think about the process of normalizing policy, I conclude that today’s risk-management calculus says we should err on the side of patience in removing highly accommodative policy. We need to solidify our confidence that our ultimate exit from the ZLB will occur smoothly — and that our escape can be sustained. A corollary to this conclusion is that we should not shy away from policy prescriptions that imply forecasts of inflation that moderately overshoot our 2 percent target for a limited time.\nSuch a policy strategy more properly balances expected costs and benefits. And it would leave me with much more confidence that inflation will not stall out below target once we start raising rates.\nI agree with Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart in thinking that we ought to be \"whites of their eyes\" inflation fighters.3 The last thing we want to do is regress back into the ZLB. Indeed, such a relapse would be a sign there was something else going on that was preventing the economy from being as vibrant as we thought possible.\nTo summarize, I am very uncomfortable with calls to raise our policy rate sooner than later. I favor delaying liftoff until I am more certain that we have sufficient momentum in place toward our policy goals. And I think we should plan for our path of policy rate increases to be shallow in order to be sure that the economy’s momentum is sustainable in the presence of less accommodative financial conditions. I look forward to the day when we can return to business-as-usual monetary policy, but that time has not yet arrived.\n\nNotes\n1Federal Open Market Committee (2014).\n2See, for example, Kocherlakota (2013).\n3Lockhart (2014).\n\nReferences\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2014, Summary of Economic Projections, Washington, DC, September 17.\nKocherlakota, Narayana, 2013, “A time of testing,” speech, St. Paul Chamber of Commerce, St. Paul, MN, November 12.\nLockhart, Dennis, 2014, “Thoughts on liftoff,” speech, Global Interdependence Center, Sixth Annual Rocky Mountain Economic Summit, Jackson Hole, WY, July 11.",

            "content": "Thank you.\nI would like to thank the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) for inviting me to speak this morning. The organizers of this annual meeting were farsighted in arranging the conference around the theme of long-term strategies. As the many excellent speakers make clear, there is much to ponder as we contemplate the future of monetary policy. And I welcome the opportunity to talk to you today about my views on the appropriate strategy for determining the timing and pace of our eventual policy normalization.\nBefore I begin, let me note that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIntroduction and Summary\nAs you know, for almost six years, economic conditions have led the FOMC to keep its primary policy tool, the federal funds rate, at its effective zero lower bound (ZLB). When will it be time to finally lift the funds rate from the ZLB? Of course, the answer to that question depends on our progress toward our mandated goals of maximum sustainable employment and price stability.\nIt has been a long time since the trough of the Great Recession. In the wake of the recession, the unemployment rate reached at an astonishing peak of 10.0 percent. Since then, we have made significant progress in moving the unemployment rate back to a more normal number. Yet, at 6.1 percent, it remains too high. And, as I will discuss shortly, some other measures suggest that the labor market is far from complete recovery.\nWe have underperformed on the inflation front as well. Since 2008, year-over-year total inflation as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) has averaged just 1.4 percent, well below its 2 percent target. Today, PCE inflation stands at 1-1/2 percent and is expected to move up only slowly toward the FOMC’s target.\nNonetheless, we have come a long way in healing the injuries the financial crisis inflicted. Certainly monetary policy has been doing some heavy lifting. The Federal Reserve responded quickly to the unfolding recession by cutting the fed funds rate to near zero by December 2008. Once at the zero lower bound, we then turned to unconventional measures, such as large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance about the federal funds rate, to provide further accommodation. In the fall of 2012, with the unemployment rate hovering stubbornly at around 8 percent and core inflation steadily drifting lower than our 2 percent target, the Fed introduced open-ended asset purchases and, later, forward guidance that related federal funds rate actions to thresholds explicitly expressed in terms of our policy goals. These efforts have helped the economy make impressive progress toward our employment mandate and appear to be moving us closer to our 2 percent inflation target as well.\nGiven this progress, it is natural to ask if it is time to return to business as usual. Are we close enough to our policy goals — and do we have enough confidence in our ability to achieve those goals within the foreseeable future — that policy can return to operating according to more traditional guidelines?\nAs I will discuss in more detail, I think the answer is no. First, inflation remains stubbornly low. Second, I believe that substantial slack persists in labor markets and that some remaining and slowly dissipating headwinds could weigh on our progress toward full employment for some time. Chair Yellen pointed to a few of these headwinds in her press conference after the September FOMC meeting: tight mortgage credit for some borrowers; depressed household expectations for their income prospects; and modest productivity growth.1 And, third, there is my weighing of risk-management considerations.\nTo me, the risks imposed on an economy forced to operate at the zero lower bound on policy rates are paramount. In an economy mired at the ZLB, interest rates cannot fall low enough to equate the supply of saving with the demand for investment — a constraint that then significantly impedes consumer spending, capital formation, and employment expansion. Accordingly, before the Fed raises rates we should have a great deal of confidence that we won’t be forced to backtrack on our moves and face another painful period at the zero lower bound. And once we start, at least initially we should raise rates slowly to make sure the economy can weather less accommodative financial conditions. In sum, we should be exceptionally patient in adjusting the stance of U.S. monetary policy — even to the point of allowing a modest overshooting of our inflation target to appropriately balance the risks to our policy objectives.\nLet me now explain how I get to this conclusion.\n\nConflicting Signs in the Labor Market\nTo judge the success of policy, you have to know when you’ve actually reached your targets. Knowing when we hit our inflation target is straightforward. After all, a 2 percent increase in PCE prices is an easily identifiable number. But full employment is a far more nuanced concept. As the FOMC’s annual January “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy” recognizes, maximum employment can be influenced by a large number of structural factors that can change over time and may not be directly measureable. In light of this uncertainty, the Committee considers many factors in gauging maximum employment. Judging the degree of slack along these many dimensions is a difficult and complex task. But it is one that is critical for the conduct of monetary policy — we must have a good idea of what constitutes achievement of our full employment target.\nMany economists, our Chicago Fed staff included, have been working long and hard on research related to this topic. In my remarks today, I will briefly talk about some of our results that touch on several of the most contested labor market issues on the table today. These involve labor force participation, job openings and wages. To give you the punch line, this research and work done by others in the field lead me to conclude that, although we have made great strides, a good deal of slack remains in the labor market.\nLabor Force Participation and Employment\nAs everyone in this room is aware, the labor force participation rate has fallen throughout the recession and recovery and is now at a 35-year low.2 Much of that decline is due to trends that far predate the Great Recession. The movement of baby boomers into retirement age and the long-running declines in teenager and prime-age male participation would have significantly reduced labor force participation rates independently of the economic downturn.\nChicago Fed economists first did work on the prospects for a declining labor force participation trend back in 2001 — near the time the rate peaked at just over 67 percent.3 Even after revisiting this topic numerous times and with multiple generations of research assistants working on the programs, our economists’ views about the trends that are consistent with the composition of the population and a labor market near equilibrium have not changed much since then.4 Among the many robustness analyses they performed, their models produce nearly the same trend for labor force participation as they have since 2001.5\nDepending on the details of the specification, Chicago Fed economists estimate that at the end of the second quarter of 2014, the labor force participation rate was between 1/2 and 1-1/4 percentage points below trend. Furthermore, the participation rate was as much as 3/4 of a percentage point below predictions based on its historical relationship with the unemployment rate. This disparity suggests that there likely is an extra margin of slack in labor markets beyond that indicated by the unemployment rate alone.\nIt is interesting to dig further into these “labor force participation gaps.” Virtually all the gap during this cycle has been due to withdrawal from the labor market of workers without a college degree. By contrast, a participation gap never materialized for college graduates, even during the depths of the recession. There is no simple explanation for this striking contrast. It could be yet another symptom of long-running but difficult-to-model trends in the economy, such as structural change in the patterns of production, job polarization, and changes in social programs, which particularly impact the lower-skill work force.6 Regardless, the divergent work behavior across education groups strikes me as an important fact and deserving of much further research attention.\nThe declining trend in labor force participation also influences how fast the economy can produce new jobs in the long run. Our estimate of the trend in payroll employment growth over the past 15 years averages roughly 100,000 jobs per month. Looking ahead, we think that declines in the labor force participation rate and population growth will bring the trend in payroll employment growth down to fewer than 50,000 jobs per month by 2016. This new benchmark probably will only become apparent in the monthly data once the economy closes the current 3.8 million employment gap. But barring sizable changes in immigration policy, policymakers and the public will need to get accustomed to a slower base of employment growth by the latter part of the decade.\nJob Openings and Hiring\nThis brings me to the issue of hiring and job openings. The job openings rate, as measured by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) data, started climbing immediately after the recession and made it back to its pre-recession high this summer.7 Yet, despite some improvement, the JOLTS hiring rate remains disappointingly below where it stood before the recession began.8\nWhy might firms report many more openings but be slower to fill them? Posting a vacancy is only part of the hiring process. Jason Faberman of the Chicago Fed, in collaboration with Steve Davis of the University of Chicago and John Haltiwanger of the University of Maryland, estimate that the overall effort that firms actually are putting into filling a job vacancy fell by over 20 percent during the recession. It has been slow to recover since and today still stands 8 percent below its 2006 peak and, for that matter, below where it was anytime during the last expansion.9\nDavis, Faberman and Haltiwanger argue that low recruiting intensity may reflect employers’ increased hiring standards. That squares with anecdotes we hear that employers are being very picky and waiting for the perfect applicant. It could be that hiring standards become more stringent during an economic downturn. For example, if there is an unusually high degree of downward nominal wage rigidity, as Mary Daly and Bart Hobijn of the San Francisco Fed document has been the case over this cycle,10 then employers may respond by filling fewer openings. If this story is true, then the high ratio of vacancies to hires is a further indication of slack in the labor market.\nAlternatively, a low rate of vacancy filling might signal a persistent structural problem. For years, I’ve been hearing business people complain of difficulty in finding sufficiently qualified candidates. This phenomenon may be indicative of a skills mismatch between jobs and workers. If this is the case, then it is possible that the steady-state level of the vacancy rate has increased, which would help explain why the improvement in vacancies we’ve seen over the past few years has been slow to translate into similar progress on hiring.\nNow, it’s unclear if these trends are widespread. For example, only about 20 percent of the respondents to the July NABE business conditions survey indicated their firms face shortages of skilled labor.11 And if skills mismatch was a large ongoing problem, we’d expect to see wages rising much faster for those with the skills in excess demand. Here, there is evidence of larger wage increases in some occupations, but the degree of wage-growth dispersion does not appear to be unusual.\nWages\nIndeed, wage growth in general continues to be very modest--at a bit over 2 percent per year. That is a long way from the 3 to 4 percent benchmark implied by productivity growth and our inflation objective. Indeed, over the past three years, the unemployment rate has fallen by a percentage point per year; yet real wage growth has barely budged. It’s hard for me to imagine a full labor market recovery without genuine improvement in compensation growth. But am I wrong? Has the wage Phillips curve completely broken down?\nSome claim the answer is no — you just have to look at the right measure of unemployment. Alan Krueger, Judd Cramer and David Cho, among others, have shown that the relationship during this cycle between real wages and the short-term unemployment rate — that is, those unemployed 26 weeks or less — has been in line with historical norms, whereas the huge spike in long-term unemployment exerted minimal pressure on real wage growth.12 Of course, the short-term unemployment rate is now close to its pre-recession level. So their model implies nominal wage growth should be returning to something close to the fundamentals implied by productivity growth and inflation.\nMy staff’s research comes to a somewhat different conclusion. Using state-level data, they show that if you further split short-term unemployment into those unemployed one month or less and those unemployed between one and six months, only the one-to-six month rate has any predictive power for wage growth. This so-called medium-term unemployment rate is still somewhat above its pre-recession mark. In addition, they find that the rate of involuntary part-time employment, which is still very high, also has a substantial influence on wage growth.13 Putting it all together, their estimates say that if labor market conditions were at their 2005–07 levels, average real wage growth would be roughly 1/2 to 1 percentage point higher over the past year — another sign of the cyclical shortfall in labor market health.\nTo sum up, with many important measures of labor market activity still well short of our estimates of cyclical norms, I believe it is a bit premature to say that we are close to our full employment target — the labor market is not yet calling for business-as-usual monetary policy\nThat said, while it has taken longer than anyone would like, our progress has been good. Indeed, there is good reason to anticipate that we will achieve full employment and price stability within the FOMC’s current forecast horizon. Notably, in the Committee’s Summary of Economic Projections released a week and a half ago, most participants anticipated that the unemployment rate would return to its long-run neutral level by the end of 2016 and that inflation then would be in the range of 1-3/4 to 2 percent.\n\nA Balanced Approach to Monetary Policy\nNow let me turn to my views on monetary policy.\nI can’t speak to my FOMC colleagues’ forecasts and how they interact with their views regarding appropriate policy. But, for my part, I think it is more likely that we will achieve our employment mandate before inflation is clearly headed back to 2 percent. Conceptually, this could raise a policy dilemma — achieving our inflation objective would call for strong accommodation, while achieving our employment target usually would call for earlier policy normalization. However, the story is even more complicated than that because important risk factors also come into play. In some ways the insights from Nobel laureates Lars Hansen and Tom Sargent regarding robust control evaluations help form my assessment.14 I see two important and divergent ways my forecast could go wrong. One is that I may be overestimating the underlying strength in the real economy and its ability to exit from the ZLB. Guarding against this risk calls for a more patient removal of accommodation. The second is that I may be wrong about the inflation outlook, and we could be poised for a much stronger rise in inflation than I am forecasting. This risk calls for more aggressive rate hikes.\nHow do I think policy should balance these divergent risks? How should these risks affect my views about how to follow the FOMC strategy of pursuing a balanced approach to achieving our policy goals?\nIn my mind, current circumstances and a weighing of alternative risks mean that a balanced policy approach calls for being patient in reducing accommodation — that is, being patient about when we first increase the federal funds rate and being patient about setting the pace of rate increases once we have begun to move. I know from the NABE Economic Policy Survey that many of you disagree with this view.15 Let me explain how I get there.\nProceed Cautiously in Normalizing Policy\nTo say the least, conducting monetary policy at the ZLB has been a difficult experience that we all want to avoid repeating unnecessarily. In the winter of 2009, with the unemployment rate soaring to double digits, the Fed would have very much liked to lower the nominal federal funds rate an additional 300 basis points; but we couldn’t because the rate was already at zero. Faced with a pressing need to provide additional accommodation, we were forced to turn to innovative, but controversial, unconventional monetary policies. These policies have been extremely helpful. But there is no denying that they were second-best options; the ZLB had made lowering the fed funds rate, which is our first-best interest rate tool, infeasible.\nEveryone will welcome a return to more normal times and a reliance on the traditional policy framework of adjustments to the federal funds rate. But the decision about when to begin to raise rates shouldn’t be made prematurely. Rather, the decision for policy liftoff has to be made for the right reasons — that is, it should be dictated by economic conditions.\nI have said many times that I agree with Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota: Policy at all times must be goal-oriented.16 Our experiences since the crisis began and current economic conditions are highly unusual. The FOMC should not simply set its policy instruments by mechanically aligning them with historical norms if those norms are not relevant harbingers for the attainment of both of our dual mandate goals. Rather, our policy instruments should be set to achieve our ultimate goals as efficaciously as possible given current and prospective economic conditions, all the while with an eye on managing against important risks to the outlook.\nWhat does that mean now? I believe that the biggest risk we face today is prematurely engineering restrictive monetary conditions. In this scenario, the FOMC could misjudge the presence and magnitude of economic impediments and misread the recent progress we have made as evidence of sounder economic trends. If we were to presume prematurely that the U.S. economy has returned to a more business-as-usual position and reduce monetary accommodation too soon, we could find ourselves in the very uncomfortable position of falling back into the ZLB environment. Such an outcome could be a serious setback to the timely attainment of our dual mandate policy objectives.\nThis risk consideration means that the decision to lift the funds rate from zero should be made only when we have a great deal of confidence that growth has enough momentum to reach full employment and that inflation will return to a sustainable 2 percent rate. We should also proceed cautiously and keep the path of rate increases relatively shallow for some time after we begin to raise rates. This approach will allow us time to assess how the economy is performing under less accommodative financial conditions and reduce the odds of overaggressive rate hikes choking off progress toward our policy goals.\n\nHistory Shows That Premature Exit Is a Risk\nGreat Depression\nPast experience with the ZLB also counsels patience. History has not looked kindly on attempts to prematurely remove monetary accommodation from economies that are in or near a liquidity trap. The U.S. experience during the Great Depression — in particular, in 1937 — is a classic example for monetary historians: In response to the positive growth and reinflation that occurred after the devaluation and suspension of gold convertibility, the Fed raised reserve requirements, the Treasury sterilized gold inflows and there was a fiscal contraction. Subsequently, the economy dropped back into recession and deflation. During this time, interest rates remained very low. The discount rate was lower after 1937 than before, and Treasury bill rates were less than 1 percent. By many economic accounts, it took the big fiscal expansion associated with World War II to exit the Great Depression.\nJapan over the Past 20 Years\nWe can also learn from the Japanese experience over the past 20 years. After attempting to expand production and avoid deflationary prospects in the late 1990s, monetary policy reversed course prematurely in the early 2000s as the inflation rate inched above zero; deflationary pressures soon reemerged and policy rates returned to zero by 2001.This experience was repeated again later in the decade. Indeed, it has only been over the past year — following nearly 20 years of stagnation — that we see the recent goal-oriented monetary expansion making significant headway in extracting Japan from below-target inflation.\nRecent European Experience\nThe recent European experience in 2011 is yet another example of premature tightening. Despite the headwinds from continuing debt-overhang and recent financial distress, European authorities in 2011 judged that the eurozone economy was emerging from recession and headline inflation was at risk to rise persistently above target. The European Central Bank (ECB) responded by raising policy rates in 2011. The ECB soon had to backtrack as output in the eurozone fell again and inflation began to march down below target. Today, the eurozone faces continued economic weakness and an inflation rate that is just about 1/2 percent. As a result, the ECB recently lowered policy rates to the ZLB, has started undertaking additional unconventional monetary policies, and is now encouraging fiscal expansion among eurozone countries that are able to do so.\nThese lessons from monetary history strongly suggest that there are great risks to premature liftoff from the ZLB or near-ZLB conditions. Unless economic conditions are fundamentally strong and the previous impediments to growth have receded sufficiently, the odds remain high that monetary authorities will need to retreat right back into the ZLB.\nAnd the costs of being mired in the ZLB are simply very large. The ZLB prevents using our very best policy tools to address negative shocks. The ZLB means that interest rates cannot fall low enough to equate the supply of saving with the demand for investment, which, of course, significantly impedes capital formation, future economic growth, and the health of labor markets. And the ZLB often comes hand in hand with undesirably low inflation or even a falling price level, carrying with it the associated costs of debt deflation on the real economy.\n\nThe Risk of Too-High Inflation\nWhat about the other risk to our policy goals that I mentioned — the risk that the U.S. economy could face pricing pressures that accelerate rapidly and ultimately leave inflation far above our 2 percent target for an unacceptably long period?\nAt some point when the economy has clearly overcome the remaining impediments from the largest economic and financial downturn since the Great Depression, the odds of inflation rising noticeably above target could become palpable. But such a breakout is just not at all very likely today. Indeed, many Fed critics have been voicing this concern since 2009, and it hasn’t even come close to happening.\nWhat if inflation just ran moderately above target for some time? Well, I see the costs of this outcome as clearly being much smaller than the costs of falling back into the ZLB. First, I believe the U.S. economy could weather the modest increases in interest rates that would be needed to keep inflation in check. Such rate increases would be manageable for the real economy; this is particularly true if industry and labor markets have already made the most difficult reallocations of jobs and overcome other factors so that productive resources are more efficiently and fully employed. Second, as I’ve noted many times in the past, a symmetric inflation target means we should be averaging 2 percent inflation over time. We’ve averaged well under that 2 percent mark for the past six and a half years. With a symmetric inflation target, one could imagine moderately-above-target inflation for a limited period of time as simply the flip side of our recent inflation experience — and hardly an event that would impose great costs on the economy.\nThe murky state of inflation expectations is another factor that enters my risk-management considerations. For inflation to take off rapidly, we would have to see a jump in inflationary expectations. But inflationary expectations have been quite stable. Indeed, we may be facing a quite different problem. Many forecasters — myself included — assume that stable 2 percent inflation expectations will be an important factor helping to pull actual inflation up. Over the past five years, professional forecasters’ projections for long-run inflation have been at the 2 percent target and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) break-evens have been flat. Yet actual inflation has only just recently made it back up to 1-1/2 percent. Moreover, we still have not seen much at all in the way of higher inflation compensation being built into interest rates or wages. So there is cause for concern that expectations might not produce as strong a pull on inflation as we hope.\nWe can turn to the Japanese experience again to highlight this risk. Over the past 20 years, long-run inflation expectations in Japan have averaged a little over 1 percent. Yet during that period, the only time inflation was palpably above zero — let alone not in outright deflation — was when consumption taxes increased or oil prices spiked. So inflation expectations may remain stable while inflation itself lags for a prolonged period.17\n\nConclusion\nAs I think about the process of normalizing policy, I conclude that today’s risk-management calculus says we should err on the side of patience in removing highly accommodative policy. We need to solidify our confidence that our ultimate exit from the ZLB will occur smoothly — and in a way that sustains our escape from it. A corollary to this is we should not shy away from policy prescriptions that generate forecasts of inflation that moderately overshoot our 2 percent target for a limited time.\nSuch a policy strategy more properly balances expected costs and benefits. And it would leave me with much more confidence that inflation will not stall out below target once we start raising rates.\nI agree with Atlanta Fed President Lockhart in thinking that we ought to be “whites of their eyes” inflation fighters.18The last thing we want to do is regress back into the ZLB. Indeed, such a relapse would be a sign there was something else going on that was preventing the economy from being as vibrant as we thought possible.\nTo summarize, I am very uncomfortable with calls to raise our policy rate sooner than later. I favor delaying liftoff until I am more certain that we have sufficient momentum in place toward our policy goals. And I think we should plan for our path of policy rate increases to be shallow in order to be sure that the economy’s momentum is sustainable in the presence of less accommodative financial conditions. I look forward to the day when we can return to business-as-usual monetary policy, but that time has not yet arrived.\n\nNotes\n1 See Yellen (2014).\n2 The labor force participation rate is defined as the share of the population aged 16 and older who are either employed or unemployed. To be unemployed, a person has to not have a job but be actively looking for work in the prior four weeks and to be currently available to work. These data are collected by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics as part of its monthly Current Population Survey.\n3 Aaronson and Sullivan (2001).\n4 Aaronson et al. (2014).\n5 Specifically, the trends generated by Chicago Fed economists’ preferred models are very close whether they are estimated using data through 2002, 2007 or 2014.\n6 See, for example, Acemoglu and Autor (2011) and Charles, Hurst and Notowidigdo (2013). See Shierholz, Mishel and Schmitt (2013) for a skeptical view. An alternative explanation is based on changes in the use of social safety net programs, especially disability insurance (DI), that are partly cyclical in nature. The DI rolls have been increasing throughout this business cycle, although they have been on the rise, more or less uninterrupted, since the 1990s (Autor, 2011; and Burkhauser and Daly, 2011). The DI program tends to be cyclical partly because eligibility standards ease amid deteriorating labor market conditions (Mueller, Rothstein and von Wachter, 2013). That is, people with moderate disabilities are more likely to qualify for the DI program when there are fewer suitable jobs available.\n7 The job openings rate is the number of job openings on the last business day of the month as a percent of total employment plus job openings.\n8 The hiring rate stood at 4.0 percent at its 2006 peak and fell to as low as 2.8 percent in 2009. Today, it is 3.5 percent.\n9 See Dice Hiring Indicators (2014).\n10 Daly and Hobijn (2014).\n11 See National Association for Business Economics (2014b).\n12 Krueger, Cramer, and Cho (2014). This same result appears for the price Phillips curve, as shown, for example, by Gordon (2013).\n13 Aaronson and Jordan (2014). The medium-term unemployed are those unemployed five to 26 weeks. Persons involuntarily employed part time for economic reasons (such as slack work or unfavorable business conditions) are those who want and are available for full-time work but have had to settle for a part-time job.

            "content": "Thank you.\nI would like to thank the Peterson Institute and Adam Posen for organizing this conference focusing on labor market issues. The functioning of the labor market is always of great interest to both academics and policymakers. But today, with the collapse of labor demand during the Great Recession and ongoing structural changes, judging the health and future of labor markets is both especially challenging and important. The work presented at this conference and others like it offers an opportunity to integrate the most recent research with the thinking of policymakers. In keeping with this theme, I will first offer my views on the labor market and how the issues raised here influence my thinking on monetary policy, and I will then discuss my more general strategy for considering when and how we should begin to normalize monetary policy.\nBefore I begin, let me note that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIntroduction and Summary\nFive long years have passed since the trough of the Great Recession, in mid-2009. Late that year the unemployment rate stood at an astonishing 10.0 percent. Since then, we have made significant progress in moving the unemployment rate back to a more normal number. Yet, at 6.1 percent, it remains too high. And, as we have heard all morning, other measures of labor market activity remain suppressed.\nWe have underperformed on the inflation front as well. Since 2008, year-over-year total inflation as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) has averaged just 1.4 percent, well below its 2 percent target. Today, PCE inflation stands at 1-1/2 percent and is expected to move up only slowly toward the FOMC’s target.\nNonetheless, we have come a long way in healing the injuries the financial crisis inflicted. Certainly monetary policy has been doing some heavy lifting. The Federal Reserve responded quickly to the unfolding recession by cutting the fed funds rate to near zero by December 2008. At the zero lower bound (ZLB), we then turned to unconventional measures, such as large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance about the federal funds rate to provide further accommodation. In the fall of 2012, with the unemployment rate hovering stubbornly at around 8 percent and core inflation steadily drifting lower than our 2 percent target, the Fed introduced open-ended asset purchases and, later, forward guidance that related federal funds rate actions to thresholds explicitly expressed in terms of our policy goals. Together, these efforts have helped the economy make impressive progress toward our employment mandate and appear to be moving us closer to our 2 percent inflation target as well.\nWith the economy undershooting both our employment and inflation goals, monetary policy does not presently face a conflict in goals; actions that support employment growth also help move inflation up toward our target. Yet, as I look to the future and assess risks, I foresee a time when a policy dilemma might emerge: Namely, we could find ourselves in a situation in which the progress or risks to one of our goals dictate a tightening of policy while the achievement of the other goal calls for maintaining strong accommodation.\nSo what happens when a conflict emerges? In such cases, the FOMC has said that it will follow a “balanced approach” to achieving its policy goals. I will elaborate at length on this later, but let me summarize how I think we should operationalize this approach today. We should keep our focus on our policy goals and should be highly attuned to both the likelihood and the costs of missing those goals. To me, the risks imposed on an economy forced to operate at the zero lower bound on policy rates are paramount. Accordingly, before the Fed raises rates we should have a great deal of confidence that we won’t be forced to backtrack on our moves and face another painful period at the ZLB. We should be exceptionally patient in adjusting the stance of U.S. monetary policy — even to the point of allowing a modest overshooting of our inflation target to appropriately balance the risks to our policy objectives.\n\nConflicting Signs in the Labor Market\nOf course, to judge the success of policy, you have to know when you’ve actually reached your targets. Knowing when we hit our inflation target is straightforward. After all, a 2 percent increase in PCE prices is an easily identifiable number. But full employment is a far more nuanced concept. As the FOMC’s annual January \"Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy\" recognizes, maximum employment can be influenced by a large number of structural factors that can change over time and may not be directly measureable. In light of this uncertainty, the Committee considers many factors in gauging maximum employment. As the extremely relevant research presented at this conference makes clear, judging the degree of slack along these many dimensions is a difficult and complex task. But it is one that is critical for the conduct of monetary policy — we must have a good idea of what constitutes achievement of our full employment target.\nOur Chicago Fed research staff has been working long and hard, and in my remarks today, I will briefly talk about some of our results that touch on several of the most contested labor market issues on the table today. These involve labor force participation, job openings and wages. To give you the punch line, this research and work done by others in the field lead me to conclude that, although we have made great strides, a good deal of slack remains in the labor market.\nLabor Force Participation and Employment\nAs everyone in this room is aware, the labor force participation rate has fallen throughout the recession and recovery and is now at a 35-year low.[1] As Julie Hotchkiss described earlier this morning, it is well understood that much of the decline is due to trends that far predate the Great Recession. The movement of baby boomers into retirement age and the long-running declines in teenager and prime-age male participation would have significantly reduced labor force participation rates independently of the economic downturn.\nChicago Fed economists first did work on the prospects for a declining labor force participation trend back in 2001 — near the time the rate peaked at just over 67 percent.[2] Even after revisiting this topic numerous times and with multiple generations of research assistants running the programs, their views about the trends that are consistent with the composition of the population and a labor market near equilibrium have not changed much since then.[3] Among the many robustness analyses they performed, their models produce nearly the same trend for labor force participation as they have since 2001.[4]\nDepending on the details of the specification, Chicago Fed economists estimate that at the end of the second quarter of 2014, the labor force participation rate was between 1/2 and 1-1/4 percentage points below trend. Furthermore, the participation rate was as much as 3/4 of a percentage point below predictions based on its historical relationship with the unemployment rate. This disparity suggests that there likely is an extra margin of slack in labor markets beyond that indicated by the unemployment rate alone.\nIt is interesting to dig further into these \"labor force participation gaps.\" Virtually all the gap during this cycle has been due to withdrawal from the labor market of workers without a college degree. By contrast, a participation gap never materialized for college graduates, even during the depths of the recession. There is no simple explanation for this striking contrast. It could be yet another symptom of long-running but difficult-to-model trends in the economy, such as job polarization and changes in social programs, which particularly impact the lower-skill work force.[5] Regardless, the divergent work behavior across education groups strikes me as an important fact and deserving of much further research attention.\nThe declining trend in labor force participation also influences how fast the economy can produce new jobs in the long run. Our estimate of the trend in payroll employment growth over the past 15 years averages roughly 100,000 jobs per month. Looking ahead, we think that declines in the labor force participation rate and population growth will bring the trend in payroll employment growth down to fewer than 50,000 jobs per month by 2016. This new benchmark probably will only become apparent in the monthly data once the economy closes the current 3.8 million employment gap. But barring sizable changes in immigration policy, policymakers and the public will need to get accustomed to a slower base of employment growth by the latter part of the decade.\nJob Openings and Hiring\nThis brings me to the issue of hiring and job openings. The job openings rate, as measured by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) data, started climbing immediately after the recession and made it back to its pre-recession high this summer.[6] Yet, despite some improvement, the JOLTS hiring rate remains disappointingly below where it stood before the recession began.[7]\nWhy might firms advertise openings aggressively but be slower to fill them? Posting a vacancy is only part of the hiring process. Jason Faberman of the Chicago Fed, in collaboration with Steve Davis of the University of Chicago and John Haltiwanger of the University of Maryland, estimate that the overall effort that firms actually are putting into filling a job vacancy fell by over 20 percent during the recession. It has been slow to recover since and today still stands 8 percent below its 2006 peak and, for that matter, below where it was anytime during the last expansion.[8]\nDavis, Faberman and Haltiwanger argue that low recruiting intensity may reflect employers’ increased hiring standards. It could be that hiring standards become more stringent during an economic downturn. For example, if there is an unusually high degree of downward nominal wage rigidity, as Mary Daly and Bart Hobijn of the San Francisco Fed document has been the case over this cycle,[9] then employers may respond by filling fewer openings. If this story is true, then the high ratio of vacancies to hires is a further indication of slack in the labor market.\nAlternatively, more stringent hiring standards might signal a persistent structural problem. For years, I’ve been hearing business people complain of difficulty in finding sufficiently qualified candidates. Furthermore, we hear anecdotes about firms being extremely picky and waiting for the perfect applicant. These behaviors may be indicative of a skills mismatch between jobs and workers. If this is the case, then it is possible that the steady-state level of the vacancy rate has increased, which would help explain why the improvement in vacancies we’ve seen over the past few years has been slow to translate into similar progress on hiring.\nWages\nIf skills mismatch were an ongoing problem, we’d expect to see wages rising for those with the skills in demand. There is evidence of increasing wages in some occupations, but wage growth in general continues to be very modest at about 2-1/4 percent per year. That is a long way from the 3 to 4 percent benchmark implied by productivity growth and our inflation objective. Indeed, over the past three years, the unemployment rate has fallen by a percentage point per year; yet real wage growth has barely budged. It’s hard for me to imagine a full labor market recovery without genuine improvement in compensation growth. But am I wrong? Has the wage Phillips curve completely broken down?\nSome claim the answer is no — you just have to look at the right measure of unemployment. Alan Krueger, Judd Cramer and David Cho, among others, have shown that the relationship between real wages and the short-term unemployment rate during this cycle has been in line with historical norms, whereas the historical spike in long-term unemployment exerted minimal pressure on real wage growth.[10] Of course, the short-term unemployment rate is now close to its pre-recession level. So their model implies nominal wage growth should be returning to something close to the fundamentals implied by productivity growth and inflation.\nMy staff’s research comes to a somewhat different conclusion. Using models similar to those Michael Kiley presented here this morning,[11] they find that pools of potential workers other than the short-term unemployed, notably the medium-term unemployed and the involuntary part-time work force, substantially influence wage growth at the state or metropolitan statistical area level.[12] Today, medium-term unemployment is down a good deal, but the involuntary part-time work force is still very high. According to their model estimates, if labor market conditions were at their 2005–07 levels, average real wage growth would be roughly 1/2 to 1 percentage point higher over the past year — another sign of the cyclical shortfall in labor market health.\nTo sum up, with many important measures of labor market activity still well short of our estimates of cyclical norms, I believe it is a bit premature to say that we are close to our full employment target. That said, while it has taken longer than anyone would like, our progress has been good. And there is good reason to anticipate that we will achieve full employment and price stability within the FOMC’s current forecast horizon. Indeed, in the Committee’s Summary of Economic Projections released about a week ago, most participants anticipated that the unemployment rate would return to its long-run neutral level by the end of 2016 and that inflation then would be in the range of 1-3/4 to 2 percent.\n\nA Balanced Approach to Monetary Policy\nNow let me turn to my views on monetary policy.\nI can’t speak to my FOMC colleagues’ forecasts and how they interact with their views regarding appropriate policy. But, for my part, I think it is more likely that we will achieve our employment mandate before inflation is clearly headed back to 2 percent. Conceptually, this could raise a policy dilemma — achieving our inflation objective would call for strong accommodation, while achieving our employment target usually would call for earlier policy normalization. However, the story is even more complicated than that because important risk factors also come into play. In some ways the insight from Nobel laureates Lars Hansen and Tom Sargent regarding robust control evaluations help form my assessment.[13] I see two important and divergent ways my forecast could go wrong. One is that I may be overestimating the underlying strength in the real economy and its ability to exit from the ZLB. Guarding against this risk calls for a more patient removal of accommodation. The second is that I may be wrong about the inflation outlook, and we could be poised for a much stronger rise in inflation than I am forecasting. This risk calls for more aggressive rate hikes.\nHow do I think policy should balance these divergent risks? How should these risks affect my views about how to follow the FOMC strategy of pursuing a balanced approach to achieving our policy goals?\nIn my mind, current circumstances and a weighing of alternative risks mean that a balanced policy approach calls for being patient in reducing accommodation — that is, being patient about when we first increase the federal funds rate and being patient about setting the pace of rate increases once we have begun to move. Let me explain how I get there.\nProceed Cautiously in Normalizing Policy\nTo say the least, conducting monetary policy at the ZLB has been a difficult experience that we all want to avoid repeating unnecessarily. In the winter of 2009, with the unemployment rate soaring to double digits, the Fed would have very much liked to lower the nominal federal funds rate an additional 300 basis points; but we couldn’t because the rate was already at zero. Faced with a pressing need to provide additional accommodation, we were forced to turn to innovative, but controversial, unconventional monetary policies. These policies have been extremely helpful. But there is no denying that they were second-best options; the ZLB had made lowering the fed funds rate, which is our first-best interest rate tool, infeasible.\nEveryone will welcome a return to more normal times and a reliance on the traditional policy framework of adjustments to the federal funds rate. But the decision about when to begin to raise rates shouldn’t be made prematurely. Rather, the decision for policy liftoff has to be made for the right reasons — that is, it should be dictated by economic conditions.\nI have said many times that I agree with Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota: Policy at all times must be goal-oriented.[14] Our experiences since the crisis began and current economic conditions are highly unusual. The FOMC should not simply set its policy instruments by mechanically aligning them with historical norms if those norms are not relevant harbingers for the attainment of both of our dual mandate goals. Rather, our policy instruments should be set to achieve our ultimate goals as efficaciously as possible given current and prospective economic conditions, all the while with an eye on managing against important risks to the outlook.\nWhat does that mean now? I believe that the biggest risk we face today is prematurely engineering restrictive monetary conditions. In this scenario, the FOMC could misjudge the presence and magnitude of economic impediments and misread the recent progress we have made as evidence of sounder economic trends. If we were to presume prematurely that the U.S. economy has returned to a more \"business as usual\" position and reduce monetary accommodation too soon, we could find ourselves in the very uncomfortable position of falling back into the ZLB environment. Such an outcome could be a serious setback to the timely attainment of our dual mandate policy objectives. This risk consideration means that the decision to lift the funds rate from zero should be made only when we have a great deal of confidence that growth has enough momentum to reach full employment and that inflation will return sustainably to 2 percent. We should also proceed cautiously and keep the path of rate increases relatively shallow for some time after we begin to raise rates. This approach will allow us time to assess how the economy is performing under less accommodative financial conditions and reduce the odds of overaggressive rate hikes choking off progress toward our policy goals.\n\nHistory Shows That Premature Exit Is a Risk\nGreat Depression\nPast experience with the zero lower bound also counsels patience. History has not looked kindly on attempts to prematurely remove monetary accommodation from economies that are in or near a liquidity trap. The U.S. experience during the Great Depression — in particular, in 1937 — is a classic example for monetary historians: In response to the positive growth and reinflation that occurred after devaluation and suspension of gold convertibility, the Fed raised reserve requirements, the Treasury sterilized gold inflows, and there was a fiscal contraction. Subsequently, the economy dropped back into recession and deflation. During this time, interest rates remained very low. The discount rate was lower after 1937 than before, and Treasury bill rates were less than 1 percent. By many economic accounts, it took the big fiscal expansion associated with World War II to exit the Great Depression.\nJapan over the Past 20 Years\nWe can also learn from the Japanese experience over the past 20 years. After attempting to expand production and avoid deflationary prospects in the late 1990s, monetary policy reversed course prematurely in the early 2000s as the inflation rate inched above zero; deflationary pressures soon reemerged and policy rates returned to zero by 2001.This experience was repeated again later in the decade. Indeed, it has only been over the past year — following nearly 20 years of stagnation — that we see the recent goal-oriented monetary expansion making significant headway in extracting Japan from below-target inflation.\nRecent European Experience\nThe recent European experience in 2011 is yet another example of premature tightening. Despite the headwinds from continuing debt-overhang and recent financial distress, European authorities in 2011 judged that the eurozone economy was emerging from recession and headline inflation was at risk to rise persistently above target. The European Central Bank (ECB) responded by raising policy rates in 2011. They soon had to backtrack as output in the eurozone fell again and inflation began to march down below target. Today, the eurozone faces continued economic weakness and an inflation rate that is just about 1/2 percent. As a result, the ECB recently lowered policy rates to the ZLB, has started undertaking additional unconventional monetary policies, and is now encouraging fiscal expansion among eurozone countries that are able to do so.\nThese lessons from monetary history strongly suggest that there are great risks to premature liftoff from the zero lower bound or near-ZLB conditions. Unless economic conditions are fundamentally strong and the previous impediments to growth have receded sufficiently, the odds remain high that monetary authorities will need to retreat right back into the ZLB.\nAnd the costs of being mired in the zero lower bound are simply very large. I have already talked about how the ZLB prevents using our very best policy tools to address negative shocks. The constraint also means that interest rates cannot fall low enough to equate the supply of saving with the demand for investment. This, of course, significantly impedes capital formation, future economic growth, and further employment expansion. Furthermore, the ZLB often comes hand in hand with undesirably low inflation or even a falling price level, carrying with it the associated costs of debt deflation on the real economy.\n\nThe Risk of Too-High Inflation\nWhat about the other risk to our policy goals that I mentioned — the risk that the U.S. economy could face pricing pressures that accelerate rapidly and ultimately leave inflation far above our 2 percent target for an unacceptably long period?\nAt some point when the economy has clearly overcome the remaining impediments from the largest economic and financial downturn since the Great Depression, the odds of inflation rising noticeably above target could become palpable. But such a breakout is just not at all very likely today. Indeed, many Fed critics have been voicing this concern since 2009, and it hasn’t even come close to happening.\nWhat if inflation just ran moderately above target for some time? Well, I see the costs of this outcome as clearly being much smaller than the costs of falling back into the ZLB. First, I believe the U.S. economy could weather the modest increases in interest rates that would be needed to keep inflation in check. Such rate increases would be manageable for the real economy; this is particularly true if industry and labor markets have already made the most difficult reallocations of jobs and overcome other factors so that productive resources are more efficiently and fully employed. Second, as I’ve noted many times in the past, a symmetric inflation target means we should be averaging 2 percent inflation over time. We’ve averaged well under that 2 percent mark for the past six and a half years. With a symmetric inflation target, one could imagine moderately-above-target inflation for a limited period of time as simply the flip side of our recent inflation experience — and hardly an event that would impose great costs on the economy.\nThe murky state of inflation expectations is another factor that enters my risk management considerations. For inflation to take off rapidly, we would have to see a jump in inflationary expectations. But inflationary expectations have been quite stable. Indeed, we may be facing a quite different problem. Many forecasters — myself included — assume that stable 2 percent inflation expectations will be an important factor helping to pull actual inflation up. Over the past five years, professional forecasters’ projections for long-run inflation have been at the 2 percent target and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) break-evens have been flat. Yet actual inflation has only just recently made it back up to 1-1/2 percent. Moreover, we still have not seen much at all in the way of higher inflation compensation being built into interest rates or wages. So there is cause for concern that expectations might not produce as strong a pull on inflation as we hope.\nWe can turn to the Japanese experience again to highlight this risk. Long-run inflation expectations in Japan have averaged a little over 1 percent. Yet during that period, the only time inflation was palpably above zero — let alone not in outright deflation — was when consumption taxes increased or oil prices spiked. So inflation expectations may remain stable while inflation itself lags for a prolonged period.\n\nConclusion\nAs I think about the process of normalizing policy, I conclude that today’s risk-management calculus says we should err on the side of patience in removing highly accommodative policy. We need to solidify our confidence that our ultimate exit from the zero lower bound will occur smoothly — and in a way that sustains our escape from it. A corollary to this is we should not shy away from policy prescriptions that generate forecasts of inflation that moderately overshoot our 2 percent target for a limited time.\nSuch a policy strategy more properly balances expected costs and benefits. And it would leave me with much more confidence that inflation will not stall out below target once we start raising rates.\nI agree with Atlanta Fed President Lockhart in thinking that we ought to be “whites of their eyes” inflation fighters.[15] The last thing we want to do is regress back into the ZLB. Indeed, such a relapse would be a sign there was something else going on that was preventing the economy from being as vibrant as we thought possible.\nTo summarize, I am very uncomfortable with calls to raise our policy rate sooner than later. I favor delaying liftoff until I am more certain that we have sufficient momentum in place toward our policy goals. And I think we should plan for our path of policy rate increases to be shallow in order to be sure that the economy’s momentum is sustainable in the presence of less accommodative financial conditions.\n\nNotes\n[1] The labor force participation rate is defined as the share of the population aged 16 and older who are either employed or unemployed. To be unemployed, a person has to not have a job but be actively looking for work in the prior four weeks and to be currently available to work. These data are collected by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics as part of its monthly Current Population Survey.\n[2] Aaronson and Sullivan (2001).\n[3] Aaronson et al. (2014).\n[4] Specifically, the trends generated by Chicago Fed economists’ preferred models are very close whether they are estimated using data through 2002, 2007 or 2014.\n[5] See, for example, Acemoglu and Autor (2011) and Charles, Hurst and Notowidigdo (2013). See Shierholz, Mishel and Schmitt (2013) for a skeptical view. An alternative explanation is based on changes in the use of social safety net programs, especially disability insurance (DI), that are partly cyclical in nature. The DI rolls have been increasing throughout this business cycle, although they have been on the rise, more or less uninterrupted, since the 1990s (Autor, 2011; and Burkhauser and Daly, 2011). The DI program tends to be cyclical partly because eligibility standards ease amid deteriorating labor market conditions (Mueller, Rothstein and von Wachter, 2013). That is, people with moderate disabilities are more likely to qualify for the DI program when there are fewer suitable jobs available.\n[6] The job openings rate is the number of job openings on the last business day of the month as a percent of total employment plus job openings.\n[7] The hiring rate stood at 4.0 percent at its 2006 peak and fell to as low as 2.8 percent in 2009. Today, it is 3.5 percent.\n[8] See Dice Hiring Indicators (2014).\n[9] Daly and Hobijn (2014).\n[10] Krueger, Cramer and Cho (2014).

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you Dimitri. Before proceeding with my comments today, I need to remind you that the views I express are my own and are not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Congress created the Federal Reserve System 100 years ago, largely as a way to provide an elastic currency that could mitigate the banking panics and other disruptions that impaired economic activity and contributed to deflations in the late 1800s and early 1900s. That mission has evolved into what is now known as our dual mandate — the Federal Reserve’s directive to help foster conditions that achieve both stable prices and maximum employment. Over the Fed’s 100 year history, three major historical episodes continue to provide lessons for today (chart 1). First, in the 1930s, the U.S. economy experienced a severe credit contraction and deflation during the Great Depression. Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz argued persuasively that inept monetary policy failed to combat these destructive deflationary forces.1 Second, in the 1970s, U.S. monetary policy tried to do too much to stimulate growth and reduce unemployment when unrecognized structural factors stood in the way. Overly accommodative policy led to soaring rates of inflation. Third, the Treasury Accord of 1951 reminds us that an essential feature of good monetary policy is an independent central bank — one that is autonomous enough to make tough policy decisions. But, democratically elected authorities don’t just grant autonomy to unelected central bankers, nor should they. The price of autonomy is accountability. In order to maintain autonomy, we need to say what we are trying to accomplish and then honestly evaluate our progress in a way that the public and their representatives can judge clearly.\n\n\n\nThe FOMC has recently made great strides in this direction by explicitly expositing a strategy that reflects the three key lessons of its history. The Committee’s “Statement of longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy\"2 was first made in January 2012 and has been reaffirmed each year since (chart 2). In it, the Committee indicates that price stability is understood to mean 2 percent inflation in the long run as measured by the annual change in the price index for total personal consumption expenditures (what we refer to as the PCE price index.) The 1930s’ deflation and the 1970s’ double-digit inflation clearly indicate that the nation is well-served by the Fed having a long-run inflation objective and making sure it achieves that objective within a reasonable period of time.\nThe employment mandate is more nuanced. Because maximum employment is determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure of the labor market, we can’t have a simple, time-invariant goal. We do, however, project where we think the longer-run normal, or “natural rate,” of unemployment is currently. Today, our estimates for this rate generally range between 5.2 percent and 5.6 percent. Such assessments can vary over time. However, the most important determinants of the natural rate change only slowly, so today’s assessment is an important input into policy. Being explicit about it contributes greatly to our accountability.\nA clear articulation of the FOMC’s goals and an explanation of how it views its policy misses and plans to correct them help the public better anticipate the Fed’s policy actions. In turn, the public’s improved understanding of FOMC policy actions increases their efficacy by reducing uncertainty over future financial conditions and how those actions might evolve with changes in the economic environment. So, what we clearly need is a scorecard that communicates our accountability in a straightforward manner.\n\nKeeping Score When There Are Two Goals\n\nI like to illustrate our balanced approach to achieving our dual-mandate goals with what I refer to as a bull’s-eye scorecard (chart 3). The bull’s-eye in the center illustrates where we would like to be. In this case, the goals are 2 percent inflation over the medium term and unemployment at its natural rate, taken here to be 5-1/4 percent, which is my long-run projection. The scorecard shows an equal weighting of policy misses around our inflation and unemployment objectives; that is, each circular ring is a collection of unemployment and inflation rates that should be equally uncomfortable for FOMC participants.3 For example, it tells us how the 9 percent unemployment rate we faced back in September 2011 can be depicted in “inflation-loss equivalent units” by showing the inflation rate that gives an equivalent loss when unemployment is at its sustainable rate. The answer is 5-1/2 percent inflation! The greater the distance the circle is from the center of the target, the greater are our policy misses. And the greater our policy misses, the greater are the social gains from aggressive monetary and other public policy actions to correct them.\nThe bull’s-eye scorecard approach has three benefits. First, it provides accountability by clearly describing success and failure to achieve our mandated goals. Second, it renders operational the concept of the FOMC’s intent to take a balanced approach in achieving our goals. Third, the bull’s-eye guides the public’s judgment of the FOMC’s likely response to current economic conditions. While we have made considerable progress toward our goals since 2011, we still have some ways to go to reach the bull’s-eye.\n\nMissing on the Full Employment Mandate\nThat’s certainly clear in the case of our employment mandate. While we’ve made much progress since the onset of the Great Recession when unemployment reached a high of 10 percent, 6.7 percent is still well above the 5-1/4 percent rate I think is the longer-run normal. Indeed, 6.7 percent is higher than the 6.3 percent peak unemployment rate in the previous recession.\nMoreover, we have to ask ourselves if this gap is a good measure of the current degree of slack in the labor market. For example, some of the decline in the unemployment rate over the past four years reflects people dropping out of the labor force instead of finding jobs. Of course, certain demographic factors such as the increasing number of baby boomers reaching retirement age mean we should have expected to see a substantial drop in labor force participation for reasons unrelated to cyclical job prospects and the health of the labor market. But, when you take a detailed look, it appears that the labor force participation rate has recently declined more than can be accounted for by demographic trends and other such structural factors alone. In addition, the end of extended unemployment insurance benefits and other factors likely have decreased the natural rate of unemployment that is our target. So, the decline in the unemployment rate likely overstates to some degree the reduction of slack in the labor market over the past year.\nThis discussion illustrates how difficult it is to judge where the labor market stands relative to our full employment mandate. A while back, this wasn’t such a critical issue: When the unemployment rate stood at 9 or 10 percent, it obviously far exceeded the natural rate of unemployment. Now, as the unemployment rate falls closer to its natural rate, disentangling structural from cyclical changes becomes more important. Thus, at this juncture, it is prudent to consider a wide range of indicators of labor market activity to better gauge the overall health of the labor market. In the press conference following the March FOMC meeting, Chair Janet Yellen indicated that, in addition to focusing on the official unemployment rate, the Committee considers a wide range of data in assessing labor market conditions.4 These include quit rates, layoffs and a variety of wage measures, as well as broader measures of unemployment that include discouraged workers and those who would like to work more hours.5 Generally, the evidence points to a still weak labor market. We still have some ways to go to reach our employment mandate.\n\nBelow Target on 2 Percent Inflation Goal, Too\nLet’s now turn to our price stability mandate. No one can doubt that we are undershooting our 2 percent target. Total PCE prices rose just 0.9 percent over the past 12 months; that is a substantial and serious miss. And, as the bull’s-eye chart shows, this undershooting has persisted for several years. Compounding these difficulties, below-target inflation is a worldwide phenomenon and it is difficult to be confident that all policymakers around the world have fully taken its challenge onboard. Persistent below-target inflation is very costly, especially when it is accompanied by debt overhang, substantial resource slack, and weak growth.\nIn the United States, the challenge of below-target inflation continues to be underappreciated in public commentary. Mistakenly, many greatly exaggerate the risks of overly high inflation. Before turning to inflation risks, let me mention one reason for some confusion. That is, some commentaries minimize the current below-target inflation experience by citing the slightly higher increases of the Consumer Price Index, or CPI. The CPI is the best-known single measure of inflation, and its underlying trend currently is running at a bit above 1-1/2 percent. Many commentators compare the CPI against our 2 percent inflation objective. Unfortunately, this is an apples and oranges comparison: The CPI tends to run about a quarter to a half of a percentage point higher on average than the PCE index because of its different market-basket composition and statistical construction. Accordingly, it is much more accurate to describe the Fed’s inflation objective in terms of the CPI to be roughly 2-1/2 percent. So, against this 2-1/2 percent benchmark, CPI inflation also is quite low relative to target. In any event, the PCE price index is the preferred inflation measure on a number of theoretical grounds and the one chosen by the FOMC as its policy target; therefore, we should judge the Committee’s ultimate inflation performance using that index relative to its 2 percent goal.\nSo, what is the inflation outlook in the current environment? Despite current low rates, I still often hear people say that higher inflation is just around the corner. I confess that I am somewhat exasperated by these repeated warnings given our current environment of very low inflation. Many times, the strongest concerns are expressed by folks who said the same thing back in 2009 and then in 2010 and, well, you get the picture. OK, five years later we still need to carefully assess this very serious question. Let me offer five reasons why I still see the economic environment as pointing to below-target inflation for several years.\nFirst, many commentators see rising commodity prices as a harbinger of rising inflation pressures. Certainly, back in 2008 and 2010 there were instances when energy and commodity prices rose to high levels. This put pressure on inflation and also reduced aggregate demand. There is a lot of evidence that these types of relative price increases result in only transitory increases in consumer price levels.6 At the moment, even these transitory upward pressures are absent, and the current weak state of global demand contributes to downward pressures. Until something unexpected, and frankly positive, happens with the world economy, commodity prices seem like an even more unlikely propellant for strongly rising inflation than they usually would be.\nSecond, some say a classic warning sign of inflation is the enormous size of the Fed’s balance sheet and the greater than $2.5 trillion of excess reserves sitting on commercial banks’ books. Surely, they say, enormous increases in the monetary base are likely to be accompanied by substantial price level increases. The problem with this story is that the banks have not been lending these reserves nearly enough to generate big increases in broad monetary aggregates. And even if they did, as an indicator of inflation, the monetary aggregates lost their predictive content many decades ago. The evidence, again, is that inflation remains low. But what if? What if lending picks up? Well, that would be really terrific. Dramatically higher bank lending would surely be associated with higher loan demand and a generally stronger economy. Strong growth and diminishing resource slack would be part of this story, and a rising rate environment would be a natural force diminishing the rising inflation pressures. In the meantime, monitoring the entire state of the economy along with inflation seems like a sensible and appropriate safeguard against this currently low probability scenario.\nThird, another potential source of inflationary pressures would be rising inflation expectations. Here, I mean a breakout of inflation expectations separate from any fundamentals that might accompany the previously discussed cases of rising commodity prices and stronger bank lending. One could think of this as the spontaneous combustion theory of inflation. The story goes like this: Households and businesses simply wake up one day and expect higher inflation is coming without any further improvement in economic fundamentals. Without appealing to esoteric economic theories of sunspots, these expectations don’t seem sustainable in the current environment. Higher inflation expectations would presumably get priced into higher bond-market yields and higher financing rates generally. Until inflation actually rises — remember, this story has expectations rising first — ex post real interest rates would be higher and that would presumably result in a higher debt burden for borrowers. This would reduce aggregate demand. Lower demand and lower growth would further reduce cost pressures, strongly suggesting that higher inflation expectations would not be ratified by inflation experience, and thus, would not be sustained. Frankly, this story just seems very unlikely.\nFourth, another more direct measure of potentially rising costs and hence inflation might be stronger wage growth. The economic story here is a bit involved. Most economic research indicates that rising wages are not a leading indicator of rising inflation, so wages are rarely an early warning signal for future inflation. However, higher inflation would lead to higher nominal wage growth. And the double-digit inflation experience of the 1970s suggests that inappropriately accommodative monetary policy can amplify rising cost pressures, creating a wage–price spiral. Clearly, unsustainably strong nominal wage increases would very likely be symptomatic of rising inflation pressures. In terms of the current situation, there is good news and bad news. The good news is that currently, wage increases are low and not symptomatic of high inflation. The bad news is that, currently, low wage increases are symptomatic of weak income growth and low aggregate demand. Stronger wage growth would likely result in more customers walking through the doors of business establishments and leading to stronger sales, more hiring and capacity expansion. During a normal and steady-growth business expansion, nominal wages would typically grow at the rate of productivity expansion plus compensation for inflation. If normal productivity growth is 1.5 percent and inflation is at our 2 percent target, this would suggest a steady labor compensation increase of 3-1/2 percent is sustainable without building inflation pressures. At today’s 2 to 2-1/4 percent compensation growth rates and labor’s historically low share of national income, there is substantial room for stronger wage growth without inflation pressures building.\nFifth, do we really know that the public’s expectations are for low inflation? Judging by today’s Treasury yield curve, inflation expectations remain below our target. If anyone was expecting inflation to accelerate in the future, surely individual and institutional investors would demand to be compensated for growing inflation risk. However, our Chicago Fed affine term-structure model implies that the three-year-ahead average inflation expectations priced into the Treasury yield curve currently are below 2 percent and remain so for quite a number of years to come. Given today’s unacceptably low inflation environment and the wealth of inflation indicators that point to continued below-target inflation, I think we need continued strongly accommodative monetary policy to get inflation back up to 2 percent within a reasonable time frame. After all, notice that the red and green regions of the bull’s-eye chart show modest inflation above 2 percent is much more acceptable than even 6 percent unemployment. The FOMC should be anxious to get to that bull’s-eye region as quickly as feasible given the long slow path to date.\n\nThe Fed’s Reaction Function\nI’ve spoken so far about how we are missing on our policy objectives. Obviously, the aim of policy is to eliminate those misses. How do we hit the bull’s-eye? What do we do operationally in terms of policy tools? In normal times, the FOMC moves it’s traditional policy tool, the federal funds rate, in order to influence aggregate demand and with it economic growth and inflation and disinflationary pressures.\n\n\n\nMany economists have studied the relationship between actual Fed actions and sensible, explicit policy rules that might capture the Fed’s policy reaction function (chart 4). Historically, Fed policy moves have been reasonably well described by simple policy rules, particularly the 1999 version of the so-called Taylor rule,7 that relate the federal funds rate to the differences of output (a proxy for employment) and inflation from their target levels and a constant term that is meant to capture the equilibrium real interest rate and the Fed’s inflation target. However, this rule does not always describe policy well. For example, given judgmental, but reasonable, choices for the Fed’s inflation objective before it adopted a 2 percent objective, the Taylor rule misses during the 1990s are big. Actually, in some cases they were bigger than those associated with the well-known and loud complaints lodged by John Taylor against the Fed for its 2003–06 deviations from the rule.8\nWhy do these misses occur? Well, the economy and the policies that optimally close deviations from our goals are more complicated than what can be captured by any simple rule. Taylor clearly recognized this in his 1993 article in which he stated: “While the analysis of these issues can be aided by quantitative methods, it is difficult to formulate them into a precise algebraic formula. Moreover, there will be episodes where monetary policy will need to be adjusted to deal with special factors. For example, the Federal Reserve provided additional reserves to the banking system after the stock-market break of October 19, 1987, and helped to prevent a contraction of liquidity and to restore confidence. The Fed would need more than a simple policy rule as a guide in such cases.\"9\nIn fact, during the most extraordinary times, such as the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath, the Taylor rule completely breaks down. Its prescription would have been to set policy rates at something like –5 percent in 2009. Such rates are just not feasible for the simple reason that nominal interest rates cannot go below zero; that is, rates cannot breach what we refer to as the zero lower bound, or ZLB. Moreover, there is no emergency handbook that comes with the rule that says what to do in this event. An apparently unstated branch of the Taylor 1993 rule includes setting the federal funds rate to zero during these circumstances and then simply waiting and presumably smiling confidently in public while holding to zero rates. As a rigid policy prescription, we are thus left with inaction. And inaction looks like policy abdication because we are left doing nothing to try to make timely progress in reducing policy misses. This rule cannot be the be-all and end-all for monetary policy; for a policy rule that some say should be enshrined in the Federal Reserve Act explicitly to govern the implementation of U.S. monetary policy, its prescriptions under the recent circumstances we’ve faced are an absolute failure.\nFurthermore, given that the Taylor rule has failed so badly and done so for so long, how can we be confident that its prescriptions will still be a good policy to follow once the rule says that the fed funds rate should rise above zero again? Indeed, that’s what many versions of the Taylor rule say today — that it’s time now to begin to increase the fed funds rate. How can we know if the policy prescriptions are from a reborn and healthy policy tool or perhaps instead from one still suffering from a zombie-like hangover in terms of its prescriptions?\nIt’s important to keep in mind that the Taylor rule’s theoretical underpinnings are loose, especially compared with the seminal 1979 John Taylor article10 on optimal monetary policy in a rational expectations model with sticky prices. Indeed, the Taylor rule parameters are not necessarily stable. In particular, consider the intercept term. The usual specification of the rule assumes that this intercept term is a constant 2 percent equilibrium level of the real interest rate. However, it is well known that equilibrium real rates of interest are not constant, and modern macroeconomic models of optimal monetary policy all take this into account. Assuming that the equilibrium real interest rate is constant is just as egregious an error as failing to account for the time-varying nature of the natural rate of unemployment. We all know that mis-specifying the natural rate of unemployment can lead to seriously inappropriate monetary policy outcomes like double-digit inflation in the 1970s. It certainly seems that the fallout from the financial crisis and persistent headwinds holding back economic activity are consistent with the equilibrium real interest rate being lower than usual today. Indeed, if you put any weight whatsoever on the secular stagnation hypothesis that Larry Summers and Paul Krugman have described,11 an appropriate analysis would recognize lower expected real rates of interest. In any event, the FOMC’s latest policy statement in March recognizes this possibility of lower real rates, as the Committee stated it currently anticipates that “even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target fed funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.”12\n\nConclusion\nDuring Ben Bernanke’s eight years as Fed Chair, the FOMC worked hard to make the Fed’s policy intentions clear; and I am confident that the FOMC under Chair Yellen will continue along this same path. When the federal funds rate got stuck at zero and goal-oriented monetary policy said to do more, we did more! We implemented the following: the first quantitative easing program, or QE1, in March 2009;13 QE2 in fall 2010; the initial forward guidance on the federal funds rate in August 2011; Operation Twist in fall 2011; the open-ended QE3 in fall 2012; and the enhanced threshold forward guidance in December 2012. All of these were ways to go beyond the policy inaction that was the prescription of simple constrained policy rules, and do something to meet our policy mandates.\nIn conclusion, let me ask again, what is the accountability test? Much has been done; however, looking at the bull’s-eye scorecard, I would argue, if anything, the FOMC has been less aggressive than the policy loss function calls for. And to me, in the current circumstances, accountability and optimal policy mean we should be maintaining a large degree of accommodation for some time. Policies that would instead place us on a slow glide path toward our targets undermine the credibility of our claim that we will do our job and meet mandated policy goals in a timely fashion. Timid policies would also increase the risk of progress being stymied along the way by adverse shocks that might hit before policy gaps are closed. The surest and quickest way to reach our objectives is to be aggressive. This means, too, that we must be willing to overshoot our targets in a manageable fashion. Such risks are optimal if the outcome of our policy actions implies smaller average deviations from our targets over the medium term. We should be willing to undertake such policies and clearly communicate our willingness to do so.\n\nNotes\n1 Friedman and Schwartz (1963).\n2 Federal Open Market Committee (2014c).\n3 Putting equal weight on (squared) inflation and unemployment deviations is reasonably standard. Given Okun’s law, this is equivalent to a formulation that weights inflation deviations four times more heavily than output deviations.

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you, Mr. Naqvi. It is truly a pleasure to be here today at the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference, and I thank the organizers for including me in this impressive program.\nToday, I would like to make three points concerning the U.S. economy and accommodative monetary policy. First, the U.S. economy continues to improve, and accommodative monetary policy will remain a strong support for this recovery for quite some time. Second, although highly accommodative monetary policy can lead to increasing inflation risks today, inflation in the United States is too low. And this is true throughout much of the world. Third, while low interest rates could lead to financial exuberance in principle, monetary policy is not the best tool to mitigate this risk. Instead, macroprudential policies are more appropriate tools to address the risk of financial instability.\nBefore turning to the details of these three points, I need to note that, as always, the standard Fed disclaimer applies: I will be giving my personal perspective, and that is not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nRecent Monetary Policy Actions\nAs you all know, in response to the unusual economic circumstances generated by the financial crisis and the Great Recession, the FOMC lowered our traditional policy tool — the target federal funds rate — to near-zero levels in December 2008 and has kept it there since. With the fed funds rate constrained at this lower bound, and economic conditions requiring additional policy accommodation, the Committee also deployed nontraditional policy tools to stimulate activity. We embarked upon large-scale purchases of long-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. We also used new communications tools to provide forward guidance about how long short-term interest rates will essentially remain at their lower bound of zero.\nWhile large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance are unconventional tools, their effect on interest rates and real economic activity is quite conventional. Both tools are aimed at stimulating economic activity through lower long-term interest rates. Through arbitrage and portfolio rebalancing, lower rates in one market are transmitted to other interest rates faced by investors, nonfinancial firms and consumers. Lower rates are also transmitted across the asset and maturity spectrum. There is significant evidence that the FOMC’s policies have been helpful in reducing financing costs rates paid by firms and consumers and, more generally, in supporting aggregate demand in the face of substantial economic headwinds over the past six years.\nIt should be noted that economic activity picked up momentum in the second half of 2013. Overall, real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at a bit under a 3-1/2 percent rate in the second half, up from an average pace of growth of about 2 percent over the previous three years. Moreover, we’ve seen some more solid consumer spending, which should provide further impetus to overall growth this year. In the labor market, job growth has been solid and the unemployment rate is down to 6.7 percent. That is well below the 8.1 percent rate that prevailed when we instituted the latest round of large-scale asset purchases in September 2012.\nHowever, we aren’t out of the woods yet. The harsh weather of this past winter — by which I mean the North American polar vortex — makes the recent data difficult to interpret. That said, some of them have been on the soft side. Balance sheet scars from the financial crisis are still weighing on the economy. Fiscal policy is a restraint on economic growth. And economic activity abroad is not robust. The good news is that all of these headwinds appear to be dissipating. But risks remain. And we still have large resource gaps. For example, the unemployment rate is still well above the 5-1/4 percent rate I think it should be in the long run. At the same time, inflation is only 1 percent — well below the FOMC’s longer-run target of 2 percent. Accordingly, monetary policy is highly accommodative, and needs to remain so for some time.\nGiven these developments, the FOMC began adjusting the mix of its tools in December. The Committee, however, is maintaining the overall highly accommodative stance of policy. The Committee modestly reduced the pace of its monthly asset purchases from $85 billion to $55 billion in three separate $10 billion steps. In addition, with the unemployment rate approaching the 6-1/2 percent threshold that was established in December 2012, the Committee decided it was time to update its forward guidance on the future path of short-term interest rates. Our policy statement now emphasizes that when deciding how long short-term rates will remain at their current level, the Committee will use a wide range of information to assess the realized and expected progress toward our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability. The statement also indicates that given the Committee’s current assessment of these factors, it likely will be appropriate to keep the fed funds rate at its current level for a considerable period after the asset purchase program ends. Furthermore, even after the economy lifts off and employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions likely will warrant keeping short-term rates below their typical long-run level for some time.\nThe various asset purchases the Fed has undertaken since 2008 have expanded our balance sheet more than fourfold, to over $4 trillion dollars. Moreover, according to the FOMC’s projections and the latest market expectations, by the time the policy rate increases, it will have been near zero for about seven years. These are startling facts and should certainly get your attention! As prudent policymakers, we would be remiss if we failed to carefully assess potential risks that might arise from these unusual and extraordinary policies.\nAs the FOMC’s communications indicate, the Committee has fully reviewed the potential costs of its policies and it reassesses them regularly. I think that the benefits of our policy choices continue to far outweigh the potential risks. However, we must repeatedly think long and hard about two risks that are mentioned often — namely, that our expanded balance sheet and the prolonged period of low rates raise 1) the risk of higher inflation; and 2) the risk of financial instability. What can go wrong? Do we have the appropriate infrastructure and tools to adequately assess and manage these risks? To address these questions, we must evaluate these risks within the context of the goals of monetary policy and the current state of the economy and financial markets.\n\nInflation Risks\nLet me start with the risk of high inflation. As far back as mid-2009, Fed critics warned that our near-zero policy rate and trillions of dollars in asset purchases risk generating very high inflation. On several occasions, to underscore this risk, I have been presented with a gift of a Zimbabwe 100 trillion dollar note. As someone who is subject to a 20 U.S. dollar limit on gifts, I can assure you it is within the guidelines to accept one of these notes.\nThe monetary policy mandates of the Federal Reserve are clear: We must foster monetary and financial conditions that support maximum employment and price stability. Since January 2012, the Fed has set an explicit goal for inflation of 2 percent, as measured by the price index for total personal consumption expenditures, or PCE. So, how are we doing with respect to this 2 percent target and our Zimbabwean risks?\nDespite many earlier predictions of unacceptably high inflation, total PCE inflation has been hovering around just 1 percent since early 2013. Other inflation measures, notably, the well-known Consumer Price Index (CPI), are also well below their related benchmarks.1 Forecasters often look at core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, because it is a better predictor of where overall prices are headed than is total inflation. Our progress toward the inflation target is not noticeably faster by this metric either. Core PCE inflation was just 1.1 percent over the past year and has been at this rate since last spring. Most private sector forecasts and survey measures of inflation expectations have remained well anchored and do not ring any alarms of high inflation. Expectations embedded in asset prices tell a similar story. Sophisticated models that extract inflation expectations from the yield curve show that investors’ inflation expectations at the three-year horizon are below 2 percent and will be below 2 percent for several years.\nAll told, the risk of high inflation seems very low. In fact, I am concerned that inflation will not pick up quickly enough. As I noted, we have been stuck at 1 percent inflation since early 2013, and there is little indication of a pickup in the recent data. Low inflation is just as economically costly as high inflation. When we set an inflation target of 2 percent, we need to hit our target without too much delay. Simply put, we need to average 2 percent inflation over the medium term.\nAccordingly, the current 1 percent inflation situation calls for extended policy accommodation. If the Fed embarked prematurely on more restrictive monetary policy conditions, these adverse actions would work to reduce inflation to further unacceptably low levels. That’s going in the wrong direction.2\n\nFinancial Stability and Monetary Policy\nIt is easy and most natural for a Fed policymaker to talk about inflation. Price stability is one of the explicit goals of monetary policy as mandated by the U.S. Congress. Financial stability risks are more complicated. How does financial stability dovetail with the Fed’s dual mandate? There is clearly an interdependent relationship between them. A strong economy with low inflation provides a key stabilizing force for beneficial credit intermediation and robust financial market functioning. At the same time, stable and well-functioning financial markets are essential for achieving maximum employment and price stability. The global experience since 2008 reinforces this critical interplay between monetary and financial conditions.\nHowever, beyond these basic principles, what is the appropriate monetary policy stance for achieving both financial stability and the dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability?\nWith inflation running well below our 2 percent longer-run target and the unemployment rate still well above its normal long-term level, appropriate monetary policy dictates that low real interest rates should prevail until the economy is further along a sustainable path to its potential level and inflation is closer to target. Nonetheless, it is common to hear the argument that these highly accommodative monetary policies might sow the seeds of financial instability.\nThe fear is that excessive and persistently low interest rates would lead to excessive risk-taking by some investors. For instance, some firms, such as life insurance companies and pension funds, are under pressure to meet a stream of fixed liabilities incurred when interest rates were higher.3 (And perhaps these liabilities were offered at somewhat generous terms to begin with.) To meet commitments like these in the current low interest rate environment, some firms have an incentive to reach for yield by investing in excessively risky assets. Furthermore, with the costs of borrowing at historically low levels, other investors might simply decide that this is a good time to cheaply amplify the risk and return in their portfolios by taking on more leverage.\nOne could reach the conclusion that historically low and stable interest rates pose a threat to financial stability. This creates a seeming paradox for policymakers. On the one hand, the existing large shortfalls in aggregate demand call for highly accommodative monetary policies and historically low interest rates. On the other hand, such policies have the potential to raise the likelihood of financial instability in the future.\nSo, the questions that I’m often asked regarding these matters are as follows: Do the regulators and the Fed have adequate safeguards in place to mitigate this potential financial risk? If not, should the FOMC step away from what we thought was the best monetary policy with respect to our dual mandate? Should we discard our nonconventional tools and raise the fed funds rate in order to reduce the possibility of undesirable financial imbalances in the future?\nI don’t believe that such monetary policy adjustment is the right approach. I think the inference that persistently low interest rates pose a danger to financial stability is based on a narrow view of the economy. This narrow view is unlikely to survive a broader analysis that takes into account all the interactions between financial markets and real economic activity.\nIf more restrictive monetary policies were pursued to generate higher interest rates, they would likely result in higher unemployment and a sharp decline in asset prices, choking the moderate recovery. Such an adverse economic outcome is unlikely to set a favorable foundation for financial stability. Moreover, our short-term interest rate tools are too blunt to have a significant effect only on those pockets of the financial system that are most prone to inappropriate risk-taking. At the same time, these blunt tools could significantly damage other markets, as well as the growth prospects for the economy as a whole. Therefore, stepping away from otherwise appropriate monetary policy to address potential financial instability risks would degrade progress toward maximum employment and price stability. This approach would be a particularly poor choice when other tools are available, at lower social costs, to address the risk of financial instability.\nLet me be clear. I am not saying that financial stability concerns are not relevant for the economy or that policymakers should not take decisive action against developments that threaten financial stability. Rather, I am saying that the macroprudential tools available to policymakers are better-suited safeguards to addressing financial risks directly. These macroprudential actions can be dialed up or down given the appropriate setting of monetary policy tools; so, undesirable macroeconomic outcomes are less likely than if we were to resort to premature monetary tightening. Indeed, any decision to instead rely on more-restrictive interest rate policies to achieve financial stability at the expense of poorer macroeconomic outcomes must pass a cost–benefit test. And such a test would have to clearly illustrate that the adverse economic outcomes from more-restrictive interest rate policies would be better and more acceptable to society than the outcomes that can be achieved by using enhanced supervisory tools alone to address financial stability risks. I have yet to see this argued convincingly.\n\nMacroprudential Tools\nLet’s discuss some of these macroprudential tools.\nOne simple but important tool is enhanced monitoring. Even before the recent financial crisis, central bankers were well aware of the key role played by stable financial markets in economic activity. Since the crisis, however, the analysis of financial stability issues has been greatly expanded and given a more prominent role in the FOMC’s deliberations. We comb through reams of data looking for evidence of incipient risks to financial stability.\nThe Federal Reserve also has revamped its approach to bank supervision substantially to expand the focus on macrofinancial risks. Traditional bank supervisory tools are being used more intensively, and new tools have been developed. Bank capital stress tests are one well-known addition to our supervisory toolkit. Another is the augmentation of traditional microprudential supervisory work that analyzes individual institutions with efforts that take a wide-angle view of the banking industry. Supervisors look to identify common trends across institutions and emerging concentrations of risks that might pose systemic threats to the financial system. This broad view also allows supervisors to better identify sound practices among firms and incorporate them into supervisory reviews and the feedback provided in them.\nThe Federal Reserve also has greatly expanded its surveillance efforts to financial markets outside of the traditional banking sector, such as the insurance industry and financial market utilities. These efforts are not confined to financial institutions per se, and reach a range of activities that might pose a potential threat to financial stability. For instance, staff members from the Chicago Fed are actively engaged in assessing the role of high-frequency computerized trading in securities and derivatives markets and associated risks that might arise with it.\nThese are just a few examples of regulatory tools available to monitor and promote financial stability. And there are a host of other instruments in our toolkit, such as resolution plans, liquidity requirements and single counterparty credit limits. All are examples of improvements in supervisory practices aimed at reducing the likelihood of systemic disruptions and containing the impact should such disruptions occur.\n\nConclusion\nTo reiterate, I currently expect that low inflation and still-high unemployment will mean that the short-term policy rate will remain near zero well into 2015. In this environment, some have questioned the ability of our supervisory and regulatory tools to adequately address potential financial instability risks. They argue that a broad tightening of interest rate policy might be more effective in catching incipient risks that might fall through the cracks. It is certainly true that higher interest rates would permeate the entire financial system. But this is just another way of saying that raising interest rates is a blunt tool. Higher interest rates would reduce risk-taking where it is excessive; but they also would result in a pullback in economic activity in sectors where risk-taking might already be overly restrained. That’s how a blunt tool works.\nIf you believe that financial stability can only be achieved through higher interest rates — interest rates that would do immediate damage to meeting our dual mandate goals at a time when unemployment is still unacceptably high — then we ought to at least ask ourselves if the financial system has become too big and too complex.\nThink about how problematic the cost-benefit calculus becomes if the only way we can achieve financial stability is to raise interest rates above the level where the forces of demand and supply in the real economy put them. The possible benefit of such a restrictive rate move would be to reduce risks that might be forming in the nooks and crannies of a highly complex financial system. But the costs would be 1) higher unemployment; 2) a risk of choking off the economic recovery; 3) even lower inflation below our objective; and, somewhat paradoxically, 4) the introduction of new financial risks by reducing asset values and credit quality. Given such cost-benefit trade-offs, I would have to question whether the financial system has become too complex — perhaps complex enough to generate negative social value. Rather than degrading our macroeconomic performance through suboptimal monetary policies, I would have to consider whether we should contemplate big changes to the financial system — a lot more rules, substantially higher capital requirements for all institutions and maybe even fewer financial products.\nHowever, I have a more favorable view of the social value of our financial system and the efficacy of supervision and regulation. Since the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has expanded its macroprudential toolkit and enhanced its microprudential tools. We have also reoriented our approach to supervision to take full advantage of the Federal Reserve System’s wide-ranging expertise on macroeconomic and financial developments and risks.\nI believe that these regulatory efforts can effectively minimize the risks of another crisis and increase the resiliency of the financial system. We can achieve these objectives without having to resort to wholesale changes to the financial system and without degrading our monetary policy goals. Maintaining the effectiveness of the financial system for generating more-robust economic growth continues to be a crucial objective for public policy. Thank you for your time, and I would be happy to take your questions.\n\nNotes\n1 Because of some differences in product coverage and statistical methodologies, total CPI inflation tends to average 1/4 to 1/2 percentage points higher than total PCE inflation. Hence, the FOMC’s 2 percent target on total PCE inflation would translate to a 2.3 percent to 2.5 percent target for total CPI inflation.\n2 I recently discussed the costs of too-low inflation and the implications of having a 2 percent inflation target in a January 15 speech; see Evans (2014).\n3 I should note that increases in interest rates since last spring have increased discount factors and thus lowered the present value of pension fund and other fixed nominal liabilities. For instance, see Fitch Ratings (2013).\n\nReferences\nEvans, Charles, 2014, \"Recurring themes for the New Year,\" speech, Corridor Economic Forecast Luncheon, Coralville, IA, January 15.\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2013, meeting minutes, December 17–18.\nFitch Ratings, 2013, \"Fitch: U.S. corporate pension plans underfunded status improves,\" press release, New York, August 15.",

            "content": "Thank you for inviting me to speak today about monetary policy strategy and communications. Before I begin my comments, let me note that the views I express here are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago or of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System.\nCommunications are critical for effective monetary policy strategy – they are inextricably linked. There are different approaches to, and much debate regarding, best practices. One approach is to have a full-throated discussion at the FOMC meetings, release a statement summarizing our view and then have the Chair hold a quarterly press conference to announce and explain the policy action to the public. This approach also includes describing how the action is intended to achieve the Committee’s policy goals. These post-meeting communications are followed by the release of the minutes, which give a fuller description of the comments made at the meeting. An alternative approach is to adopt a simple policy rule, like Taylor’s 1993 policy rule. The Committee would follow the policy rule prescription and report on any particular details regarding how the rule was implemented at each meeting. Again, a press conference could be used as a communications enhancement.\n\nAlthough all central banks face these strategy and communications issues, and they implement them somewhat differently, my view is that 90 percent of the communications challenge is met by expressing policy intentions clearly so that the public can understand the Federal Reserve’s goals and how the Fed is committed to achieving these goals in a timely fashion.A clear expression of policy intentions requires stating the Fed’s policy goals clearly and explicitly. These messages need to be repeated – over and over again. It is also necessary to clearly demonstrate our commitment to achieving these goals in a timely fashion with policy actions.\nAn equivalent and more operational statement of this principle is that the Fed should follow a goal-oriented monetary policy strategy and should provide full accountability.\nNotice the links between these two statements: “Express policy intentions clearly so that the public can understand the Federal Reserve’s goals” is captured by “follow a goal-oriented monetary policy strategy.” “The Fed’s commitment to achieving these goals in a timely fashion” is captured by “provide full accountability.” The final 10 percent of communications represents details that are crucially important for individuals and market participants, but the first 90 percent is the key to the public’s understanding of our policies.\n\nThroughout the Great Recession, financial crisis and weak recovery, the Bernanke FOMC followed this goal-oriented approach. The September 2012 open-ended quantitative-easing (QE) program indicated the FOMC’s clear intention to facilitate maximum employment in a more timely fashion. The numerical forward-guidance thresholds we introduced in December 2012 reinforced this communication. The September 2013 decision to delay tapering the QE3 purchase rate was another clear indication of our intentions, as it further reinforced the data-dependence of this nontraditional monetary policy action.\n\nThe January 2012 statement of long-run monetary policy strategy clearly expresses the FOMC’s policy intentions: It states that the FOMC’s explicit inflation objective is 2 percent for the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) in the long run and that maximum employment is associated with a sustainable unemployment rate that properly reflects structural developments that may alter this rate over time. Our long-run strategy also points to the Committee’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) to provide a range of values for the sustainable unemployment rate. Currently, the central tendency for this range is between 5¼ percent and 5¾ percent. Finally, our strategy states that the Committee will use a balanced approach to reduce deviations from our long-run objectives.\nThis balanced approach implies strongly that our policy loss function can provide what I refer to as “bull’s-eye” accountability. This entire chart is like a simple “corporate scorecard” for our two-dimensional policy objectives in unemployment and inflation outcomes. The circles provide collections of unemployment and inflation rates that are equally uncomfortable for FOMC participants. The chart clearly depicts the unemployment dilemma that the Committee still faced as of September 2011. For example, it tells us how a 9 percent unemployment rate can be depicted in “inflation-loss equivalent units” by showing what inflation rate gives an equivalent loss when unemployment is at its sustainable rate. The answer is 5½ percent inflation! All post-Volcker central bankers would respond to 5½ percent inflation as if their “hair was on fire.” Such a situation would call for strong and decisive monetary action. The bull’s-eye scorecard provides accountability. And indeed, in response to this loss, the FOMC acted. The FOMC had already employed QE2 in the fall of 2010. In August 2011, the FOMC employed a form of forward guidance and followed that up in September 2011 with the Maturity Extension Program, or “Operation Twist.”\nThe most recent December 2013 Summary of Economic Projections shows that the Committee forecasts that unemployment and inflation will reach the bull’s-eye mark by the fourth quarter of 2016. This is a relatively slow attainment of our long-run goals. It also should be pointed out that these are still just projections of improvement, yet to be achieved. Nevertheless, the enhancements to our communications in recent years go a long way toward meeting our communications objectives by using this scorecard to depict progress toward our dual mandate goals.\nOur actions are strongly reinforced when the public knows that the FOMC is committed to achieving the bull’s-eye within a reasonable period of time with appropriate monetary policy actions. This is particularly true for unconventional policy actions. For example, consider Chairman Bernanke’s April 2012 press conference. At this event, numerous questions from journalists expressed skepticism that the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections indicated a clear commitment to closing the unemployment gap in a timely fashion. Following the adoption of our January 2012 strategy document, this public questioning was trying to assess whether these forecasts reflected a difference of opinion between the FOMC and the public on what is a “balanced approach to reducing imbalances,” or whether the forecast reflected the difficult and time-consuming process of consensus policy decision-making. In either case, the open public discussion of the issue enhanced the Fed’s accountability regarding the bull’s-eye scorecard. The entire discussion was taking place in public and contemporaneously with the policy decision. This is goal-oriented monetary policy with accountability. It is the combination of our January 2012 strategy statement, the quarterly SEP, the Chair’s press conference and repetition.\nSo, my claim is that to be any good, monetary policy communications regarding policy actions must be consistent with the Fed expressing policy intentions clearly, so that the public can understand the Fed’s goals and its commitment to achieving these goals in a timely fashion. This should be a principle for all effective monetary policy strategies and communications: to state monetary policy intentions clearly.\nI will now be critical of incomplete attempts to solve this strategy and communications challenge by invoking and following an overly simple policy rule. John Taylor has repeatedly argued that the Fed has failed because it has not followed the 1993 Taylor rule. In March 2011, during his Senate testimony, Chairman Bernanke was asked why the Fed had not followed the Taylor rule.1 Chairman Bernanke replied that Fed policy has been remarkably consistent with the 1999 version of the Taylor rule. He also pointed out several issues associated with the fact that there is a zero lower bound on the fed funds rate.\nFor me, there is a problem with simplistic approaches. Simple Taylor rules fail the strategic principle to express policy intentions clearly. At the zero lower bound, simple rules simply cannot be implemented. Accordingly, they cannot express policy intentions and do not allow the public to clearly understand the Fed goals and the Fed’s commitment to achieving these goals in a timely fashion. During quieter, normal times when short-term interest rates are 2 percent or more, many approaches may work. But how structurally sound are these simple rules? If a policy rule is sturdy, the test of its structural foundation comes when a hurricane or an earthquake hits.\nThe 1999 Taylor rule captures Fed policy reasonably well during normal times. I’d note, though, that the Taylor errors in the 1990s are big – actually, bigger than the loudest complaint that John Taylor lodges against the Fed for the 2003–06 violations of the rule.\nOf course, the rule completely breaks down during the Great Recession and its aftermath. It says to set the federal funds rate at minus 5 percent in 2009. We can’t do that. Moreover, there is no emergency handbook that comes with the rule that says what to do in this event. The effective policy rule is really the maximum of zero and the prescription from real rates and output and inflation gaps. We are thus left with inaction, and inaction looks like policy abdication and a failure to make timely progress in reducing policy imbalances. In these cases, this “policy rule” fails to provide clear policy intentions to achieve goals in a timely fashion and it fails to produce accountability at the zero lower bound. This rule cannot be the be all and end all — for a policy rule that some suggest should govern the implementation of monetary policy in the U.S., this is an absolute failure.\nFurthermore, once the rule has failed, and done so for so long, how can we be confident that its prescriptions will still be a good policy to follow once the rule says that the fed funds rate should rise above zero again? More generally, it is difficult to figure out how to jury-rig work-arounds for these simple rules, because they often have a loose and ad hoc relationship between economic theory and the right-hand-side variables and parameters. It is particularly disconcerting that simple Taylor-type rules are typically offered without an explicit theoretical underpinning for the rule. Consider Taylor 1993. This specification follows a “rule of 2s:” 2 percent inflation objective relative to pre-1992 experience, 2 percent equilibrium real interest rate and parameter weights of ½.\nThe resulting constant intercept term in the rule is particularly vexing. It is well known that policy actions that fail to account for the time-varying nature of the natural rate of unemployment can lead to seriously inappropriate monetary outcomes — like double-digit inflation in the 1970s. Just as relevantly, it is well known that the equilibrium real interest rate is not a constant. However, the Taylor rule sets this intercept at 2 percent — a constant. How is this less egregious than simply assuming that the natural rate of unemployment is always 4 percent? Consider Larry Summers’ recent hypothesis that the U.S. may be facing a secular stagnation, which would contemplate a lower and perhaps negative equilibrium real rate. Maybe that is a small risk, but it has an extraordinarily high policy loss associated with the wrong robotic prescriptions for policy. According to Mehra and Prescott (1985), the historical average short-term real interest rate is less than 1 percent, with large variations over the long period they study.2\nAs I mentioned earlier, the Bernanke FOMC has worked hard to make the Fed’s policy intentions clear and provide accountability for our nontraditional policy actions to support more timely achievement of our goals. With the January 2012 long-run policy strategy, policy intentions are explicit: Get to bull’s-eye with labor market near 5½ percent unemployment rate and PCE inflation at 2 percent. When the federal funds rate is stuck at zero and goal-oriented monetary policy says do more — Do more! The quantitative-easing programs and enhanced forward guidance on short-term interest rates reflect a commitment to a clear policy principle. The Bernanke FOMC’s attention to policy misses has been vigilant throughout. And so the misses have led us to numerous policy interventions: QE1 in March 2009; QE2 in fall 2010; the forward guidance in August 2011; Operation Twist in fall 2011; the open-ended QE3 in fall 2012; and the threshold forward guidance in December 2012. What is the accountability test? Although much has been done — looking at the bull’s-eye scorecard — if anything, the FOMC has been less aggressive than the policy loss function might admit.\nDespite the enhancements in recent years, there are remaining communications challenges regarding Fed policy intentions. The Fed has demonstrated that it will act aggressively to reduce resource slack when it is well away from its objective. It is less clear the public understands that we should be willing to overshoot our objectives in order to more speedily re-attain our goals. A slow glide toward our goals from large imbalances risks being stymied along the way and is more likely to fail if adverse shocks hit beforehand. The surest and quickest way to get to the objective is to be willing to overshoot in a manageable fashion. With regard to our inflation objective, we need to repeatedly state clearly that our 2 percent objective is not a ceiling for inflation. Our “balanced approach” to reducing imbalances clearly indicates our symmetric attitudes toward our 2 percent inflation objective.\n\nLet me point out another misperception regarding our inflation objective. It must be noted repeatedly that our 2 percent inflation objective is for the PCE price index. The more popular Consumer Price Index (CPI) tends to run about a quarter to a half point higher on average than the PCE index. Accordingly, this implies that price stability in terms of CPI inflation is higher, closer to 2½ percent. This is particularly important to note since a number of useful measures such as the Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) inflation compensation that we and market participants so often refer to is in terms of the higher CPI numbers. Moreover, consumer inflation expectations likely are closer to CPI expectations, since the CPI is restricted to out-of-pocket expenditures and gets used for Social Security adjustments and the like. The PCE price index is the preferred inflation measure on theoretical grounds, and so it is the appropriate index to use for our inflation target; but as policymakers, we should call attention to these inflation measurement discrepancies in order to best communicate our policy intentions and make sure the public correctly interprets our policy goals.\nThere is a very real risk of confusion on this score. Last Friday, Jon Hilsenrath of the Wall Street Journal, who follows Fed communications very closely, mentioned that CPI inflation, at 1.6 percent, was rising a bit and it was getting closer to the Fed’s 2 percent objective.3 That is misleading. Our 2 percent objective is with respect to the PCE index. For the CPI, 2½ percent is a more accurate calibration of our price stability goal.\nTo conclude, clear communication is key to effective monetary policy strategy. I believe the Fed can meet 90 percent of its communications challenge by seeking to: “Express policy intentions clearly so that the public can understand the Federal Reserve’s goals and the Fed’s commitment to achieving these goals in a timely fashion.”\n\nNotes\n1 Ben S.

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you. It is truly a pleasure to be here today and have the opportunity to speak to the Detroit Economic Club. And it is a particular pleasure to be introduced by Carl (Camden, president and chief executive officer of Kelly Services). This past December, Carl completed his service as the chair of the Detroit Branch of the Chicago Fed after previously serving as a member of our board and on our advisory council. Carl has always been exceedingly generous in sharing his time and perspective on a wide range of issues. We are very grateful for his contributions, and it’s terrific to be able to continue that association through events like this. There are also a number of our current and former Detroit directors in the audience today, and it is great to see you all as well.\nWe have made much progress since the financial crisis began and the economy dropped into a deep recession. Since 2008, short-term interest rates have been near zero and are likely to remain at that level for some time. Over that period, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has expanded more than fourfold to over $4 trillion. Yet, in recent months, we’ve seen growth in economic activity gain some additional traction, and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has begun to taper its asset purchases. This afternoon, I would like to discuss our recent policy actions and some of the issues we face. As always, I will be giving my personal perspective, which is not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the FOMC or in the Federal Reserve System.\nIn a refreshing departure from the past several years, growth in economic activity in 2013 actually did not fall short of our forecasts made at the beginning of the year. Labor markets improved substantially, and the economy is entering 2014 with much better momentum. In light of this improved performance, the Federal Reserve began in December to adjust the mix of its monetary policy tools modestly. We started to taper our asset purchases, but we indicated that the fed funds rate would be near zero for quite some time — quite likely well into 2015. Barring any changes to our outlook, this would translate into seven years in which short-term interest rates would be at their zero lower bound. But policy likely will need to remain highly accommodative for such a time to ensure we make adequate progress toward maximum employment and price stability — the two congressionally mandated goals for U.S. monetary policy.1\nThe deep recession, financial distress and prolonged slow recovery clearly called for such unusually accommodative monetary policy. Nonetheless, we need to be wary of any potential risks that might accompany the prolonged period of low interest rates. Most critical analysts often highlight two risks: unacceptably high inflation and financial exuberance that leads to instability. These are legitimate risks to consider. By my assessment, the risk of high inflation is fairly remote. In fact, today inflation in the U.S. and other advanced countries is too low, and I am concerned that inflation will run too low for too long. Regarding potential financial instability risks, I think the scenarios are more nuanced. But by my reading, these risks currently do not warrant altering the stance of monetary policy.2 In fact, altering the current trajectory of monetary policy in order to mitigate these risks would likely degrade progress toward achieving maximum employment and price stability. If broad risks to financial stability were to become more prominent, the Federal Reserve has more effective tools to contain them than adjusting interest rates.\n\nRecent Monetary Policy Actions\nIn my remarks this afternoon, I will discuss recent monetary policy actions and financial stability risks. Let me begin with recent economic developments and monetary policy.\nAs you all know, in response to the unusual economic circumstances generated by the financial crisis and the Great Recession, the FOMC brought down the target federal funds rate, its traditional policy tool, to near-zero levels — as low as it can go — and has kept it there since 2008. With the fed funds rate constrained at this lower bound and economic conditions requiring additional policy accommodation, the Committee also deployed nontraditional policy tools to stimulate activity: namely, large-scale purchases of long-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, as well as forward guidance about how long short-term interest rates would essentially remain at their lower bound of zero.\nWhile large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance are unconventional tools, their effect on interest rates and real economic activity is quite conventional. Both tools are aimed at stimulating economic activity through lower long-term rates. Through arbitrage and portfolio rebalancing, lower rates in one market — whether it’s the fed funds market or the Treasury and mortgage-backed securities markets — are transmitted to other rates faced by investors, nonfinancial firms and consumers, as well as across the asset and maturity spectrum. There is significant evidence that the FOMC’s policies have been helpful in lowering rates paid by firms and consumers and, more generally, in supporting aggregate demand in the face of the substantial headwinds the economy has faced over the past six years.\nMost recently, economic activity picked up momentum in the second half of 2013. Overall, real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at over a 3-1/2 percent rate in the second half, up from an average pace of growth of about 2 percent over the previous three years. Moreover, we’ve seen a marked pickup in consumer spending, which should provide further impetus to overall growth this year. In the labor market, job growth has been solid and the unemployment rate is down to 6.7 percent — well below the 8.1 percent rate that prevailed when we instituted the latest round of large-scale asset purchases in September 2012.\nHowever, we aren’t out of the woods yet. Balance sheet scars from the financial crisis are still weighing on the economy. Fiscal policy is a restraint on economic growth. And economic activity abroad is not robust. The good news is that all of these headwinds appear to be dissipating. But risks remain. And we still have large resource gaps — for example, the unemployment rate is still well above the 5-1/4 percent rate I think it should be in the long run. At the same time, inflation is only 1 percent — well below the FOMC’s longer-run target of 2 percent. Accordingly, monetary policy is highly accommodative, and needs to remain so for some time.\nGiven these developments, the FOMC adjusted the mix of its tools in December and last week, but maintained the overall highly accommodative stance of policy. The Committee modestly reduced the pace of its monthly asset purchases from $85 billion to $65 billion in two separate $10 billion steps. In addition, the FOMC strengthened its forward guidance on the future path of short-term interest rates by emphasizing that rates are likely to remain at very low levels well past the time the unemployment rate declines below the 6-1/2 percent threshold that was established in December 2012 — especially if inflation is expected to run below the 2 percent target.\nNotwithstanding these modest changes to the mix of tools, monetary policy will remain highly accommodative for some time. Asset purchases have expanded our balance sheet more than fourfold to over $4 trillion dollars. Moreover, by the time rates increase, they will have been near zero for about seven years, according to the FOMC’s projections and the latest market expectations. These are startling facts and certainly get your attention. As prudent policymakers, we would be AWOL if we failed to carefully assess potential risks that might arise from these unusual and extraordinary policies.\nAs the FOMC’s communications indicate, the Committee has fully reviewed the potential costs of its policies and assesses them regularly. I think that the benefits of our policy choices continue to far outweigh the potential risks. However, we must repeatedly think long and hard about two risks that are mentioned often — namely, that our expanded balance sheet and prolonged period of low rates raise the risk of financial instability and also the risk of producing higher inflation. What can go wrong? Do we have the appropriate infrastructure and tools to adequately assess and manage the risks? To address these questions, we must evaluate these risks within the context of the goals of monetary policy and the current state of the economy and financial markets.\n\nInflation Risks\nLet me start with the risk of high inflation. As far back as mid-2009, Fed critics warned that our zero policy rate and trillions of dollars in asset purchases risk generating very high inflation. On several occasions to underscore this risk, I have been presented with $100 trillion Zimbabwe notes (which I can assure you are worth less than the $20 gift limit we have as Federal Reserve employees). The monetary policy mandates of the Federal Reserve are clear: to foster monetary and financial conditions that support maximum employment and price stability. Since January 2012, the Fed has set an explicit goal for inflation of 2 percent, as measured by the price index for total personal consumption expenditures, or PCE. So, how are we doing with respect to this 2 percent target and the risk for high inflation?\nDespite many earlier predictions of unacceptably high inflation, total PCE inflation has been hovering around just 1 percent. Other inflation measures, like the well-known Consumer Price Index (CPI), are also well below their related benchmarks.3 Forecasters often look at core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, because it is a better predictor of where overall prices are headed than total inflation. Our progress toward the 2 percent target is not noticeably faster by this metric either. Core PCE inflation was just 1.2 percent over the past year and has stayed at this rate since last spring. Most private sector forecasts and survey measures of inflation expectations have remained well anchored and do not ring any alarms of high inflation. Expectations embedded in asset prices tell a similar story. Sophisticated models that extract inflation expectations from the yield curve4 show that investors’ inflation expectations at the three-year horizon are below 2 percent and have been below 2 percent for several years.\nAll told, the potential risk of high inflation seems very low. In fact, I am concerned that inflation will not pick up quickly enough. As I noted, we have been stuck at 1 percent inflation since early 2013, and there is little indication of a pickup in the recent data. Low inflation is just as economically costly as high inflation. When we set an inflation target of 2 percent, we need to hit our target without too much delay. Simply put, we need to average 2 percent inflation over the medium term. Accordingly, the current 1 percent inflation situation calls for extended policy accommodation. More restrictive monetary policy conditions would work to reduce inflation to further unacceptably low levels.5\n\nFinancial Stability and Monetary Policy\nIt is easy and most natural for a Fed policymaker to talk about inflation. Price stability is one of the explicit goals of monetary policy as mandated by Congress. Financial stability risks are more complicated. How does financial stability dovetail with the Fed’s dual mandate? There is clearly an interdependent relationship between them. A strong and robust economy with low inflation provides a key stabilizing force for beneficial credit intermediation and robust financial markets. At the same time, stable and well-functioning financial markets are essential for achieving maximum employment and price stability. Our global experience since 2008 reinforces this critical interplay between monetary and financial conditions.\nHowever, beyond these basic principles, what is the appropriate monetary policy stance for achieving both financial stability and the dual mandate?\nWith inflation running well below our 2 percent long-run target and the unemployment rate still well above its long-term normal level, appropriate monetary policy dictates that low real interest rates should prevail until the economy is further along a sustainable path to its potential level. This assertion is made from a mainstream macroeconomic perspective. Nonetheless, it is common to hear the argument that these highly accommodative monetary policies might sow the seeds of financial instability.\nThe fear is that excessive and persistently low interest rates would lead to excessive risk-taking by some investors. For instance, some firms, such as life insurance companies and pension funds, are under pressure to meet a stream of fixed liabilities incurred when interest rates were higher.6 (And perhaps these liabilities were offered at somewhat generous terms to begin with.) To meet commitments like these in the current low interest rate environment, the incentive exists to reach for yield by investing in excessively risky assets. Furthermore, with the costs of borrowing at historically low levels, other investors might simply decide that this is a good time to cheaply amplify the risk and return in their portfolios by taking on more leverage.\nSo, one could reach the conclusion that historically low and stable interest rates pose a threat to financial stability. This creates a seeming paradox for policymakers. The existing large shortfalls in aggregate demand call for highly accommodative monetary policies and historically low interest rates. Yet, such policies have the potential to raise the likelihood of financial instability in the future.\nSo, the questions that I’m often asked regarding these matters are as follows: Do the regulators and the Fed have adequate safeguards in place to mitigate this potential financial risk? If not, should the FOMC step away from what we thought was the best monetary policy with respect to our dual mandate? Should we discard our nonconventional tools and raise the fed funds rate in order to reduce the possibility of undesirable financial imbalances in the future?\nI don’t believe that such monetary policy adjustment is the right approach. I think the inference that persistently low interest rates pose a danger to financial stability is based on a narrow view of the economy and is unlikely to survive a broader analysis that takes into account all the interactions between financial markets and real economic activity. If more restrictive monetary policies were pursued to generate higher interest rates, they would likely result in higher unemployment and a sharp decline in asset prices, choking the moderate recovery. Such an adverse economic outcome is unlikely to set a favorable foundation for financial stability. Moreover, our short-term interest rate tools are too blunt to have a significant effect on those pockets of the financial system prone to inappropriate risk-taking without, at the same time, significantly damaging other markets, as well as the growth prospects for the economy as a whole. Therefore, stepping away from otherwise appropriate monetary policy to address potential financial stability risks would degrade progress toward maximum employment and price stability. This approach would be a particularly poor choice when other tools are available, at lower social costs, to address financial stability risks.\nLet me be clear. I am not saying that financial stability concerns are not relevant for the economy or that policymakers should not take decisive action against developments that threaten financial stability. Rather, I am saying that the macroprudential tools available to policymakers are better-suited safeguards to addressing financial risks directly. These macroprudential actions can be dialed up or down given the appropriate setting of monetary policy tools, so undesirable macroeconomic outcomes are less likely than if we were to resort to premature monetary tightening. After all, any decision to rely on more-restrictive interest rate policies to achieve financial stability at the expense of poorer macroeconomic outcomes must pass a cost–benefit test. Such a test should clearly illustrate that the economic outcomes from more-restrictive interest rate policies — which could include much higher unemployment and even lower inflation than at present — would be better and more acceptable to society than the outcomes that can be achieved by using enhanced supervisory tools alone to address financial stability risks.\n\nMacroprudential Tools\nLet’s discuss some of these macroprudential tools.\nOne simple but important tool is enhanced monitoring. Even before the recent financial crisis, central bankers were well aware of the key role played by stable financial markets in economic activity. Since the crisis, however, the analysis of financial stability issues has been greatly expanded and given a more prominent role in the FOMC’s deliberations. We comb through reams of data looking for evidence of incipient risks to financial stability.\nThe Federal Reserve also has revamped its approach to bank supervision substantially to expand the focus on macrofinancial risk. Traditional bank supervisory tools are being used more intensively, and new tools have been developed. Bank capital stress tests are one well-known addition to our supervisory toolkit. Another is the augmentation of traditional microprudential supervisory efforts that analyze individual institutions with a wide-angle view of the banking industry. Supervisors look to identify common trends across institutions and emerging concentrations of risks that might pose systemic threats to the financial system. This broad view also allows supervisors to better identify sound practices among firms and incorporate them into supervisory reviews and the feedback provided in them.\nThe Federal Reserve has greatly expanded its surveillance efforts to financial markets outside of the traditional banking sector, such as the insurance industry and the financial market utilities. These more intense monitoring efforts are not confined to financial institutions per se, and reach a range of activities that might pose a potential threat to financial stability. For instance, staff members from the Chicago Fed are actively engaged in assessing the role of high-frequency computerized trading in securities and derivatives markets and issues that arise associated with it.\nThese are just a few examples of regulatory tools available to monitor and promote financial stability. And there are a host of other instruments in our toolkit, such as resolution plans, liquidity requirements and single counterparty credit limits. All are examples of improvements in supervisory practices aimed at reducing the likelihood of systemic disruptions and containing the impact should such disruptions occur.\n\nConclusion\nLet me reiterate that I currently expect that low inflation and still-high unemployment will mean that the short-term policy rate will remain near zero well into 2015. In this environment, some have questioned the ability of these supervisory and regulatory tools to adequately address potential financial stability risks, arguing that a broad interest-rate policy might be more effective in catching incipient risks that might fall through the cracks. It is certainly true that higher interest rates would permeate the entire financial system. But this is just another way of saying that raising interest rates is a blunt tool. Higher interest rates would reduce risk-taking where it is excessive; but they also would result in a pullback in economic activity in sectors where risk-taking might already be overly restrained. That’s how a blunt tool works.\nIf you believe that financial stability can only be achieved through higher interest rates — interest rates that would do immediate damage to meeting our dual mandate goals at a time when unemployment is still unacceptably high — then we ought to at least ask ourselves if the financial system has become too big and too complex. This conclusion is particularly vexing if supervisory, macroprudential and market-discipline tools are inadequate. If the only way we can achieve financial stability is to raise interest rates above where the forces of demand and supply in the real economy put them, then the cost–benefit calculus of our policy choices becomes much more complex. The possible benefit of such a restrictive rate move would be to reduce risks that might potentially be forming in the nooks and crannies of a highly complex financial system. But the cost would be higher unemployment; a risk of choking off the economic recovery; even lower inflation below our objective; and, somewhat paradoxically, the introduction of new financial risks by reducing asset values and credit quality. When weighing the costs and benefits of alternative policy actions under these circumstances, I would have to question whether the financial system has become too complex — perhaps complex enough to generate negative marginal social value. Rather than degrading our macroeconomic performance through suboptimal monetary policies, I also would have to consider whether we should contemplate big changes to the financial system — a lot more rules, substantially higher capital requirements for all institutions and maybe even fewer financial products.\nHowever, I have a more favorable view of the social value of our financial system and the efficacy of supervision and regulation. Since the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has expanded its macroprudential toolkit and enhanced its microprudential tools. We have also reoriented our approach to supervision to take full advantage of the Federal Reserve System staff’s wide-ranging expertise on macroeconomic and financial developments and risks. I believe that these regulatory efforts can effectively minimize the risks of another crisis and increase the resiliency of the financial system. We can achieve these objectives without having to resort to wholesale changes to the financial system and without degrading our monetary policy goals. Maintaining the effectiveness of the financial system for generating stronger and more robust economic growth continues to be a crucial objective for public policy. Thank you for your time, and I would be happy to take your questions.\n\nNotes\n1 Four times a year, participants in the FOMC submit their economic projections, including projections for the future path of the federal funds rate under their assessments of appropriate monetary policy. In the latest projections, published on December 18, 2013, 15 of the 17 participants anticipated that the first increase in the target federal funds rate would not be warranted until 2015 or later.\n2 Recently, the FOMC conducted a survey of the participants regarding the marginal costs and marginal efficacy of asset purchases. Most participants judged the marginal benefits of the program to outweigh the costs. The survey results are summarized in Federal Open Market Committee (2013).\n3 Because of some differences in product coverage and statistical methodologies, total CPI inflation tends to average one-quarter to one-half percentage points higher than total PCE inflation. Hence, the FOMC’s 2 percent target on total PCE inflation would translate to a 2.3 percent to 2.5 percent target for total CPI inflation.\n4 The yield curve is the line plotting the interest rates of assets of the same credit quality but with differing maturity dates at a certain point in time.\n5 I recently discussed the costs of too-low inflation and the implications of having a 2 percent inflation target in a January 15 speech; see Evans (2014).\n6 I should note that increases in interest rates since last spring have increased discount factors and thus lowered the present value of pension fund and other fixed nominal liabilities. For instance, see Fitch Ratings (2013).\n\nReferences\nEvans, Charles, 2014, \"Recurring themes for the New Year,\" speech, Corridor Economic Forecast Luncheon, Coralville, IA, January 15.\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2013, meeting minutes, December 17–18.\nFitch Ratings, 2013, \"Fitch: U.S. corporate pension plans underfunded status improves,\" press release, New York, August 15.",

            "content": "Introduction and Summary\nThank you, Pat Deignan (chief executive officer of Banker’s Trust) for that kind introduction. I am pleased to be back in Coralville for this annual forecast luncheon. My talk today will first cover the state of the economy and the outlook for growth and inflation. I’ll then address five issues — that is, the five recurring themes for the New Year — that are key to my thinking about monetary policy. Before I begin, though, I’d note that the views I express are my own and do not reflect those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Outlook\nThe recent data on economic activity generally have been encouraging. Importantly, the labor market has improved. True, the December jobs report was disappointing. But, taking a broader perspective, payroll employment growth averaged more than 200,000 jobs per month between August and November and the unemployment rate has fallen to 6.7 percent. According to surveys of consumer sentiment, household confidence is recovering from the drop that occurred during last fall’s fiscal policy debates. These improvements in the job market and sentiment are helping to boost consumer spending, which has increased at a very solid 4-1/2 percent annualized rate over the past three months. The latest data also suggest that housing markets may be picking up again; as you know, the housing market stalled somewhat after the run-up in mortgage rates last spring and summer. News from the fiscal policy front has also been positive. Although the budget deal in Washington does not address long-term structural issues, the new budget agreement is a welcome development. Fiscal policy will be slightly less restrictive over the next couple of years, and the agreement has also reduced some of the uncertainty that has been weighing on the economy.\nNow, as an economist, I am well aware that economics is often referred to as the dismal science. In this context, I won’t paint too bright of a picture. At 6.7 percent, the unemployment rate is still well above the 5-1/4 percent rate I think is consistent with its normal longer-run level. Furthermore, much of the decline in the unemployment rate in 2013 reflected people dropping out of the labor force as opposed to finding new jobs. In addition, the level of activity in many sectors of the economy, while improving, still has some way to go before returning to what we would consider normal. Construction — both for housing and nonresidential buildings — comes to mind. And, as I will discuss in more detail shortly, growth still faces some important headwinds, meaning that it could be some time before we close the so-called resource gaps in the economy.\nMoreover, the recent news on inflation has not been good. Inflation is too low and is running well below the FOMC’s 2 percent target. This target is measured in terms of the price index for total personal consumption expenditures — or PCE — and this has increased less than 1 percent over the past year. Core PCE inflation — which excludes the volatile food and energy categories and hence is a better predictor of where overall prices are headed — rose just 1.1 percent over the past 12 months and has been stuck at this low rate since last spring. Other inflation measures, like the well-known Consumer Price Index (CPI), are also well below their related benchmark levels.1 I know it sounds strange to many, but persistently too-low inflation is a problem that monetary policy needs to address. I will also return to this issue later.\nGiven these observations on the most recent data releases, how does the economic outlook fare these days? Most private forecasters think growth in the fourth quarter of last year was well over 3 percent. This follows a robust 4.1 percent rate in the third quarter. A good deal of this growth during the second half of last year reflected a sharp pickup in inventory investment that undoubtedly was transitory and could be offset to some degree in coming quarters. But even after inventory volatility is accounted for, there appears to be improving underlying momentum in production and spending during recent quarters.\nLooking further ahead, I anticipate highly accommodative monetary policy to continue to support the recovery, and I expect economic growth to be around 2-3/4 percent in 2014 and then run at a somewhat higher pace in 2015. I think this growth should bring the unemployment rate down to 6 percent or even a bit lower by the end of 2015. I'd note that forecasting the unemployment rate is unusually tricky right now because of the large decline in the labor force participation rate that I mentioned earlier. According to our analysis at the Chicago Fed, even accounting for structural factors (such as the aging workforce) that lower participation, the rate appears to be below its longer-run trend. The closure of this participation gap with an improved economy will dampen the decline in the unemployment rate. But the exact patterns are difficult to predict. As resource gaps close and the Fed maintains accommodative policy, inflation should begin to rise. I expect it to get closer to 1-1/2 percent by the end of next year. But the very low inflation in an environment of rebounding growth and highly accommodative monetary policy continues to be both puzzling and worrisome.\n\nPolicy\nAs I just noted, my forecast assumes that the Federal Reserve will maintain a highly accommodative stance for policy over the projection period. Now, some of you may ask how this squares with the fact that in December the Fed decided to cut back on its purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities from $85 billion to $75 billion per month. Let me explain.\nIn September 2012, the FOMC began its latest large-scale asset purchase program (LSAP). At the time, the unemployment rate was over 8 percent and the outlook for growth was quite subdued. The program (our third round of quantitative easing, or QE3) was put in place to help improve this situation, and was purposely open-ended; that is, we said we would keep purchasing long-term Treasury and mortgage-backed securities until we saw a substantial improvement in labor market conditions.\nWhen the Committee met this past December, with the unemployment rate at 7 percent and other labor market indicators showing improvement, we decided that the cumulative improvement to that point met the criteria for first scaling back purchases. This decision does not, however, mean we thought the economy needed less overall policy accommodation. Rather, the Committee agreed it was time to rebalance the mix of monetary policy. Large-scale asset purchases have been effective in stimulating activity, and their effects have shown more through to top-line gross domestic product (GDP) growth now that the most restrictive fiscal influences in the first half of 2013 have waned some. Nevertheless, QE3 is a nontraditional policy instrument. If in fact monetary policy and the recovery are now gaining better traction, it makes sense to rely more on our traditional short-term interest rate policy tool, the federal funds rate. We have a much better understanding of how changes in the funds rate affect the economy than we do of the benefits and potential costs associated with large-scale asset purchases, largely because we simply have more experience with the former policy tool.\nIn order to clarify that overall monetary policy will remain highly accommodative as long as necessary, we also decided to strengthen the forward guidance in our policy statement concerning the economic conditions likely to prevail when we might eventually first increase the federal funds rate.\nBack in December 2012, the FOMC introduced conditional forward guidance by saying it would hold the funds rate at exceptionally low levels at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent and the projection for inflation between one and two years ahead is less than 2-1/2 percent and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. Let me emphasize the “at least.” As we often stated, the 6-1/2 percent unemployment number was a threshold and not a trigger. Crossing 6-1/2 percent would not automatically result in an increase in the funds rate. Exactly when we would begin to raise the funds rate once we hit 6-1/2 percent depends critically on whether we are expecting continued improvements in the labor market and on what the outlook for inflation is relative to our 2 percent target.\nWhen evaluating the situation at our meeting this past December, we reasoned that conditions had evolved in a way that meant we could — and should — provide more specificity on what might happen with the federal funds rate when the economy reached this threshold. Importantly, in my mind, the low readings for inflation by themselves now suggest that it likely will be appropriate to keep the funds rate at its current level for quite some time. So I supported our change in language to say that the federal funds rate likely will remain in its current range “well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6-1/2 percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal.”2 This elaboration of our forward guidance should more strongly communicate that we are in no hurry to raise rates: We will not prematurely reduce accommodation in an economy with elevated unemployment and very low inflation pressures. \nThis relationship between economic conditions and the policy rate shows up pretty clearly when you look at the forecasts made by FOMC participants, which are published in our Summary of Economic Projections — what we refer to as the SEPs. Last month, 15 of the 17 participants thought that it would be appropriate that the first increase in the funds rate would occur in 2015 or later, and all 17 thought the unemployment rate would be at or below 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015. Indeed, two-thirds thought it would be below 6 percent. So the “well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6-1/2 percent” is in our forecasts. Contrast this to when we first adopted the 6-1/2 percent unemployment threshold in December 2012. Back then, 14 out of 19 participants thought the first increase in the funds rate would occur in 2015 or later, but only six thought the unemployment rate would be below 6.2 percent at the end of 2015. To understand these changes, we also have to consider the inflation side of the ledger. In December 2013, 12 out of 17 participants thought inflation in 2015 would only be between 1.3 and 1.8 percent; back in December 2012, more than half thought inflation in 2015 would be 1.9 percent or higher. This lower current outlook for inflation certainly justifies maintaining policy accommodation, even though the unemployment picture looks brighter than it did a year ago.\nA great number of factors influence growth, inflation and the execution of monetary policy. I’d now like to turn to five broad issues that have been and continue to be important in shaping my thinking about the economy and monetary policy. These five themes are reasons why I support our current policy approach and believe it will be necessary to maintain a highly accommodative policy for some time to come.\n\nTheme 1: Fiscal Restraint Has Been a Powerful Headwind\nHeightened fiscal austerity has been front page news in 2013. The year began with both tax hikes and automatic spending cuts known as sequestration. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that federal fiscal restraint reduced real GDP growth by about 1-1/2 percentage points last year.3 In other words, to get to 2-1/2 percent real GDP growth, the rest of the economy had to generate 4 percentage points of growth.\nThe overall role of the government sector since the recession ended is complicated. Tax and spending actions by the federal government provided an important boost to the level of activity in 2009, 2010 and 2011. However, at the same time, flagging state and local tax revenues caused those governments to pare back on employment and spending. These state and local budget pressures have been gradually easing around the country, and state and local purchases stopped falling in 2012 and began to rise in 2013. In contrast, federal fiscal policy turned to restricting growth in 2011 through 2013, as temporary stimulus measures, such as the payroll tax holiday, expired and spending cuts due to earlier budget deals came on line.\nIf we look at the entire 2009 through 2013 period, real GDP increased at an average annual rate of 2.2 percent. However, excluding state, local and federal government purchases, private spending grew at a 3.2 percent pace. This isn’t the stellar rate of growth for private spending that one would hope for given the magnitude of the Great Recession, but it is a much healthier number than the 2.2 percent rate of growth for real GDP: At some level, this reflects how private sector strength supported by monetary policy accommodation offset the contraction in government purchases.\nOf course, government restraint has not been the only headwind the economy has faced. The fallout from the financial crisis has been large. Many financial institutions have had to recapitalize, and households have needed to rebuild balance sheets following the sharp declines in stock market and housing wealth. These debt overhangs have been major factors holding back growth. In addition, global economic growth has been weak, because of the European crisis and slower growth in emerging markets, notably in China. But the restraint from the federal government sector has been a self-inflicted wound, and it has been unusual relative to other historical episodes.\nLet me give you an example. In 1981-82, the economy experienced a severe downturn, but it rebounded rapidly. One reason was that increases in government purchases contributed nearly a percentage point to growth, on average, in 1983 and 1984. Large tax cuts also helped fuel the recovery. Contrast that to the fiscal restraint that we’ve seen recently.\nIn addition to fiscal policy impetus, the Federal Reserve was able to reduce the federal funds rate as much as was necessary to get growth back on track. With the federal funds rate at nearly 15 percent in 1982, it was possible to drop the rate by 6 percentage points. However, in the current environment, monetary policy has less room to maneuver because short-term interest rates are already pushed to their lowest possible limits. We have had to work harder and turn to unconventional tools to help counteract the fiscal restraint and other forces holding back growth. This leads me to the second theme.\n\nTheme 2: The Zero Lower Bound\nToday, the federal funds rate is effectively pushed as low as it can go. It stands near zero and has been at that rate since December 2008. Central bankers refer to this as the zero lower bound. Operating near the zero lower bound has limited the Fed’s ability to use its traditional tools to offset the ferocious impediments to growth that I just outlined. We have tried to overcome this obstacle with nontraditional policies. The main two are the ones I discussed earlier — our large-scale asset purchase programs and, separately, forward guidance regarding the economic conditions under which we would consider to begin to raise rates. Let me go into a bit more detail about how these work.\nGiven that we can’t lower current short-term rates any further, our strategy is to promote a faster recovery by lowering long-term interest rates. A classic textbook decomposition of long-term rates is to view them as the average of expected future short-term rates and a so-called term premium, which compensates for a number of factors that affect the riskiness of holding a long-term bond relative to a short-term note. The new tools are aimed at influencing both of these components of long-term rates.\nForward guidance provides some information on the length of time that short-term borrowing rates will remain low. By credibly indicating that we will keep the federal funds rate low in the future, we directly lower the component of long-term rates that reflects the average expectations for short-term rates. Furthermore, to the degree that we can articulate how we will respond to changes in economic conditions, we can reduce uncertainty over future interest rates and also the risk premium that enters long-term rates.\nLarge-scale asset purchases work on long-term rates by reducing the term premium. Our purchases of long-term Treasury and mortgage-backed securities shorten the duration of these assets held by the public, lowering the term premium built into rates. We effectively drive up the price and lower the yield. At times, LSAPs may also lower long-term rates if markets view them as reinforcing the idea that the Fed will keep short-term rates lower for a longer period of time.\nBy mitigating some of the headwinds I mentioned earlier, LSAPs and forward guidance have helped return the economy to better health. There is still a ways to go. Our two nontraditional policy tools have simply not been strong enough to overcome these headwinds and generate an early 1980s “morning in America” recovery yet.4 Moreover, inflation remains stubbornly low.\nThis low inflation environment is the third theme I’d like to cover today.\n\nTheme 3: Inflation Is Running Under Our 2 Percent Objective\nSince January 2012, the Fed has set an explicit goal for inflation of 2 percent. As the Wall Street Journal recently noted,5 there is no doubt that the lack of inflation has been the biggest surprise of the near-zero interest rate environment. Despite many earlier predictions to the contrary, as I noted earlier, current year-over-year total PCE inflation is only 0.9 percent and core PCE inflation is running just 1.1 percent.\nGiven these low inflation data, we are clearly missing our inflation objective today. And we have for some time — average annual total PCE inflation since December 2007 has been just 1 1/2 percent. Low inflation is not just a domestic problem: It is a worldwide issue. Inflation has fallen quite low in the eurozone area, Canada and the United Kingdom. In Japan, inflation has climbed to 1 percent — a victory for the Japanese — but still well below their target of 2 percent.\nWhen I state the facts about U.S. inflation, some people look at me like I’m from Mars and question my grasp of reality, believing that inflation is higher than the numbers I just recited. While I sympathize with their concern — we all have experienced large individual price increases that cause hardships — the indexes that we rely on to measure overall inflation are based on sound methodology. Moreover, other independent evidence points to the same conclusion. The Billion Prices Project6 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) collects prices posted online on a daily basis. These Internet transactional prices cover around 60 percent of the goods covered by the CPI. This MIT project’s U.S. index tracks the CPI quite well and also points to inflation below 2 percent.\nThe Treasury yield curve also provides convincing evidence that inflation is low. When an investor purchases a bond, he expects compensation for any future inflation that would erode the real purchasing power of coupon and principal payments. Accordingly, nominal interest rates contain a premium for expected inflation and inflation risk. Sophisticated finance models that estimate these effects show that investors’ inflation expectations at the three-year horizon are below 2 percent and have been below 2 percent for several years.\nPersistently undershooting our 2 percent target is costly. When determining how much debt to take on, borrowers consider their ability to repay that debt. For example, households take on debt expecting that their income will be adequate to cover monthly payments. If inflation is surprisingly low, wage increases and other income gains are more likely to fall short of these expectations, and interest and principal payments will be more burdensome than what was planned for. A similar story will hold for business borrowing. When debt financing becomes more burdensome than borrowers originally expected, a period of deleveraging can occur, and the associated reduction in spending can weigh heavily on the overall pace of economic activity.\nJust as undershooting our inflation target can be costly, overshooting our inflation target can also be damaging. Lenders are hurt if inflation exceeds the rate they anticipated when they made the loan, because the payments they receive can purchase fewer goods and services than they expected. Moreover, high inflation may be associated with more variable inflation; not only does this make it difficult for borrowers and lenders to anticipate the real value of future payments, this also can mask the signals contained in individual price changes about supply and demand conditions for particular products.\nTo avoid all of these costs on both sides of the inflation target, the Fed should aim to hit the inflation target! And we should seek to do so in a symmetric fashion — we should seek for inflation to average 2 percent. Under no circumstances should we consider our 2 percent target to be a ceiling for inflation.\nSo, inflation that is too low or too high is a problem. This leads me to the fourth theme regarding the Fed’s strategy for achieving our goals.\n\nTheme 4: There Are Ample Safeguards in Place\nMonetary policymakers must recognize the inherent uncertainties in how the economy may evolve and how our policies may influence those developments. Recognizing this, we have built ample safeguards and conditionalities into our unconventional monetary policy tools.\nWith inflation being so low and projections indicating it is likely to remain below our 2 percent target for some time, I worry about the risk of inflation not picking up quickly enough. Here, new language in the FOMC’s December statement provides an important safeguard. We are monitoring the inflation situation carefully, and if it doesn’t start to rise, we will leave the funds rate at its current low level well after we hit 6-1/2 percent unemployment.\nOthers point to the risk that, instead of inflation being too low, inflation could start to quickly pick up and push us too far past our 2 percent objective. They fear the recurrence of a 1970s-style wage–price spiral. I view the current situation as much different from the circumstances we found ourselves in back then. For one, we see little pressure building for wage increases that we saw then. Furthermore, inflation expectations are well anchored.\nBut I could be wrong. Labor market slack could be smaller than I think. Or the U.S. economy could experience an unexpectedly large surge in lending that could be inflationary. We are vigilantly on the lookout for these factors, and at the moment we don’t see anything even smoldering. In addition, our forward guidance has an explicit inflation safeguard built in; namely, there is our promise to keep rates unusually low for at least as long as the inflation outlook one to two years ahead is below 2-1/2 percent and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. If these conditions are broached, we could raise rates. Our inflation safeguard of 2-1/2 percent is a major risk-mitigant against the possibility that accommodative policy leads to unacceptable and higher inflation.\nSome critics are concerned about potential financial stability risks raised by our large balance sheet and our promise to keep rates unusually low for a long time. I think we have adequate safeguards in place against these risks as well. At the Federal Reserve, we are devoting considerably more resources than we did before the financial crisis to monitoring for nascent financial fragilities. For example, last year we saw a large expansion in leveraged loan syndications, and issued enhanced supervisory guidance to banks on underwriting standards and sound risk management expectations for such loans. More broadly, the Dodd–Frank Act provides for enhanced supervision and new macroprudential tools to address financial stability issues should they develop. I think judicious and diligent use of these tools will allow the Federal Reserve and other regulators to manage financial stability risks that may arise.\nSo far, I have argued that the substantial headwinds impeding growth and below-target inflation clearly dictate substantial monetary policy accommodation, and I have also contended that we have sufficient safeguards in place against potential downside risks. This leads me to my fifth and final theme regarding the Fed’s strategy for achieving our goals.\n\nTheme 5: Fed Credibility Is an Integral Part of Policy\nHow much is enough when it comes to accommodative policy? As unlikely as it sounds, the game of golf provides some clues. My older brother, Billy, is a scratch golfer. Billy has two remarkable golfing achievements. First, he has had 14 holes-in-one. Second, he has had the great opportunity to play five rounds at Augusta National Golf Course where the famed Masters Tournament is held. During those five rounds, he had two holes-in-one. Think about it: That’s 20 par-three opportunities and two aces at Augusta. That’s a 10 percent success rate! I don’t know many golfers who can top that. Clearly, when he is on the tee, he thinks differently from most everyone I know. So, how does he do it? I asked him what his strategy is. And he said, “Charles, whatever the distance, when you face a 120- or 175-yard hole, most people don’t use enough club to get the ball to the hole! They come up short.” In other words, you need enough club to get the job done.\nIn terms of monetary policy strategy, after four years of weak and inadequate growth with low inflation, we need extraordinary monetary accommodation to finish the task at hand. The public must have confidence in the Fed’s ultimate resolve to successfully address economic challenges. We need to be both bold and committed to following through. Simply put, we have to use enough club and be willing to hit the ball with a full swing; a half-hearted effort will bring us up short.\nWe often talk about this in terms of credibility. Credibility means that we are clear about our goals, have the tools to achieve those goals and are committed to using those tools.\nWe have been clear about our goals. We are dedicated to achieving our statutory dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. We certainly have turned to unprecedented actions to get the job done — near-zero short-term interest rates; strong forward guidance about keeping rates low for well after the economic recovery strengthens; and large-scale assets purchases that have boosted our balance sheet from about $800 billion to more than $4 trillion. And we must continue to be willing to use these tools to put us on a clear track back to full employment and inflation averaging our 2 percent target.\n\nNotes\n1Because of some differences in product coverage and statistical methodologies, total CPI inflation tends to average one-quarter to one-half percentage points higher than total PCE inflation.\n2The full press release from the December 17-18, 2013, FOMC meeting is available online.\n3See chapter 2 of the CBO report online.\n4The “morning in America” recovery refers to economic policy carried out during the Reagan presidency.

            "content": "Introduction\nGood afternoon. Thank you.\nMy comments today will be about the U.S. economy and current monetary policy challenges. I will also have some specific thoughts on the auto industry, which is so important to this area and the rest of the Chicago Fed District. But before I begin, I should note that my commentary reflects my own views and does not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System.\nAs a little background, at the end of each meeting the FOMC issues a statement that provides some context for its monetary policy decisions. In addition to providing commentary on developments since the last meeting, the statement offers guidance on how the Committee expects monetary policy to evolve. In the most recent statement, released after the meeting in late October, the FOMC said that “in determining whether it will be appropriate to raise the target range at its next meeting, the Committee will assess progress — both realized and expected — toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.”1\nGoals of Monetary Policy — Are We There Yet?\nThese objectives refer to the dual mandate Congress gave to us. More specifically, the Federal Reserve is charged with fostering financial conditions that achieve 1) stable prices and 2) maximum sustainable employment.\nFor the first goal, the inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy. So the FOMC has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation. Since January 2012, the Committee has set an explicit 2 percent inflation target as measured by the annual change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE).2\nFor the second goal, quantifying the maximum sustainable level of employment is a much more complex undertaking. Many nonmonetary factors affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market. These factors can vary over time and are hard to measure. Consequently, the Committee does not set a fixed goal for employment, but instead considers a wide range of indicators to gauge maximum employment.\n\nNonetheless, FOMC participants provide their individual view of the longer-run normal level of unemployment that is consistent with the employment mandate. The median estimate among FOMC participants is currently 4.9 percent.3 My own view is in line with this assessment.\n\nGiven these operational objectives, how close are we to achieving the goals of our dual mandate? There is no doubt that labor markets have improved significantly over the past seven years. Job growth has been quite solid for some time now. And today, at 5 percent, the unemployment rate is half what its peak was during the recession and just a tenth of a percentage point above the FOMC’s median view of the long-run normal rate. That said, a few other labor market indicators lead me to believe that there still remains some additional resource slack beyond what is indicated by the unemployment rate alone: Notably, 1) a large number of people who are employed part time would prefer a full-time job; 2) the labor force participation rate is quite low, even after accounting for demographic and other long-running trends; and 3) wage growth has been quite subdued.4 In sum, I don’t think we’re quite there yet, but we have made good progress toward meeting our employment mandate.\nTo support activity during and since the Great Recession, the Fed has reduced the federal funds rate, our traditional policy instrument, as low as effectively possible. And we sought to provide additional accommodation through nontraditional means, such as our large-scale asset purchase programs.5 I believe these policies have been extremely important in supporting the economic recovery.\n\nThe motor vehicle industry certainly has benefited. As you know, the industry is highly cyclical. In difficult times households and businesses seek ways to cut spending. For many, purchasing an automobile is a significant commitment of resources. So, it makes sense to delay that acquisition when job prospects are poor, the business climate is uncertain, and financing is costly and hard to obtain. During the Great Recession, all of these forces were in full play. Therefore, it is little wonder that from 2006 to 2009, car and light truck sales fell by more than 45 percent to a rock-bottom 9-million-unit pace.\n\nWell, the market certainly looks better today. Indeed, over the past few months light vehicle sales have averaged around 18 million units at an annualized rate — which is actually somewhat above where most analysts put the long-run sustainable trend. Federal Reserve policy has unquestionably helped. Of course, our actions were not aimed at the motor vehicle sector per se — monetary policy is set to improve conditions for the economy as a whole. That said, policy did contribute to lower borrowing rates for auto and truck loans and easier credit conditions for automakers and their suppliers, not to mention the overall improvement in job conditions and economic growth that are so critical to motor vehicle demand.\n\nNow, for the first time in seven years, the FOMC is contemplating raising the federal funds rate.6 It has been so long since we have raised rates that we may have forgotten what this actually means! Because the fed funds rate is a key determinant of short-term financing costs for banks and other financial institutions, as it goes up, so will the borrowing rates paid by households and nonfinancial businesses. This includes rates on car and truck loans. With sales above trend and higher financing costs coming, we should expect sales to move down some from their current high pace. But against the backdrop of a healthy job market and steady economic growth, the declines shouldn’t be too large. Indeed, many forecasters are looking for car and light truck sales to average a still solid 17-million-unit annual rate over the next five years or so.7\n\nWhat can I say about the outlook more generally? In the FOMC’s latest forecast, my colleagues on the Committee projected that real gross domestic product (GDP) growth would run in the 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent range over the next year and a half or so. My personal view is closer to the upper end of that range. Most of us — myself included — also expect the unemployment rate to edge down further and even fall slightly below its long-run sustainable level by the end of next year.8 I also anticipate the elements of extra labor-market slack that I mentioned earlier to dissipate over that time. So I see we are close to reaching our employment mandate.\n\nHowever, I am far less confident about reaching our inflation goal within a reasonable time frame. Inflation has been too low for too long. Core PCE inflation — which strips out the volatile energy and food components and is a good indicator of underlying inflation trends — has averaged just 1.4 percent over the past seven years. Core PCE inflation over the past 12 months was just 1.3 percent. And inflation according to the total PCE Price Index — which does include food and energy prices — was just 0.2 percent over the past year.\n\nMost FOMC participants expect inflation to rise steadily from these low levels, coming in just a shade under the Committee’s 2 percent target by the end of 2017.9 My own forecast is less sanguine. I expect core PCE inflation to undershoot 2 percent by a greater margin over the next two years than do my colleagues. I expect core PCE inflation to be just below 2 percent at the end of 2018.\n\nA Risk-management Approach to Monetary Policy\n\nSo why do I lack confidence in our ability to achieve our 2 percent inflation target over the medium term? One reason is that there exist a number of important downside risks to the inflation outlook. Now I recognize that “medium term” is somewhat vague. To a central banker it can mean two to three years or three to four years. It is more a term of art than science.\n\nSo what are these inflation risks? With prospects of slower growth in China and other emerging market economies, low energy and import prices could exert downward pressure on inflation longer than most anticipate. That’s a risk. In addition, while many survey-based measures of long-term inflation expectations have been relatively stable in recent years, we shouldn’t take them as confirmation that our 2 percent target is assured. In fact, some survey measures of inflation expectations have ticked down in the past year and a half. Furthermore, measures of inflation compensation derived from financial markets have moved down to quite low levels in recent months. These measures could reflect either lower expectations of inflation or a heightened concern over the nature of the economic conditions that will be associated with low inflation. Adding to my unease is anecdotal evidence: I talk to a wide range of business contacts, and virtually none of them are mentioning rising inflationary or cost pressures. No one is planning for higher inflation. My contacts just don’t expect it.\n\nHow does this asymmetric assessment of risks to achieving the dual mandate goals influence my view of the most appropriate path for monetary policy over the next three years? It leads me to prefer a later liftoff than many would like, followed by a very gradual normalization of our monetary policy. I think such a policy setting will best position the economy for the potential challenges ahead.\n\nNow, I take seriously the view that I should go into every FOMC meeting with an open mind regarding the policy decision. And I will do so in our meeting two weeks from now. Should we raise rates or not? I admit to some nervousness about our upcoming decision. Before raising rates, I would prefer to have more confidence than I do today that inflation is indeed beginning to head higher. Given the current low level of core inflation, some evidence of true upward momentum in actual inflation would bolster my confidence. I am concerned, however, that it could be well into next year before the headwinds from lower energy prices and the stronger dollar dissipate enough so that we begin to see some sustained upward movement in core inflation.\n\nThat said, the exact timing of liftoff it is less important than the trajectory rates would follow over the next couple of years. Regardless of whether we liftoff soon or wait somewhat longer, I think it would be appropriate to raise the target interest rate very gradually. This would give us sufficient time to assess how the economy is adjusting to higher rates and the progress we are making toward our policy goals.\n\nI’ll go into my reasoning on this in more detail in a minute. But first, let’s talk a bit more about what this gradual path might look like. In addition to economic and inflation forecasts, FOMC participants also submit individual assessments of the appropriate monetary policy supporting their forecasts. These policy judgments are summarized in the Federal Open Market Committee’s well-known “dot plot.”\n\n\nThis is the chart that shows FOMC participants’ views of the appropriate target federal funds rate by the end of each year for 2015 through 2018 and also over the longer run. Each participant’s fed funds rate forecast is shown as a distinct dot at each of these time horizons. The chart I’m showing here is the most recent one we did for last September’s FOMC meeting, so, with apologies, it’s a little dated.\n\nLet us focus for a moment on the median policy projections, indicated by the red dots. Most of my colleagues thought that it would be appropriate to raise the target federal funds rate at least by our meeting in December. Over the next three years, these projections envisioned a slow increase in the rate, to about 3-1/2 percent by the end of 2018.10 On average, this path is consistent with the target federal funds rate increasing by 25 basis points at every other FOMC meeting over the next three years. By historical standards, this is certainly a gradual path. It is even slower than the so-called measured pace of increases over the 2004–06 tightening cycle, which was 25 basis points per meeting.\n\nOf course, there is a dispersion of views around this median path, and, overall, my dots are among the most accommodative on the chart. Let me explain my thinking.\n\nHistorically, central bankers have established their credibility by defending their inflation target from above — to fight off undesirably high inflation. Today, policy needs to defend our inflation target from below. This is necessary to validate our claim that we aim to achieve our 2 percent inflation target in a symmetric fashion. Failure to do so may weaken the credibility of this claim. The public could begin to mistakenly believe that 2 percent inflation is a ceiling — and not a symmetric target. As a result, expectations for average inflation could fall, lessening the upward pull on actual inflation and making it even more difficult for us to achieve our 2 percent target.\n\nAnother factor underlying my thinking about policy is a consideration of policy mistakes we could make. One possibility is that we begin to raise rates only to learn that we have misjudged the strength of the economy or the upward tilt in inflation. In order to put the economy back on track, we would have to cut interest rates back to zero and possibly even resort to unconventional policy tools, such as more large-scale asset purchases. I think these policies can be effective, but they clearly are a second-best alternative to our traditional policy tools.\n\nBoth the defense of a symmetric inflation target and risk management against potential policy errors compel me to argue for taking a very gradual approach to policy normalization. The outlook for economic growth and the health of the labor market continues to be good. But the outlook for inflation remains too low. I think a gradual path of normalization would balance both the various risks to my projections for the economy’s most likely path and the costs that would be involved in mitigating those risks if they indeed came to pass.\n\nNow as I mentioned earlier, while I favor a somewhat later liftoff than many of my colleagues, the precise timing for the first increase in the federal funds rate is less important to me than the path the funds rate will follow over the entire policy normalization process. After all, today’s medium- and longer-term interest rates depend on market expectations of the entire path for future rates, not just the first move. In turn, these medium- and longer-term rates are key to the borrowing and spending decisions of households and businesses.\n\nAccordingly, when thinking about the initial stages of normalization, I find it useful to focus on where I think the federal funds rate ought to be at the end of next year. And right now, given my economic outlook and assessment of risks, regardless of the exact date for liftoff, I think it could well be appropriate for the funds rate to still be under 1 percent at the end of 2016.\n\nThere is a crucial caveat, though, to my comment downplaying the importance of the exact date of liftoff. To me, it is vital that when we first raise rates, the FOMC also strongly and effectively communicates its plan for a gradual path for future rate increases. If we do not, then market participants might construe an early liftoff as a signal that the Committee is less inclined to provide the degree of accommodation that I think is appropriate for the timely achievement of our dual mandate objectives.

            "content": "Introduction\nGood morning. Thank you.\nMy comments today will be about the U.S. economy and current monetary policy challenges, with some specific thoughts on the housing market. But before I begin, I should note that my commentary reflects my own views and does not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System.\nI really value the opportunity to speak to groups such as yours. Obviously, it provides me with a forum to communicate my views about monetary policy. I believe that clear communication is essential for the accountability, credibility and effectiveness of our policy decisions. But the occasion offers an additional opportunity. Your experiences and perspectives help me formulate my own thoughts about the economy and monetary policy. Therefore, I look forward with great interest to your questions and observations at the end of my remarks.\nAs a little background, at the end of each meeting the FOMC issues a statement that provides some context for its monetary policy decisions. In addition to providing commentary on developments since the last meeting, the statement offers guidance on how the Committee expects monetary policy to evolve. For example, in the most recent statement released just a few weeks ago, the Committee said that “in determining whether it will be appropriate to raise the target range at its next meeting, the Committee will assess progress — both realized and expected — toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.1”\nGoals of Monetary Policy — Are We There Yet?\nThese objectives refer to the dual mandate Congress gave to us. More specifically, the Federal Reserve is charged with fostering financial conditions that achieve 1) stable prices and 2) maximum sustainable employment.\nFor the first goal, the inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy. So the FOMC has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation. Since January 2012, the Committee has set an explicit 2 percent inflation target as measured by the annual change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE).2\nFor the second goal, quantifying the maximum sustainable level of employment is a much more complex undertaking. Many nonmonetary factors affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market. These factors can vary over time and are hard to measure. Consequently, the Committee does not set a fixed goal for employment, but instead considers a wide range of indicators to gauge maximum employment.\nNonetheless, FOMC participants provide their individual views of the longer-run normal level of unemployment that are consistent with the employment mandate. The median estimate among FOMC participants is currently 4.9 percent.3 My own assessment is in line with this projection.\nGiven these operational objectives, how close are we to achieving the goals of our dual mandate? There is no doubt that labor markets have improved significantly over the past seven years. Job growth has been quite solid for some time now. That includes last month’s number, which was quite good. And today, at 5 percent, the unemployment rate is one half its peak in 2009. This is just a tenth of a percentage point above the median long-run projection. However, a number of other labor market indicators lead me to believe that there still remains some additional resource slack beyond what is indicated by the unemployment rate alone: Notably, 1) a large number of people who are employed part time would prefer a full-time job; 2) the labor force participation rate is quite low, even after accounting for demographic and other long-running trends; and 3) wage growth has been quite subdued.4 In sum, I don’t think we’re quite there yet, but we have made good progress toward meeting our employment mandate.\nHousing, however, is one area where the recovery probably still has a good way to go. As I’m sure I don’t need to remind this group, the housing market was hit particularly hard by the Great Recession. From their peak in early 2006 to their trough in 2011, house prices fell about 30 percent on average across the nation.5 A home is the most important asset for many households, and as real estate values plummeted, so did household wealth. Over 5.5 million Americans lost their homes, many others ended up with underwater mortgages.6 As a result, consumers found themselves in the difficult position of having to reduce other spending to build back lost wealth, with the obvious negative repercussions for the rest of the economy. While this wealth effect certainly wasn’t the only factor contributing to the Great Recession, it certainly was an important one.\nTo support activity during and since the recession, the Fed has reduced the federal funds rate, our traditional policy instrument, as low as effectively possible. And we sought to provide additional accommodation through nontraditional means, such as our large-scale asset purchase programs.7 But even as overall economic growth has recovered, progress in the housing market has been slow and uneven. Some areas of the country have seen real estate values rebound to levels exceeding previous highs. But improvement in other regions has been slower. For example, house values in the East North Central District — which includes Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin — are currently still 3.5 percent below their previous high.8\nPart of the impediment to the housing recovery has been the retrenchment of financial institutions from mortgage and construction lending during and after the crisis. For instance, according to the Federal Reserve’s Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, banks tightened standards for mortgage loans to prime borrowers and maintained the tighter standards throughout the 2006 to 2012 period. For borrowers with less pristine credit histories, banks have started to ease standards somewhat only this year.9 As a result, today — over six years into the recovery — mortgages are difficult to obtain or refinance for those without the best credit histories. Therefore, not everyone who would like to has been able to take advantage of those historically low interest rates.\nOf course, housing demand is not just driven by financing opportunities. At its base, the demand for housing is determined by the number of households. And the rate of household formation has been truly low. To form a new household, people must have a sense of confidence that their employment is secure and their income is likely to grow. The Great Recession and subsequent weak recovery certainly weighed heavily on this confidence. Consider young adults between the ages of 20 and 24 years old — ages when many normally take the first steps toward forming their own households. In 2007, almost 75 percent of these 20 to 24 year olds were either working or actively searching for jobs. Today that number is around 70 percent.10 You can’t expect those who have dropped out of the labor force to go live on their own or start a family.\nThat said, housing market conditions are improving. Although construction of single-family homes remains well below pre-recession levels, it has improved some. Moreover, the more affordable multifamily home sector has shown considerable growth. Further improvements in the labor market should make more and more people confident of their ability to form a new household and own a home. And there are signs of some freeing up of unusually tight credit in mortgage markets. So I anticipate that economic conditions will support continued gradual improvements in the housing market.\nWhat can I say about the outlook more generally? In the FOMC’s latest forecast, my colleagues on the Committee projected that real gross domestic product (GDP) growth would run in the 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent range over the next year and a half or so. My personal view is closer to the upper end of that range. Most of us — myself included — also expect the unemployment rate to edge down further and even fall slightly below its long-run sustainable level by the end of next year.11 I also anticipate the elements of extra labor-market slack that I just mentioned to dissipate over that time. So I see we are close to reaching our employment mandate.\nHowever, I am far less confident about reaching our inflation goal within a reasonable time frame. Inflation has been too low for too long. Core PCE inflation — which strips out the volatile energy and food components and is a good indicator of underlying inflation trends — has averaged just 1.4 percent over the past seven years. Core PCE inflation over the past 12 months was just 1.3 percent. And inflation according to the total PCE Price Index — which does include food and energy prices — was just 0.2 percent over the past year.\nMost FOMC participants expect inflation to rise steadily from these low levels, coming in just a shade under the Committee’s 2 percent target by the end of 2017.12 My own forecast is less sanguine. I expect core PCE inflation to undershoot 2 percent by a greater margin over the next two years than do my colleagues. I expect core PCE inflation to be just below 2 percent at the end of 2018.\nA Risk-management Approach to Monetary Policy\nSo why do I lack confidence in our ability to achieve our 2 percent inflation target over the medium term? One reason is that there exist a number of important downside risks to the inflation outlook. Now I recognize that “medium term” is somewhat vague. To a central banker it can mean two to three years or three to four years. It is more a term of art than science.\nSo what are these inflation risks? With prospects of slower growth in China and other emerging market economies, low energy and import prices could exert downward pressure on inflation longer than most anticipate. That’s a risk. In addition, while many survey-based measures of long-term inflation expectations have been relatively stable in recent years, we shouldn’t take them as confirmation that our 2 percent target is assured. In fact, some survey measures of inflation expectations have ticked down in the past year and a half. Furthermore, measures of inflation compensation derived from financial markets have moved quite low in recent months. These could reflect either lower expectations of inflation or a heightened concern over the nature of the economic conditions that will be associated with low inflation. Adding to my unease is anecdotal evidence: I talk to a wide range of business contacts, and virtually none of them are mentioning rising inflationary or cost pressures. No one is planning for higher inflation. My contacts just don’t expect it.\nHow does this asymmetric assessment of risks to achieving the dual mandate goals influence my view of the most appropriate path for monetary policy over the next three years? It leads me to conclude that 1) a later liftoff and 2) a more gradual normalization of our monetary policy setting will best position the economy for the potential challenges ahead.\nMore specifically, before raising rates, I would like to have more confidence than I do today that inflation is indeed beginning to head higher. Given the current low level of core inflation, some evidence of true upward momentum in actual inflation is critical to this assessment. I believe that it could be well into next year before the headwinds from lower energy prices and the stronger dollar dissipate enough so that we begin to see some sustained upward movement in core inflation. After liftoff, I think it would be appropriate to raise the target interest rate very gradually. This would give us sufficient time to assess how the economy is adjusting to higher rates and the progress we are making toward our policy goals.\nOverall, my view of appropriate policy is somewhat more accommodative than those held by the majority of my colleagues. In addition to economic and inflation forecasts, FOMC participants also submit individual assessments of the appropriate monetary policy supporting their forecasts. These policy judgments are summarized in the Federal Open Market Committee’s well-known “dot plot.”\n  This is the chart that shows FOMC participants’ views of the appropriate target federal funds rate by the end of each year for 2015 through 2018 and also over the longer run. Each participant’s fed funds rate forecast is shown as a distinct dot at each of these time horizons. Let us focus for a moment on the median policy projection, highlighted with a red dot, for the end of 2015: Most of my colleagues think that it will be appropriate to raise the target federal funds rate sometime this year. Over the next three years, these projections envision a slow increase in the rate, to about 3-1/2 percent by the end of 2018.13 On average, this path is consistent with the target federal funds rate increasing by 25 basis points at every other FOMC meeting over the next three years. This is certainly a gradual path by historical standards. It is even slower than the so-called measured pace of increases over the 2004–06 tightening cycle, which was 25 basis points per meeting. In my view, though, an even more patient approach is warranted. Let me explain my thinking.\nHistorically, central bankers have established their credibility by defending their inflation target from above — to fight off undesirably high inflation. Today, policy needs to defend our inflation target from below. This is necessary to validate our claim that we aim to achieve our 2 percent inflation target in a symmetric fashion. Failure to do so may weaken the credibility of this claim. The public could begin to mistakenly believe that 2 percent inflation is a ceiling — and not a symmetric target. As a result, expectations for average inflation could fall, lessening the upward pull on actual inflation and making it even more difficult for us to achieve our 2 percent target.\nAnother factor underlying my thinking about policy is a consideration of policy mistakes we could make. One possibility is that we begin to raise rates only to learn that we have misjudged the strength of the economy or the upward tilt in inflation. In order to put the economy back on track, we would have to cut interest rates back to zero and possibly even resort to unconventional policy tools, such as more large-scale asset purchases. I think our multiple rounds of asset purchases were effective, but they clearly are a second-best alternative to traditional policy. This scenario is not merely hypothetical. Just consider the recent challenges experienced in Europe and Japan. Policymakers tried to raise rates that were near or at their lower bounds; but faced with faltering demand, they were forced to reverse course and deploy nontraditional tools more aggressively than before. And we all know the subsequent difficulties Europe and Japan have had in rekindling growth and inflation. So I see substantial costs to premature policy normalization.\nAn alternative potential policy mistake would be that sometime during the gradual policy normalization process, inflation begins to rise too quickly. Well, we have the experience and the appropriate tools to deal with such an outcome. Given how slowly underlying inflation would likely move up from the current low levels, we probably could keep inflation in check with only moderate increases in interest rates relative to current forecasts. And given how gradual the projected rate increases are to start with, the concerns being voiced about the risks of rapid increases in policy rates if inflation were to pick up seem overblown to me. For example, we could raise the funds rate 100 basis points more than envisioned by the median participant’s projection in a year simply by increasing rates 25 basis points at every meeting instead of at every other meeting — that’s hardly a steep path of rate increases.\nAll told, I think the best policy is to take a very gradual approach to normalization. The outlook for economic growth and the health of the labor market continues to be good. But the outlook for inflation remains too low. A gradual path of normalization would balance both the various risks to my projections for the economy’s most likely path and the costs that would be involved in mitigating those risks.\nNow I would like to emphasize that while I favor a somewhat later liftoff than many of my colleagues, the precise timing for the first increase in the federal funds rate is less important to me than the path the funds rate will follow over the entire policy normalization process. After all, today’s medium- and longer-term interest rates depend on market expectations of the entire path for future rates, not just the first move. In turn, these medium- and longer-term rates are key to the borrowing and spending decisions of households and businesses.\nAccordingly, when thinking about the initial stages of normalization, I find it useful to focus on where I think the federal funds rate ought to be at the end of next year. And right now, given my economic outlook and assessment of risks, regardless of the exact date for liftoff, I think it could well be appropriate for the funds rate to still be under 1 percent at the end of 2016.\n\nThere is an important caveat, though, to my comment downplaying the importance of the exact date of liftoff. It is critically important to me that when we first raise rates the FOMC also strongly and effectively communicates its plan for a gradual path for future rate increases. If we do not, then market participants might construe an early liftoff as a signal that the Committee is less inclined to provide the degree of accommodation that I think is appropriate for the timely achievement of our dual mandate objectives. I would view this as an important policy error.\nEffective Communication Is a Critical Policy Tool\nI cannot stress enough how critical it is for monetary policymakers to effectively communicate how they aim to achieve their long-run goals and strategies. They must clearly describe how their views on the appropriate path for monetary policy will help generate outcomes for employment and inflation that are consistent with achieving the mandated goals within a reasonable time frame. Moreover, they must demonstrate they have appropriately considered the risks to their outlooks on the economy. I hope I have done that for you today by laying out my forecast for the economy and what I consider to be the appropriate path for policy.\nWe also need to be clear about how monetary policymakers will react to new data as the economy evolves. We talk a lot about data dependence, but what does that really mean? To me, it involves the following: 1) evaluating how the new information alters the outlook and the assessment of risks around that outlook and 2) adjusting my expected path for policy in a way that keeps us on course to achieve our dual mandate objectives in a timely manner. So, if in the coming months inflation rises more quickly than I currently anticipate and appears to be headed to undesirably high levels, then I would argue to tighten financial conditions sooner and more aggressively than I presently do. If instead inflation headwinds persist, I would advocate a more gradual approach to normalization than I currently envision. In either case, my policy forecasts would change and I would explain how and why they did.\nSuch communication helps clarify our reaction to new information — the so-called Fed reaction function you hear financial market analysts talk about. This in turn makes it easier for households and businesses to plan for the future. Such transparency is a key feature of goal-oriented, accountable monetary policy — the kind of policy that the Federal Reserve is committed to providing today and in the future.\nThank you.\nNotes\n1 Federal Open Market Committee (2015a).\n2 This was first acknowledged in Federal Open Market Committee (2012).

            "content": "Introduction\nGood afternoon. Thank you, Lou.\n\nBefore I begin, I should note that my commentary reflects my own views and does not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System.\n\nMy comments today will be about the U.S. economy and current monetary policy challenges. However, I’d like to start with an overview of the Federal Reserve System. The Fed is the central bank of the United States. It was established by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, largely in response to a series of financial panics. Congress designed the structure of the Fed to give it a broad perspective on economic activity in all parts of the nation. It is a federal system, composed of a central, governmental agency — the Board of Governors in Washington, DC — and 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks. These regional banks serve a vital purpose. It is through these District banks that the Fed gains valuable insight into regional economic developments. For example, because of the importance of the steel industry to our local economies, events within it are followed very closely by the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago and Cleveland. Indeed, we discussed developments in the industry a good deal at a joint meeting of our two Banks’ Boards of Directors that we held last month. The decentralized structure of the Fed also provides policymakers more opportunities to communicate the goals and strategies of monetary policy, as I am going to do today. I think such direct communication is essential for the accountability, credibility and effectiveness of our policy decisions.\n\nThe monetary policy decisions are made by the Federal Open Market Committee, which holds eight regularly scheduled meetings a year. The FOMC is made up of the seven members of the Board of Governors; the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; and presidents of four other regional Federal Reserve Banks who serve on a rotating basis.1 Only these members vote on policy decisions. For example, this year I am a voting member and next year my vote will rotate to the president of the Cleveland Fed, Loretta Mester. Although only members vote at roll call, all 12 regional Fed presidents attend FOMC meetings, participate fully in policy discussions and provide their forecasts and perspectives. The inclusion of Bank presidents in policy deliberations and votes underscores the importance of having independent voices on the Committee. The full participation of every president at each meeting also ensures that when the FOMC decides on the appropriate stance of monetary policy, it has information on economic activity from all corners of the nation.\n\nGoals of Monetary Policy — Are We There Yet?\nAt each meeting, as the FOMC deliberates the appropriate stance of monetary policy, it seeks to achieve the mandates set by Congress in a timely fashion. Congress has charged the Federal Reserve with fostering financial conditions that achieve stable prices and maximum sustainable employment. These two goals — together known as our “dual mandate” — guide the Fed’s monetary policy decisions. The Federal Open Market Committee has translated these broadly defined mandates into operational goals.\nFor the first goal, the inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy. So the FOMC has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation. Since January 2012, the Committee has set an explicit 2 percent inflation target, measured by the annual change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE).2\nFor the second goal, quantifying the maximum sustainable level of employment is a much more complex undertaking. Many nonmonetary factors affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market. These factors can vary overtime and are hard to measure. Consequently, the Committee does not set a fixed goal for employment, but instead considers a wide range of indicators to gauge maximum employment.\nNonetheless, FOMC participants do provide their individual views of the longer-run normal level of unemployment that are consistent with the employment mandate. These can be found in the Committee’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which are released four times a year and give participants’ forecasts of key economic metrics over the next three years and for the longer run.3 In the most recent SEP, which was released a little over three weeks ago, the median participant estimated that the normal long-run unemployment rate was 4.9 percent.4 My own assessment is in line with this projection.\nGiven these operational objectives, how close are we to achieving the dual mandate? There is no doubt that labor markets have improved significantly over the past seven years. Job growth has been quite solid for some time now. Last month’s number was somewhat weaker than expected but doesn’t change the overall view. And the unemployment rate has declined significantly from its peak of 10 percent in 2009 and currently stands at 5.1 percent. This is just two-tenths of a percentage point above the median long-run projection. However, a number of other labor market indicators lead me to believe that there still remains some additional resource slack beyond what the unemployment rate alone indicates: Notably, a large number of people who are employed part time would prefer a full-time job; the labor force participation rate is quite low, even after accounting for demographic and other long-running trends; and wage growth has been quite subdued.5\nMy colleagues on the FOMC and I project that over the next three years, the unemployment rate will edge down further and run slightly below its long-run sustainable level.6 I also believe the elements of “extra” labor-market slack I just mentioned will dissipate over that time. What is driving this forecast? Well, gross domestic product (GDP) appears to be well positioned to continue to grow at a fairly solid, though not spectacular, pace for some time. In particular, consumer spending looks to be advancing at a healthy rate — supported in part by lower energy prices and, more importantly, by the improvements in the job market. We economists sometimes refer to this as “virtuous cyclical dynamics” — more jobs lead to more spending, which in turn leads to more jobs. So, although there are some risks, I am relatively confident that we will reach our employment goal within a reasonable period.\nHowever, I am far less confident about reaching our inflation goal within a reasonable time frame. Inflation has been too low for too long. Core PCE inflation — which strips out the volatile energy and food components and is a good indicator of underlying inflation trends — has averaged just 1.4 percent over the past seven years. Core PCE inflation over the past 12 months was just 1.3 percent. The total PCE inflation has barely budged, rising just 0.3 percent over the past year.\nMost FOMC participants expect inflation to rise steadily from these low levels, coming in just a shade under the Committee’s 2 percent target by the end of 2017.7 My own forecast is less sanguine. I expect core PCE inflation to undershoot 2 percent by a greater margin over the next two years than do my colleagues. I expect core PCE inflation will be just below 2 percent at the end of 2018.\nA number of factors inform my inflation forecast. First, low energy prices and increases in the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies continue to generate downward pressure on consumer prices. Second, putting aside the swings in energy prices and the like, core inflation tends to change quite slowly — particularly when it is at low levels. So low core inflation today tends to be a harbinger of low overall inflation for some time. Third, wage growth has been very subdued, coming in around 2 percent to 2-1/2 percent for the past six years. This is well below the 3 to 3-1/2 percent pace we would expect in an economy growing at its potential with inflation at 2 percent. Although higher wage growth is not necessarily a strong predictor of inflation, it is a good corroborating indicator of underlying inflation trends.\nSo given these forces holding back inflation, why do I expect it to rise? Well, the influences from low energy and import prices are expected to be temporary. Additional improvement in the labor market should also help boost inflation. Another important determinant of actual inflation is the public’s perception of inflationary trends because these views get built into the pricing decisions of businesses and the wage aspirations of workers. Currently, these expectations appear to be higher than actual inflation. So they should also help boost inflation. Furthermore, economic theory tells us that in the long run, inflation is a monetary phenomenon, and my forecast for a gradual rise in inflation critically depends on monetary policy maintaining a highly accommodative stance for some time.\nA Risk-management Approach to Monetary Policy\nAs a policymaker, I try to rely on my expertise and judgment and those of my staff to chart a course for the future. But I am aware that I must also guard against overconfidence and have a good Plan B in hand in case obstacles materialize. In determining the best course for monetary policy, I believe the Fed should follow this principle. How does that apply to today’s situation?\nCurrently, there are some downside risks to reaching our maximum employment goal — namely, the potential for weak foreign activity to weigh on U.S. growth. But, as I noted earlier, we have made tremendous progress toward this goal. Economic growth appears to have enough momentum that I am fairly confident that we will reach our maximum employment goal within a reasonable time. However, to reiterate, I am far less confident that we can reach our 2 percent inflation target over the medium term because of a number of important downside risks to the inflation outlook. Now I recognize that “medium term” is somewhat vague. To a central banker it can mean two to three years or three to four years. It is more a term of art than science.\nSo what are these inflation risks? With prospects of slower growth in China and other emerging market economies, low energy and import prices could exert downward pressure on inflation longer than I anticipate. In addition, while many survey-based measures of long-term inflation expectations have been relatively stable in recent years, we shouldn’t take them as confirmation that our 2 percent target is assured. In fact, some survey measures of inflation expectations have ticked down in the past year and a half. Furthermore, financial market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved quite low in recent months. These could reflect either lower expectations of inflation or a heightened concern for the economic conditions that are associated with low inflation. Adding to my unease is anecdotal evidence: I talk to a wide range of business contacts, and none of them are mentioning rising inflationary or cost pressures. None of them are planning for higher inflation. They don’t expect it.\nHow does this asymmetric assessment of risks to achieving the dual mandate goals influence my view of the most appropriate path for monetary policy over the next three years? It leads me to conclude that a later liftoff and a gradual normalization of our monetary policy framework will best position the economy for the potential challenges ahead.\nBefore raising rates, I would like to have more confidence than I do today that inflation is indeed beginning to head higher. Given the current low level of core inflation, some evidence of true upward momentum in actual inflation is critical to this assessment. I believe that it could well be the middle of next year before the headwinds from lower energy prices and the stronger dollar dissipate enough so that we begin to see some sustained upward movement in core inflation. After liftoff, I think it would be appropriate to raise the target interest rate very gradually. This would give us sufficient time to assess how the economy is adjusting to higher rates and the progress we are making toward our policy goals.\nOverall, my view of appropriate policy is somewhat more accommodative than the views held by the majority of my colleagues. In addition to economic and inflation forecasts, FOMC participants also submit individual assessments of the appropriate monetary policy that support their SEP forecasts. These policy judgments are summarized in the FOMC’s well-known “dot plot.”\nThis is the chart I handed you that shows FOMC participants’ views of the appropriate target federal funds rate by the end of each year for 2015 through 2018 and also over the longer run. Each participant’s fed funds rate forecast is shown as a distinct dot at each of these time horizons. According to the median policy projection for the end of 2015, most of my colleagues think that it will be appropriate to raise the target federal funds rate sometime this year. Over the next three years, these prognostications envision a slow increase, to about 3-1/2 percent by the end of 2018. 8 On average, this path is consistent with the target federal funds rate increasing by 25 basis points at every other FOMC meeting over the next three years. This is certainly a gradual path by historical standards. It is even slower than the so-called measured pace of increases over the 2004–06 tightening cycle, which was 25 basis points per meeting.\nAs I said, I think policy should be somewhat more accommodative than this course of action suggested by the median forecasts of the latest SEP. In my view, an extra-patient approach is warranted for several reasons. And you will see that my logic reflects my risk-management approach to monetary policy.\nFirst, after several years of below-target inflation performance and in light of the downside risks to the inflation outlook, appropriate policy should provide enough accommodation to generate a reasonable likelihood that inflation in the future would moderately exceed 2 percent. Aggressive pursuit of achieving our 2 percent target sooner rather than later does indeed open the possibility of modestly overshooting 2 percent. But this is not as heretical as it might first appear. After all, this is a consequence of having a symmetric inflation target: It is difficult to average 2 percent inflation over the medium term if the track record and near-term projections of inflation are all less than 2 percent.\nFurthermore, maintaining credibility is key to effective policy. Historically, central bankers have established their credibility by defending their inflation target from undesirably high inflation. Today, policy needs to validate our claim that we aim to achieve our 2 percent inflation target in a symmetric fashion. Failure to defend our inflation goal from below may weaken the credibility of this claim. The public could begin to mistakenly believe that 2 percent inflation is a ceiling — and not a symmetric target. As a result, expectations for average inflation could fall, lessening the upward pull on actual inflation and making it even more difficult for us to achieve our 2 percent target.\nSecond, consider the other policy mistakes we could make. One possibility is that we begin to raise rates only to learn that we have misjudged the strength of the economy or the upward tilt in inflation. In order to put the economy back on track, we would have to cut interest rates back to zero and possibly even resort to unconventional policy tools, such as more quantitative easing.9 I think quantitative easing has been effective, but it clearly is a second-best alternative to traditional policy. This scenario is not merely hypothetical. Just consider the recent challenges experienced in Europe and Japan. Policymakers tried to raise rates from their lower bounds; but faced with faltering demand, they were forced to reverse course and deploy nontraditional tools more aggressively than before. And we all know the subsequent difficulties Europe and Japan have had in rekindling growth and inflation. So I see substantial costs to premature policy normalization.\nAn alternative potential policy mistake is that sometime during the gradual policy normalization process, inflation begins to rise too quickly. Well, we have the experience and the appropriate tools to deal with such an outcome. Given how slowly underlying inflation would likely move up from the current low levels, we probably could keep inflation in check with only moderate increases in interest rates relative to current forecasts. And given how gradual the projected rate increases are in the latest SEP, the concerns being voiced about the risks of rapid increases in policy rates if inflation were to pick up seem overblown to me. For example, we could raise the funds rate 100 basis points more than envisioned by the median SEP projection in a year simply by increasing rates 25 basis points at every meeting instead of at every other meeting — that’s hardly a steep path of rate increases.\nFurthermore, as I just outlined, there is no problem in moderately overshooting 2 percent. After several years of inflation being too low, a modest overshoot simply would be a natural manifestation of the Federal Reserve’s symmetric inflation target. Moreover, such an outcome is not likely to raise the public’s long-term inflation expectations either — just look at how little these expectations appear to have moved with persistently low inflation readings over the past several years. So, I see the costs of dealing with the emergence of unexpected inflation pressures as being manageable.\nAll told, I think the best policy is to take a very gradual approach to normalization. This would balance both the various risks to my projections for the economy’s most likely path and the costs that would be involved in mitigating those risks.\nNow I would like to emphasize that while I favor a somewhat later lift off than many of my colleagues, the precise timing for the first increase in the federal funds rate is less important to me than the path the funds rate will follow over the entire policy normalization process. After all, today’s medium- and longer-term interest rates depend on market expectations of the entire path for future rates, not just the first move. In turn, these medium- and longer-term rates are key to the borrowing and spending decisions of households and businesses.\nAccordingly, when thinking about the initial stages of normalization, I find it useful to focus on where I think the federal funds rate ought to be at the end of next year given my economic outlook and assessment of the risks. And right now, regardless of the exact date for lift-off, I think it could well be appropriate for the funds rate to still be under 1 percent at the end of 2016.\nThere is an important caveat, though, to my comment downplaying the importance of the exact date of lift-off. It is critically important to me that when we first raise the federal funds rate the FOMC also strongly and effectively communicates its plan for a gradual path for future rate increases. If we do not, then markets might construe an early lift-off as a signal that the Committee is less inclined to provide the degree of accommodation than I think is appropriate for the timely achievement of our dual mandate objectives. I would view this as an important policy error.\nEffective Communications Is a Critical Policy Tool\nI cannot stress enough how critical it is for monetary policymakers to effectively communicate how they aim to achieve their long-run goals and strategies. They must clearly describe how their views on the appropriate path for monetary policy will help generate outcomes for employment and inflation that are consistent with achieving the mandated goals within a reasonable time frame. Moreover, they must demonstrate they have appropriately considered the risks to their outlooks on the economy. I hope I have done that for you today by laying out my forecast for the economy and what I consider to be the appropriate path for policy.\nWe also need to be clear about how monetary policymakers will react to new data as the economy evolves. We talk a lot about data dependence, but what does that really mean? To me, it involves the following: 1) evaluating how the new information alters the outlook and the assessment of risks around that outlook; and 2) adjusting my expected path for policy in a way that keeps us on course to achieve our dual mandate objectives in a timely manner. So, if in the coming months inflation rises more quickly than I currently anticipate and appears to be headed to undesirably high levels, then I would argue to tighten financial conditions sooner and more aggressively than I presently do. If instead inflation headwinds persist, I would advocate a more gradual approach to normalization than I currently envision. In either case, my policy forecasts would change, and I would explain how and why they did.\nSuch communication helps clarify our reaction to new information — the so-called Fed reaction function you hear financial market analysts talk about. This in turn makes it easier for households and businesses to plan for the future. Such transparency is a key feature of goal-oriented, accountable monetary policy — the kind of policy that the Federal Reserve is committed to providing today, and the kind of policy that the Federal Reserve is committed to providing in the future.\nNotes\n1 Currently, there are two vacancies on the seven-member Board of Governors.

It rises to 2.3 percent in 2016 before gradually edging down to 2 percent (the longer-run estimate of real GDP growth) in 2018 (Federal Open Market Committee, 2015a).\n7 In the latest SEP, the median forecast for both core and total PCE inflation is 1.7 percent in 2016, 1.9 percent in 2017, and 2 percent in 2018 (Federal Open Market Committee, 2015a).\n8 Specifically, the median projected path for the target federal funds rate is 0.4 percent at the end of 2015; 1.4 percent at the end of 2016; 2.6 percent at the end of 2017; and 3.4 percent at the end of 2018.

            "content": "Introduction\nGood afternoon. Thank you, Travis.\nBefore I begin, I should note that my commentary reflects my own views and does not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System. I’m going to use the term “FOMC” a lot. The Federal Reserve Board Governors and 12 Reserve Bank Presidents comprise this committee, and it is the group that makes monetary policy decisions for the United States.\nAlthough my comments today will be about the U.S. economy and current monetary policy challenges that the Federal Reserve faces, I’d like to start with an observation about how basic decision-making challenges, similar to what I’m sure many of you regularly face, inform my policy analysis. In 2002, a psychologist by the name of Daniel Kahneman won the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work related to the field of behavioral economics.1 He is the author of a recent book entitled Thinking, Fast and Slow.2 An overly simplistic synopsis of the book is this: Our minds are wired in complicated ways to solve a variety of problems. Sometimes our quick reaction brain reaches the right solution, and other times it doesn’t. That’s when our slower, more thoughtful brain is required to get it right. Recently, I read an interview with Kahneman with the following subtitle: “What would I eliminate if I had a magic wand? Overconfidence.”3 This certainly is food for thought.\nGiven my economics training, my 20 years of experience attending FOMC meetings and the outstanding analyses of my talented Fed staff, I often feel extremely confident about my monetary policy views. But policy mistakes can and have happened throughout the long history of central banks. With this in mind, I’m constantly asking myself, “What if my policy proposals end up being wrong?” So I try to have a Plan B ready to go. For example, in 2011, in an effort to provide more monetary accommodation, I proposed that the FOMC adopt explicit forward guidance that linked our future policy actions to outcomes for unemployment and inflation. This guidance included a safeguard that said accommodation would be dialed back if it unintentionally kindled unacceptably high inflation. So, the proposal had a Plan B imbedded in it. The Federal Open Market Committee adopted a policy along these lines in late 2012. As it turned out, we didn’t need to invoke the safeguard, but I still think it played a critical Plan B role in the policy’s effectiveness.\nAs my speech progresses, I hope you will see similar attempts to provide risk safeguards in my comments today. First, though, I would like to begin with a discussion of the goals of monetary policy.\nGoals of Monetary Policy — Are We There Yet?\nCongress has charged the Federal Reserve with fostering financial conditions that achieve stable prices and maximum sustainable employment. These two goals —together known as our “dual mandate” — guide the Fed’s monetary policy decisions. The Federal Open Market Committee has translated these broadly defined mandates into operational goals.\nFor the first goal, the inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy. So the FOMC has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation. Since January 2012, the Committee has set an explicit 2 percent inflation target, measured by the annual change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE).4\nFor the second goal, quantifying the maximum sustainable level of employment is a much more complex undertaking. Many nonmonetary factors affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market. These factors can vary overtime and are hard to measure. Consequently, the Committee does not set a fixed goal for employment, but instead considers a wide range of indicators to gauge maximum employment.\nNonetheless, FOMC participants do provide their individual views of the longer-run normal level of unemployment that are consistent with the employment mandate. These can be found in the Committee’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which are released four times a year and give participants’ forecasts of key economic metrics over the next three years and for the longer run.5 In the most recent SEP, which was released a little over three weeks ago, the median participant estimated that the normal long-run unemployment rate was 4.9 percent.6 My own assessment is in line with this projection.\nGiven these operational objectives, how close are we to achieving the dual mandate? There is no doubt that labor markets have improved significantly over the past seven years. Job growth has been quite solid for some time now. Last month’s number was somewhat weaker than expected but doesn’t change the overall view. And the unemployment rate has declined significantly from its peak of 10 percent in 2009 and currently stands at 5.1 percent. This is just two-tenths of a percentage point above the median long-run projection. However, a number of other labor market indicators lead me to believe that there still remains some additional resource slack beyond what the unemployment rate alone indicates: Notably, a large number of people who are employed part time would prefer a full-time job; the labor force participation rate is quite low, even after accounting for demographic and other long-running trends; and wage growth has been quite subdued.7\nMy colleagues on the FOMC and I project that over the next three years, the unemployment rate will edge down further and run slightly below its long-run sustainable level.8 I also believe the elements of “extra” labor-market slack I just mentioned will dissipate over that time. What is driving this forecast? Well, gross domestic product (GDP) growth appears to be well positioned to continue at a fairly solid, though not spectacular, pace for some time. In particular, consumer spending looks to be advancing at a healthy rate — supported in part by lower energy prices and, more importantly, by the improvements in the job market. We economists sometimes refer to this as “virtuous cyclical dynamics” — more jobs lead to more spending, which in turn leads to more jobs. So, although there are some risks, I am relatively confident that we will reach our employment goal within a reasonable period.\nHowever, I am far less confident about reaching our inflation goal within a reasonable time frame. Inflation has been too low for too long. Core PCE inflation — which strips out the volatile energy and food components and is a good indicator of underlying inflation trends — has averaged just 1.4 percent over the past seven years. Core PCE inflation over the past 12 months was just 1.3 percent. The total PCE price index has barely budged, rising just 0.3 percent over the past year.\nMost FOMC participants expect inflation to rise steadily from these low levels, coming in just a shade under the Committee’s 2 percent target by the end of 2017.9 My own forecast is less sanguine. I expect core PCE inflation to undershoot 2 percent by a greater margin over the next two years than do my colleagues. I expect core PCE inflation will be just below 2 percent at the end of 2018.\nA number of factors inform my inflation forecast. First, low energy prices and increases in the dollar continue to generate downward pressure on consumer prices. Second, putting aside the swings in energy prices and the like, core inflation tends to change quite slowly — particularly when it is at low levels. So low core inflation today tends to be a harbinger of low overall inflation for some time. Third, wage growth has been very subdued, coming in around 2 percent to 2-1/2 percent for the past six years. This is well below the 3 to 3-1/2 percent pace we would expect in an economy growing at its potential with inflation at 2 percent. Although higher wage growth is not necessarily a strong predictor of inflation, it is a good corroborating indicator of underlying inflation trends.\nSo given these forces holding back inflation, why do I expect it to rise? Well, the influences from low energy and import prices are expected to be temporary. Additional improvement in the labor market should also help boost inflation. Another important determinant of actual inflation is the public’s perception of inflationary trends because these views get built into the pricing decisions of businesses and the wage aspirations of workers. Currently, these expectations appear to be higher than actual inflation. So they should also help boost inflation. Furthermore, economic theory tells us that in the long run, inflation is a monetary phenomenon, and my forecast for a gradual rise in inflation critically depends on monetary policy maintaining a highly accommodative stance for some time.\nA Risk-Management Approach to Monetary Policy\nAs a policymaker, I try to rely on my expertise and judgment and that of my staff to chart a course for the future. But I am aware that I must also guard against overconfidence and have a good Plan B in hand in case obstacles materialize. In determining the best course for monetary policy, I believe the Fed should follow this principle. How does that apply to today’s situation?\nCurrently, there are some downside risks to reaching our maximum employment goal — namely, the potential for weak foreign activity to weigh on U.S. growth. But, as I noted earlier, we have made tremendous progress toward this goal. Economic growth appears to have enough momentum that I am fairly confident that we will reach our maximum employment goal within a reasonable time. However, to reiterate, I am far less confident that we can reach our 2 percent inflation target over the medium term because of a number of important downside risks to the inflation outlook. Now I recognize that “medium term” is somewhat vague. To a central banker it can mean 2 to 3 years or 3 to 4 years. It is more a term of art than science.\nSo what are these inflation risks? With prospects of slower growth in China and other emerging market economies, low energy and import prices could exert downward pressure on inflation longer than I anticipate. In addition, while many survey-based measures of long-term inflation expectations have been relatively stable in recent years, we shouldn’t take them as confirmation that our 2 percent target is assured. In fact, some survey measures of inflation expectations have ticked down in the past year and a half. Furthermore, financial market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved quite low in recent months. These could reflect either lower expectations of inflation or a heightened concern for the economic conditions that are associated with low inflation.

None of them are planning for higher inflation. They don’t expect it.\nHow does this asymmetric assessment of risks to achieving the dual mandate goals influence my view of the most appropriate path for monetary policy over the next three years? It leads me to conclude that a later liftoff and a gradual normalization of our monetary policy framework will best position the economy for the potential challenges ahead.\nBefore raising rates, I would like to have more confidence than I do today that inflation is indeed beginning to head higher.

It is critically important to me that when we first raise rates the FOMC also strongly and effectively communicates its plan for a gradual path for future rate increases. If we do not, then markets might construe an early liftoff as a signal that the Committee is less inclined to provide the degree of accommodation than I think is appropriate for the timely achievement of our dual mandate objectives. I would view this as an important policy error.\nEffective Communications Is a Critical Policy Tool\nI cannot stress enough how critical it is for monetary policymakers to effectively communicate how they aim to achieve their long-run goals and strategies. They must clearly describe how their views on the appropriate path for monetary policy will help generate outcomes for employment and inflation that are consistent with achieving the mandated goals within a reasonable time frame. Moreover, they must demonstrate they have appropriately considered the risks to their outlooks on the economy. I hope I have done that for you today by laying out my forecast for the economy and what I consider to be the appropriate path for policy.\nWe also need to be clear about how monetary policymakers will react to new data as the economy evolves. We talk a lot about data dependence, but what does that really mean? To me, it involves the following: 1) evaluating how the new information alters the outlook and the assessment of risks around that outlook; and 2) adjusting my expected path for policy in a way that keeps us on course to achieve our dual mandate objectives in a timely manner. So, if in the coming months inflation rises more quickly than I currently anticipate and appears to be headed to undesirably high levels, then I would argue to tighten financial conditions sooner and more aggressively than I presently do. If instead inflation headwinds persist, I would advocate a more gradual approach to normalization than I currently envision. In either case, my policy forecasts would change and I would explain how and why they did.\nSuch communication helps clarify our reaction to new information — the so-called Fed reaction function you hear financial market analysts talk about. This in turn makes it easier for households and businesses to plan for the future. Such transparency is a key feature of goal-oriented, accountable monetary policy — the kind of policy that the Federal Reserve is committed to providing today, and the kind of policy that the Federal Reserve is committed to providing in the future.\nNotes\n1 In its announcement, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (2002b) cites Kahneman “for having integrated insights from psychological research into economic science, especially concerning human judgment and decision-making under uncertainty.” For further details on his research, see Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (2002a).\n2 Kahneman (2011).\n3 Shariatmadari (2015).\n4 This was first acknowledged in Federal Open Market Committee (2012).

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you, President Lovell for that kind introduction.\nBefore I begin, I should note that my commentary reflects my own views and does not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System.\nAlthough my comments today will be about the U.S. economy and current monetary policy challenges that the Federal Reserve faces, I know that this lecture series has been a forum for discussions about leadership. So I would like to motivate my comments today with an observation about how leadership challenges inform my policy analysis. In 2002, a psychologist by the name of Daniel Kahneman won the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work related to the field of behavioral economics.1 He is the author of a recent book entitled Thinking, Fast and Slow.2 An overly simplistic synopsis of the book is this: Our minds are wired in complicated ways to solve a variety of problems. Sometimes our quick-reaction brain reaches the right solution, and other times it doesn’t. That’s when our slower, more thoughtful brain is required to get it right. Recently, I read an interview with Kahneman with the following subtitle: “What would I eliminate if I had a magic wand? Overconfidence.”3 This certainly is food for thought, particularly for leaders.\nGiven my training, experience and the outstanding analyses by my talented Fed staff, I often feel extremely confident about my monetary policy views. But policy mistakes can and have happened throughout the long history of central banks. With this in mind, I’m constantly asking myself, “What if my policy proposals end up being wrong?” So I try to have a Plan B ready to go. For example, in 2011, in an effort to provide more monetary accommodation, I proposed that the FOMC adopt explicit forward guidance that linked our future policy actions to outcomes for unemployment and inflation. This guidance included a safeguard that said accommodation would be dialed back if it unintentionally kindled unacceptably high inflation. So, the proposal had a Plan B imbedded in it. The FOMC adopted a policy along these lines in 2012. As it turned out, we didn’t have to invoke the safeguard, but I still think it played a critical role in the policy’s efficacy.\nI hope you will see similar attempts to provide risk safeguards in my comments today. First, though, I would like to begin with a discussion of the goals of monetary policy.\nGoals of Monetary Policy — Are We There Yet?\nCongress has charged the Federal Reserve with fostering financial conditions that achieve stable prices and maximum sustainable employment. These two goals —together known as our “dual mandate” — guide the Fed’s monetary policy decisions. The FOMC has translated these broadly defined mandates into operational goals.\nBecause the inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, the FOMC has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation. Since January 2012, the Committee has set an explicit 2 percent inflation target, measured by the annual change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE).4\nQuantifying the maximum sustainable level of employment is a much more complex undertaking. Many nonmonetary factors — which can vary over time and are hard to measure — affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market. Consequently, the Committee does not set a fixed goal for employment, but instead considers a wide range of indicators to gauge maximum employment.\nNonetheless, FOMC participants do provide their individual views of the longer-run normal level of unemployment that are consistent with the employment mandate. These can be found in the Committee’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which are released four times a year and give participants’ forecasts of key economic metrics over the next three years and for the longer run.5 In the most recent SEP, which was released a little over a week ago, the median participant estimated that the normal long-run unemployment rate was 4.9 percent.6 My own assessment is in line with this projection.\nGiven these operational objectives, how close are we to achieving the dual mandate? There is no doubt that labor markets have improved significantly over the past seven years. Job growth has been quite solid for some time now, and the unemployment rate has declined significantly from its peak of 10 percent in 2009 and currently stands at 5.1 percent — just two-tenths of a percentage point above the median long-run projection. However, a number of other labor market indicators lead me to believe that there still remains some additional resource slack beyond what the unemployment rate alone indicates: Notably, a large number of people who are employed part time would prefer a full-time job; the labor force participation rate is quite low, even after accounting for demographic and other long-running trends; and wage growth has been quite subdued.7  \nMy colleagues on the FOMC and I project that over the next three years, the unemployment rate will edge down further and run slightly below its long-run sustainable level.8 I also believe the elements of “extra” labor-market slack I just mentioned will dissipate over that time. What is driving this forecast? Well, gross domestic product (GDP) growth appears to be well positioned to continue at a fairly solid, though not spectacular, pace for some time. In particular, consumer spending looks to be advancing at a healthy rate — supported importantly by the improvements in the job market. We economists sometimes refer to this as “virtuous cyclical dynamics” — more jobs lead to more spending, which in turn leads to more jobs. So, although there are some risks, I am relatively confident that we will reach our employment goal within a reasonable period.\nHowever, I am far less confident about reaching our inflation goal within a reasonable time frame. Inflation has been too low for too long. Core PCE inflation — which strips out the volatile energy and food components and is a good indicator of underlying inflation trends — has averaged just 1.4 percent over the past seven years. This morning, we received another reading. Core PCE inflation over the past 12 months has been just 1.3 percent, while at 0.3 percent, the total PCE price index has barely budged.\nMost FOMC participants expect inflation to rise steadily from these low levels, coming in just a shade under the Committee’s 2 percent target by the end of 2017.9 My own forecast is less sanguine. I expect core PCE inflation to undershoot 2 percent by a greater margin over the next two years than do my colleagues, and reach just below 2 percent only by the end of 2018.\nA number of factors inform my inflation forecast. First, low energy prices and the relatively strong dollar continue to generate downward pressure on consumer prices, but these influences are expected to be temporary. Second, putting aside the swings in energy prices and the like, core inflation tends to change quite slowly – particularly when it is at low levels. So low core inflation today tends to be a harbinger of low overall inflation for some time. Third, wage growth has been very subdued, coming in around 2 percent to 2-1/2 percent for the past six years. This is well below the 3 to 3-1/2 percent pace we would expect in an economy growing at its potential with inflation at 2 percent. Although higher wage growth is not necessarily a strong predictor of inflation, it is a good corroborating indicator of underlying inflation trends.\nSo given these forces holding back inflation, why do I expect it to rise? Additional improvement in the labor market should help boost inflation. Another important determinant of actual inflation is the public’s perception of inflationary trends because these views get built into the pricing decisions of businesses and the wage aspirations of workers. Currently, these expectations appear to be higher than actual inflation. So they should help boost inflation once temporary influences dissipate. Furthermore, economic theory tells us that in the long run, inflation is a monetary phenomenon, and my forecast for a gradual rise in inflation critically depends on monetary policy maintaining a highly accommodative stance for some time.\nA Risk-Management Approach to Monetary Policy\nI began by noting that effective leaders must use their expertise and good judgment to chart a course for the future, but that they must also guard against overconfidence and have a good Plan B in hand in case obstacles materialize. In determining the best course for monetary policy, I believe the Fed should follow this principle. How does that apply to today’s situation?\nCurrently, there are some downside risks to reaching our maximum employment goal — namely, the potential for weak foreign activity to weigh on U.S. growth. But, as I noted earlier, we have made tremendous progress toward this goal. Economic growth appears to have enough momentum that I am fairly confident that we will reach our maximum employment goal within a reasonable time. However, to reiterate, I am far less confident that we can reach our 2 percent inflation target over the medium term because of a number of important downside risks to the inflation outlook.\nWith prospects of slower growth in China and other emerging market economies, low energy and import prices could exert downward pressure on inflation longer than I anticipate. In addition, while many survey-based measures of long-term inflation expectations have been relatively stable in recent years, we shouldn’t take them as confirmation that our 2 percent target is assured. In fact, some survey measures of inflation expectations have ticked down in the past year and a half. Furthermore, financial market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved quite low in recent months. These could reflect either lower expectations of inflation or a heightened concern for the economic conditions that are associated with low inflation. Adding to my unease is anecdotal evidence: I talk to a wide range of business contacts, and none of them are mentioning rising inflationary or cost pressures. None of them are planning for higher inflation.\nHow does this asymmetric assessment of risks to achieving the dual mandate goals influence my view of the most appropriate path for monetary policy over the next three years? It leads me to conclude that a later liftoff and a gradual subsequent approach to normalizing monetary policy best position the economy for the potential challenges ahead.\nBefore raising rates, I would like to have more confidence than I do today that inflation is indeed beginning to head higher. Given the current low level of core inflation, some evidence of true upward momentum in actual inflation is critical to this assessment. I believe that it could well be the middle of next year before the headwinds from lower energy prices and the stronger dollar dissipate enough so that we begin to see some sustained upward movement in core inflation. After liftoff, I think it would be appropriate to raise the target interest rate very gradually. This would give us sufficient time to assess how the economy is adjusting to higher rates and the progress we are making toward our policy goals\nOverall, my view of appropriate policy is somewhat more accommodative than what is represented by the median of the FOMC’s well-known “dot plot.” This is the chart that shows FOMC participants’ views of the appropriate target federal funds rate by the end of each year in our forecast period and over the longer run. Most of my colleagues think that it will be appropriate to raise the target federal funds rate sometime this year and then slowly increase it to a bit under 3-1/2 percent by the end of 2018.10 On average, this path is consistent with the target federal funds rate increasing by 25 basis points at every other FOMC meeting over the next three years. This is certainly a gradual path by historical standards — even slower than the measured pace of increases over the 2004–06 tightening cycle, which was 25 basis points per meeting.\nAs I said, I think policy should be somewhat more accommodative than the course of action suggested by the median forecasts of the latest SEP. In my view, such an extra-patient approach is warranted for several reasons. And you will see that my logic reflects my risk-management approach to monetary policy.\nFirst, after several years of below-target inflation performance and in light of the downside risks to the inflation outlook, appropriate policy should provide enough accommodation to generate a reasonable likelihood that inflation in the future would moderately exceed 2 percent. Aggressive pursuit of achieving our 2 percent target sooner rather than later does indeed open the possibility of modestly overshooting 2 percent. But this is not as heretical as it might first appear. After all, this is a consequence of having a symmetric inflation target: It is difficult to average 2 percent inflation over the medium term if the track record and near-term projections of inflation are all less than 2 percent.\nFurthermore, maintaining credibility is key to effective policy. Thus, policy needs to validate our claim that we aim to achieve our 2 percent inflation target in a symmetric fashion. Failure to defend our inflation goal from when we are considerably below target may weaken the credibility of this claim. The public could begin to mistakenly believe that 2 percent inflation is a ceiling — and not a symmetric target. As a result, expectations for average inflation could fall, lessening the upward pull on actual inflation and making it even more difficult for us to achieve our target.\nSecond, consider the other policy mistakes we could make. One possibility is that we begin to raise rates only to learn that we have misjudged the strength of the economy or the upward tilt in inflation. In order to put the economy back on track, we would have to cut interest rates back to zero and possibly even resort to unconventional policy tools, such as more quantitative easing.11 I think quantitative easing has been effective, but it clearly is a second-best alternative to traditional policy. This scenario is not merely hypothetical. Just consider the recent challenges experienced in Europe and Japan. Policymakers tried to raise rates from their lower bounds; but faced with faltering demand, they were forced to reverse course and deploy nontraditional tools more aggressively than before. And we all know the subsequent difficulties Europe and Japan have had in rekindling growth and inflation. So I see substantial costs to premature policy normalization.\nAn alternative potential policy mistake is that sometime during the gradual policy normalization process, inflation begins to rise too quickly. Well, we have the experience and the appropriate tools to deal with such an outcome. Given how slowly underlying inflation would likely move up from the current low levels, we probably could keep inflation in check with only moderate increases in interest rates relative to current forecasts. And given how gradual the projected rate increases are in the latest SEP, the concerns being voiced about the risks of rapid increases in policy rates if inflation were to pick up seem overblown.\nFurthermore, as I just outlined, there is no problem in moderately overshooting 2 percent. After several years of inflation being too low, a modest overshoot simply would be a natural manifestation of the Federal Reserve’s symmetric inflation target. Moreover, such an outcome is not likely to raise the public’s long-term inflation expectations either — just look at how little these expectations appear to have moved with persistently low inflation readings over the past several years. So, I see the costs of dealing with the emergence of unexpected inflation pressures as being manageable.\nAll told, I think the best policy is to take a very gradual approach to normalization. This would balance both the various risks to my projections for the economy’s most likely path and the costs that would be involved in mitigating those risks.\nEffective Communications Is a Critical Policy Tool\nIn my remarks today, I stressed the need for the FOMC to follow interest rate policies that credibly demonstrate its commitment to a symmetric inflation target. As I noted earlier, one of the channels through which monetary policy affects the economy is through its influence on the public’s expectations about inflation and economic activity. Accordingly, a critical component of monetary policy is to effectively communicate how we aim to achieve our long-run goals and strategies.\nPolicymakers must clearly describe how their views on the appropriate path for monetary policy will help generate outcomes for employment and inflation that are consistent with achieving the mandated goals within a reasonable time frame. Moreover, they must demonstrate they have appropriately considered the risks to their outlooks on the economy. I hope I have done that for you today by laying out my forecast for the economy and what I consider to be the appropriate path for policy.\nWe also need to be clear about how monetary policymakers will react to new data as the economy evolves. We talk a lot about data dependence, but what does that really mean? To me, it involves the following: 1) evaluating how the new information alters the outlook and the assessment of risks around that outlook; and 2) adjusting my expected path for policy in a way that keeps us on course to achieve our dual mandate objectives in a timely manner. So, if in the coming months inflation rises more quickly than I currently anticipate and appears to be headed to undesirably high levels, then I would argue to tighten financial conditions sooner and more aggressively than I presently do. If instead inflation headwinds persist, I would advocate a more gradual approach to normalization than I currently envision. In either case, my policy forecasts would change and I would explain how and why they did.\nSuch communication helps clarify our reaction to new information — the so-called Fed reaction function you hear financial market analysts talk about. This in turn makes it easier for households and businesses to plan for the future. Such transparency is a key feature of goal-oriented, accountable monetary policy.\nConclusion\nIn summary, regardless of when we begin to normalize policy rates, I believe that the rate increases should be gradual —both from the point of view of my baseline outlook for the economy and from a perspective where I have weighed the risks and potential costs of policy missteps. As we manage this next phase for monetary policy, it remains essential that we carefully articulate the rationale for our policies. This would ensure that monetary policy is transparent, accountable and effective.\nThank you.\nNotes\n1 In its announcement, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (2002b) cites Kahneman “for having integrated insights from psychological research into economic science, especially concerning human judgment and decision-making under uncertainty.” For further details on his research, see Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (2002a).\n2 Kahneman (2011).\n3 Shariatmadari (2015).\n4 This was first acknowledged in Federal Open Market Committee (2012).

            "content": "Good afternoon.\nThank you for inviting me to this year’s Economic Growth, Monetary Policy and Structural Reform: Challenges Ahead for the U.S. and Europe conference.\nToday, I would like to share my outlook for the U.S. economy and my assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Let me note that my comments reflect my own views and do not necessarily represent the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System.\nTo give you the punch line, I think the outlook for growth in economic activity and the labor market is good. However, inflation is too low, and I expect it will be so for some time. Based on this forecast, and the risks to the outlook, I think the FOMC should refrain from raising the federal funds rate (our traditional short-term interest rate policy tool) until there is much greater confidence that inflation one or two years ahead will be at our 2 percent target. I see no compelling reason for us to be in a hurry to tighten financial conditions until then.\nNow, for the details.\nNearing Our Employment Goal\nFollowing years of false starts and tepid growth, economic activity advanced at a solid pace over the past two years. Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an average rate of about 2-1/2 percent over this time, and growth was quite rapid in the second half of 2014. True, growth stalled in the first quarter of this year, but this appears to reflect in some part transitory factors. The underlying fundamentals still look good. So, I expect growth to average in the 2-1/2 to 3 percent range over the next couple of years. \nAs output growth has improved, so has the labor market. The average monthly increase in payroll employment was about 260,000 per month in 2014 and early 2015. This is well above the average monthly gain of roughly 190,000 over the previous two years. Job growth was subdued in March, but recovered to a healthy 223,000 in April. In my estimation, with 2-1/2 to 3 percent output growth, average job gains should remain above the 200,000 mark for a while longer before gradually moving back down toward its longer-run trend. \nMeanwhile, the unemployment rate has declined significantly. In each of the past four years, it has fallen by about 1 percentage point and now stands at 5.4 percent. This is terrific progress, but it remains somewhat higher than what a normal, sustainable unemployment rate should be.  \nFour times a year, my colleagues and I are asked to submit forecasts of real GDP growth, the unemployment rate and inflation over the next three years and for the longer run.1 Last March, most FOMC participants’ estimates for the longer-run normal rate of unemployment fell in the range of 5.0 percent to 5.2 percent. Based in part on the extensive analysis done by my staff on demographic and other changes in the composition of the labor force, my current thinking is that the number is at the bottom of that range.2 So, I think we are still about 1/2 of a percentage point above the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.\nFurthermore, some other indicators suggest that there is more slack in labor markets than one would infer from the unemployment rate alone. For example, the number of people who are employed part time for economic reasons remains unusually high.3 If the economy were closer to full employment, these individuals would have more opportunities to find full-time jobs. Moreover, wage growth has been much lower than one would expect if labor markets were closer to normal.\nEven with these caveats, it’s clear that economic activity and labor markets have improved significantly over the past two years. And monetary policy has been an important factor in helping the economy achieve this progress.\nMissing Our Inflation Goal\nThings are different with inflation.\nSince 2012, the FOMC has set an explicit longer-run goal for inflation of 2 percent as measured by the year-over-year rate of change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE).4 Overall, inflation has been running well below this rate for quite some time, averaging about 1-1/2 percent for the past six years. Currently, core PCE inflation, which is a better indicator of underlying trends, was 1.3 percent over the past year.5 Of course, there are other measures of inflation, such as the well-known Consumer Price Index (CPI).6 CPI inflation runs 1/4 to 1/2 of a percentage point higher than PCE measure on average because of differences in the methodologies used to compute the indexes. So a 2 percent goal for PCE inflation equates to something closer to a 2-1/2 percent goal in terms of CPI inflation. By this measure, too, inflation is falling well short of our goal, as the CPI has averaged less than 2 percent since 2008.\nSimply put, inflation is too low. Just as too-high inflation can impose significant costs on the economy, so can too-low inflation. When prices and, along with them, wages and incomes rise at a slower rate than anticipated, borrowers’ fixed monthly loan obligations become more burdensome. These costs now have been accumulating for the past six-plus years that inflation has underrun the FOMC’s 2 percent target that borrowers had relied upon. To meet these higher real costs, borrowers must cut back on other spending, reducing aggregate demand and ultimately weighing on economic activity. This is an important reason why we need to achieve our 2 percent inflation objective.\nLooking ahead, I am anticipating inflation to rise at a pretty gradual pace, reaching our 2 percent objective only in 2018. That’s a pretty slow increase. Furthermore, there is downside risk to my projection.\nSome of this risk surrounds two factors that have held down inflation recently. First, there is the stronger dollar, which has reduced the prices of imported products we buy in the United States. Second, the dramatic decline in oil prices has lowered the costs of energy-related items and bolstered the real spending capacity of consumers and businesses.\nIf lower import and energy prices result in just a one-time drop in consumer prices, then they would not be an issue for monetary policymakers to worry about. But if the lower pricing gets embedded more persistently in the longer-run inflationary expectations of households and businesses, it would be even harder to get inflation back to its 2 percent target. This is not in my baseline forecast, but such a drop in inflation expectations is a downside risk that we need to be on the watch for.\nI don’t have to remind this audience that low inflation is a global phenomenon. In part, this reflects slower global growth and disinflationary pressures in most advanced economies. Of course, a global slowdown also presents some downside risk for growth in the United States as well.\nAn Appropriate Path for Monetary Policy\nWhat does this all mean for my assessment of appropriate monetary policy?\nAlong with projections for the key metrics of the economy that I mentioned earlier, each FOMC participant provides his or her assumption for the appropriate path of the federal funds rate that underlies their economic forecasts. In the latest projections, made last March, 15 of the 17 FOMC participants expected that it would be appropriate to raise rates sometime this year.\nLooking further ahead, I note that the median path for the target fed funds rate is consistent with roughly a 25 basis point increase at every other FOMC meeting for the next year and a half. This is a considerably slower, more gradual pace of rate increases than those implemented in 2004 through 2006, the last time the Fed normalized policy following an extended period of very low interest rates.\nFinancial market participants expect an even slower pace of rate hikes than FOMC participants do. The most recent reading on market expectations puts the target rate at the end of 2016 at around 1 percent — a full percentage point below the median FOMC forecast.\nIn my view, it likely will not be appropriate to begin raising the fed funds rate until sometime in early 2016. Economic activity appears to be on a solid, sustainable growth path, which, on its own, would support a rate hike soon. However, the weak first-quarter data do give me pause, and I would like to see confirmation that they are indeed a transitory aberration. Furthermore, and most important, inflation is low and is expected to remain low for some time.\nA prudent risk-management and goal-oriented approach to monetary policy also prescribes waiting to increase the fed funds rate.7 One risk we face is that we begin to raise rates only to learn that we have misjudged the strength of the economy. In order to rekindle growth and boost inflation, we would have to cut rates back to zero and possibly resort to unconventional, second-best policy tools. It could take some time, then, to get back out of the mess. In contrast, if we wait too long to raise rates, we face the opposite risk of inflation rising too quickly. Here, though, we could likely keep inflation in check with moderate increases in interest rates. Furthermore, there aren’t any serious costs of modestly overshooting our inflation target — particularly considering how long inflation has been below our target. It simply would be a natural manifestation of the Federal Reserve’s symmetric inflation target.\nThis risk-management approach is essential in the presence of substantial uncertainty about the equilibrium real rate of interest, which is also often referred to as the neutral or natural interest rate. Often associated with the Swedish economist Knut Wicksell, this is the inflation-adjusted interest rate that equates demand to supply when the economy operates at full employment of labor and productive capital and inflation is at its long-run target. One can gauge the stance of monetary policy by comparing the level of actual interest rate to this equilibrium rate. When the actual inflation-adjusted federal funds rate is below the equilibrium rate, policy is accommodative, and we would expect inflation pressures to build. When the actual federal funds rate is higher than the equilibrium rate, policy is restrictive, and there is downward pressure on inflation. The bigger the gap is between the actual and equilibrium rates, the greater are these pressures.\nWhen the economy is below its productive capacity, the Wicksellian rate is low. For instance, during the financial crisis, the equilibrium real interest rate was very low — indeed quite negative — reflecting the dearth of spending opportunities that looked attractive to households, businesses and the financial sector, all of which needed to rebuild scarred balance sheets. Unless actual real rates were reduced, financial conditions would have been extraordinarily restrictive. To try to drive actual interest rates toward the unusually low equilibrium rate, monetary policy had to be as accommodative as possible — however, the zero lower bound (ZLB) on interest rates prevented us from actually getting there.\nOver time, as fundamentals have improved and the economy has worked through the scars from the financial crisis, the equilibrium real rate has risen. And it should continue to rise as the healing process continues. The key question is this: Has the Wicksellian rate risen enough so that our currently low federal funds rate is now finally providing too much policy accommodation?\nI think the answer is no.\nIf the equilibrium real interest rate were observable, the job of central bankers would be much easier. But, it is not. There is a great deal of uncertainty over the current equilibrium real rate. It could be lower or higher than the level needed to justify a rate hike. However, there are a number of simple observations that suggest the equilibrium rate is still low enough — that is, the fundamentals of the economy have not improved enough — that the current level of the federal funds rate is not overly accommodative. As I noted before, resource slack still remains. There is no meaningful upward momentum in inflation. And instead of investing, businesses are sitting on piles of cash or distributing it to stockholders: This is a sign that they think the real rate of return on prospective investment projects is quite low.\nIndeed, one could argue that we currently do not have enough policy accommodation in place. As I mentioned earlier, my forecast does not see inflation rising to our 2 percent target until 2018 — for me, that’s too far down the road given how long we have underrun our target. If policy truly were highly accommodative, we’d be getting to our inflation target sooner. Furthermore, I think policy should be sufficiently accommodative so that the probability that PCE inflation is at least 2 percent within two years is greater than a 50-50 coin flip.\nAnother way to state this is that the odds should favor modestly overshooting our 2 percent target sometime in the medium term. This is not a radical idea; let me expand on this point.\nA symmetric 2 percent inflation target means that over long periods of time, we should expect that inflation will average 2 percent. At the point when one is confident that inflation will be at our 2 percent objective, the probability that inflation will run above 2 percent ought to equal the probability that it will run below 2 percent. So given that we are starting below target and that we have been so for six years, it makes sense to favor some overshooting in order to have sufficient confidence that we actually will achieve our objective in a reasonable amount of time. This is a defining characteristic of a symmetric inflation objective.\nWhat is the worry if we spend ten years from 2009 through 2018 with inflation below 2 percent? Well, if we do, the public would likely infer that 2 percent is not a symmetric target but rather the upper end of our inflation tolerance. In that case, over the long run, the public would see the odds of inflation falling below 2 percent well exceeding the odds of it running above 2 percent. There could be serious policy costs from this outcome. Importantly, addressing adverse economic shocks could become problematic. Let me describe the economic mechanism in a bit more detail.\nSuppose we hit bad times, the economy contracts and inflation softens well below 2 percent — such as we’ve seen over the past six years. Here, it would be appropriate for the Fed to provide ample monetary accommodation. If the public doubts our resolve to bring low inflation back up to target, it will expect inflation to run below 2 percent for a long time. Also, if markets don’t believe we will set policy to aggressively boost inflation, the expected future path for the nominal federal funds rate will be higher than it otherwise would be. Of course, expectations of lower inflation and higher future short-term nominal interest rates are both going to translate directly into higher current longer-maturity real interest rates; these, in turn, are the relevant costs of capital consideration for housing, most business capital spending projects and many asset prices. So by failing to embrace a symmetric inflation target, we’ve made monetary policy less accommodative — hardly the outcome we need if we find ourselves in tough economic times.\nSometimes in public forums, I hear the comment, “Well, 1 percent inflation is good for consumers and savers. If borrowing costs are too high, just cut the nominal funds rate more to offset these effects.” The problem is you can only cut the fed funds rate to zero. If inflation were 1 percent, nominal interest rates would likely be very low as well, so you just wouldn’t have that much room to provide a great deal of accommodation if you really needed to do so.\nOne factor that influenced the FOMC’s decision to select an inflation target of 2 percent was research that showed a low likelihood of hitting the zero lower bound on the federal funds rate under this 2 percent target.8 And simulations showed that if we did hit the bound, our time there would be fairly short-lived. But this research was based on a symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. Symmetry is crucial. At our inflation objective, we need the probability that inflation is above 2 percent to be the same as the probability it will be below 2 percent. Without symmetry and, hence, with an inflation objective effectively below 2 percent, the odds of hitting the ZLB would be greater and the time spent there would be longer. Our experience of the past six years illustrates how undesirable such an outcome would be.\nFor me, the way to avoid a loss of credibility about our symmetric target is to make sure we have enough accommodation in place to achieve our 2 percent objective in a timely manner. Today, this policy would mean leaving the fed funds rate at zero until I was more confident that the equilibrium real rate is well north of the actual rate and that the equilibrium rate was rising smartly. And to establish adequate upward momentum in inflation, I think it likely also would be appropriate to increase the fed funds rate target only gradually for a while after the first rate hike.\nOf course, there are also substantial uncertainties over the inflation outlook. Inflation is notoriously hard to forecast. Indeed, logically, because the equilibrium real interest rate has a strong bearing on the inflation outlook, the uncertainty over it that I mentioned earlier goes hand in hand with the uncertainty in inflation forecasting. We can’t be confident that inflation is headed back up to 2 percent unless we are also confident that our policy setting relative to the equilibrium real rate path is accommodative enough to return inflation to target.\nOf course, the forecast and equilibrium rate uncertainty also means we can’t fine-tune the future path for inflation. Naturally, any policy that gets the probability of hitting 2 percent in a timely fashion high enough is going to be boosting the probability that inflation will spend some time moderately above 2 percent as well. But as I argued earlier, I don’t see this as costly. Indeed, considering how long inflation has been below target, adopting a policy that allows the possibility of such an overshoot actually seems necessary to support the credibility of our symmetric target.\nMarkers of Progress\nGoing forward, I will be looking for several important markers to assess if the equilibrium real rate has risen to the point that we’re likely to achieve our policy goals in a timely fashion. Only then will I be confident enough to support the start of the policy normalization process.\nFirst, it goes without saying that we need to see continued improvements in labor markets and solid GDP growth. Even though we have made great strides, the economy has not yet returned to full employment, and we must be confident that growth will be adequate to get there.\nSecond, we should feel quite confident that inflation is going to reach our goal of 2 percent on a sustainable basis within a year or two. Of course, given the lags in how monetary policy influences the economy, this means the first rate hike will occur based on a forecast. There are a lot of elements in play, and we have to be humble about our ability to forecast inflation. This means we need an array of evidence to be confident that inflation will rise.\nAll else being equal, a tighter labor market has historically been associated with higher inflation, and so further improvements relative to our employment mandate should also be consistent with a forecast that achieves our inflation mandate.9\nAnother simple but powerful signal will be if we start seeing a pickup in the year-over-year rate of change in the price index for PCE inflation excluding food and energy. This index may be about the single best predictor of where total inflation will be a year from now. So I would feel more confident about my inflation outlook if core PCE inflation began to rise in a sustainable fashion.\nI would also want to see stronger growth in wages and other forms of labor compensation. Wage growth has been very weak for quite some time, averaging only 2 to 2-1/2 percent per year for the past five years. Usually, productivity growth of 1 to 2 percent annually and 2 percent inflation would produce wage growth in the range of 3 to 4 percent per year. Wage and compensation growth closer to this range is an important sign not just of diminished labor market slack, but also of cost increases more consistent with an economy running closer to a 2 percent inflation rate. Of course, a lot of factors — some of which we don’t have a good handle on right now — go into wage determination, and in the past, rising inflation has tended to precede rising wages. Nonetheless, faster wage growth would be good corroborating evidence that inflation was on its way up.\nAnother signal that would make me more confident relates to measures of inflation expectations, which are an important determinant of actual inflation. To reach our 2 percent inflation target, the public and financial markets need to expect that inflation will run at 2 percent over the medium term. Of particular concern on this score is the fact that the compensation that financial market participants require for taking on inflation risk has moved down considerably over the past year. There are a few reasons why inflation compensation could be low. Benign technical financial market considerations are one possibility. However, it could be that people are expecting inflation to be low. Alternatively, the cost to investors of higher inflation might have fallen or the cost of low inflation might have risen. Neither depressed inflation expectations nor higher costs of low inflation bode well for the outlook. So I also would feel more confident about the inflation outlook if either inflation compensation picked back up to previous levels or we had more evidence that the drop in compensation was due to benign technical factors.\nCurrent Circumstances Call for Caution\nIn summary, I think we should be cautious in the timing of the first rate-hike and our pace of policy normalization thereafter. My current view is that my economic outlook and my assessment of the balance of risks will evolve in such a way that I likely will not feel confident enough to begin to raise rates until early next year. But there is no prescribed timeline that must be adhered to — and no pre-set script to follow — other than that we should let economic conditions and risks to the outlook be our guides. Given uncomfortably low inflation and uncertainties about the economic environment, I see significant risks, but few benefits, to increasing interest rates prematurely.\nLet’s be confident that we will achieve both dual mandate goals within a reasonable period of time before taking actions that could undermine the very progress we seek.\nNotes\n1 See Federal Open Market Committee (2015a), which features the most recent results from the Summary of Economic Projections. The longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of where the variables would be under appropriate policy and in the absence of any economic shocks. The full range of projections for the longer-run unemployment rate is currently 4.9 percent to 5.8 percent.\n2 See Aaronson et al. (2014, 2015) — recent research by Chicago Fed staff on labor force participation rates and the natural rate of unemployment.\n3 During the recession, the share of labor force employed part time for economic reasons increased sharply and the labor force participation rate declined significantly, creating large gaps with respect to their trend levels. Currently, these gaps are still sizable.\n4 This was first acknowledged in Federal Open Market Committee (2012). It remains in the most recent statement of our longer-run goals; see Federal Open Market Committee (2015b).\n5 Core PCE inflation strips out the volatile energy and food prices and thus provides a more accurate reading on underlying inflation trends than overall PCE inflation. I discuss this measure again later.\n6 The CPI differs from the PCE deflator in methodology and the basket of goods and services it tracks.\n7 I have made the case for patience in earlier speeches.

            "content": "Good afternoon.\nThank you for inviting me to the Global Outlook Seminar.\nToday, I would like to share my outlook for the U.S. economy and my assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Let me note that my comments reflect my own views and do not necessarily represent the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System.\nTo give you the punch line, I think the outlook for growth in economic activity and the labor market is good. However, inflation is too low, and it has been too low for the last 6 years. Moreover, my forecast is for inflation to rise at a very gradual pace, reaching our 2 percent objective only in 2018. Based on this forecast, and the risks to the outlook, I think the FOMC should refrain from raising the federal funds rate (our traditional short-term interest rate policy tool) until there is much greater confidence that inflation one or two years ahead will be at our 2 percent target. I see no compelling reason for us to be in a hurry to tighten financial conditions until then.\nNow, for the details.\nNearing Our Employment Goal\nFollowing years of false starts and tepid growth, economic activity advanced at a solid pace over the past two years. Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an average rate of about 2-1/2 percent over this time, and growth was quite rapid in the second half of 2014. True, growth stalled in the first quarter of this year, but this appears to reflect in some part transitory factors. The underlying fundamentals still look good. So, I expect growth to average in the 2-1/2 to 3 percent range over the next couple of years. \nAs output growth has improved, so has the labor market. The average monthly increase in payroll employment was about 260,000 per month in 2014 and early 2015. This is well above the average monthly gain of roughly 190,000 over the previous two years. Job growth was subdued in March, but recovered to a healthy 223,000 in April. In my estimation, with 2-1/2 to 3 percent output growth, average job gains should remain above the 200,000 mark for a while longer before gradually moving back down toward its longer-run trend. \nMeanwhile, the unemployment rate has declined significantly. In each of the past four years, it has fallen by about 1 percentage point and now stands at 5.4 percent. This is terrific progress, but it remains somewhat higher than what a normal, sustainable unemployment rate should be.  \nFour times a year, my colleagues and I are asked to submit forecasts of real GDP growth, the unemployment rate and inflation over the next three years and for the longer run.1 Last March, most FOMC participants’ estimates for the longer-run normal rate of unemployment fell in the range of 5.0 percent to 5.2 percent. Based in part on the extensive analysis done by my staff on demographic and other changes in the composition of the labor force, my current thinking is that the number is at the bottom of that range.2 So, I think we are still about 1/2 of a percentage point above the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.\nFurthermore, some other indicators suggest that there is more slack in labor markets than one would infer from the unemployment rate alone. For example, the number of people who are employed part time for economic reasons remains unusually high.3 If the economy were closer to full employment, these individuals would have more opportunities to find full-time jobs. Moreover, wage growth has been much lower than one would expect if labor markets were closer to normal.\nEven with these caveats, it’s clear that economic activity and labor markets have improved significantly over the past two years. And monetary policy has been an important factor in helping the economy achieve this progress.\nMissing Our Inflation Goal\nThings are different with inflation.\nSince 2012, the FOMC has set an explicit longer-run goal for inflation of 2 percent as measured by the year-over-year rate of change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE).4 Overall, inflation has been running well below this rate for quite some time, averaging about 1-1/2 percent for the past six years. Currently, core PCE inflation, which is a better indicator of underlying trends, was 1.3 percent over the past year.5 Of course, there are other measures of inflation, such as the well-known Consumer Price Index (CPI).6 CPI inflation runs 1/4 to 1/2 of a percentage point higher than PCE measure on average because of differences in the methodologies used to compute the indexes. So a 2 percent goal for PCE inflation equates to something closer to a 2-1/2 percent goal in terms of CPI inflation. By this measure, too, inflation is falling well short of our goal, as the CPI has averaged less than 2 percent since 2008.\nSimply put, inflation is too low. Just as too-high inflation can impose significant costs on the economy, so can too-low inflation. When prices and, along with them, wages and incomes rise at a slower rate than anticipated, borrowers’ fixed monthly loan obligations become more burdensome. These costs now have been accumulating for the past six-plus years that inflation has underrun the FOMC’s 2 percent target that borrowers had relied upon.

This is an important reason why we need to achieve our 2 percent inflation objective.\nLooking ahead, I am anticipating inflation to rise at a pretty gradual pace, reaching our 2 percent objective only in 2018.

Furthermore, I think policy should be sufficiently accommodative so that the probability that PCE inflation is at least 2 percent within two years is greater than a 50-50 coin flip.\nAnother way to state this is that the odds should favor modestly overshooting our 2 percent target sometime in the medium term. This is not a radical idea; let me expand on this point.\nA symmetric 2 percent inflation target means that over long periods of time, we should expect that inflation will average 2 percent. At the point when one is confident that inflation will be at our 2 percent objective, the probability that inflation will run above 2 percent ought to equal the probability that it will run below 2 percent. So given that we are starting below target and that we have been so for six years, it makes sense to favor some overshooting in order to have sufficient confidence that we actually will achieve our objective in a reasonable amount of time. This is a defining characteristic of a symmetric inflation objective.\nWhat is the worry if we spend ten years from 2009 through 2018 with inflation below 2 percent? Well, if we do, the public would likely infer that 2 percent is not a symmetric target but rather the upper end of our inflation tolerance. In that case, over the long run, the public would see the odds of inflation falling below 2 percent well exceeding the odds of it running above 2 percent. There could be serious policy costs from this outcome. Importantly, addressing adverse economic shocks could become problematic. Let me describe the economic mechanism in a bit more detail.\nSuppose we hit bad times, the economy contracts and inflation softens well below 2 percent — such as we’ve seen over the past six years. Here, it would be appropriate for the Fed to provide ample monetary accommodation. If the public doubts our resolve to bring low inflation back up to target, it will expect inflation to run below 2 percent for a long time. Also, if markets don’t believe we will set policy to aggressively boost inflation, the expected future path for the nominal federal funds rate will be higher than it otherwise would be. Of course, expectations of lower inflation and higher future short-term nominal interest rates are both going to translate directly into higher current longer-maturity real interest rates; these, in turn, are the relevant costs of capital consideration for housing, most business capital spending projects and many asset prices. So by failing to embrace a symmetric inflation target, we’ve made monetary policy less accommodative — hardly the outcome we need if we find ourselves in tough economic times.\nSometimes in public forums, I hear the comment, “Well, 1 percent inflation is good for consumers and savers. If borrowing costs are too high, just cut the nominal funds rate more to offset these effects.” The problem is you can only cut the fed funds rate to zero. If inflation were 1 percent, nominal interest rates would likely be very low as well, so you just wouldn’t have that much room to provide a great deal of accommodation if you really needed to do so.\nOne factor that influenced the FOMC’s decision to select an inflation target of 2 percent was research that showed a low likelihood of hitting the zero lower bound on the federal funds rate under this 2 percent target.8 And simulations showed that if we did hit the bound, our time there would be fairly short-lived. But this research was based on a symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. Symmetry is crucial. At our inflation objective, we need the probability that inflation is above 2 percent to be the same as the probability it will be below 2 percent. Without symmetry and, hence, with an inflation objective effectively below 2 percent, the odds of hitting the ZLB would be greater and the time spent there would be longer. Our experience of the past six years illustrates how undesirable such an outcome would be.\nFor me, the way to avoid a loss of credibility about our symmetric target is to make sure we have enough accommodation in place to achieve our 2 percent objective in a timely manner. Today, this policy would mean leaving the fed funds rate at zero until I was more confident that the equilibrium real rate is well north of the actual rate and that the equilibrium rate was rising smartly. And to establish adequate upward momentum in inflation, I think it likely also would be appropriate to increase the fed funds rate target only gradually for a while after the first rate hike.\nOf course, there are also substantial uncertainties over the inflation outlook. Inflation is notoriously hard to forecast. Indeed, logically, because the equilibrium real interest rate has a strong bearing on the inflation outlook, the uncertainty over it that I mentioned earlier goes hand in hand with the uncertainty in inflation forecasting. We can’t be confident that inflation is headed back up to 2 percent unless we are also confident that our policy setting relative to the equilibrium real rate path is accommodative enough to return inflation to target.\nOf course, the forecast and equilibrium rate uncertainty also means we can’t fine-tune the future path for inflation. Naturally, any policy that gets the probability of hitting 2 percent in a timely fashion high enough is going to be boosting the probability that inflation will spend some time moderately above 2 percent as well. But as I argued earlier, I don’t see this as costly. Indeed, considering how long inflation has been below target, adopting a policy that allows the possibility of such an overshoot actually seems necessary to support the credibility of our symmetric target.\nMarkers of Progress\nGoing forward, I will be looking for several important markers to assess if the equilibrium real rate has risen to the point that we’re likely to achieve our policy goals in a timely fashion. Only then will I be confident enough to support the start of the policy normalization process.\nFirst, it goes without saying that we need to see continued improvements in labor markets and solid GDP growth. Even though we have made great strides, the economy has not yet returned to full employment, and we must be confident that growth will be adequate to get there.\nSecond, we should feel quite confident that inflation is going to reach our goal of 2 percent on a sustainable basis within a year or two. Of course, given the lags in how monetary policy influences the economy, this means the first rate hike will occur based on a forecast. There are a lot of elements in play, and we have to be humble about our ability to forecast inflation. This means we need an array of evidence to be confident that inflation will rise.\nAll else being equal, a tighter labor market has historically been associated with higher inflation, and so further improvements relative to our employment mandate should also be consistent with a forecast that achieves our inflation mandate.9\nAnother simple but powerful signal will be if we start seeing a pickup in the year-over-year rate of change in the price index for PCE inflation excluding food and energy. This index may be about the single best predictor of where total inflation will be a year from now. So I would feel more confident about my inflation outlook if core PCE inflation began to rise in a sustainable fashion.\nI would also want to see stronger growth in wages and other forms of labor compensation. Wage growth has been very weak for quite some time, averaging only 2 to 2-1/2 percent per year for the past five years. Usually, productivity growth of 1 to 2 percent annually and 2 percent inflation would produce wage growth in the range of 3 to 4 percent per year. Wage and compensation growth closer to this range is an important sign not just of diminished labor market slack, but also of cost increases more consistent with an economy running closer to a 2 percent inflation rate. Of course, a lot of factors — some of which we don’t have a good handle on right now — go into wage determination, and in the past, rising inflation has tended to precede rising wages. Nonetheless, faster wage growth would be good corroborating evidence that inflation was on its way up.\nAnother signal that would make me more confident relates to measures of inflation expectations, which are an important determinant of actual inflation. To reach our 2 percent inflation target, the public and financial markets need to expect that inflation will run at 2 percent over the medium term. Of particular concern on this score is the fact that the compensation that financial market participants require for taking on inflation risk has moved down considerably over the past year. There are a few reasons why inflation compensation could be low. Benign technical financial market considerations are one possibility. However, it could be that people are expecting inflation to be low. Alternatively, the cost to investors of higher inflation might have fallen or the cost of low inflation might have risen. Neither depressed inflation expectations nor higher costs of low inflation bode well for the outlook. So I also would feel more confident about the inflation outlook if either inflation compensation picked back up to previous levels or we had more evidence that the drop in compensation was due to benign technical factors.\nCurrent Circumstances Call for Caution\nIn summary, I think we should be cautious in the timing of the first rate-hike and our pace of policy normalization thereafter. My current view is that my economic outlook and my assessment of the balance of risks will evolve in such a way that I likely will not feel confident enough to begin to raise rates until early next year. But there is no prescribed timeline that must be adhered to — and no pre-set script to follow — other than that we should let economic conditions and risks to the outlook be our guides. Given uncomfortably low inflation and uncertainties about the economic environment, I see significant risks, but few benefits, to increasing interest rates prematurely.\nLet’s be confident that we will achieve both dual mandate goals within a reasonable period of time before taking actions that could undermine the very progress we seek.\nNotes\n1 See Federal Open Market Committee (2015a), which features the most recent results from the Summary of Economic Projections. The longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of where the variables would be under appropriate policy and in the absence of any economic shocks. The full range of projections for the longer-run unemployment rate is currently 4.9 percent to 5.8 percent.\n2 See Aaronson et al. (2014, 2015) — recent research by Chicago Fed staff on labor force participation rates and the natural rate of unemployment.\n3 During the recession, the share of labor force employed part time for economic reasons increased sharply and the labor force participation rate declined significantly, creating large gaps with respect to their trend levels. Currently, these gaps are still sizable.\n4 This was first acknowledged in Federal Open Market Committee (2012). It remains in the most recent statement of our longer-run goals; see Federal Open Market Committee (2015b).\n5 Core PCE inflation strips out the volatile energy and food prices and thus provides a more accurate reading on underlying inflation trends than overall PCE inflation. I discuss this measure again later.\n6 The CPI differs from the PCE deflator in methodology and the basket of goods and services it tracks.\n7 I have made the case for patience in earlier speeches. See, for example, Evans (2014).\n8 For instance, see Coenen, Orphanides and Wieland (2004) and Reifschneider and Williams (2000).\n9 Details on the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate are available online.\n\nReferences\nAaronson, Daniel, Luojia Hu, Arian Seifoddini and Daniel G.

            "content": "Good afternoon.\nThank you for inviting me to this year’s Annual Meeting of the Columbus Economic Development Board. This kind invitation originated from Harold Force, president and chief executive officer of Force Construction Company and a member of the Chicago Fed’s Advisory Council on Agriculture, Small Business and Labor. The Advisory Council meetings provide us with opportunities to gain ground-level insights in these key areas and share with Council members our perspective on the economy and information on Fed projects.\nToday I would like to highlight one of those projects — our Industrial Cities Initiative, or ICI,[1] before sharing my economic outlook and perspective on monetary policy. Let me note that my comments reflect my own views and do not necessarily represent the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Industrial Cities Initiative\nThe goal of the ICI, which began in 2011, is to understand the factors and strategies that shaped the economic development of communities that experienced significant declines in manufacturing jobs over the past few decades. The ICI is a comprehensive study of 10 industrial cities in the Seventh Federal Reserve District[2] that had a population of at least 50,000 and 25 percent of its employment in manufacturing in 1960. In Indiana, we profiled Gary and Fort Wayne. While Columbus did have a sufficiently large manufacturing base in 1960, its population back then was below the study’s threshold.\nWe want to understand such midwestern cities as they strive to either build upon or replace their manufacturing legacies, so that they can more fully participate in both the regional and global economies. The conclusions of the ICI study are based on long-term demographic and economic trends and insights from almost 200 on-site interviews.\nWe found that leaders in cities struggling economically are acutely aware of the challenges they’re facing. Leaders in cities enjoying greater success are cautiously optimistic about the future. And since we published the ICI study, we’ve been approached by officials from cities that we didn’t profile who want to gain a greater understanding of who their peers are, how they compare with them, and what they can learn and share.\nI’d like to highlight some of the themes that emerged from the ICI project thus far. Though Columbus is thriving, some of the following will surely resonate with you.\nWe often heard about the importance of having strong leadership and a shared vision for the future. A candid assessment by the community’s leaders of its assets and vulnerabilities was critical. Many city leaders referred to the early 1980s—a period when manufacturing jobs disappeared rapidly—as a “wake-up call.” Few cities in the study, if any, had a commercial legacy beyond that of a hard-working manufacturing town. For many people in these communities, coming to terms with their cities’ altered roles in a highly competitive global economy was a significant challenge that continues today. The ability of community leadership — representing many sectors — to craft a unified vision for the future largely defines the difference between those communities that were able to adapt to a new economic landscape and those that were not. I understand from your Economic Development Board’s executive director that in many respects Columbus’ leaders were ahead of the curve: They recognized its dependence on one company as early as the late 1970s, which quickly led to formal economic development planning.\nAll these cities face the challenge of promoting job growth at living wages. Job growth, obviously, is a common economic development goal. However, many of the ICI cities with favorable job growth also have experienced increases in poverty, indicating that these new jobs may not pay well enough to lift a family above the poverty line. Growth in living-wage jobs requires a work force trained and educated to compete in the global marketplace.\nSo, not surprisingly, educational attainment is another factor in economic success. The days when a high school diploma promised a lifetime of comfortable employment are gone. Today’s workers need twenty-first-century technical skills and the ability to interface with people and technology in ways unfamiliar to workers of even a decade ago. We found that many former manufacturing hubs suffer from an educational deficit. Most ICI cities do not have a large number of adults with at least some college education, so the study’s participants often mentioned a “skills mismatch” — where employers are unable to fill open positions while prospective employees lament the lack of available jobs. In response, community colleges, economic development entities and business leaders have crafted innovative responses to employment needs — often in partnership with one another. There is no one-size-fits-all path to success. However, those from resurgent and economically healthy cities noted their populations’ flexibility, creativity and innovation in responding to work force needs identified by employers. The Columbus Community Education Coalition is one such example. Having the K–16 leadership at the table with business leaders sends a clear message that career planning and skills building starts early.\nAnother factor that distinguishes some ICI cities from others is their proximity to large urban centers. Some are close to Chicago. Others though, such as Green Bay, Wisconsin, and Cedar Rapids, Iowa, have formed their own distinct economic regions by drawing workers, entrepreneurs and commerce into their metro areas. I was interested to learn that although Columbus has a population of 45,000, over 1 million people live within a 45-minute drive, with a high concentration of engineers. These features of your area are important assets for companies considering a move here.\nMany city leaders also noted the importance of embracing the principles of diversity and inclusion as an economic imperative. Isolation and exclusion are detrimental to economic fundamentals such as educational attainment, labor force participation and crime rates. Several of these cities still struggle to shake off a legacy of racial issues and segregation, which their leaders describe as their “Achilles’ heel.” Similarly, many cities are wrestling with how to accommodate and integrate new arrivals. I understand that efforts led by your community foundation are under way to address these issues locally and ensure that all populations feel welcome.\nFinally, a recurring theme was housing affordability. Like most places across the nation, ICI cities were deeply affected by the economic crisis and saw rising foreclosure rates and declining property values. Most of them are recovering. But demand for affordable rental housing has increased dramatically while the supply has not kept pace. In many ICI cities, community development organizations are working in concert with economic development groups to address these issues.\nOur staff has returned to many of the ICI cities to share our findings and to identify ways to engage with leaders from these communities. For many of these leaders, the Fed is a new partner and resource. Several of our fellow Reserve Banks are also exploring the challenges facing their older industrial cities. We continue to partner with them — in our research, policy analysis and outreach efforts. That said, regardless of its location, industry concentration or size, no place is immune to macroeconomic trends and forces.\nSo let me turn to my outlook for the economy and views on monetary policy.\nEconomic Outlook and Views on Monetary Policy\nTo give you the punchline, I think the outlook for growth in economic activity and the labor market is good. However, inflation is too low, and I expect it will be so for some time. Based on this forecast, and the risks to the outlook, I think the FOMC should refrain from raising the federal funds rate (our traditional short-term interest rate policy tool) until there is much greater confidence that inflation one or two years ahead will be at our 2 percent target. I see no compelling reason for us to be in a hurry to tighten financial conditions until then.\nNow for the details.\nNearing Our Employment Goal\nFollowing years of false starts and tepid growth, economic activity advanced at a solid pace over the past two years. Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an average rate of about 2-1/2 percent over this time, and growth was quite rapid in the second half of 2014. True, growth stalled in the first quarter of this year, coming in at just 0.2 percent, but this appears to reflect in some part transitory factors. The underlying fundamentals still look good. So, moving forward, I expect growth to average in the 2-1/2 to 3 percent range over the next couple years.\nAs output growth has improved, so has the labor market. Average monthly payroll employment growth was about 260,000 per month in 2014 and early 2015. This is well above the average monthly gain of roughly 190,000 over the previous two years. Similar to output growth in the first quarter, we think the more subdued pace of job gains in March will prove to be transitory. Looking ahead, with 2-1/2 to 3 percent output growth, average job gains should remain above the 200,000 mark for a while longer before gradually moving back down toward its longer-run trend.\nMeanwhile, the unemployment rate has declined significantly. In each of the past four years, it has fallen by about 1 percentage point and now stands at 5.5 percent. This is terrific progress, but it remains somewhat higher than what a normal, sustainable unemployment rate should be.\nFour times a year, my colleagues and I are asked to submit forecasts of real GDP growth, the unemployment rate and inflation over the next three years and for the longer run.[3] Last March, most FOMC participants’ estimates for the longer-run, normal rate of unemployment fell in the range of 5.0 percent to 5.2 percent. Based in part on the extensive analysis done by my staff on demographic and other changes in the composition of the labor force, my estimate was 5.0 percent.[4] So, we are still one-half percentage point above my assumption for the long-run normal rate of unemployment.\nFurthermore, some other indicators suggest that there is more slack in labor markets than one would infer from the unemployment rate alone. For example, the number of people who are employed part time for economic reasons remains unusually high. If the economy were closer to full employment, these individuals would have more opportunities to find full-time jobs. Moreover, wage growth has been much lower than one would expect if labor markets were closer to normal.\nEven with these caveats, it’s clear that the economic activity and labor markets have improved significantly over the past two years. And monetary policy has been an important factor in helping the economy achieve this progress.\nMissing Our Inflation Goal\nThings are different with inflation.\nSince 2012, the FOMC has set an explicit longer-run goal for inflation of 2 percent as measured by the year-over-year rate of change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE).[5] Inflation has been running well below this rate for quite some time, averaging about 1-1/2 percent for the past six years. Currently, core PCE inflation, which is a better indicator of underlying trends, was 1.3 percent over the past year.[6] Of course, there are other measures of inflation, such as the well-known Consumer Price Index (CPI).[7] The CPI inflation runs 1/4 to 1/2 of a percentage point higher than PCE measure on average due to differences in the methodologies used to compute the indexes. So a 2 percent goal for PCE inflation equates to something closer to a 2-1/2 percent goal in terms of CPI inflation. By this measure, too, inflation is falling well short of our goal, as the CPI has averaged less than 2 percent since 2008.\nSimply put, inflation is too low. Just as too-high inflation can impose significant costs on the economy, so can too-low inflation. When prices and, along with them, wages and incomes rise at a slower rate than anticipated, borrowers’ fixed monthly loan obligations become more burdensome. These costs now have been accumulating for the past six plus years that inflation has underrun the FOMC’s 2 percent target that borrowers had relied upon. To meet these higher real costs, borrowers must cut back other spending, reducing aggregate demand and ultimately weighing on economic activity. This is an important reason why we need to achieve our 2 percent inflation objective.\nLooking ahead, I am anticipating inflation to rise at a pretty gradual pace, reaching our 2 percent objective only in 2018. That’s a pretty slow increase. Furthermore, there are downside risks to my projection.\nSome of this risk surrounds two factors that have held down inflation recently. First, there is the stronger dollar, which has reduced the prices of imported products we buy. Second, the dramatic decline in oil prices has lowered the costs of energy related items, albeit as it also has bolstered the real spending capacity of consumers and businesses.\nIf lower import and energy prices result in just a one-time drop in consumer prices, then they would not be an issue for monetary policymakers to worry about. But if the lower pricing gets embedded more persistently in the longer-run inflationary expectations of households and businesses, it would be even harder to get inflation back to its 2 percent target. This is not in my baseline forecast, but such a drop in inflation expectations is a downside risk that we need to be on the watch for.\nI should note, too, that low inflation is a global phenomenon. In part, this reflects slower global growth and disinflationary pressures in most advanced economies. Of course, a global slowdown also presents some downside risk for growth in the United States as well.\nAn Appropriate Path for Monetary Policy\nWhat does this all mean for my assessment of appropriate monetary policy?\nAlong with projections for the key metrics of the economy that I mentioned earlier, each FOMC participant provides his or her assumption for the appropriate path of the federal funds rate that underlies their economic forecasts. In the latest projections, 15 of the 17 FOMC participants expected that it would be appropriate to raise rates sometime this year.\nLooking further ahead, the median path for the target fed funds rate is consistent with roughly a 25 basis point increase at every other FOMC meeting for the next year and a half. This is a considerably slower, more gradual pace of rate increases than those implemented in 2004 through 2006 — the last time the Fed normalized policy following an extended period of very low interest rates.\nFinancial market participants expect an even slower pace of rate hikes than FOMC participants do. The most recent reading on market expectations puts the target rate at the end of 2016 a bit below 1 percent — a full percentage point below the median FOMC forecast.\nIn my view, it likely will not be appropriate to begin raising the federal funds rate until sometime in early 2016. Economic activity appears to be on a solid, sustainable growth path, which, on its own, would support a rate hike soon. However, the weak first-quarter data do give me pause, and I would like to see confirmation that they are indeed a transitory aberration. Furthermore, and most important, inflation is low and is expected to remain low for some time.\nA prudent risk-management and goal-oriented approach to monetary policy also prescribes waiting to increase the federal funds rate.[8] One risk we face is that we begin to raise rates only to learn that we have misjudged the strength of the economy. In order to rekindle growth and boost inflation, we would have to cut rates back to zero and possibly resort to unconventional, second-best policy tools. It could take some time, then, to get back out of the mess. In contrast, if we wait too long to raise rates, we face the opposite risk of inflation rising too quickly. Here, though, we could likely keep inflation in check with moderate increases in interest rates. Furthermore, there aren’t any serious costs of modestly overshooting our inflation target—particularly considering how long inflation has been below our target, this simply would be a natural manifestation of our symmetric inflation target.\nThis risk-management approach can be thought of in another way. Economists like to talk about an abstract concept called a “natural” or “equilibrium” real rate of interest. This is the inflation-adjusted interest rate consistent with full employment of labor and productive capital and with inflation at its long-run target. When the actual inflation-adjusted federal funds rate is below the theoretical equilibrium rate, policy is accommodative and we would expect inflation pressures to build. When the actual federal funds rate is higher than the equilibrium rate, policy is restrictive, and there is downward pressure on inflation. The bigger the gaps between the actual and equilibrium rates, the greater these pressures.\nDuring the financial crisis, the equilibrium real interest rate was quite low — indeed quite negative — reflecting the dearth of spending opportunities that looked attractive to households, businesses and the financial sector, all of which needed to rebuild scarred balance sheets. To try to drive actual interest rates towards the natural rate, policy had to be as accommodative as possible — however, the zero lower bound on interest rates prevented us from actually getting there.\nOver time, as the economy has worked through the scars from the financial crisis, the equilibrium real rate has risen. And it should continue to rise as the healing process continues. The key question is: Has it risen enough so that the gap between the actual and equilibrium federal funds rate has reached the point that we are actually providing too much policy accommodation and so we should begin to raise the federal funds rate?\nI think the answer is no.\nThere is a great deal of uncertainty over the current equilibrium real rate. It could be lower or higher than the level needed to justify a rate hike. However, there are a number of simple observations that suggest the current level of the federal funds rate relative to the natural rate is not overly accommodative. Namely, we still have resource slack, there is no meaningful upward momentum in inflation and instead of investing businesses are sitting on piles of cash or distributing it to stockholders — a sign that they think the real rate of return on prospective investment projects is quite low.\nIndeed, one could argue that we currently do not have enough policy accommodation in place. As I noted earlier my forecast does not see inflation rising to our 2 percent target until 2018 — for me, that’s too far down the road given how long we have underrun our target. If policy truly were highly accommodative, we’d be getting to our inflation target sooner.\nMarkers of Progress\nGoing forward, I will be looking for several important markers to assess if the equilibrium real rate has risen to the point that we’re likely to achieve our policy goals in a timely fashion. Only then will I be confident enough to support the start of the policy normalization process.\nFirst, it goes without saying that we need to see continued improvements in labor markets and solid GDP growth. Even though we have made great strides, the economy has not yet returned to full employment, and we must be confident that growth will be adequate to get there.\nSecond, we should feel quite confident that inflation is going to reach our goal of 2 percent on a sustainable basis within a year or two. Of course, given the lags in how monetary policy influences the economy, this means the first rate hike will occur based on a forecast.

This index may be about the single best predictor of where total inflation will be a year from now. So I would feel more confident about my inflation outlook if core PCE inflation began to rise in a sustainable fashion.\nI would also want to see stronger growth in wages and other forms of labor compensation. Wage growth has been very weak for quite some time, averaging only 2 to 2-1/2 percent per year for the past five years.

Neither depressed inflation expectations nor higher costs of low inflation bode well for the outlook. So I also would feel more confident about the inflation outlook, if either inflation compensation picked back up or we had more evidence that the drop in compensation was due to benign technical factors.\nCurrent Circumstances Call for Caution\nIn summary, I think we should be cautious in the timing of the first rate hike and our pace of policy normalization thereafter. My current view is that my economic outlook and my assessment of the balance of risks will evolve in such a way that I likely will not feel confident enough to begin to raise rates until early next year. But there is no prescribed timeline that must be adhered to, and no preset script to follow, other than that we should let economic conditions and risks to the outlook be our guides. Given uncomfortably low inflation and uncertainties about the economic environment, I see significant risks, but few benefits, to increasing interest rates prematurely.\nLet’s be confident that we will achieve both dual mandate goals within a reasonable period of time before taking actions that could undermine the very progress we seek.\n[1] For more details on the ICI, see https://www.chicagofed.org/region/community-development/community-economic-development/ici/index.\n[2] The Seventh District comprises all of Iowa and most of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin.

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you for that warm introduction. It is a great pleasure to join the impressive list of speakers to your group. I look forward to your insightful remarks. My views are sharpened through comments I get from the audience and getting an international perspective is particularly helpful. So, I am most appreciative for this opportunity.\nToday I will first discuss recent developments and my outlook for the U.S. economy. I will then explain how that outlook and the risks around it shape my views about the appropriate timing and pace of eventual Federal Reserve policy normalization. I should note that my commentary reflects my own viewpoint and does not necessarily represent the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System.\nIn particular, I expect to see continued solid growth in real activity and further improvements in labor markets in the U.S. Our outlook for economic activity is probably on its best footing since the recovery began in mid-2009.\nHowever, inflation is too low relative to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective. In fact, inflation has averaged just 1-1/2 percent for the past six years, and it is hard to see inflation heading up to target in the near term. This worries me quite a bit, and I will spend a good deal of time today explaining my concern.\nIt is largely because of this outlook for inflation that I think the FOMC should refrain from raising the federal funds rate (our traditional short-term interest rate policy tool) until there is much greater confidence that inflation one or two years ahead will be at our 2 percent target. I see no compelling reason for us to be in a hurry to tighten financial conditions until then.\nGoal-Oriented Approach to Monetary Policy\nFor some time now, I have been advocating a goal-oriented approach to monetary policy[1]. This is distinct from an instrument-rule approach, like in Taylor (1993). In fact, it is more closely related to a seminal Taylor (1979) article’s treatment of optimal monetary policy. The Federal Reserve Act mandates that monetary policy should work to foster financial conditions that promote both full employment and price stability. To me, this means setting our policy tools with the aim of achieving both of our goals in a reasonable amount of time while minimizing potential risks associated with uncertainty over the course of future economic events. This is a tall order, but that’s the stuff of central banking.\nBefore I get to the specifics of how I think policy should be set in the current circumstances, let me first discuss where I see the U.S. economy standing today with respect to our goals of full employment and price stability.\nNearing Our Employment Goal\nFollowing years of false starts and tepid growth, the pace of U.S. economic growth these past two years has been quite good. Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an average rate of 2-3/4 percent over this time, and growth was at a quite rapid 3-1/2 percent annualized pace in the second half of 2014. Looking ahead, I am expecting growth to average near 3 percent for the next couple years.\nAs output growth has improved, so has the labor market.Average payroll employment growth was 260,000 per month in 2014 and early 2015. This is well above the average monthly gain of roughly 190,000 during the previous two years. With 3 percent output growth, the average monthly job gain should remain above the 200,000 mark for some time before gradually moving back down toward its longer-run trend.\nSince the end of 2010, the unemployment rate has declined significantly and steadily. In each of the past four years, it has fallen by about 1 percentage point and now stands at 5.5 percent. This is terrific progress, but 5.5 percent remains somewhat higher than what a normal, sustainable unemployment rate should be. Most FOMC participants’ estimates for the longer-run normal rate of unemployment fall in the range of 5.0 percent to 5.2 percent.[2] Based in part on the extensive analysis done by my staff on compositional and demographic changes in the labor force, I think that it it’s more like 5.0 percent.[3] So, in my mind, the degree of labor market slack may be somewhat larger than what some others infer from the 5.5 percent U.S. unemployment rate.\nSome other labor market indicators support this assessment of slack. For example, the number of people who are involuntarily employed part time remains unusually high. If the economy were closer to full employment, these individuals would have more opportunities to find full-time jobs. Furthermore, wage growth has been much lower than one would expect if labor markets were closer to normal.\nEven with these caveats, the U.S. economy and labor markets have seen great improvement over the past two years. Monetary policy has been an important factor in this progress. The Federal Reserve initially responded to the financial crisis and ensuing deep recession by providing accommodation in the usual way — by cutting short-term interest rates. But once rates hit their zero lower bound (ZLB), we had to turn to other nonconventional tools to provide further accommodation, notably large-scale asset purchases (LSAP) and guidance regarding future movements in the federal funds rate.[4]\nOne of our most notable and controversial responses followed our September 2012 meeting. At that time, three years into the recovery, the unemployment rate was over 8 percent. Moreover, forecasts showed a strong risk that improvements in the labor market were about to stall.[5] It was clear that more accommodation was needed, but just how to provide that accommodation was unclear. Against this backdrop, the FOMC announced that the Fed would steadily purchase $85 billion of long-term Treasury and mortgage-backed securities each month until we saw substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market. This open-ended program is often referred to as QE3.[6]\nWithin a year, more accommodative financial conditions helped reenergize employment gains. Borrowing rates declined. Car sales rose, and consumer conditions improved. This recovery is all the more remarkable in that it occurred at a time when already strong headwinds — such as higher income tax rates and cuts in federal spending — were gaining strength.\nOf course, to be completely fair, the U.S. economy was long overdue for just such an acceleration in growth and employment. So, maybe the past couple of years have been a combination of luck and good policy. I don’t think it was all luck. Just as it’s good to be lucky, it’s also good to be resourceful.\nRegardless of whether it was good fortune or effective policy that propelled growth, our asset purchase program and the explicit conditions of its implementation demonstrated clearly that the Federal Reserve is fully committed to undertaking goal-oriented monetary policy actions. The sheer size of our asset purchases certainly had some direct effect on lowering interest rates. But these policies were all the more effective because of their open-ended, goal-oriented nature that confirmed our commitment to act until we saw the desired improvements in labor markets.\nNow let me turn to inflation.\nMissing Our Inflation Goal\nSince 2012, the FOMC has set an explicit longer-run goal for inflation of 2 percent as measured by the year-over-year rate of change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE).[7] Inflation has been running well below this rate for quite some time, averaging 1-1/2 percent for the past six years. Currently, core PCE prices are up 1.3 percent from a year ago.[8] Of course, there are other measures of inflation, such as the well-known Consumer Price Index (CPI).[9] The CPI inflation runs 1/4 to 1/2 of a percentage point higher than PCE inflation on average due to differences in methodology. So a 2 percent target for PCE inflation equates to something closer to a 2-1/2 percent goal in terms of CPI inflation. By this measure, too, inflation is falling well short of our goal, as changes in the CPI have averaged less than 2 percent since 2008.\nSimply put, inflation is too low. I know that it sounds unusual for a central banker to make that claim. I certainly never expected I would utter those words. Those of you who are as old as I am have heard the refrain for most of your mature life that inflation is too high and it needs to be lower.\nMy long-held views on inflation were forged in the 1970s and early 1980s. U.S. inflation rose to an alarming 10 percent during that period and seemed destined to remain there.[10] Fearing that inflation was spiraling out of control, the Paul Volcker-led Fed raised interest rates steeply and successfully broke the back of double-digit inflation. By the time of Volcker’s departure in 1987, inflation was running about 4 percent a year. The Greenspan-led Fed then spent the next dozen or more years trying to inch inflation down to about 2 percent. That goal was achieved in the early 2000s, and the Fed has aimed to bring PCE inflation in at 2 percent for the past ten or more years. First, this was an informal objective, but later it was made an explicit goal.\nWhy is it important for the Federal Reserve to achieve its 2 percent inflation objective? What is the problem posed by too-low inflation? Simply put, prolonged and significant deviations of actual inflation from what consumers and businesses are expecting when they make long-term investment decisions could impose significant costs on the economy.\nFor instance, interest rates on loans are set high enough to compensate lenders for expected inflation. From the lender’s point of view, if actual inflation exceeds the level expected when the loan was originated, loan payments remain fixed in nominal terms, but the purchasing power of those interest receipts is less than lenders had expected. So, unexpectedly high inflation hurts creditors.\nOn the flip side, when prices and, along with them, wages and incomes rise at a slower rate than anticipated, borrowers’ fixed monthly loan obligations become more burdensome. And the longer inflation undershoots borrowers’ expectations, the higher are these real costs. These costs have been accumulating for the past six years, during which inflation has underrun the FOMC’s 2 percent target that borrowers had relied upon. To meet these higher real costs, borrowers must cut back other spending, reducing aggregate demand and ultimately weighing on economic activity.\nThis is one of several reasons why we need to achieve our 2 percent inflation objective. It also explains why achieving symmetry around our 2 percent goal is important.\nSlow and Uncertain Improvement toward Our Inflation Goal\nTo reiterate, I am concerned about the current low inflation environment in the United States and about the inflation outlook. Core inflation is about 1.3 percent today, and my forecast has it rising to 2 percent only by the end of 2018. This is a woefully gradual pace. Furthermore, there are downside risks to my projection.\nSince last summer, the dollar has appreciated nearly 23 percent against major currencies. The stronger dollar presents a clear disinflationary pressure through its influence on U.S. import prices. Similarly, the dramatic decline in oil prices lowers consumer inflation, albeit temporarily, even as it bolsters the real spending capacity of consumers and businesses.\nIf lower energy and import prices result in just a one-time drop in consumer prices, then they would not be an issue for monetary policymakers to worry about. But if the lower pricing gets embedded more persistently in the longer-run inflationary expectations of households and businesses, this would make it even harder to get inflation back to its 2 percent target. The Fed needs to be ready to take steps counteracting any indications that longer-run inflation expectations are deviating from 2 percent.\nI should note that low inflation is a global phenomenon. In part, this reflects slower global growth and disinflationary pressures in most advanced economies. Of course, a global slowdown also presents some downside risk to the outlook for growth in the U.S.\nAn Appropriate Path for Monetary Policy\nGiven this assessment, what is my outlook for monetary policy and the most appropriate path for the U.S. interest rates?\nFour times a year, my colleagues and I submit forecasts of real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation over the next three years. There is no single assumption of appropriate policy that all the FOMC participants use to shape their forecasts. Therefore, along with those projections, we provide our individual assumptions for the appropriate path for monetary policy that underlies our economic forecasts. These forecasts are reported as the Summary of Economic Projections (SEPs), with the policy expectations presented in what is often referred to as the “Dot Plot.”\n    Our Chair, Janet Yellen, discusses this chart during her press conferences.\nIn the latest projections made just last week, 15 of the 17 FOMC participants expected that it would be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate sometime this year.[11] As you can see from the chart, while there is a fair amount of dispersion among the individual participants’ projections, the median for the target federal funds rate at the end of this year is a bit above half a percent. And note that FOMC participants’ views differ even more in regard to the end of 2016: Most expect the fed funds rate to be set below 2 percent, but three of my colleagues think the fed funds rate should be in the range of 3 to 4 percent by the end of that year.\nThe “median participant” expects the target fed funds rate to be about 1-3/4 percent by the end of 2016. In other words, according to the median path for the target fed funds rate as projected by FOMC participants, rate increases of about 50 basis points for this year and 100 basis points next year are to be expected. The FOMC meets eight times a year. So, the projected path is consistent with a 25 basis point increase at every other FOMC meeting. I should note that this would be a considerably slower, more gradual pace of rate increases than those implemented in 2004 through 2006 — the last time the Fed normalized policy following an extended period of very low interest rates.\nThe solid red line in the dot plot shows financial market participants’ expectations for our policies. Currently, they expect an even slower pace of rate hikes than the FOMC participants do. In fact, market expectations puts the target rate at the end of 2016 at about 1 percent — 75 basis points below the median FOMC forecast.\nWhat is my personal view of the appropriate path for Fed policy? I think economic conditions are likely to evolve in a way such that it will be appropriate to hold off on raising short-term rates until 2016.\nEconomic activity appears to be on a solid, sustainable growth path. However, inflation is low and is expected to remain low for some time — and I have serious concerns that inflation will run even lower than I expect.\nAccordingly, in my view, a prudent risk-management and goal-oriented approach to U.S. monetary policy dictates that we continue to assess inflation developments for some time before generating more restrictive financial conditions.[12] One risk I worry about is that we begin to raise rates only to learn that we misjudged the strength of the economy. Another is that some disinflationary shock will hit as we drift along a low inflation path. In either of these cases, we would find ourselves in the extremely uncomfortable position of being forced to lower short-term rates back to their zero lower bound — a policy position that has already proved challenging for the Fed (and for other central banks). On the other hand, if we were too timid and did not lower short-term rates back to the zero lower bound under either of those circumstances, policy would be overly restrictive.\nNow consider an alternative risk: We wait too long to raise rates, and subsequently, inflation picks up faster than the projected gradual path to 2 percent. Given how far inflation is from our target, some greater-than-expected pickup in inflation would actually be welcome. Furthermore, if we were to end up with a period of inflation running moderately above 2 percent, the associated costs would be low. It would just be the symmetric flip side of our recent below-target inflation experience. And in the event the risk of overshooting our target by an uncomfortable margin did arise, given the inertia in inflation, we would likely have ample time to address the problem with moderate increases in interest rates.\nI should note that this type of risk-management approach is a long-standing feature of U.S. monetary policy. I quote former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan from a speech he made in 2004:\n\"The conduct of monetary policy in the United States has come to involve, at its core, crucial elements of risk management. This conceptual framework emphasizes understanding as much as possible the many sources of risk and uncertainty that policymakers face, quantifying those risks when possible, and assessing the costs associated with each of the risks.\"[13]\nIn a recent Brookings paper, some of my colleagues at the Chicago Fed and I show that the FOMC’s policy communications contain numerous instances when the Committee appeared to use a variety of risk-management rationales for slightly shifting the funds rate higher or lower than conditions might otherwise call for.[14] The Committee often cited uncertainty about the economic outlook or the need to take out insurance against low-probability but potentially costly outcomes as a rationale for such actions. The Asian financial crisis in 1997–98 and then the tragedy of September 11, 2001, are two of the more prominent examples that prompted the Committee to respond in this way.\nIn our Brookings paper, we develop some simple theoretical models that illustrate the importance of risk management at the zero lower bound. We show that when the economy is at or near the zero lower bound, monetary policymakers should be cautious about raising rates if there is uncertainty about the potential for unforeseen shocks to push the economy back toward the ZLB. The ZLB induces an important policy asymmetry: Although rates can be raised to bring down inflation if inflation comes in surprisingly high, rates cannot be lowered below zero to boost activity or lift inflation after downside shocks. Of course, the further rates are from the ZLB and the closer we are to meeting our policy targets, the less important this effect is. But we aren’t there yet.\nI should also note that these risk-management considerations mean that the best policies can and should deviate from simple rules that mechanically adjust interest rates as employment and inflation diverge from their long-run targets. These simple rules often will not lead to the best responses to the uncertain economic environment policymakers face day to day. Once again I cite former Chairman Greenspan (2004):\n\"Prescriptions of formal rules can, in fact, serve as helpful adjuncts to policy, as many of the proponents of these rules have suggested. But at crucial points, like those in our recent policy history — the stock market crash of 1987, the crises of 1997–98, and the events that followed September 2001 — simple rules will be inadequate as either descriptions or prescriptions for policy.\"\nMarkers of Progress\nOf course, at some time, it will become appropriate to increase the federal funds rate. For me to feel comfortable doing so, I will need to be confident enough that we will achieve our dual mandate goals within an acceptable period of time and that we are at low risk of regressing back to economic conditions that necessitate policy rates returning to their zero lower bound. There are several important indicators that will assure me that growth and inflation are on the right sustainable trajectories.\nFirst, it goes without saying that we need to see continued improvements in labor markets and GDP growth. Even though we have made great strides, the U.S. economy has not yet returned to full employment, and we must be confident that growth will not stall before getting there.\nSecond, we should feel quite confident that inflation will reach our goal of 2 percent on a sustainable basis within a reasonable amount of time — say, within a year or two. I don’t have that level of confidence yet. My forecast assumes policy rates will begin to rise sometime in the first half of 2016, which is a critical element in my approach to generating higher inflation. Even with a liftoff in 2016, my forecast is that we will achieve 2 percent inflation only in 2018. Certainly, I would like to reach our target inflation rate earlier than that — say, in 2017 or 2016, which would be a much more successful outcome.\nSo what would make me more confident that inflation is heading higher?\nA simple signal will be if we start seeing a pickup in the year-over-year rate of change in the price index for core PCE — which strips out the volatile changes in food and energy prices. As a matter of practical forecasting, core inflation today may be about the single best predictor of where total inflation will be a year from now. So I would like to see core PCE inflation begin to rise above its current 1.3 percent rate in a sustainable fashion. If it does not, then that’s a clear sign that there are important factors persistently driving down inflation.\nI would also need to see stronger growth in wages and other forms of labor compensation. Wage growth has been very weak for quite some time, averaging only 2 to 2-1/2 percent per year for the past five years. Usually, productivity growth of 1 to 2 percent annually and 2 percent inflation would produce wage growth in the range of 3 to 4 percent per year. Wage and compensation growth closer to this range is an important sign not just of diminished labor market slack, but also of cost increases more consistent with an economy running closer to a 2 percent inflation rate.\nThe last signal I will need to see relates to measures of inflation expectations. Specifically, I need more evidence that the public and financial markets expect that inflation will be rising over the medium term in line with our 2 percent objective. Survey measures of long-term inflation expectations in the U.S. have been remarkably stable since the late 1990s. The optimist in me sees this as an indication of the Fed’s credibility with respect to its price stability goal. However, I also worry that survey measures might be like a stopped clock that won’t provide a timely signal of changes in inflation attitudes. Some will recall that surveys in Japan showed stable inflation expectations even after the economy had experienced several years of deflation. When expectations did move down, it took extraordinary policy actions by the Bank of Japan to edge them back up. So, I can’t help but be cautious and not take too much comfort from the U.S. survey measures.\nThe large declines in long-term interest rates we have experienced over the past year — and what they might imply for the inflation outlook — offer no comfort either.\nSince last July, the yield on ten-year U.S. Treasury securities has declined by about 70 basis points. Over the same period, the difference between the yields on nominal Treasury securities and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS,[15] has declined almost one for one with long-term nominal yields. This difference, of course, represents the compensation that investors purchasing nominal Treasury securities need to receive because the returns on those bonds are exposed to inflation risk while TIPS returns are not. So it seems these investors now require less extra yield to compensate for bearing inflation risk than they did before. Investors are currently demanding about 1.8 percent in extra yield as compensation for CPI inflation six to ten years from now; however, last July, they were demanding nearly 2.5 percent.[16] These are large declines that have brought long-term inflation compensation in the U.S. down to the bottom tenth percentile of its historical levels in just a few months.\nThese data are clearly flashing a warning sign. But are they giving us a reliable signal of a shift in long-term inflation attitudes in the U.S.? Sophisticated econometric models of the term structure of interest rates can be used to parse inflation compensation into a number of factors: market participants’ expectations of future inflation, an inflation risk premium, and a residual factor reflecting differences in liquidity and other trading features in these markets. As with most models, the results critically depend on the models’ identifying assumptions and the estimation methodology used.\nThe estimates from some of these models suggest that the primary driver of the fall in yields has been the residual factor. Such developments should be short-lived and soon reverse themselves. Indeed, in the last couple of months, we have seen a small upward movement in inflation compensation and the residual factor.\nHowever, it is possible that some of these term structure models might be conflating movements in liquidity and other trading features with unknown or unmodeled elements that have less benign interpretations and are more persistent. For instance, the changes in the residual factor might reflect a stronger preference for safe assets by global investors.\nSimilarly, declines in inflation risk premia, even if inflation expectations remain stable, can signal that investors are now viewing low inflation outcomes as being more economically costly. My colleague Narayana Kocherlakota has spoken extensively about this and has pointed out how such a change in investors’ assessment of potential inflation outcomes should be a source of concern for monetary policymakers.[17]\nMoreover, not all term structure models indicate that inflation expectations are stable. Most notably, a model estimated by Chicago Fed staff finds only small and unexceptional changes in inflation risk premia during the recent period.[18] It does suggest that expectations of future inflation in the U.S. have moved down. The model relies on the breakdown of inflation among food, energy and core components to better capture the dynamic relationship between interest rates and inflation. Although the model’s fitting errors have risen over the past year, its forecasts for inflation five years ahead also have fallen about 20 to 30 basis points over this time. In fact, the model has been projecting very low inflation for some time. For instance, at the end of 2013, its projection for core PCE inflation in 2014 was 1.4 percent, compared with 1.7 percent projected by the Survey of Professional Forecasters.[19] The actual core PCE inflation in 2014 was 1.4 percent. Today, the Chicago Fed model projects that average annual total PCE inflation between February 2018 and February 2021 — three to six years from now — will be only 1-1/2 percent. That is simply too low to be consistent with our longer-run inflation objective of 2 percent.\nAll told, we cannot definitively state what has driven inflation compensation in the U.S. down in recent months. It could be benign, transitory factors that will dissipate in a few months. In that case, we can take full comfort from the stability of survey measures of inflation expectations. That said, it is also quite possible that market-based measures are capturing unfavorable changes in investors’ inflationary attitudes and expectations that survey measures are missing.\nBecause it is uncertain which scenario is the true one, a risk-management approach to monetary policy, once again, seems appropriate. If it is the benign scenario, then waiting to see inflation compensation recover before normalizing policy would be appropriate. If it is the more worrisome scenario, then we should not begin the monetary policy normalization process until the 2 percent inflation target is closer to our reach. In either case, waiting to begin the policy normalization process seems appropriate.\nCurrent Circumstances Call for Caution\nIn summary, I think we should be cautious in raising interest rates. There is no prescribed timeline that must be adhered to and no pre-set script to follow other than that we should let economic conditions and risks to the outlook be our guides for implementing appropriate policy. Given uncomfortably low inflation and an uncertain global environment, there are significant risks, but few benefits, to increasing interest rates prematurely. Let’s be confident that we will achieve both dual mandate goals within a reasonable period of time before taking actions that could undermine the very progress we seek.\n[1] This is a point I’ve been making regularly in my public appearances since 2010. See, for example, Evans (2010, 2011, 2014c, 2014b). Minneapolis Fed President Kocherlakota (2015) supports the same approach.\n[2] See Federal Open Market Committee (2015), which features the most recent results from the Summary of Economic Projections. The full range of longer-run projections for the unemployment rate is 4.9 percent to 5.8 percent.\n[3] See Aaronson et al. (2014)—which is recent research by Chicago Fed staff on labor force participation rates and the natural rate of unemployment, or longer-run normal rate of unemployment (which represents the unemployment rate that would prevail in an economy making full use of its productive resources).\n[4] For more on LSAPs, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2015a). For more on our guidance regarding future movements in the federal funds rate, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2015b).\n[5] For instance, the central tendency of FOMC participants’ projections made in September 2012 (see Federal Open Market Committee, 2012a) was for the unemployment rate to edge down from 8.1 percent in 2012 to 7.9 percent in 2013. The September 2012 forecasts from the Blue Chip Economic Indicators showed a similarly shallow path for the projected improvements in the unemployment rate.\n[6] The Fed halted LSAPs made under QE3 (the third round of quantitative easing) in October 2014; see Federal Open Market Committee (2014).\n[7] This was first acknowledged in Federal Open Market Committee (2012b).\n[8] Core PCE inflation strips out the volatile energy and food prices and thus provides a more accurate reading on underlying inflation trends than the overall PCE inflation. I discuss this measure again later.\n[9] The CPI differs from the PCE in methodology and the basket of goods and services it tracks.\n[10] For the four quarters ending in 1975:Q1, core PCE inflation was 10.1 percent and then, more than five years later, stood at 9.7 percent for the four quarters ending in 1980:Q4.\n[11] See Federal Open Market Committee (2015). Note that the number of voting members differs from the number of participants. Every participant provides a forecast, but the voting members rotate annually. For example, the president of the Cleveland Fed and I alternate votes every other year.\n[12] I have made the case for a cautious approach to tightening financial conditions based on risk-management considerations in earlier speeches. See, for example, Evans (2014a).\n[13] Greenspan (2004).\n[14] Evans et al.

            "content": "In a speech to the Peterson Institute I gave last September, I argued that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would be well served by being especially cautious before raising the fed funds rate off zero. In this paper, Jonas Fisher, Françcois Gourio, Spencer Krane and I develop explicit theoretical and empirical foundations for this argument.\n\nWe see two substantial and conflicting risks facing policymakers today. Suppose that the FOMC raises rates, but then discovers that the economy is more reliant on policy accommodation than previously thought — either growth turns weaker or inflation remains stubbornly low. In this situation, the Fed could find itself forced back to the zero lower bound (ZLB). The unconventional tools we have to provide accommodation at the ZLB are useful, but they are imperfect substitutes for changes in the funds rate. And these unconventional tools may be less effective going forward if a premature exit reduces the public’s confidence in the Fed’s commitment to its goals.\n\nThe other substantial risk is higher inflation. Suppose the FOMC delays raising rates so long that inflation rises much faster than currently projected. Well, the Fed knows how to respond to that — we can raise rates to reel inflation back in. And if the economy is on a solid footing, these rate increases should be manageable. To me, this suggests we should err on the side of less aggressive policy tightening.\n\nWe call the first channel the “expectations channel.” We explore this using the standard workhorse forward-looking New Keynesian model. In that model, when the ZLB binds, both output and inflation are low. So the chance that the ZLB will bind tomorrow translates into lower expected output and inflation tomorrow. And because agents are forward looking, the expected losses tomorrow reduce output and inflation today through negative wealth effects and lower inflationary expectations. In this situation, what should the policymaker do? Our analysis shows that optimal policy under discretion is to loosen policy now.\n\nWe call the second channel the “buffer stock channel.”\nWe explore this using an “old-style Keynesian” framework, in which growth and inflation have some inherent underlying momentum due to inertia. This is summarized by the output gap and inflation being functions of their own lagged values. In this setup, the higher output and inflation are today, the higher output and inflation will be tomorrow, reducing in turn the chances that the ZLB will bind tomorrow.\nSuppose there is a significant chance a shock tomorrow will push you towards the ZLB. We show that policy should be looser today to build up a buffer of inflation and output so that if that shock does occur, you are less likely to actually hit the ZLB tomorrow. And even if you do get pushed to the ZLB tomorrow, the buffer lowers the costs of doing so.\n\nNaturally, there is a cost from this policy if the shock does not occur and the economy “overheats.” The resulting inflation will have to be brought down. Optimal policy under discretion recognizes these costs and balances them against the benefits that the buffer provides against the ZLB.\n\nOur theoretical analysis formally develops these two channels.\nWe have two propositions — one for each model. But they essentially amount to the same thing: As uncertainty rises regarding future shocks that can drive policy to the ZLB, the looser today’s policy should be to guard against those events.\n\nThis policy amounts to taking out insurance today against the risk of hitting the ZLB tomorrow. So these propositions certainly fit into a common-sense view of risk management.\n\nFor analytical convenience and clarity, we present the two channels independently in different simple models. However, both channels operate in standard macro models, such as the state-of-the-art dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models.\n\nMy time is short, so I will briefly illustrate some of what we find using a very standard backward-looking model.\nIn this model, optimal policy is the interest rate chosen to minimize the usual quadratic loss function of the deviation of inflation from target, π, and the output gap, x. This choice is made subject to being constrained by the ZLB and taking into account private sector behavior, which is governed by the backward-looking Phillips and investment/saving (IS) curves. All of the uncertainty in the model surrounds the cost-push shock denoted by ut in the Phillips curve and shocks to the equilibrium “natural” real interest rate denoted by ρn in the IS curve.\n\nWe simulated this model using standard parameter settings from the literature. In period zero, the output gap is –1-1/2 percent, inflation is 1.3 percent (the latest reading for the price index for core personal consumption expenditures, or PCE), and the natural rate of interest is –1/2 percent.\nWe then assume the real natural rate rises gradually to its long-run level of 1-3/4 percent over the next four years. Uncertainty is modeled as first-order autoregressive, or AR(1), shocks about this natural rate path and in the cost-push term.\nWith these settings plugged into the model, the optimal policy has the nominal interest rate at the zero lower bound in the first period. The red line in the upper right panel shows the optimal interest rate as we march through time. Obviously both the private sector and the Fed react to shocks as they hit the economy, and there are many possible outcomes. This line is a “baseline scenario,” in which agents make decisions taking into account the model’s uncertainty, but ex post all shocks turn out to be zero. This is akin to plotting an impulse response path.\n\nNote that optimal policy delays liftoff from the ZLB for six periods. The resulting output gap is shown by the red line in the lower left panel. The gap falls immediately from –1-1/2 percent at time zero to –1 percent at time one. The output gap eventually overshoots zero, but this is needed to bring inflation — the red line in the lower right panel — back up to target and to maintain a buffer against the ZLB.\n\nFor the sake of comparison, we plotted the blue lines, which show what the 1993 Taylor rule would generate. The Taylor rule would immediately set the nominal rate to 2 percent. Output takes four years to return to its potential level, and inflation remains low for a long time.\n\nFinally, the green line in the upper right panel shows what optimal policy looks like if uncertainty increases by 50 percent. Consistent with our theorem, optimal policy in this scenario has liftoff delayed by a further six quarters.\n\nOf course, the baseline scenario is just one possible realization out of many. The next slide considers a scenario that exhibits what many think of as the biggest risk to delaying liftoff — inflation could take off to unacceptably high levels. Here we assume that two large back-to-back cost-push shocks lead to a burst of inflation before what would otherwise be the time for liftoff. These shocks stand in for some unexplained jump in inflation expectations or for other inflationary forces beyond those captured in the model’s simple Phillips curve.\nYou can see in the upper right panel that both optimal policy and the Taylor rule hike rates aggressively in response to these shocks. Optimal policy clearly does a much better job in closing the output gap than the Taylor rule. And while the Taylor rule does a better job bringing inflation back to target, the inflation path under optimal policy is not radically different. In other words, delaying liftoff does not seem to seriously impair the Fed’s ability to hold inflation in check.\n\nThis table summarizes the outcomes from a large number of simulated paths of the natural rate and cost-push shocks using the same set of initial conditions as before. Optimal policy has the smaller loss — about 1/2 of that under the Taylor rule. We find it revealing to look at the economic conditions under which liftoff occurs. In the typical, that is, median, draw, optimal policy lifts off with a small positive output gap and inflation essentially at target. This looks like a “whites of their eyes” inflation-fighting policy.\n\nThe optimal policy greatly reduces the odds of hitting the ZLB tomorrow — the probability that the natural rate is negative the quarter after liftoff is only about 20 percent under optimal policy.\nThese outcomes are very different than under the Taylor rule, which typically lifts off with large negative gaps and 90 percent of the time runs into a negative natural rate immediately after liftoff. \n\nHow well do the policies guard against bad luck? At the bottom, we see the median worst outcomes across simulations. Optimal policy and the Taylor rule are not very different here — worst-case output gaps of 1 percent or so and inflation rates in the range of 4 percent. These results reinforce the point we noted from the previous chart: Optimal policy is able to raise rates enough to choke off inflation scares — and can do so essentially as well as the Taylor rule.\n\nHow has risk management entered into actual FOMC policymaking? In our empirical analysis, we study a time span when the funds rate is mostly well above zero. Nevertheless, this history is still worth investigating: If the Fed has practiced risk management away from the ZLB, it seems reasonable for it to take account of the special risks generated by the ZLB in its decision-making calculus today. We study risk management empirically by estimating standard Clarida-Galí-Gertler-style monetary policy reaction functions.\n\nHere R-star is a notional target funds rate that depends on the expected difference of inflation from its target and the expected average output gap over the next year. We use the Fed’s Greenbook forecasts for these variables. We then append a variable st that proxies for risk-management factors that might influence the policy decision over and above how they might affect the forecast. As is standard, we assume a partial adjustment of the actual funds rate to this notional target.\n\nWe consider an eclectic mix of risk-management proxies.\nThe FOMC’s minutes and other Fed communications suggest risk management was often a consideration affecting policy moves. There are numerous references to uncertainties over the outlook; insurance against skewed losses; or preemption of nascent recessionary dynamics.\n\nWe summarize this information by coding dummy variables to indicate when we judged uncertainty and insurance considerations shaded policy higher or lower than prescribed by the forecast alone.\nWe also let the computer take a shot at this, by having it count sentences in the minutes that mention “uncertainty” and “insurance.” Other proxies include revisions to Greenbook forecasts for gross domestic product (GDP) and inflation — large forecast revisions may signal asymmetric weights on outcomes in the direction of the shock and the FOMC may have wanted to insure against these outcomes. We also consider variables that summarize variance and skewness in private sector forecasts, including those derived from financial markets and those derived from the Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF).\n\nHere are the variables we found statistically significant at the 5 percent level. When the human-coded uncertainty dummy turns on up or down, the notional target funds rate changes by 40 basis points. All other numbers are the basis point responses to the notional target associated with a one standard deviation increase in a variable. Overall, we find what our historical narrative analysis also suggests: Before it was constrained by the ZLB, the FOMC seems to have incorporated risk-management considerations into its policy decisions.\n\nThis chart shows how one of our proxies — the variance across the GDP point forecasts made by the SPF panelists — lines up with the residuals from the policy reaction function that excludes a risk-management proxy. We see a clear negative correlation, suggesting the Committee shaded down the funds rate during times when the private sector — and, presumably, the Fed — had heightened uncertainty over the outlook for growth.\n\nIt’s useful to look more closely at the 2000–01 period.\nThe bars in this figure show the effect on the notional funds rate of the GDP point forecast variance shown in the previous figure. The bars are quarterly because this is the frequency of the SPF.\nBy the middle of 2000, the economy appeared to be slowing, in part because of monetary tightening in 1999 and early 2000. The level of our proxy for uncertainty usually was below average then. But as we moved through 2001, the economy slowed more, and uncertainty grew about whether we were slipping into recession — this shows up here as negative effects of the uncertainty variable.\nThen, the tragic events of September 11th hit, which created huge uncertainty and downside risks to the economic outlook. We see this in the spike in the SPF uncertainty variable in November — the last bar — that would point to a nearly 100 basis point drop in the funds rate.\n\nThe red line plots the actual path for the funds rate against these uncertainty effects. We can see that the Fed began to undo its tightening cycle in mid-2000, and cut rates a good deal further in mid-2001as uncertainty rose. We then see that the large spike in uncertainty at the end of the year is correlated with a big drop in the funds rate.\nOf course, there is much more to be said about risk management during this period. The 2000 pause in rate increases occurred despite forecasts of very low unemployment and rising inflation, in part, as the minutes tell us, because the Committee was uncertain over the degree to which its previous tightening might further affect the economy.\nThe aggressive rate cuts in early 2001 encompassed other rationales; notably, the January 30–31, 2001, minutes stated the Committee was front-loading easing to “help guard against cumulative weakness” — perhaps a reference to policy insurance against outcomes skewed to the downside.\nThe post-9-11 cuts had this reasoning as well. In addition, as evidenced in the November 6, 2011, minutes, the Committee noted its concern that recessionary dynamics could, and I quote, “be difficult to counter with the current federal funds rate already quite low.” Accordingly, the large policy moves could also have reflected insurance against the future possibility of running into the ZLB — precisely the policy scenario our theory addresses.\n\nSo, to conclude, we think our theoretical and empirical analysis support one of my favorite quotes from one of our discussants:",

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you, Tim, for that warm introduction. The Rotary Club brings together civic-minded people from all over the world. It is a pleasure to interact with members of this vibrant community. Occasions such as this provide me with a valuable opportunity to describe my views on monetary policy to an interested audience. Equally as important, when I hear your questions and comments following my remarks, I gain a better understanding of the concerns many people have. This valuable communication helps sharpen my thinking on the economy and monetary policy. So, I look forward with particular interest to the discussion following my remarks. I should note that my commentary reflects my own viewpoint and does not necessarily represent the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System.\nToday I will first discuss recent economic developments and my outlook for the economy. I will then explain how that outlook and the risks around it shape my views about the appropriate timing and pace of eventual policy normalization.\nIn particular, I expect to see continued solid growth in real economic activity and substantial improvements in labor markets. The outlook for economic activity is probably on its best footing since the recovery began in 2009.\nHowever, inflation is too low relative to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective. In fact, it has been too low for the past six years, and it is hard to see inflation heading up to target any time soon. This worries me quite a bit, and I will spend a good deal of time today explaining my concern.\nIt is largely because of this outlook for inflation that I think the FOMC should refrain from raising the federal funds rate, until conditions indicate much greater confidence in forecasts of inflation getting to 2 percent in a year or two. I see no compelling reason for us to be in a hurry to tighten financial conditions before that time.\nGoal-Oriented Approach to Monetary Policy\nFor some time now, I have been advocating a goal-oriented approach to monetary policy.[1] This is distinct from an instrument-rule approach that currently being advocated by Professor John Taylor from Stanford, based on analysis he did in 1993.[2] In fact, it is more closely related to a seminal Taylor 1979 article. The Federal Reserve Act mandates that monetary policy should work to foster financial conditions that promote both full employment and price stability. To me, this means setting our policy tools with the aim of achieving both our goals in a reasonable amount of time while also minimizing potential risks associated with uncertainty over the course of future economic events. This is a tall order, but that’s the stuff of central banking.\nBefore I get to the specifics of how I think policy should be set in the current circumstances, let me first report on where the economy stands today with respect to our goals of full employment and price stability.\nNearing Our Employment Goal\nFollowing years of false starts and tepid growth, economic growth these past two years has been quite good. Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an average rate of 2-3/4 percent over this time, and growth was at a quite rapid 3-1/2 percent annualized pace in the second half of 2014. Looking ahead, I am expecting growth to average near a 3 percent pace for the next couple years.\nAs output growth has improved, so has the labor market. Average monthly payroll employment growth was about 265,000 per month over the past year.  This is well above the average monthly gain of roughly 190,000 over the previous two years. With 3 percent output growth, job gains should remain above the 200,000 mark for some time before gradually moving back down toward its longer-run trend.\nAt the same time, the unemployment rate has declined significantly. In each of the past four years, it has fallen by about 1 percentage point and now stands at 5.7 percent. This is terrific progress, but it remains higher than what a normal, sustainable unemployment rate should be. Most FOMC participants’ estimates for the longer-run normal rate of unemployment — which were made last December — fall in the range of 5.2 percent to 5.5 percent.[3] My own estimate was at the bottom of this range. But, based in part on the extensive analysis done by my staff on compositional and demographic changes in the labor force, I now think that it might be something more like 5.0 percent.[4] So in my mind the degree of labor market slack may be somewhat larger than what many others infer when looking at the 5.7 percent unemployment rate.\nSome other labor market indicators support this assessment of slack. For example, the number of people who are employed part time for economic reasons remains unusually high. If the economy were closer to full employment, these individuals would have more opportunities to find full-time jobs. Furthermore, wage growth has been much lower than one would expect if labor markets were closer to normal.\nEven with these caveats, it’s clear that the economy and labor markets have seen great improvement over the past two years. Monetary policy has been an important component to this progress. The Federal Reserve initially responded to the financial crisis and ensuing deep recession by providing accommodation in the usual way — by cutting short-term interest rates. But once rates hit their zero lower bound, we had to turn to other nonconventional tools to provide further accommodation, notably large-scale asset purchases (LSAP) and guidance regarding future movements in the federal funds rate.[5]\nOne of our most notable and controversial responses followed our September 2012 meeting. At that time, the unemployment rate was over 8 percent and forecasts showed a strong risk that improvements in the labor market were about to stall. It was clear that more accommodation was needed, but just how to provide that accommodation was unclear. Against this backdrop, the FOMC announced that the Fed would steadily purchase $85 billion of long-term Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities each month until we saw substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market. This open-ended program is often referred to as the third round of quantitative easing, or QE3.[6]\nWithin a year, more accommodative financial conditions helped to re-energize employment gains. Borrowing rates declined. Car sales rose, and consumer conditions improved. This recovery is all the more remarkable in that it occurred just when already strong headwinds — such as higher income tax rates and cuts in federal spending — gained in strength.\nOf course, to be completely fair and balanced, the economy was long overdue for just such acceleration in growth and employment. So, maybe the past couple of years have been a combination of luck and good policy. Now I don’t think it was all luck. Just as it’s good to be lucky, it’s also good to be resourceful.\nRegardless of whether it was good fortune or effective policy that propelled growth, our asset purchase program and the explicit conditions of its implementation demonstrated clearly that the Federal Reserve is fully committed to undertaking goal-oriented monetary policy actions. The sheer size of our asset purchases certainly had some direct effect on lowering interest rates. But the efficacy of these policies was substantially enhanced by their open-ended, goal-oriented nature that confirmed our commitment to act until we saw the improvements in labor markets that we were looking for.\nNow let me turn to inflation.\nMissing Our Inflation Goal\nSince 2012, the FOMC has set an explicit longer-run goal for inflation of 2 percent as measured by the year-over-year rate of change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE).[7] Inflation has been running well below this rate for quite some time, averaging about 1-1/2 percent for the past six years. Currently, core PCE inflation is 1.3 percent compared with a year ago.[8] Of course, there are other measures of inflation, such as the well-known Consumer Price Index (CPI).[9] Because of the CPI’s construction, CPI inflation runs 1/4 to 1/2 of a percentage point higher than PCE inflation on average. So a 2 percent goal for PCE inflation equates to something closer to a 2-1/2 percent goal in terms of CPI inflation. By this measure, too, inflation is falling well short of our goal, as the CPI has averaged less than 2 percent since 2008.\nInflation is simply too low. I know that it sounds unusual for a central banker to claim that inflation is too low.  I certainly never expected I would utter those words.  For anyone as old as I am, most of your mature life has occurred while hearing the refrain that inflation is too high and it needs to be lower.\nMy long-held views on inflation were forged in the 1970s and early 1980s. Inflation then rose to an alarmingl10 percent and seemed destined to remain there.[10] Fearing that inflation was spiraling out of control, the Paul Volcker-led Fed raised interest rates steeply and successfully broke the back of double-digit inflation.[11] By the time of Volcker’s departure in 1987, inflation was running about 4 percent a year. The Greenspan-led Fed spent the next dozen or more years trying to bring inflation down to about 2 percent. That goal was achieved in the early 2000s, and the Fed has aimed to bring PCE inflation in at 2 percent for the past ten or more years. First, this was an informal objective, but was later made an explicit goal.\nWhy is it important for the Federal Reserve to achieve its 2 percent inflation objective? What is the problem posed by too low inflation? Simply put, prolonged and significant deviations of actual inflation from what consumers and businesses are expecting when they make long-term investment decisions could impose significant costs on the economy.\nFor instance, interest rates on loans are set high enough to compensate lenders for expected inflation. From the lenders’ point of view, if actual inflation exceeds the level expected when the loan was originated, loan payments remain fixed in nominal terms, but the purchasing power of those interest receipts is less than lenders had expected. So, unexpectedly high inflation hurts creditors.\nOn the flip side, when prices and, along with them, wages and incomes rise at a slower rate than anticipated, borrowers’ fixed monthly loan obligations become more burdensome. And the longer inflation undershoots borrowers’ expectations, the higher are these real costs. Today, these costs have been accumulating for the past six years that inflation has underrun the 2 percent rate that the Fed targets and that borrowers had relied upon. To meet these higher real costs, borrowers must make cutbacks in other spending, reducing aggregate demand and ultimately weighing on economic activity.\nThis is an important reason why we need to achieve our 2 percent inflation objective, and it also explains why achieving symmetry around our two percent goal is important.\nSlow and Uncertain Improvement towards Inflation Goal\nTo reiterate, I am concerned about the current low inflation environment and the outlook for the future. Current core inflation is about 1.3 percent, and my forecast has it rising to 2 percent only by the end of 2018. So, I am anticipating it to rise at a woefully gradual pace. Furthermore, there are downside risks to my projection.\nThe dramatic decline in oil prices, on net, is a positive development for U.S. economic activity. The lower prices bolster the real spending capacity of consumers and businesses. The drop in oil prices also lowers consumer inflation — both directly, through the effects on gasoline prices, and indirectly, as cost savings for businesses pass through to lower prices for consumer goods and services. Similarly, the appreciation of the dollar since last summer presents another disinflationary pressure through its influence on lowering import prices.\nIf lower energy and import prices resulted in just a one-time drop in consumer prices, then they wouldn’t be an issue for monetary policymakers to worry about. But if the lower pricing gets embedded more persistently in underlying trends, it is problematic — especially if ultimately it lowers longer-run inflationary expectations of households and businesses. This could make it even harder to get inflation back to our 2 percent target.\nI should note that low inflation is a global phenomenon. In part, this reflects slower global growth and disinflationary pressures in most advanced economies, which also present some downside risk to the outlook for growth in the United States.\nAn Appropriate Path for Monetary Policy\nGiven this assessment, what is my outlook for monetary policy and the most appropriate path for interest rates?\nFour times a year, my colleagues and I are asked to submit a forecast of real GDP growth, the unemployment rate and inflation over the next three years. Along with those projections, we provide our assumptions for the appropriate path for monetary policy that underlies our economic forecasts. In the latest projections made in December, 15 of the 17 FOMC participants expected that it would be appropriate to raise rates sometime this year. While there is a fair amount of dispersion among the individual participants’ projections, the median for the target federal funds rate at the end of this year is a bit above 1 percent. Moreover, the median for the target rate at the end of 2016 is slightly above 2 percent.\nIn other words, according to the median path for the target fed funds rate as projected by FOMC participants, rate increases of about 100 basis points for this year and next are to be expected. The FOMC meets eight times a year. So, the projected path is consistent with a 25 basis point increase at every other FOMC meeting. I should note that this is a considerably slower, more gradual pace of rate increases than those implemented in 2004 through 2006 — the last time the Fed normalized policy following an extended period of very low interest rates.\nIndeed, financial market participants expect the pace of rate increases to be even slower than FOMC participants do. The most recent reading on market expectations puts the target rate at the end of 2016 a bit above 1 percent — a full percentage point below the median FOMC forecast.\nWhat is my personal view of the appropriate path for policy? As I have argued for some time, I think economic conditions will evolve in a way such that it will be appropriate to delay normalizing monetary policy — that is, to hold off on raising short-term rates — until 2016.\nEconomic activity appears to be on a solid, sustainable growth path. However, inflation is low and is expected to remain low for some time — and I have serious concerns that inflation will run even lower than I expect.\nAccordingly, in my view, a prudent risk-management and goal-oriented approach to monetary policy dictates that we continue to assess low inflationary condition for some time before generating more restrictive financial conditions.[12] The risk I worry about is if we were to begin to raise rates only to learn that we have misjudged the strength of the economy.  Or suppose we were surprised by some disinflationary shock while already drifting along a low inflation path. In these cases we would find ourselves in the extremely uncomfortable position of being forced to lower the fed funds rate back to its zero lower bound — a policy position that has already proved challenging for the Fed. Or if we were too timid to reverse ourselves back to the zero lower bound, we would persist with overly restrict conditions.\nNow consider the problem posed by waiting too long to raise rates and, subsequently, inflation picking up faster than we now expect. I simply do not see high costs to this scenario. Given how far inflation is from our target, some greater-than-expected pickup in inflation would actually be welcome. Furthermore, there is no great cost even if we were to end up with a period of inflation running moderately above 2 percent. It would just be the symmetric flip side of our recent below-target inflation experience. And in the event the risk of overshooting our target by an uncomfortable margin did arise, given the inertia in inflation, we would likely have ample time to address the problem with moderate increases in interest rates.\nMarkers of Progress\nOf course, at some time, it will become appropriate to increase the federal funds rate. So let me now talk about the conditions I would expect to see when policy normalization finally becomes appropriate.\nWell, I need to be confident enough that we will achieve our dual mandate goals within an acceptable period of time and that we are at low risk of regressing back to economic conditions that necessitate policy rates returning to their zero lower bound. There are several important indicators that will assure me that growth and inflation are on the right sustainable trajectory.\nFirst, it goes without saying that we need to see continued improvements in labor markets and GDP growth. Even though we have made great strides, the economy has not yet returned to full employment, and we must be confident that growth will not stall before getting there.\nSecond, we should feel quite confident that inflation is going to start increasing so that it will reach our goal of 2 percent on a sustainable basis within a reasonable amount of time — say, within a year or two. I’m not at that point yet. My forecast assumes policy rates will begin to rise sometime in the first half of 2016. I believe this delayed liftoff relative to what most of my colleagues on the FOMC are expecting in their Summary of Economic Projections (SEPs) is a critical element in my approach to generating higher inflation. Even with this delay in raising short-term rates, my forecast is that we will not actually achieve 2 percent inflation until 2018. Earlier than that — say, in 2017 or 2016 — would be a much more successful outcome.\nWhat would make me more confident that inflation is heading higher?\nA simple signal will be if we start seeing a pickup in the year-over-year rate of change in the price index for core PCE. This price index strips out the volatile changes in food and energy prices; and as a matter of practical forecasting, core inflation today may be about the single best predictor of where total inflation will be a year from now. So I would like to see core PCE inflation begin to rise above its current 1.3 percent rate in a sustainable fashion. If it does not, then that’s a clear sign that there are important factors persistently driving down inflation.\nI would also need to see stronger growth in wages and other forms of labor compensation. Wage growth has been very weak for quite some time, averaging only 2 to 2-1/2 percent per year for the past five years. Usually, productivity growth of 1 to 2 percent annually and 2 percent inflation would produce wage growth in the range of 3 to 4 percent per year. Wage and compensation growth closer to this range is an important sign not just of diminished labor market slack, but also of cost increases more consistent with an economy running closer to a 2 percent inflation rate.\nThe last signal I will need to see relates to measures of inflation expectations. Specifically, I need more evidence that the public and financial markets expect that inflation will be rising over the medium term in line with our 2 percent objective. Of particular recent concern, the compensation financial market participants require for taking on inflation risk has been moving down dramatically. According to the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) market,[13] market participants are currently looking to be compensated for future CPI inflation of about 1.9 percent, six to ten years from now. In PCE terms, this would be an expectation of about 1-1/2 percent. That is simply too low to be consistent with our longer-run inflation objective of 2 percent.\nThere are a few reasons inflation compensation could be low. Benign technical financial market considerations are one possibility. However, it could be that people are expecting inflation to be low. Alternatively, the cost to investors of higher inflation might have fallen or the cost of low inflation might have risen. At the moment, the data suggest market participants are concerned about low inflation outcomes. Neither depressed inflation expectations nor higher costs of low inflation bode well for the outlook. So I would need to see an increase in inflation compensation to be confident about tightening monetary policy.\nCurrent Circumstances Call for Patience\nIn summary, I think we should be patient in raising interest rates. There is no prescribed timeline that must be adhered to and no pre-set script to follow other than that we should let economic conditions and risks to the outlook be our guides. Given uncomfortably low inflation and an uncertain global environment, there are few benefits and significant risks to increasing interest rates prematurely. Let’s be confident that we will achieve both dual mandate goals within a reasonable period of time before taking actions that could undermine the very progress we seek.\n[1] This is a point I’ve been making regularly in my public appearances since 2010.

            "content": "Introduction\nI have been president of the Chicago Fed for nine years, after having transitioned from research director in September 2007. Talk about impeccable timing! Almost immediately, the U.S. experienced a financial crisis that led to the Great Recession, with unemployment peaking at a horrendous 10 percent. And since mid-2009, the U.S. has been in a slow recovery and a prolonged period of inflation running below our 2 percent policy objective (as measured by the annual change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE). 1\nThe Federal Reserve’s response to these enormousA challenges included a reduction in our short-term policy interest rate, the federal funds rate, all the way to its zero lower bound (ZLB) in December 2008. And to provide additional monetary accommodation, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) subsequently introduced unconventional policies – such as large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance about the future path for the fed funds rate. 2\nWe’ve made great progress. Today, the unemployment rate is down to 5.0 percent, and U.S. economic fundamentals appear good. As summarized in the Federal Reserve’s quarterly Summary of Economic Projections, or SEPs, we expect 2 percent or so growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) over the next few years, with further declines in unemployment. 3\nHowever, the story on inflation is not satisfactory. Core PCE inflation, which strips out the volatile food and energy components, appeared to have stalled at 1.6 percent before edging up to 1.7 percent in August. The SEP forecasts have it taking another two years to return to our 2 percent target. Moreover, I should note that the SEPs have been predicting inflation would take at least two years to return to target for the last four years.\nWhat does this imply for monetary policy?\n\nAs you may know, the FOMC took a first step toward policy normalization last December, increasing the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 1/4 to 1/2 percent. However, for a variety of reasons, the FOMC has refrained from further increases since then. This may well be changing soon. The most recent FOMC policy statement indicated that “the Committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened but decided, for the time being, to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives.\" 4 Indeed, at our September meeting, three FOMC members dissented in favor of immediately increasing rates. Moreover, it is public knowledge that going into our July meeting, eight of 12 Reserve Banks had requested an increase in the discount rate, likely signaling a preference for policy tightening. 5\nWithin this context, today I will discuss the objectives of the Federal Reserve and my thinking about the policy path ahead. There are three key issues that we need to consider: First, the trend, or potential, rate of economic growth in the U.S. is now recognized to be markedly lower than we assessed prior to 2007. Second, there continues to be substantial uncertainty on how close we are to “full employment.” And, third, we need to recognize that the predominant inflation risk facing monetary policymakers has shifted from inflation being too high to inflation being too low. The Great Inflation that so occupied policymakers in the 1970s and 1980s was first broken by the Volcker Fed and then finished off under Greenspan.\nWe then got a glimpse of a new regime in May 2003, when the FOMC’s post-meeting policy statement first explicitly mentioned the risk that inflation might be too low. 6 And this risk has been intense since the Great Recession, with inflation running persistently below our 2 percent target for the past eight years.\n\nWith all of this in store for today’s discussion, I need to mention now that these are my own views and do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the FOMC or those in the Federal Reserve System.\nMonetary Policy Goals and Strategies\nThis slide summarizes the long-run goals and strategy for U.S. monetary policy, which the FOMC first explicitly laid out in January 2012. The U.S. Congress has given the Fed a dual mandate — to set monetary conditions with the aim of achieving price stability and maximum sustainable employment. The FOMC’s price stability target is an inflation rate of 2 percent as measured by the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures, as I mentioned before. The strategy statement explicitly says this target is symmetric, with the Committee being concerned if inflation persistently runs either above or below 2 percent.\n\n\nBecause maximum employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that can change over time, the FOMC does not have a fixed numerical target for our employment mandate. However, one guide is the unemployment rate that FOMC participants see the economy settling out at in the long run. The range of these forecasts currently is 4-1/2 to 5.0 percent, with the median at 4.8 percent. 7 Finally, the goals and strategy statement says that the FOMC will take a balanced approach to achieving our dual objectives.\n\nNow let’s focus on slide 2. One simple way to depict our policy strategy is with the standard quadratic loss function I’ve written down on this slide. It says that deviations from our two goals are equally costly, with the costs rising with the square of the deviation above or below each goal. The two panels show the history and current status of progress towards our policy goals. The cross hairs in the bull’s-eyes are drawn at the sweet spots for policy — our 2 percent inflation target and the FOMC’s current median estimate of the long-run unemployment rate, 4.8 percent . 8\n  During the recession and early recovery, when resource slack was enormous and inflation was obviously too low, the direction of policy was clear: The U.S. economy needed highly accommodative policies to ease financial strains, facilitate balance sheet restructuring by households and businesses and stimulate growth and inflation. The right-hand panel depicts what I’ve already noted — we have made great progress toward our full employment mandate, but are still short of our inflation objective.\n\nIn spite of weak global conditions, the U.S. economy has come a long way back. So isn’t the policy direction clear and obvious today? By old benchmarks, such as the original Taylor rule, we should be increasing rates now. However, for me, the current economic environment looks very different than it did during my first 16 years at the Chicago Fed, before becoming president (1991–2007). That’s because the validity of these old benchmarks depends on how we assess the three issues that I mentioned at the start of my talk: trend growth; uncertainty about what constitutes full employment; and the tilt of inflation risks. These assessments have important implications for how much the Fed needs to adjust its previous tactics in order to address new circumstances. Let’s turn to these issues now.\nThree Issues Facing Monetary Policymakers\nIssue number 1: Going forward, trend (or potential) output growth is expected to be only about 1.8 percent — that’s the median projection from the FOMC’s September SEP 9  and it is our Chicago Fed assessment as well. This is quite a change from the past — for example, between 1980 and 2007, U.S. real GDP growth averaged about 3.0 percent.\n\nMany economists have been speaking at length on this subject for some time, so I will just list the main reasons for this slowdown: 1) Growth in available labor input is slowing, largely because of the retirement of the baby boomers and lower youth and prime-age labor force participation (LFP) rates; 2) Total factor productivity (TFP). 10 growth appears to have reverted to rates that prevailed during the slow growth years between 1975 and 1995; and 3) capital deepening has been weak. 11\nThe last two factors determine growth in labor productivity. And it is a matter of arithmetic that trend growth in labor hours and labor productivity translate into trend GDP growth. Thus, 1.8 percent is my current assessment for the sum of these two factors.\n\nOne of the first reactions I often get to this statement is something like: “Well, shouldn’t we all prefer something higher, like 4 percent trend growth?” Yes, I agree. But how does the economy achieve trend growth in labor hours plus trend growth in labor productivity that add up to 4 percent? That is the crucial public policy challenge, but it is beyond the capacity of monetary policy.\n\nIncreasing trend growth is crucial. Just pushing growth up to 4 percent without affecting potential won’t do. Growth well above potential year after year would generate unsustainable imbalances that typically lead to large undesirable increases in inflation.\n\nThe pace of trend growth has another important implication. As standard economic theory tells us, one consequence of slower trend growth is lower equilibrium real interest rates (r *). 12 And, with lower equilibrium real rates, any given level of a central bank’s policy interest rate is less accommodative than it otherwise would be. So, clearly, we need to rethink our old policy benchmarks with this new calibration in mind. Furthermore, a lower equilibrium real interest rate reduces the buffer monetary policy has to fight downside shocks before it is confronted with the zero lower bound. And experiences from around the world have left us with all too great an appreciation for the difficulties that the ZLB presents to policymakers.\n\nNow for issue number 2: Is the U.S. economy now at full employment? We don’t really know with certainty, but my guess is no. This isn’t really a new issue — it’s always been a challenge to assess the maximum sustainable level of employment consistent with price stability. The FOMC’s statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy acknowledges this explicitly. 13\nOur view at the Chicago Fed is that the natural rate of unemployment 14 currently is 4.7 percent and that for some time it will fall about 5 basis points a year, reaching 4-1/2 percent by 2020. This assessment reflects the increasing age and educational levels of the labor force. My staff also thinks the labor force participation rate currently is below where it should be based on long-run trends, which means there is additional slack beyond what’s picked up by the unemployment rate alone. I put substantial weight on my staff’s labor market views, and indeed, they have a good track record: Aaronson and Sullivan identified downward trends for U.S. LFP back in the early 2000s before most economists even contemplated them. 15 So at the Chicago Fed, we see more slack than most of my FOMC colleagues — as I mentioned earlier, the FOMC’s latest forecasts of the long-run neutral unemployment rate range from 4-1/2 to 5 percent, with a median of 4.8 percent.\n\nBy the way, I don’t see the differences in the estimates as a problem — a strength of our Federal Reserve System is the diverse expertise and perspectives that 12 regionally dispersed Reserve Bank presidents plus five Federal Reserve Board Governors bring to the FOMC discussion.\n\nNow, the 50 basis point range of natural rate estimates may seem rather large at first glance. But 95 percent error bands generated by statistical models of the natural rate are typically at least 250 basis points wide. 16 Our uncertainty over measures of “full employment” is enormous. When unemployment in the U.S. was 10 percent or 8 percent or even 6 percent, this uncertainty wasn’t really critical to policy — we didn’t know exactly how far we were from the natural rate, but we were quite certain we were a fair ways above it. But with the unemployment rate at 5.0 percent and inflation closer to but still below our 2 percent objective, this uncertainty becomes a very important issue.\n\nMy FOMC colleagues and I have been quite vocal in saying we need to consider a wide variety of risks when choosing appropriate monetary policy. Weighting these risks by the size of their social costs should be a big part of this calculation. Full employment is an enormously important, valuable economic outcome. And repairing damage incurred from the Great Recession continues to be critical for improving labor force quality for stronger, long-lasting growth. In this context, overestimating the natural rate; incorrectly inferring that U.S. is at full employment; and prematurely tightening policy would carry particularly high social costs.\n\nOf course, we can’t just don rose-colored glasses either. We have to be cognizant of the risks of underestimating the natural rate of unemployment as well. I will return to more fully discuss how these various risks affect our policy calculus shortly.\n\nThis brings me to issue number 3: The change in the predominant inflation risk from inflation being too high to it being too low. During most of my Fed career, going back to the early 1990s, the problem with inflation was pretty clear: It was too high — above any sensible inflation objective, and monetary policy needed to engineer a lower secular level of inflation. I’m pretty confident that Fed policymakers from the Paul Volcker era through 2002 would agree with this characterization — trend inflation needed to be lower.\n\nBut the world has changed. The May 2003 FOMC meeting was an important one — as I mentioned earlier, that’s when the FOMC’s policy statement first explicitly mentioned the risk that inflation might be too low. Today, I will simply point out that the bull’s-eye chart shows clearly that inflation has been too low for almost all of the past nine years.\n\nOf course, some are still focused on the risk that Fed policy will overstimulate the economy, pushing inflation above our 2 percent target in a way that would require a sharply restraining policy response. But I would say that such fears currently are exaggerated and are a bit like the problem of generals fighting the last war. Today, looking at experiences from around the world, I think the bigger risk is that inflation in the U.S. will not get back to our symmetric 2 percent objective within an acceptable period of time.\n\nMuch of my perspective derives from how I view the symmetry of our inflation target. I would say that the FOMC has been challenged to describe what is meant by symmetry for our 2 percent inflation objective. I typically point out that a successful symmetric approach would have inflation average 2 percent over long stretches of time. In order to average 2 percent, some time will be spent above 2 percent and some time will be spent below 2 percent.\n\nSo, in the current situation, after many years of very low inflation, one has to ask, Would overshooting 2 percent be a failure or a virtue?\n\nCurrent SEP forecasts from FOMC participants have inflation rising to 2 percent without overshooting our target level. I call this threading the needle to get to 2 percent. This might be consistent with a symmetric approach to inflation. But that can’t really be known with much certainty until sometime in the future when inflation is shocked above 2 percent. At that juncture, we would be able to see whether or not the FOMC responds by similarly trying to thread the needle with a shallow decline in inflation back down to 2 percent.\n\nGiven what I see today, I am skeptical that the public believes a future FOMC would act in such a manner. Indeed, when I say in speeches or panel discussions that the FOMC has a symmetric inflation target, I am often greeted with skepticism. To ensure more public confidence that the Fed’s inflation objective is indeed symmetric, we need to provide a substantial and credible example of symmetric behavior with regard to our inflation target. And we need to do it sooner rather than later.\nDeterminants of Inflation\nIn today’s persistent low inflation environment with great uncertainties, credible inflation targets are fundamental for central banks to hit their inflation objectives. Monetary policymakers around the world are grappling with this issue.\n\nTo discuss this more fully, I find it helpful to describe the intuition underpinning my inflation projections. My exposition is slightly simplified from the analysis that Chair Yellen described in a speech last year. 17 Our canonical inflation model is depicted on this slide:\nIn this model, four things determine current inflation. The lagged terms in inflation represent inertia in the inflation process due to “sticky” price setting and other such factors. X refers to transitory factors, such as changes in food and energy prices and the exchange value of the dollar, whose movements only have temporary influences on inflation. The slack term represents the Phillips curve, in which underutilization of resources pulls down inflation while overutilization generates inflationary pressure. Long-run inflation expectations — the last term — anchor inflation when the effects of adjustment lags, transitory factors and resource utilization are all neutral. 18 . Of course, a credible inflation target, in turn, anchors inflation expectations.\nAs I assess current conditions, my confidence that inflation will rise to 2 percent before too much more time depends critically on a) whether the U.S. economy is at full employment now or will be relatively soon and b) whether inflation expectations are consistent with achieving a symmetric inflation objective of 2 percent.\n\nIf I had strong confidence that full employment was consistent with a 5 percent unemployment rate and that there was a strong upward pull from inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent, then I would have more confidence that core PCE inflation was headed to 2 percent sooner rather than later. Unfortunately, I have doubts about both of these conditions. First, as I noted, my staff’s research points to a natural rate of unemployment moving closer to 4-1/2 than 5 percent. Moreover, there is a large body of evidence that the slope of the Phillips curve is very flat, so even if the natural rate is 5 percent, it is hard to expect much upward influence on inflation from modestly undershooting the natural rate — such as we see in the median SEP forecast.\n\nThis leaves inflation expectations to carry the remaining burden. Here, again, I have worries, because looking at evidence from surveys of households and professional forecasters, as well as various measures coming out of financial markets, I believe expected inflation is not 2 percent, but something more like 1-3/4 percent. If these low inflation expectations persist, even when the transitory factors and economic slack settle back to zero, inflation will still not be back to target.\n\nSo when I account for all of the elements of the standard inflation model, I just don’t see a reason to be very confident that we’re headed back to 2 percent within a reasonable time frame. Instead, my projection, which differs from many of my Fed colleagues, is that it will take until roughly 2020 to get inflation to target and even that rather slow pace of progress will require a very shallow path for the federal funds rate.\nShould Policy Allow Overshooting?\nWith this forecast taxonomy as background, let’s explore how best to deal with the new era of inflation risks. Making good policy always requires weighing the benefits and costs of various actions. Today, I think the big question is whether we should maintain enough monetary policy accommodation to impart a significant probability of overshooting 2 percent inflation.\n\nLet’s start by thinking about the benefits of such an action. First, getting inflation to our target sooner and with a likelihood of overshooting would avoid the substantial costs of allowing inflation to linger below our objective for too long. Just consider the difficulties the Japanese economy has faced during their decades of low inflation and the Bank of Japan’s ZLB challenges. These costs are substantial.\n\nSecond, I see benefits to trying to engineer policy to allow for the strong possibility of inflation overshooting its target. Because expected inflation currently is too low, overshooting 2 percent would reinforce our symmetric objective and move expectations up toward 2 percent. This in turn would increase the upward pull on actual inflation.\n\nIn a world with lower real r * and without increasing our inflation objective, as several have advocated, 19 firming up inflationary expectations to 2 percent from 1-3/4 would slightly reduce the risk that future adverse developments would take us back to the ZLB. Every little bit helps. Also, the risk will be lower that we will need to again employ unconventional policies, including newer tools in use by foreign central banks, such as negative short-term interest rates. Many in the public tell me that they would prefer to avoid negative interest rates.\nNow, if the Phillips curve is flat and inflation expectations currently anchor inflation below 2 percent, how does a central bank engineer inflation overshooting its target? It can do so by expressing a firm commitment to increasing inflation in order to boost inflation expectations.\n\nIn the current situation, it would help to state clearly that monetary policy that leads to a high probability of inflation exceeding 2 percent would be consistent with our symmetric objective. I also think it would help to indicate that policymakers would be willing to accept the increased inflationary risk that might accompany further declines in unemployment. This inflation risk arises because we don’t really know what the level of full employment is. Pushing harder to get inflation at least to 2 percent should provide some better information about where this benchmark lies.\n\nNow let’s turn to the other side of the ledger: What are the costs of overshooting our 2 percent inflation objective?\n\nOne risk often mentioned is that pushing too hard to lower unemployment might lead to unsustainable outcomes and eventually bring the economic expansion to a premature end. After all, when inflation risks are too great and inflation is above its objective, a central bank brings inflation back down by tightening financial conditions, which usually raises unemployment. Indeed, some think that if unemployment gets more than just a small amount below its sustainable level, then its return to its natural rate might trigger a counterproductive recession.\n\nInterestingly, it is true that in the postwar U.S., there have not been increases in quarterly unemployment of more than three- or four-tenths without a recession. Nonetheless, to me it seems overly bold to extrapolate this experience forward. We have a limited number of examples, and the economic setting today is quite different than in the past.\n\nTo understand these differences, it’s useful to talk more about the history of Fed inflation-fighting. We know from the careful work of Christina and David Romer that there were many instances when the postwar Federal Reserve explicitly decided to tighten monetary policy in order to bring inflation down. 20Take, for example, the actions that began in April 1974. After OPEC’s increase in oil prices, the FOMC, fearing that high inflation was becoming embedded in the public mindset, tightened monetary policy dramatically. According to the simplified inflation model that I presented earlier, the resulting increase in resource slack and reduction in inflation expectations ought to bring inflation down. The 1974 FOMC stepped hard on the monetary brakes. And resource slack did rise — and, indeed, a sharp recession ensued. Now the downturn was made worse by nonmonetary challenges facing the U.S. economy, such as the adjustment of production technologies to higher energy prices and labor market rigidities. 21 And many have argued that these structural issues were not well appreciated by policymakers in the 1970s. Still, the monetary tightening itself did have a strong effect on the real economy.\nOf course, there are several other episodes in which the FOMC tried to rein in rising inflation and inflation expectations. Indeed, during most of the period from the 1970s into the early 2000s, the direction of monetary policy was always pretty clear: Inflation was much too high, well above any sensible inflation objective, and monetary policy tried to engineer lower inflation whenever it was opportune. The 1987–2003 period that John Taylor identifies as exemplifying best-practice monetary policy is included in this longer time period. 22 Throughout Taylor’s sample, inflation was above the Fed’s unstated inflation objective. Lower inflation was always better, and this was generally achieved with higher interest rates.\nAs I mentioned earlier, higher rates had two tasks to perform — increase unemployment (boost the slack term in inflation model) and reign in high inflation expectations (Ε(π)). And in some cases, large tightenings were needed to reduce inflation, and large tightenings typically led to recessions, as in 1973–75 and 1980–82.\nBut the 1989–90 and 1999 monetary policy tightenings were different; soft landings were almost achieved during these episodes. Because they were aiming at relatively small reductions in inflation, the Fed increased interest rates less. Recessions did eventually ensue, but arguably, in both cases the economy would not have fallen into recession if not for late-breaking external events — namely, the invasion of 1990 Kuwait and the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack in New York. These two episodes suggest that recessions may not be inevitable if we are talking about modest inflation adjustments and if we are not simultaneously facing other major economic challenges.\n\nThe current situation is very different. Unlike the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s, when the U.S. was starting from a point where inflation and inflation expectations were too high, today we are starting from a position where they are too low. This means that a mild overshooting of 2 percent in actual inflation is unlikely to result in inflation expectations rising enough that they would move very far above target. Accordingly, if it became necessary, policy wouldn’t have to do much work to lower inflation expectations back down to 2 percent.\n\nIn the past, higher interest rates had to first offset upward momentum in inflationary expectations and, once that was done, continue to work to lower inflationary expectations down to our target. Today, since inflation expectations are approaching target from below, higher rates would most likely only be needed to offset upward momentum. We wouldn’t need the second restraining dose to bring expectations down. And if we did have to, the dosage most likely would be small.\n\nThis argument implies that it may be a mistake to extrapolate the postwar monetary experience — even that of the more benign 1987–2003 period — to today. It also suggests that more research should be done to investigate whether familiar interest rate rules, such as the Taylor rule, are robust to structural changes related to lower values for potential growth, equilibrium real interest rates and inflation expectations. The Lucas critique suggests that policy rules that previously appeared useful and robust in an earlier environment may not continue to be appropriate today. 23 More evidence is needed. 24\nGiven this context and given the large uncertainties around our estimates of full employment and the current low inflation risks, it seems reasonable to continue to take stock of how much more room the economy has to grow without generating a meaningful risk of inflation rising to levels that would threaten the credibility of our symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.\nInflation Benchmarks\nFinally, I would note that much attention has been placed on exactly when the next increase in the federal funds rate might be. If core inflation was clearly on its way to 2 percent, then I would see the next readjustment of monetary policy toward its long-run neutral level as an appropriate and easy decision. However, as you can tell from my remarks today, I have yet to see clear and convincing evidence that inflation is headed up to 2 percent.\n\nWhat would convince me that inflation is clearly on its way to 2 percent? Well, I would like to see evidence of positive movements in the terms in my inflation forecasting taxonomy. So, here’s what I’m looking for: First, actual core inflation moving closer to 2 percent in a sustained fashion. Second, further reductions in unemployment and other indicators of labor market slack. And third, sustained increases in the various measures of inflation compensation and surveys of inflation expectations.\n\nIndeed, I would prefer that at the time we make our next move, FOMC communications would also indicate that subsequent increases will be dependent on seeing further positive developments in inflation indicators. I believe this would help assure the public that the Committee is seeking economic and financial conditions to support inflation attaining our 2 percent target sustainably, symmetrically and sooner rather than later.\n\nThank you.\nNotes\n1 This objective was first acknowledged in Federal Open Market Committee (2012).

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you, Jeff, for that kind introduction. It is a great pleasure to be here. The past ten years have been a challenging environment for the global economy. In the years since the financial crisis and the deep recession that followed, economic growth around the globe has been modest and the stance of monetary policy remains highly accommodative.\nThat is certainly true in the U.S. As you know, in response to the enormous challenges posed by the financial crisis, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) reduced its short-term policy interest rate - the federal funds rate - all the way to its zero lower bound (ZLB) in December 2008. The Committee took a first step toward policy normalization last December, increasing the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 1/4 to 1/2 percent. However, for a variety of reasons, the FOMC has refrained from further increases since then. This may well be changing soon, as the policy statement after our most recent meeting in mid-September noted that \"the Committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened but decided, for the time being, to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives.\" 1\nIn my remarks today, I will discuss my outlook for the U.S. economy and share my views on U.S. monetary policy. I will not be addressing the narrow question of exactly when our next policy move is going to be. Instead, I will talk about some broader issues that influence the entire path for policy renormalization, which I see as much more important than the particular date at which we make our next 25 basis point move. In that regard, another feature of Fed communications in September that gained a good deal of attention was the fact that FOMC participants once again reduced the number of rate hikes they expected over the next several years and also slightly lowered their views about the longer-run level of the fed funds rate. 2 Such downward adjustments to the path for our policy rate have been a familiar refrain in recent years.\nNow, before I proceed, let me lay out my main points:\nI expect to see sound economic growth and further reductions in labor market slack.\nMy inflation outlook is less sanguine. Inflation is too low, has been too low for too long, and I don't expect a quick and easy return to our 2 percent target.\nWith regard to monetary policy, an important structural feature to keep in mind when calibrating the future path for policy is that the \"equilibrium level of interest rates\" — a key concept I'll cover in detail later on - is likely a good deal lower than it has been in the past.\nI think policy can improve the inflation outlook by better linking future moves to indicators that inflation is moving up in a sustained fashion to the 2 percent target.\nMoreover, I think to achieve our symmetric 2 percent inflation target, appropriate policy needs to be accommodative enough to generate a reasonable likelihood that future inflation could exceed 2 percent.\nNaturally, the views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the FOMC or those in the Federal Reserve System.\nEconomic Outlook\nLet me start by briefly sharing my outlook for the U.S. economy. After a weak first half of 2016, during which real gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged only about 1 percent, I expect growth to move up in the second half and to average just over 2 percent over the next three years.\nThe U.S. consumer is the linchpin of this forecast. The most important factor supporting household spending is the substantially improved labor market in the U.S. Over the past two years, the unemployment rate has fallen below 5 percent (half its 2009 peak) and job growth has averaged around 220,000 per month. These gains have raised incomes and buoyed confidence over future job prospects. Lower energy prices and accommodative monetary policy have provided additional support to the spending wherewithal of households. All of these factors should continue to generate solid increases in consumer spending - particularly given my assumption that interest rates will stay quite low for some time.\nI also expect stronger performance from two sectors of the economy that held growth back in the first half of the year - inventory investment and business capital spending. Inventory investment subtracted 3/4 of a percentage point from growth in the first half of the year; firms even liquidated inventory stocks in the second quarter. Without evidence of overhangs, I think just a return to the trend pace of stock-building will add a lot to growth.\nBusiness fixed investment has been weak: It's declined two of the past three quarters. There are good reasons for this low level of business investment: The rising value of the U.S. dollar against many foreign currencies has been an obstacle to manufacturers with an international presence; low oil prices have held back energy exploration and drilling; and, early in the year, increased risk spreads in financial markets raised borrowing costs. However, even after accounting for these factors, recent capital spending has been weak. Fortunately, incoming indicators are pointing to some recovery in spending. But this doesn't mean we're expecting a robust rebound. Notably, my business contacts say their capacity is right-sized to their sales expectations, and they remain very cautious about spending money on even moderately risky new opportunities.\nAdding everything up, I see growth in the U.S. recovering from the tepid first half of 2016 and averaging in the range of 2 to 2-1/4 percent for the next two to three years. For reference, this pace is modestly stronger than my assessment of the underlying growth trend and should, therefore, support continued reduction in labor market slack.\nIn particular, I expect the unemployment rate to decline further over the next three years, to reach 4-1/4 percent by the end of 2019. My current estimate of the natural rate of unemployment is 4.7 percent; 3 I think demographic factors will steadily lower this natural rate to about 4-1/2 percent by 2020. Therefore, under appropriate monetary policy, I expect the unemployment rate to reach its natural rate by the end of next year and to undershoot it a bit after that. As I will discuss later, I think undershooting the unemployment goal is a necessary feature of appropriate monetary policy that raises inflation to our 2 percent target in a reasonably timely and sustainable fashion.\nThere are, however, risks to my growth outlook. On the upside, the solid labor market and continued low energy prices could lead to stronger household spending than expected - with attendant spillovers to other components of domestic demand. That said, I see more downside risks. My biggest growth concern on the domestic front is that business caution will hold back capital spending more than I expect and may even impinge on hiring. Furthermore, according to most economic forecasters as well as my business contacts, the U.S. is the bright spot in the global economy. While the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects the U.S. economy to expand at a 2.4 percent rate over the next two years, its growth forecast for the euro area is only 1-1/2 percent, and the UK and Japanese economies are predicted to grow at even more meager rates. Even the relatively faster-growing emerging market economies are projected to grow at a 4.7 percent rate - a noticeably slower pace than five years ago. 4\nTo be clear, I do not want to be seen as a \"glass half-empty\" kind of forecaster - the type who sees gloom and doom everywhere. I have reasonable confidence in my forecast for U.S. GDP growth running a bit above potential and for further improvements in labor markets. It's just that one needs to be cognizant of the risks.\nInflation Outlook and Risks\nI am less optimistic about the inflation outlook. In January 2012, the FOMC set 2 percent inflation - measured by the annual change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) - as the explicit inflation target consistent with our price stability mandate. 5 However, over the past eight years, PCE inflation has averaged only 1-1/2 percent. To get a sense of where total inflation is likely to be headed over the next year or so, it's useful to strip out the volatile food and energy components and look at so-called core inflation. And here we see core PCE inflation also has averaged about 1-1/2 percent since the crisis. 6 Although we did see core inflation move up some at the beginning of this year, it appeared to have stalled at 1.6 percent in August; it then edged up to 1.7 percent. Further ahead, I see both core and total inflation moving up very gradually to approach, but not quite reach, our 2 percent inflation target over the next three years. This path reflects the dissipating effects on consumer prices of earlier declines in energy prices and the appreciation in the dollar; the influence of further improvements in labor markets and growth in economic activity; and the support of an accommodative path for monetary policy.\nHowever, as with growth, I see downside risks to the outlook for inflation. The U.S. and other advanced economies have experienced below-target inflation rates for several years. Given the disinflationary forces across the globe and the growth challenges faced by many countries, international developments may result in further declines in energy prices or additional appreciation of the dollar.\nMost worrisome to me is the possibility that inflation expectations in the U.S. might be drifting lower. The compensation for prospective inflation one can glean from a number of financial asset prices has fallen considerably over the past three years. Some survey-based measures of inflation expectations also have moved down to historically low levels. True, financial market inflation compensation and some survey measures of inflation expectations have stabilized in recent months, but they still remain quite low. For instance, investors see the risk-priced probability of total Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation over the next ten years being below 1 percent at about 38 percent, while they are pricing in only 19 percent odds that inflation will be above 3 percent. 7 I don't hear any talk of inflationary pressures or pricing power from my business contacts either. Notably, despite the solid improvements in labor markets over the past several years, most contacts report only modest, if any, increases in the wages they have to pay to attract and retain qualified workers. These are certainly not the kinds of increases we would expect to see in a 2 percent inflation environment. If we were going to see a quick return to 2 percent inflation, I would have expected to have already heard hints bubbling up from among my contacts.\nThese incipient signs that businesses and households may be entrenched in a \"low inflation\" psychology are disconcerting. The Bank of Japan's experience over the past two decades is a reminder of how difficult it is to raise actual inflation and inflation expectations once such a psychology takes hold. Unless there is a more dramatic and sustained increase in aggregate demand or something else supporting an upward movement in inflation expectations, I don't see this low-inflation psychology changing quickly.\nIn sum, as conditions currently stand, my forecast for a gradual and modest increase in inflation is still just a forecast. It relies on historical relationships holding true in today's somewhat different environment, rather than on a solid trend in recent economic data.\nI would note that my forecast of moderate expansion in economic activity and further improvements in labor markets is broadly consistent with the median forecast from the September Survey of Economic Projections (SEPs). 8 However, my colleagues are a bit more optimistic about inflation than I am, with the median participant expecting core PCE inflation to reach 2 percent by the end of 2018.\nA Longer-Run Perspective: Lower Growth Potential, Lower Interest Rates\nGiven the major developments of the past ten years and their implications for future growth prospects, it is important to put my outlook in a longer-run context. It is my view that we will be in a low-growth, low-interest-rate environment for some time.\nLet me sketch out why.\nLet's start with a thought experiment. Think about a world in which the economy is at full employment; output is growing along its long-run trend path; and inflation and inflationary expectations are well anchored at the FOMC's 2 percent inflation target. Economists call the real interest rate consistent with this economic environment, which subtracts out the inflation target, the \"equilibrium real rate of interest.\" 9 What determines this rate?\nA crucial element is long-run trend output growth. The greater this growth rate, the greater the real returns are to business and household capital investment - and the greater the returns are to the financial instruments funding that investment. These higher returns, in turn, imply a higher equilibrium real interest rate.\nLooking ahead, I see there is a distinct possibility that there has been a reduction in the long-run trend in economic growth. My colleagues on the FOMC and I have spoken extensively about a number of reasons underlying this slowdown: the retiring of the baby boomers; lower labor force participation trends among the working-age population; a plateauing in educational achievement; smaller increases in capital per worker; and slower growth of total factor productivity (TFP). 10\nBeyond the potential slowdown in the long-run trend of economic growth, there are other factors that will likely keep market interest rates low for quite a while in the U.S. and other advanced economies. High on this list is the enormous worldwide demand for safe assets. In their well-known \"conundrum\" and \"global savings glut\" speeches, former Fed chairs Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke both pointed to such growing demand as an important factor reducing interest rates on long-term safe assets in the U.S. 11 Greenspan's \"conundrum\" commentary explicitly cited this demand as leading to a flattening of the Treasury yield curve. 12\nNote that I didn't mention monetary policy as a primary element in determining the equilibrium real interest rate. This is because the effects of monetary policy on the long-run growth potential of the economy or the saving preferences of economic players are small and indirect. True, the Fed would still be setting the federal funds rate in this hypothetical situation, but with the economy at full employment and inflation at target, the Fed's job simply would be to guide the target fed funds rate to the equilibrium determined by these nonmonetary factors.\nNow, monetary policy does have a direct influence on the equilibrium nominal interest rate, which is the sum of the equilibrium real rate and expected inflation. This influence depends on the central bank's choice of an inflation target and its success at achieving that target over time. As long as the public believes that policy authorities are committed to symmetrically achieving that target, expected inflation should equal the central bank's inflation objective over the long run.\nA lot is made of the Federal Reserve's role in engineering today's low nominal interest rate environment. Certainly, following the Great Recession, in order to provide the accommodation necessary to get economic activity back up to its potential and bring inflation back up to target, we have attempted to steer interest rates below their equilibrium levels. However, to a great degree, the current low levels of nominal interest rates likely also reflect changes in the equilibrium real rate of interest that are largely beyond the scope of monetary policy. Importantly, the factors currently weighing on equilibrium real rates could be quite persistent. In such a case, low real and (given our 2 percent inflation target) nominal interest rates could be with us for some time - even after policy rates return to a neutral setting.\nIt is also worth noting that other countries also are likely to confront lower potential growth rates and lower interest rates. For instance, the International Monetary Fund (2015) estimates that underlying structural trends will lower the average rate of potential growth in advanced economies from 2-1/4 percent during the 2001-07 pre-crisis period to 1.6 percent over the 2015-20 period. Similarly, Rachel and Smith (2015) estimate that global structural factors could result in the average of ten-year real interest rates in the G7 countries (excluding Italy) being about 1 percent in the medium and long term - well below their trends in the past.\nFor the U.S., most analysts now expect that both short-run money rates and longer-term interest rates will be lower over the long run than they had expected just a few years ago. For instance, in March 2010, the Blue Chip consensus - an average of about 50 private sector economic forecasters - expected the three-month Treasury rate would average 4-1/4 percent over the long run. By March 2016, that number had fallen to just 3 percent. Over the same time period, their outlook for long-term interest rates had come down as well (falling by over 1-1/2 percentage points). 13\nBeyond just economists' consensus forecasts, the lower-for-longer interest rate scenario appears to be built into business plans. I recently had a meeting with a number of executives from the life insurance industry, whose business models rely on investing funds to cover anticipated long-term liabilities. They talked about the challenges posed by the low interest rate environment to their business models and their bottom lines. But they also discussed how they and other real money investors - such as investment managers for pension funds - are reassessing the yield curve environment. They are increasingly coming around to the view that persistently slow output growth in the U.S. and abroad may keep real interest rates low for a long time - longer than they likely thought one, two or certainly three years ago. As a result, these long-horizon investors are developing strategies to manage their business operations based, at least in part, on the low yields that are currently achievable on longer-term fixed-income instruments.\nLet me be very clear on why this is important. We often hear of rates on long-term safe assets being reduced by a temporary flight to quality - that is, by investors running away from riskier investments until the threats recede. And many statistical asset-pricing models estimate that temporary declines in term premia - as opposed to outright permanent declines in expected real rates - have been a major contributor to low long-term interest rates. As a technical matter, these models' conclusions often turn importantly on the assumption that the level factor is stationary - that is, it will revert to its historical average over time - and, unless otherwise augmented, cannot robustly allow for secular changes in the level of interest rates. The commentary from the life insurance executives and others I just referred to differs from what such stationary models tell us. Their business decisions suggest that an important part of the decline in long-term market rates reflects expectations of lower short-term interest rates over the long run. This is quite different from attributing nearly all of the decline to transitory movements in difficult-to-explain term premia.\nImplications for Monetary Policy\nNow, how does this all inform U.S. monetary policy?\nFor one, there has been a notable decline in FOMC participants' views of where the federal funds rate will converge to over the long run. Their median forecast fell from 4-1/4 percent in 2012 to 2.9 percent most recently. 14\nMoreover, as indicated in their public commentary and FOMC communications, many FOMC participants estimate that the neutral level of the federal funds rate today is lower than its eventual long-run level due to various headwinds to growth. 15 By some estimates, the equilibrium real rate is currently near zero. Judged against this benchmark, the median forecast of a 50 to 75 basis point range for the nominal fed funds rate at the end of 2016 is not terribly far below neutral and, hence, not as accommodative as it would have been in the past. Moreover, in recent years, as the data on economic activity and inflation came in and as the FOMC participants' views of neutral policy have shifted downward, so has the median path for appropriate policy. In the September projections, the median participant expects one rate hike this year, followed by eight additional increases of 25 basis points each over the course of the following three years as appropriate. Such a path would bring the federal funds rate to 2.6 percent at the end of 2019 - still somewhat below its longer-run level.\nClearly, the pace of policy tightening envisioned in these forecasts is much slower than in previous tightening cycles. I think a very shallow funds rate path, such as the one envisioned by the median FOMC participant, is appropriate and needed to support my forecasts for growth and inflation. Indeed, I think the pace of policy normalization necessary to bring inflation back up to 2 percent in a timely manner has to be shallow enough to result in the unemployment rate falling below its natural level. I should note, too, that achieving a symmetric target means having enough accommodation in place to generate a reasonable likelihood that inflation in the future could moderately exceed 2 percent. 16 If you eliminate all chance of inflation rising above target, then you are effectively making your inflation target a ceiling. A very shallow path for policy normalization is likely needed to deliver these results.\nFurthermore, I believe the communications underlying our policy path are key to the execution of appropriate policy.\nMuch attention has been placed on exactly when the next increase in the federal funds rate might be. I am less concerned about the timing of the next increase than I am about the path over the next three years. If core inflation was clearly on its way to 2 percent, then I would see a readjustment of monetary policy toward its long-run neutral level as an appropriate and easy decision. However, I have yet to see clear and convincing evidence in the data that inflation is headed up to 2 percent.\nWhat would convince me that inflation is clearly on its way to 2 percent?\nFirst, I'm looking for core inflation moving closer to 2 percent. Given the potentially significant shifts in underlying economic fundamentals and the global disinflationary forces, I would prefer to see solid evidence that inflation is actually moving up in a sustained fashion rather than rely solely on historical forecasting relationships to make the call.\nSecond, I would like to see further reductions in unemployment and other indicators of labor market slack. Such reductions should help foster tighter labor market conditions and boost wages and inflation.\nThird, I would like to have more confidence that inflation expectations are solidly and symmetrically aligned with our 2 percent inflation objective. Sustained increases in the various measures of inflation compensation and surveys of inflation expectations would help me in this regard.\nIndeed, I would prefer that at the time we make our next move, FOMC communications would also indicate that subsequent increases will depend on seeing such changes in inflation indicators. I believe this would help assure the public that the Committee is seeking economic and financial conditions to support attaining our 2 percent inflation target sustainably, symmetrically and sooner rather than later.\nI also view risk-management issues to be of great importance today. Given that the fed funds rate is still barely above its effective lower bound and given the downside risks to my outlook, policy is much better positioned to counter unexpected strength than to address downside shocks. So I still judge that risk-management arguments continue to favor providing more accommodation than usual to deliver an extra boost to aggregate demand. Such a boost would provide a buffer against possible future downside shocks that might otherwise drive us back to the effective lower bound.\nTo conclude, there are many challenges for policymakers in judging long-run growth prospects and discerning the appropriate path of monetary policy. I see good arguments that we are in for a protracted period of low equilibrium real interest rates. In such an environment, it is all the more critical that we demonstrate our commitment to a symmetric inflation target with our policy actions and our policy communications.\nNotes\n1 Federal Open Market Committee (2016b).\n2 Federal Open Market Committee (2016a).\n3 The natural rate of unemployment is the unemployment rate that would prevail in an economy making full use of its productive resources. Consequently, it is the rate of unemployment that would predominate over the longer run in the absence of shocks to the economy.\n4 International Monetary Fund (2016, 2013).\n5 Federal Open Market Committee (2012a); for the most recent statement of the longer-run goals, which reaffirmed this inflation target, see Federal Open Market Committee (2016c).\n6 Specifically, except for a brief period at the beginning of 2012, core PCE inflation has been below 2 percent since the third quarter of 2008.\n7 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System staff calculations based on prices on inflation derivatives, as discussed in Kitsul and Wright (2013).\n8 Four times a year, the FOMC releases its Summary of Economic Projections, which presents FOMC participants’ forecasts of key economic variables over the next three years and for the longer run. Real GDP growth in the September SEPs is expected to increase from 1.8 percent this year to around 2 percent over the next two years — a bit higher than the longer-run estimate of growth. The median FOMC participant expects the unemployment rate to decline from 4.8 percent at the end of this year — which is the median forecast for the longer-run rate of unemployment — to 4.6 percent by the end of next year and to remain at about that level through the end of 2019. See Federal Open Market Committee (2016a).\n9 The equilibrium interest rate is sometimes called the “natural” or “neutral” interest rate.\n10 See, for instance, Yellen (2016a, 2016b), Evans (2016) and Powell (2016). TFP refers to the technologies and operational systems that businesses use to combine various inputs into outputs. In other words, TFP captures the residual growth in total output of the national economy that cannot be explained by the accumulation of measured inputs, such as labor and capital.\n11 Greenspan (2005) and Bernanke (2005).\n12 A yield curve is the line plotting the yields or interest rates of assets of the same credit quality but with differing maturity dates at a certain point in time. These assets, such as U.S. Treasury securities, typically yield incrementally more at longer maturities.\n13 See the March 10, 2010, and March 10, 2016, issues of the Blue Chip Economic Indicators.\n14 Federal Open Market Committee (2012b, 2016a).\n15 The neutral, or equilibrium, federal funds rate is the funds rate associated with a neutral monetary policy (policy that is neither expansionary nor contractionary).\n16 This is not as heretical as it might first appear. After all, it is a simple consequence of having a symmetric inflation target: It is difficult to average 2 percent inflation over the medium term if there is little chance of inflation ever running above 2 percent. If policy preempts this possibility, the public could begin to mistakenly believe that 2 percent inflation is a ceiling — and not a symmetric target.\n\nReferences\nBernanke, Ben, 2005, “The global saving glut and the U.S. current account deficit,” remarks of Federal Reserve Governor at the Sandridge Lecture, Virginia Association of Economists, Richmond, VA, March 10.\nEvans, Charles L., 2016, “Reflections on the current monetary policy environment,” speech by Chicago Fed president at Global Interdependence Center, London, June 3.\n  Federal Open Market Committee, 2016a, Summary of Economic Projections, Washington, DC, September 21.\n\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2016b, press release, Washington, DC, September 21.\n  Federal Open Market Committee, 2016c, “Statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy,” Washington, DC, as amended effective January 26.\n  Federal Open Market Committee, 2012a, press release, Washington, DC, January 25.\n  Federal Open Market Committee, 2012b, Summary of Economic Projections, Washington, DC, January 25.\n  Greenspan, Alan, 2005, testimony of the Federal Reserve Chairman before the U.S. Senate, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Washington, DC, February 16.\n  International Monetary Fund, 2016, “Uncertainty in the aftermath of the U.K. referendum,” World Economic Outlook Update, Washington, DC, July 19.\n  International Monetary Fund, 2015, “Where are we headed?

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you for the introduction and for inviting me to speak to you today. Settings like this are valuable for policymakers like me because they offer us a chance to hear a broad array of comments and observations from people who run financial institutions day in and day out, as well as those involved in banking supervision. You are an important source of views and perspectives for us at the Federal Reserve as we continually take stock of monetary policy, financial markets and the banking industry. In many cases, you are the first to feel the changing rhythms of our economy. This event also provides an opportunity to bring together bankers, supervisors and academics, with the aim of advancing research in how we can improve upon the community bank business model.\n\nIn my meetings with bankers, I consistently hear about the ways an increase in the target federal funds rate would benefit community banks, including their ability to increase lending and build capital. It’s worth mentioning that this feedback can come in the unlikeliest of places. Take, for instance, a recent trip I took to Georgia to visit my older brother. He has told his friends about my job responsibilities. As we were crossing the parking lot on our way to lunch, one of his banker friends saw us and yelled, “Hey, Evans, when are you going to raise rates?” It’s a friendly bunch down in Columbus. This was in February, just after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had raised the target range for the federal funds rate in December. So I yelled back, good-naturedly, of course, “We already did!” Without skipping a beat, the banker yelled back, “But when are you going to raise long rates and steepen the yield curve?” 1 I paused and then yelled back, “That’s not me. You have to go track down Mr. Market for that one.”\nWell, I apologize if this all seems a bit flippant as an answer to a serious question — namely, what is the relationship between short-term policy rates and the yield curve for safe assets? A more serious, but perhaps no more satisfying, answer would have been this: The FOMC raised the target rate in December of last year, and the median projection at that time was for four more increases in 2016. However, economic developments — many of them global in nature — intervened in January and again in the summer: We refrained from further policy rate increases, and market-determined long-term rates on safe assets also moved lower. The point is the low interest rate environment is not just a U.S. phenomenon, or simply a situation engineered by Federal Reserve policy. Rather, it is a global phenomenon with underpinnings in economic fundamentals that are central to the framing of monetary policy.\n   As you know, the Federal Open Market Committee currently envisions only a gradual increase in the funds rate over the next couple of years, and there is good reason to think that even once policy normalizes, interest rates may be a good deal lower than they were in the past. Today I will discuss the rationale behind this “lower-for-longer” interest rate scenario. I’ll then turn to some observations about what this scenario may mean for financial institutions’ profitability.\nBefore I continue, though, I’d like to note that the views I’ll be expressing are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.\nElements of Low Interest Rates\nLet’s start with a thought experiment. Think about a world in which the economy is at full employment; output is growing along its long-run trend path; and inflation and inflationary expectations are well anchored at the central bank’s inflation target, which is 2 percent in the U.S. 2 This is also the inflation target in most other advanced economies. Economists call the real interest rate consistent with this economic environment, subtracting out the inflation target, the “equilibrium real rate of interest.” 3 What determines this rate? A crucial element is long-run trend output growth. The greater this growth rate, the greater the real returns are to business and household capital investment — and the greater the returns are to the financial instruments funding that investment, which, of course, includes bank lending. These higher returns then imply a higher equilibrium real interest rate. The saving preferences of households and businesses also influence this rate. The more they want to save (for instance, either for retirement purposes or as a precautionary buffer), the greater the supply of loanable funds and the lower the equilibrium real interest rate.\n\nNote that I didn’t mention monetary policy as a primary element in determining the equilibrium real rate. This is because the effects of monetary policy on the long-run growth potential of the economy or the saving preferences of economic players are small and indirect. True, the Fed would still be setting the federal funds rate in this hypothetical situation, but with the economy at full employment and inflation at target, the Fed’s job simply would be to guide the target fed funds rate to the equilibrium determined by these nonmonetary factors.\n\nNow, monetary policy does have a direct influence on the equilibrium nominal interest rate, which is the sum of the equilibrium real rate and expected inflation. This influence depends on the central bank’s choice of an inflation target and its success at achieving that target over time. As long as the public believes that policy authorities are committed to symmetrically achieving that target, expected inflation should equal the central bank’s inflation objective over the long run.\n\nA lot is made of the Federal Reserve’s role in engineering today’s low nominal interest rate environment. Certainly, following the Great Recession, in order to provide the accommodation necessary to get economic activity back up to its long-run potential and bring inflation back up to target, the FOMC has attempted to steer interest rates below their equilibrium levels. However, to a great degree, the current low levels of nominal interest rates likely also reflect changes in the equilibrium real rate of interest that are largely beyond the scope of monetary policy. And, importantly, the factors weighing on equilibrium real rates could be quite persistent, meaning that low real and (given our 2 percent inflation target) nominal interest rates could be with us for some time — even after policy rates return to a neutral setting.\nPersistence of Low Rates\nWhy do I think the equilibrium real rate may be lower than before the financial crisis? I begin with the observation that the average annual pace of growth over the recovery has been about 2 percent. By comparison, over the previous three expansions, real gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged closer to an annual rate of 3-1/2 percent. The weak recent pace certainly makes one sit back and take notice. What’s going on? Well, in part, the disappointing growth, particularly early in the recovery, reflects the severe disruptions to market functioning caused by the financial crisis. But something even more long-lasting appears to be going on as well.\n\nFirst and foremost is the possibility that there has been a reduction in the long-run trend in economic growth. There are a number of reasons underlying this slowdown. Demographics are playing an essential role. In the U.S., growth in the workforce is slowing because of both the movement of the baby-boom cohort into retirement age and lower labor force participation rates, particularly among the youth. Also, a plateauing in educational achievement and the retirement of highly experienced workers mean that improvements in the quality of the workforce are already contributing less to productivity growth than they have in the past.\n\nAnother key element of productivity growth is something economists call “total factor productivity,” or TFP for short. This refers to the technologies and operational systems that businesses use to combine various inputs into outputs. 4 The recent trends relating to TFP have not been good. John Fernald at the San Francisco Fed and his co-authors 5 estimate that the current trend in TFP growth is only about one-half of 1 percent; that compares unfavorably with the trend TFP growth rate of 1-3/4 percent during the heady days of the productivity surge that lasted from the mid-1990s through the mid-2000s. Therefore, according to these estimates, just from TFP alone, overall productivity growth in the U.S. economy today is more than 1 percentage point lower than it was during that high-growth period.\n\nSome economists, such as Robert Gordon at Northwestern University, 6think this slowdown is possibly here to stay. They argue that we have already picked the low overhanging fruit, so future transformative technologies will be increasingly more difficult to harvest. Others disagree, pointing to the huge productivity advances we’ve seen in medicine and energy production. Such innovations may indeed be “transformative,” but their effects have yet to make their way through the pipeline to show up as measurable increases in total factor productivity. We’ll have to wait and see. But at this point, many are assuming that modest TFP growth will be with us for years to come.\n\nProductivity and potential output growth are also influenced by the quantity and quality of the capital stock that workers employ in the production of goods and services. Business investment in structures, equipment and intellectual property declined sharply during the Great Recession, and has grown only modestly during the recovery. This has left the level of capital spending quite low, and increases in capital per worker — what economists call “capital deepening” — have been weak. This reduced pace of capital formation translates directly into lower growth in potential output.\n\nSluggish capital spending may in part reflect low expectations for growth over the longer run. I often hear this from business executives. They feel their firms’ productive capacity is about right-sized to the current level of demand and their modest baseline expectations for growth in sales. Many of you who work at banks or supervise them may have heard similar sentiments from your community lending base.\n\nThere are other factors that will likely keep market interest rates low for quite a while in the U.S. and other advanced economies. High on this list is the enormous worldwide demand for safe assets. In their well-known “conundrum” and “global savings glut” speeches, former Fed chairs Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke both pointed to such growing demand as an important factor reducing interest rates on long-term safe assets in the U.S. 7 Greenspan’s “conundrum” commentary explicitly cited these demands as leading to a flattening of the Treasury yield curve.\nFor all these reasons, the outlook for interest rates is vastly more complicated today than it was before. Most analysts have come to expect that both short-run money rates and longer-term interest rates will be lower over the long run than they had expected just a few years ago.As of March 2010, the Blue Chip consensus — an average of about 50 private sector economic forecasters — expected the three-month Treasury rate would average 4-1/4 percent over the long run. As of March 2016, that number was just 3 percent. Over the same time period, the outlook for long-term interest rates had come down as well (falling by over 1-1/2 percentage points 8 In addition, as reported in the FOMC’s most recent Summary of Economic Projections, or SEPs, the Fed’s median long-run fed funds projection has fallen to about 3 percent. 9\n\nCurrently, at 25 to 50 basis points, the target range for the federal funds rate appears to be quite low. However, to accurately gauge the stance of monetary policy, you must compare policy rates relative to their equilibrium level 10 — not against some simple historical norm. In general, a lower equilibrium interest rate means that monetary policy is not as accommodative as it otherwise might seem. On top of that, because the economy faces a variety of headwinds, the equilibrium federal funds rate today likely is even lower than its eventual long-run level. These observations strongly suggest that U.S. policy today is less expansionary than what is often calibrated from simple monetary policy rules or other historical comparisons you might read about in the press. And this, in turn, means that the risk of overshooting our 2 percent inflation objective is lower — and the likelihood that we actually get to 2 percent is smaller — than what these comparisons would imply.\nImpact on the Banking Sector\nWhy do I bring all of this up to you today? Well, if this analysis holds, community banks are going to have to adjust to a new normal with regard to how interest rates enter their business models.\nSuch challenges are not new to people in this room. Since the Great Recession, banks have maintained their profitability by aggressively cutting rates paid on deposits and by enforcing interest rate floors on floating rate loans. In the end, the median net interest margin (NIM) for community banks moved down only about 40 basis points between mid-2007 and late last year, whereas the target federal funds rate fell over 500 basis points over that same period. 11\nNevertheless, headwinds still exist for banks, particularly for community banks. Deposit pricing for banks appears to have hit its lower bound in 2015. 12 Given deposits make up such a large portion of community banks’ liability profiles and, hence, their funding costs, community bankers are likely going to have to focus more on the asset side of the balance sheet in order to maintain their institutions’ performance levels.\nI’d now like to discuss two general approaches to addressing low interest rates that appear to be emerging among financial services firms. As I see it, the first approach recognizes the need to adopt sound business practices for operating in a world in which interest rates will most likely be low for a long time. The second one involves altering strategies and standards — sometimes in a less prudent fashion — out of impatience with the low interest rate environment.\nHere is an example of the first approach. I recently had a meeting with a number of executives from the life insurance industry, whose business models rely on investing funds to cover anticipated long-term liabilities. They talked about the challenges posed by the low interest rate environment to their business models and their bottom lines. But they also discussed how they and other real money investors — such as investment managers for pension funds — are reassessing the yield curve environment. They are increasingly coming around to the view that persistently slow output growth in the U.S. and abroad may keep real interest rates low for a long time — longer than they likely thought one, two or certainly three years ago. As a result, these long-horizon investors are developing strategies to manage their business operations based, at least in part, on the low yields that are currently achievable on longer-term fixed-income instruments.\nWhat strategies have community banks used? Most have extended loan tenures. The weighted average maturity of loans originated by community banks has been rising at a pace above that of loans originated by bigger banks in recent years. 13 Holding longer-term assets and short-term liabilities is the classic carry trade that has historically been the bedrock of community bank profitability. The ability to act as an intermediary between the public’s need for longer-term project financing and its desire for short-term investment vehicles is essential to the business model of community banks. However, we all know the interest rate risk exposure inherent in this structure.\nNow, in addition to extending loan duration, many financial institutions — and community banks are certainly among them — have decided to adopt alternative strategies in an effort to improve earnings (what I’ve referred to as the second approach). Such strategies may involve starting new business lines, emphasizing fee-based products and services or, of course, loosening credit underwriting. When thoughtfully conceived, some of these strategies can be prudent adjustments to address thinning profitability in commoditized sectors. But when financial institutions increase their risk-taking without a proper roadmap or appreciation of their potential exposures, they are “reaching for yield” in a perilous fashion.\nSo, are the lengthening of loan duration and the implementation of alternative business strategies at community banks today being done in a prudent manner? Or are they instead posing an undue level of interest rate and credit risk on banks’ books?\nTo help answer these questions, I would highlight the importance of gauging risk tolerance and testing deposit sensitivity in relation to changes in the interest rate environment. A lower-for-longer interest rate environment does not absolve firms of interest rate risk management; nor does it mean we have eliminated uncertainty over future rates or other factors influencing current credit conditions. In recognition of this uncertainty, bankers should continue to simulate their firms’ earnings and equity performance under different interest rate scenarios as part of their ongoing risk management. These exercises are valuable in helping institutions understand the impact of interest rate changes and other economic developments on their overall performance over both the short and long run.\nLet us focus on deposits for a moment. Some of the key assumptions during these exercises surround deposits — specifically, estimating both their duration and the interest rate the bank would be willing to offer to attract them. Deposit volumes in the banking system are at an all-time high 14 even as deposit pricing, as I mentioned earlier, appears to have reached its lower bound last year. Just think about that for a moment. The financial system has more deposit funding than it has ever seen, and it has attracted that funding at a very minimal price. So a risk manager needs to consider whether or not customers will continue to provide such cheap funding.\nBecause deposits represent such a large portion of a community bank’s liabilities, assumptions about the duration and costs of deposits are fundamental to the modeling exercises. A prudent institution will make reasonable baseline assumptions and also recognize the uncertainty surrounding those assumptions. The possible range of outcomes from such sensitivity tests can be extremely valuable to a firm’s board of directors as they set the overall tolerance of how far a firm is willing to lengthen its asset duration or make other changes to its business practices.\nNow, what other strategies are we seeing in the field? Well, in my District located in the upper Midwest, we have seen some examples of what could be labeled as less well-thought-out “reaching for yield.” And conversely, we have also seen numerous examples of community banks making prudent, thoughtful changes to their strategic plans. I’d like to round out my comments with a pair of composite sketches that illustrate both types of behaviors.\nLet’s say there’s a rural community bank that had throughout the recovery maintained a policy of avoiding longer-term fixed-rate loans, given forecasts for rising interest rates in the not too distant future. (Is this sounding familiar?) This community bank held fast to this standard even after it lost some longtime customers to nearby competitors who were willing to offer fixed rates on commercial loans for ten years or even longer. Still, after years of weak earnings, the community bank’s shareholders and executives were both getting restless. So this year the bank began issuing commercial real estate (CRE) and commercial and industrial (C&I) loans for terms matching or exceeding its competitors’. And the resulting new loan volume pulled in by the bank has indeed begun to boost its net interest margin. The bank is finding a lot of growth in these particular sectors after just a few months. However, even as this bank boosts its short-term profits, its lack of prudent planning and risk analysis could lead to difficulties if credit conditions were to change.\nOK, so let’s consider a better alternative. Suppose there’s a community bank with identical business lines as the previous one I discussed. It too stayed disciplined throughout the recovery. And similarly, its board and management were getting restless after years of low yields. So at a recent board meeting, they made changes to the bank’s strategic plan and decided to loosen its underwriting policies to offer longer-term fixed-rate loans for established CRE projects, for which there has been steady demand in the bank’s local markets. However, its board set a conservative lending limit to control the bank’s total exposure to the new longer-term fixed-rate loans, and mandated regular reviews of its credit concentration risk, along with liquidity targets to maintain, as it funded this activity. In addition, the bank also began running broader interest rate simulations to inform its board of the interest rate risks associated with this strategy.\nCompared to the first example, this second example provides a sensible roadmap for how to address the challenges posed by a lower-for-longer interest rate environment.\nNote that these illustrations are rather simplistic. In reality, both the bankers and the supervisors in this room could fill in the many complexities that make it difficult to evaluate the underlying risks and trade-offs in these new strategies. Such complexities present challenges both to bankers who are balancing risk-taking with the appropriate controls and to supervisors who are evaluating the adequacy of how bankers have struck that balance. These are hard jobs, but necessary ones.\nConclusion\nTo conclude, I feel we will likely be in a low interest rate environment for some time, which leaves monetary policymakers with less room to navigate future downside shocks should they occur. This is one reason that monetary policy is expected to normalize at a very gradual pace. And even once it has normalized, the new equilibrium likely will be one with lower interest rates than we have experienced in the past.\nThis environment has been and will continue to be a challenging one for community banking performance. Deposit behavior is a particularly important topic to be further explored by academics and policymakers. I’m also interested in how this lower-for-longer scenario plays into the discussion about community banking performance at this afternoon’s research session on profitability and bank size. It is important for banks, particularly community banks, to carefully plan for the lower-for-longer rate environment and to think hard about its impact on both current and long-term earnings. And it also is critical for banks to recognize — and supervisors to evaluate — the potential effects of alternative strategies on the baseline path. Finally, it is crucial that banks have appropriate controls in place to address the associated risks to their balance sheets.\nNotes\n1 A yield curve is the line plotting the yields or interest rates of assets of the same credit quality but with differing maturity dates at a certain point in time. These assets, such as U.S. Treasury securities, typically yield incrementally more at longer maturities.\n2 This was first acknowledged in Federal Open Market Committee (2012).

            "content": "In the late 1990s, Paul Krugman analyzed the Japanese economy’s early experience with deflationary forces, and concluded that the Bank of Japan should provide extraordinary amounts of monetary accommodation in order to push inflation several percentage points above its perceived inflation objective.\nKrugman’s policy prescription was bold, but it was a straightforward and sensible consequence of his mainstream analysis.\nA bit unfortunately, his clever rhetoric describing the optimal policy response was distracting: He described it as the central bank “credibly promis[ing] to be irresponsible.”1 I suspect this characterization didn’t sit well with many monetary policy analysts.\nWhy do I bring this up now? Well, several years ago, Larry Summers described the global economic environment of low growth and low interest rates. He speculated that we were likely experiencing what he dubbed “secular stagnation.”2\nMany critics have maligned Summers’ perceptive analysis because of this provocative terminology. Secular stagnation calls to mind a permanently lower state of growth and decay into the indefinite future. Why should we think the world has permanently fallen into such a rut?\nWell, similar to Krugman’s analysis about Japan, Summers’ analysis is standing the test of time. Today, the world economy is still in a low-growth, low-market-interest-rate regime. And more and more economists see the essential characteristics of this state as likely persisting for some time to come, as shown in their analytical perspectives and baseline forecasts.\nAs a mainstream, time-series oriented macroeconomic researcher, I know all of the baggage that comes with terms like “secular” and “permanent.”\nBut I don’t think we should get hung up over technical details related to I(0) vs. I(1) behavior.\nWhether the current weakness is a permanent new regime or a very persistent deviation from the norm is not the point.\nThe task of identifying changes in fundamentals and the persistence of those changes is indeed formidable.\nRemember back to the late 1990s. Quite some time was required before the productivity surge was commonly recognized as something sufficiently long-lasting to be incorporated into baseline economic projections.\nOK? And now think how difficult it has been recently to digest the persistence in the decline in productivity that has occurred since the mid-2000s.\nBut whether we are talking about I(0) or I(1) processes here isn’t key; stationary but highly persistent behavior is enough to make the stagnation hypothesis a serious issue for analysts and policymakers.\nAnd more and more do seem to be taking this persistence on board. Many economic forecasters have notably downgraded their estimates of long-run growth over the past several years.\nFor example, between March 2010 and March 2016 the Blue Chip consensus forecast for long-run gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the U.S. fell half a percentage point, from 2.6 to 2.1 percent.\nClearly, mainstream analysts think something fundamental is going on.\nBy now, we should all be aware of the factors contributing to lower long-run growth.\nDemographics are playing an essential role. In the U.S., growth in the workforce is slowing due to both the movement of the baby-boom cohort into retirement age and lower labor force participation rates, particularly among the youth. Also, a plateauing in educational achievement and the retirement of highly experienced workers mean that improvements in the quality of the work force are already contributing less to productivity growth than they have in the past.\nFurthermore, the underlying trends in total factor productivity (TFP) growth do not look good. John Fernald at the San Francisco Fed and his co-authors estimate that the current trend in TFP growth is about one-half of 1 percent; that compares with 1-3/4 percent during the heady days of the mid-1990s productivity surge.3\nSome economists, such as Robert Gordon at Northwestern, think this slowdown is possibly here to stay.4 They argue that we have already picked the low overhanging fruit, so future transformative technologies will be increasingly more difficult to harvest.\nOthers disagree, pointing to the huge productivity advances we’ve seen in medicine and energy production. Such innovations may indeed be “transformative,” but have yet to make their way through the pipeline to show up as measurable increases in factor productivity.\nWe’ll have to wait and see. But at least at this point, many are assuming modest TFP growth trends for years to come.\nProductivity and potential output growth are also influenced by the quantity and quality of the capital stock that workers employ in the production of goods and services.\nBusiness investment in structures, equipment and intellectual property declined sharply during the recession, and has grown only modestly during the recovery. This has left the level of capital spending quite low, and capital deepening has been weak.\nThis reduced pace of capital formation translates directly into lower growth in potential output.\nI would note that one persistent theme I hear from business executives is that they feel their productive capacity is about right-sized to the current level of demand and their modest baseline expectations for growth in sales. So the sluggish capital spending may itself in large part reflect low expectations for growth over the longer run.\nIn addition to the supply-side factors that I have noted, the secular stagnation argument also typically envisions insufficient aggregate demand support from fiscal and monetary policy.\nThat is, with weak supply-side factors, low inflation, and little appetite for fiscal expansion, negative demand shocks of all varieties are more likely to bring economies to the effective lower bound on interest rates. And at this bound, monetary policy is less efficient at mitigating headwinds and boosting activity.\nThis setting has strong implications for interest rates and monetary policy. All else being equal, weaker long-run growth fundamentals imply lower equilibrium real interest rates over the longer run. This is a straightforward implication of our standard macroeconomic models.\nThere are other factors that will likely keep market interest rates low for quite a while in the U.S. and other advanced economies as well.\nHigh on this list is the enormous worldwide demand for safe assets.\nEven before Summers raised the specter of “secular stagnation,” former Fed chairs Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke pointed to such growing demand as an important factor in their well-known “conundrum” and “global savings glut” speeches.\nGreenspan’s conundrum commentary explicitly cited these demands as leading to a flattening of the Treasury yield curve.5\nFor all of these reasons, the outlook for interest rates is vastly more complicated today. Most analysts have come to expect that both short-run rates that are directly tied to monetary policy and longer-term interest rates will be lower over the long run than they had expected just a few years ago.\nWith regard to short-term rates, I note that:\nIn March 2010 the Blue Chip consensus thought the three-month Treasury rate would average 4-1/4 percent over the long run; last March, that number was just 3 percent.\nSimilarly, in the Fed’s most recent Summary of Economic Projections, or SEPs, the median long-run fed funds rate projection was down to 3 percent.6\nWe have also have seen meaningful declines in long-term expectations for future short-term rates from a number of econometric term structure models.\nBeyond just economists’ consensus forecasts, I have recently heard more commentary that the lower-for-longer interest rate scenario is being built into business plans.\nI recently had a meeting with a number of executives from the life insurance industry, whose business models rely on investing funds to cover anticipated long-term liabilities.\nThey talked about how they and other real money investors — such as pension funds — are reassessing the yield-curve environment and increasingly coming to the view that persistently slow output growth in the U.S. and abroad may keep real interest rates low for a long period of time; longer than they likely thought one, two or certainly three years ago.\nAs a result, these long-horizon investors are developing strategies to manage their business operations based, in part, on the yields that are currently achievable on longer-term safe fixed-income instruments.\nI have also heard complementary reports from those on the other side of the market. In particular, issuers of high-quality corporate debt are finding markets receptive to their offerings, and new issues are routinely being oversubscribed.\nLet me be very clear on why this is important. This comes back to the “secular” component of secular stagnation.\nWe often hear of rates on long-term safe assets being reduced by a temporary flight to quality — that is, by investors running away from riskier investments until the threats recede.\nAnd many asset-pricing models estimate that temporary declines in term premia — as opposed to outright permanent declines in expected real rates — have been a major contributor to low long-term interest rates.\nAs a technical matter, these models’ conclusions often turn importantly on an I(0) stationarity modeling assumption for the level factor. Along with other assumptions, this stationarity does not more robustly allow for secular changes in rates.\nThe commentary from the life insurance executives and others I just referred to is different. Their business decisions suggest that an important part of the decline in long-term market rates reflects expectations of lower short-term interest rates over the long run. This is quite different from attributing nearly all of it to transitory movements in difficult-to-explain term premia.\nNow, how does this all inform my assessment of the degree of accommodation that U.S. monetary policy is currently providing?\nIn general, a lower equilibrium long-term rate means that current monetary policy is not as accommodative as it might seem by historical standards.\nOn top of that, the view among many Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants is that today the neutral federal funds rate is even lower than its eventual long-run level, implying an even further adjustment to the degree of accommodation in the current stance of policy.\nThese observations strongly suggest that U.S. policy today is less expansionary than what is often calibrated from simple monetary policy rules. These simple rules embed an intercept — which is an average real rate — that is higher than what we are envisioning today. Accordingly, the risk now of overshooting our 2 percent inflation objective is lower — and the likelihood that we actually get to 2 percent is smaller — than what these rules would imply.\nThese observations primarily have first-moment, mean implications for the path of interest rates. But the long-duration investors’ comments also help inform questions about future volatility in long-term interest rates.\nFor example, some worry that if the FOMC gets behind the curve and has to raise the funds rate moderately faster than, say, what is in the Fed’s most recent SEPs, fixed-income markets will be spooked and we’ll see a spike in long-term interest rates that could be detrimental both to growth and to financial stability.\nPresumably, these analysts think that a steady pace of fed funds increases would reduce this “spike risk.”\nNormally, the risks of large spikes in long-term rates are probably intensified by fast-money investors (hedge funds and the like) making carry trade bets on low-term premia. These investors have an eye toward a quick exit when rates begin to rise — behavior that can snowball into something like the taper tantrum we saw in 2013 when long-term rates spiked 100 basis points in response to a sudden change in expectations for the path of Fed asset purchases.\nInstead, today I have been talking about the positions of real-money, long-horizon investors. Given their expectations of low-for-long policy rates, they are less likely to think that some unexpected tightening will lead to substantially higher rates over the long term. Rather, such a tightening would likely be seen as simply flattening the yield curve.\nPut differently, long-run expectations for policy rates provide an anchor to long-run interest rates. So lower policy rate expectations act as a restraint on how much long-term rates could rise following a surprise over the near-term policy path.\nFinally, if inflation or term premium risks rose substantially, the alternative funds rate path for funds rate increases that might accompany a tighter-than-expected policy is still likely to be quite gradual.\nIn the June SEPs, the median funds rate path envisioned two more 25 basis point rate increases in 2016 followed by three more — totaling 75 basis points a year — in 2017 and again in 2018.\nDuring the normalization of policy between 2004 and 2006, the FOMC increased the funds rate 25 basis points at every meeting — a pace of eight increases, for a total of 200 basis points, a year.\nNo one discusses that 2004–06 pace of tightening as anything but gradual — it was certainly not steep enough to generate financial stability concerns.\nAnd while there are important differences in the environment today, this example does lead one to believe that, if necessary, we could normalize policy much faster than currently envisioned and still keep the pace gradual enough to avoid a disorderly change in financial conditions.\nTo conclude, let me say:\nThere are many challenges for monetary economists in judging long-run growth prospects and discerning what they mean for financial conditions and the implementation of monetary policy.\nI see good arguments for believing that we are in for a protracted period of low equilibrium real interest rates. I also think many long-term investors are taking this view as well.\nWe still need to remain on guard for market vulnerabilities in case this analysis is wrong. But the scenario I’ve outlined today suggests fewer financial stability concerns than if low long-term interest rates were being driven solely by unusual declines in term premia that could leave markets more exposed to sharp swings in risk sentiment or speculative unwinding of carry trades.\nStill, the low-growth, low-interest-rate world we find ourselves in today is a difficult situation.\nWhether we call this secular stagnation or simply a persistent period of low market interest rates is not the point. Both interpretations present strong challenges for policymakers.\nAddressing downside shocks near the zero lower bound is much, much harder than if we had a comfortable buffer against the equilibrium real rate. And we must stay attuned to the difficulties in delivering additional monetary policy accommodation if the need ever arises before this environment changes.\nNotes\n1 Krugman (1998).\n2 Summers (2014).\n3 Byrne, Fernald and Reinsdorf (2016).\n4 Gordon (2012).\n5 Greenspan (2005) and Bernanke (2005).\n6 Federal Open Market Committee (2016).\n\nReferences\nBernanke, Ben, 2005, “The global saving glut and the U.S. current account deficit,” remarks of Federal Reserve Governor at the Sandridge Lecture, Virginia Association of Economists, Richmond, VA, March 10.\n\nByrne, David M., John G.

            "content": "Introduction\nGood morning and thank you. It is a pleasure to be here.\n\nToday, I would like to briefly give you my outlook for the U.S. economy before discussing some long-term economic trends and my views of appropriate monetary policy. Let me note that my comments will reflect my own views and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI will start my remarks with a discussion of my relatively optimistic outlook for the U.S. economy. I’ll then talk about some underlying structural trends that imply that both growth and real interest rates in the U.S. will likely be lower in the long run than we thought they would be just a couple of years ago. I’ll finish with my views of appropriate monetary policy in the U.S.\n\nLet me now turn to my outlook for the U.S. economy.\nU.S. Economic Outlook\nI anticipate U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) will grow in the range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent over the remainder of this year. After the sluggish first-quarter annualized growth rate of 0.8 percent is accounted for, this would leave the increase in GDP for 2016 as a whole close to 2 percent — or about the same pace as in 2015.\n\nThe U.S. consumer is the linchpin behind this relatively optimistic outlook. True, consumer spending was somewhat soft last winter, but it rebounded quite a bit in April and what little data we have for May were positive. The most important factor supporting household spending is the substantially improved labor market in the U.S. Over the past two years, the unemployment rate has fallen to 5 percent, half its 2009 peak; and job growth has averaged 233,000 per month. These gains have raised incomes and buoyed confidence over future job prospects. Lower energy prices and accommodative monetary policy have provided additional support to the spending wherewithal of households. All of these factors should continue to generate solid increases in consumer spending — particularly given my assumption that interest rates will stay quite low for some time.\n\nThere are, however, several factors weighing on economic activity in the U.S. The slowdown in global economic growth — notably in emerging market economies — and uncertainty about international prospects have contributed to a rising dollar and declining commodity prices since mid-2014. The trade-weighted dollar has appreciated about 20 percent since June 2014, while oil prices are down more than 50 percent over the same period. U.S. firms that sell their products in global markets and those exposed to commodity markets have felt the brunt of these relative price movements. All told, net exports have made noticeable negative contributions to U.S. growth in the past two years.\n\nUncertainties over foreign prospects also have at times contributed to heightened volatility and some elevation in risk premia in U.S. financial markets. The associated tightening in credit conditions have weighed on domestic spending. Notably, in addition to falling energy prices and the rising dollar, tighter U.S. financial conditions probably contributed to especially weak business capital expenditures in late 2015 and early 2016.\n\nSince last winter financial markets have calmed down and credit spreads have retreated; oil prices have stabilized; and the dollar has depreciated a bit. Of course, we need to keep in mind that to some degree this welcome reduction in headwinds was influenced by monetary policy communications — a point I will return to later this morning.\n\nAdding things up, I see growth in the U.S. recovering from the tepid first quarter and increasing in the range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent for the remainder of 2016 and in 2017. For reference, this pace is modestly stronger than my assessment of the underlying growth trend and should therefore support continued reduction in labor market slack.\n\nI should note, though, that I see the balance of risks to this outlook as weighted to the downside. True, the solid labor market and continued low energy prices could lead to stronger household spending than expected — with attendant spillovers to other components of domestic demand. But the downside risks — notably that the international situation could deteriorate more than expected and related movements in the dollar and financial conditions could weigh more heavily on domestic spending — seem more likely to me. Also, I don’t see other sectors of spending picking up the slack if for some reason the U.S. consumer were to falter.\n\nThe U.S. Congress has mandated that the Federal Reserve foster economic conditions with the aim of promoting two economic goals — maximum employment and price stability. As a monetary policymaker, I think it is important to benchmark the economy’s performance relative to these goals. So how are we doing?\n\nAlong with most of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee, I judge that an unemployment rate that averages somewhat under 5 percent over the longer run is consistent with the Federal Reserve’s maximum employment mandate. The current unemployment rate is 5 percent. However, other measures — subdued wage growth being a particularly important one — suggest that some slack remains in the labor market. Let me be clear: We have made tremendous progress. But I’m not completely confident that we have met our employment objective just yet, and probably won’t be until the unemployment rate is modestly below its long-run normal level. Now, given my outlook for growth, I expect the unemployment rate will edge down to between 4-1/2 and 4-3/4 percent by the end of next year. So, I do think the FOMC’s employment objective is within sight.\n\nHow about the inflation objective? Well, the performance on this leg of the dual mandate has not been as good. In January 2012 the FOMC set 2 percent inflation — measured by the annual change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) — as the explicit inflation target consistent with our price stability mandate.1 However, over the past eight years, PCE inflation has averaged only 1.5 percent. To get a sense of where total inflation is likely to be headed over the next year or so, I prefer to strip out the volatile and transitory food and energy components and look at so-called core inflation. Core PCE inflation also has run well below 2 percent for quite a long time. We did see some higher readings on core inflation early this year, but the last couple of monthly numbers were more subdued. Still, on a year-over-year basis, core inflation was 1.6 percent in April; that’s up from the 1.3 percent pace that prevailed through most of last year. I am encouraged by this development, but not satisfied — we still have a way to go before we are back to target.\n\nI am projecting core inflation to end 2016 at 1.6 percent. Further ahead, I see both core and total inflation moving up gradually to approach our 2 percent inflation target within the next three years. This path reflects the dissipating effects on consumer prices of earlier declines in energy prices and the appreciation in the dollar as well as the influence of further improvements in labor markets and growth in economic activity.\n\nHowever, as with growth, I see downside risks to the outlook for inflation. The recent pickup in core inflation could prove to reflect more temporary volatility than I have assumed (we saw this happen in 2012). Or international developments may result in further declines in energy prices or greater appreciation of the dollar. Most worrisome to me is the risk that inflation expectations might drift lower. Here, I find it troubling that the compensation for prospective inflation one can glean from a number of financial asset prices has fallen considerably over the past two years. More recently, some survey-based measures of inflation expectations, which had previously seemed unmovable, edged down to historically low levels. True, financial market inflation compensation and some survey measures of inflation expectations have risen a bit of late, but they still remain quite low.\n\nTo recap, I expect the U.S. economy to grow at a moderate pace over the next couple of years. This growth will be primarily driven by further increases in household spending. I also expect to make additional progress toward our 2 percent inflation target. While I see this path for the U.S. economy as the most likely outcome, there are a number of downside risks to my outlook for both growth and inflation.\n\nBefore discussing the implications of this forecast for my views on appropriate monetary policy, let me put my growth outlook in a longer-run context.\nMy Growth Forecast in Longer-Run Context\nBy historical standards, my forecast of real GDP growth in the range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent might not seem particularly optimistic. It’s in line with the average pace of growth since 2009, which is about 2-1/4 percent. By comparison, over the previous three expansions, real GDP growth averaged closer to an annual rate of 3-1/2 percent. The decline from 3-1/2 percent growth to 2-1/4 percent makes one sit back and take notice. What’s going on? Why has growth in real activity been so subdued in the current expansion?\n\nFor one thing, the financial crisis and the ensuing Great Recession had far-reaching negative effects. You are all too well aware of these scars. With the support of accommodative monetary policy, these impediments to growth have been slowly dissipating. Nonetheless, I think these and other headwinds will take some more time to fade away completely.\n\nIn addition, as I survey the economic landscape, I see other factors that could hold growth back even after these impediments recede. Broadly speaking, an economy’s long-run growth potential depends upon increases in its available productive resources and the technological improvements that enable those resources to produce more. The trend for neither looks particularly favorable.\n\nThe most important productive resource is labor. Here, demographics are working against us. The U.S. Census Bureau projects that over the next ten years the population aged 16 and over will grow perhaps 0.4 percentage point per year slower than it did between 1990 and 2010. And the share of the population participating in the labor force has been trending down since around 2000 after rising steadily for the previous 35 years. Moreover, increases in educational attainment and workforce experience are rising more slowly than in the 1980s and 1990s.2 For all of these reasons, we are likely in the midst of a slowdown in growth of the effective labor input into the aggregate production function for the U.S. This translates directly into slower growth in potential output.3\nEconomic growth over the longer run also depends upon technological progress. By one carefully estimated measure — made by John Fernald at the San Francisco Fed and his co-authors — the underlying trend in total factor productivity (TFP) growth has declined from 1.8 percent during the productivity boom of the mid-1990s through the mid-2000s to a mere half a percent today.4 That is in line with the period of low productivity growth from the 1970s through the mid-1990s. Some economists, such as Robert Gordon (2012) at Northwestern, think that the slowdown in trend productivity growth possibly is here to stay. Gordon argues that the search for transformative technologies that spurred productivity and economic growth in the past has become increasingly costly and more difficult to harvest: We have already picked the low-hanging fruit.\n\nNot everyone subscribes to this view. Rapid advances in the field of medicine and in energy production are two examples of where we have seen huge productivity improvements. It may be that transformative innovations are being created today, but have yet to make their way through the pipeline to show up as measurable increases in factor productivity. We’ll have to wait and see.\n\nProductivity and potential output growth are also influenced by the amount and quality of the capital that workers use in the production of goods and services. Since the recession ended, business investment in structures, equipment and intellectual property has grown somewhat more slowly than in other recent expansions. And when you consider that this comes on the heels of huge declines in investment during the Great Recession, the level of spending and the associated growth rate in the productive capital stock per worker — what we refer to as capital deepening — are very low. This reduced pace of capital formation also translates into lower growth in potential output.\n\nWith low interest rates and plenty of cash on hand, firms might be expected to invest more. Instead, businesses are opting to restructure debt or return money to shareholders by issuing dividends or buying back stock. What is going on here?\n\nIn my position I have an opportunity to speak to a broad cross section of business executives and learn firsthand about the issues they face. Of course, it’s difficult to generalize, but one persistent theme I hear is that firms feel their productive capacity is about right-sized to the current level of demand and their modest baseline expectations for growth in sales. Another common theme is that businesses are very attentive to what could go wrong with their plans. The greater weight they put on costly downside scenarios, the more reluctant they will be to commit funding to a long-run capital expansion project. Of course, businesses are also going to be less enthusiastic to spend if technological advancement truly has slowed so that new capital won’t be all that more productive than current capacity.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the slowdown in productivity growth is temporary or long lasting. That said, the notion that longer-run potential growth is slowing is a view that has been gaining traction. This assessment is reflected to some degree in the economic projections of FOMC participants. In January 2012, FOMC participants assessed the long-run potential growth rate of the economy to be around 2-1/2 percent.5 Today, the median FOMC participant believes that longer-run real GDP growth is only 2 percent. Even the most optimistic of my colleagues places this number at around 2.4 percent.6\nWhen measured against these benchmarks, my forecast of real GDP growth in the range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent in 2016 is simply saying that the economy will expand a bit faster than its longer-run productive capabilities. This number may be disappointing — we would certainly like stronger sustainable growth — but there is nothing much that monetary policy can do about labor force trends or technical progress. Still, these are structural conditions the FOMC must recognize when setting monetary policy.\nLower Potential Growth, Lower Equilibrium Interest Rates\nAll else being equal, equilibrium real interest rates, which are the rates consistent with fully employed resources, will be lower in an economy with slower potential output growth. In turn, lower real rates imply lower nominal rates when inflation is at its target. So, the equilibrium federal funds rate — which is the funds rate associated with a neutral monetary policy (policy that is neither expansionary nor contractionary) — is lower in an economy with lower potential output growth. Therefore, the FOMC must take estimates of potential output growth into account when calibrating the stance of monetary policy.\n\nThere are other reasons why equilibrium interest rates could be lower than they were in the past. For example, former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke has frequently discussed the global savings glut. This refers to the large pools of saving being generated by fast-growing emerging market economies that are seeking safe, profitable opportunities for investment. Not being able to find these in their domestic markets, many investors in such economies are moving funds across their borders, lowering interest rates across the globe. Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers has expanded on this theme, speculating that the lack of investment opportunities reflects in part soft worldwide aggregate demand, which has discouraged structural investment and capital stock growth (his view of the “secular stagnation” hypothesis).\n\nAll of these factors imply that the federal funds rate consistent with a neutral stance for monetary policy may be lower than we used to think. How big might the difference be? Well, in March, FOMC participants’ projections for the longer-run nominal federal funds rate were in the range of 3 to 4 percent, with the median projection at 3-1/4 percent.7 Four years ago, when forecasts of potential growth were higher, the Committee was projecting the longer-run fed funds rate would be in the range of 3-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent — about 50 basis points higher than today’s estimates.8 In other words, even after policy has normalized, the federal funds rate will likely end up at a lower level than it has averaged in the past.\nWhat Is Next for Monetary Policy?\nI’d now like to talk about what the transition path to that new level might look like.\n\nAn important element in Federal Reserve communications is our well-known FOMC dot chart. Quarterly, each of the 17 FOMC participants submits his or her projections of key economic variables, along with assumptions for the appropriate monetary policy path that underlies those forecasts.9 These are published in what is known as the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP. The dot chart is found in the SEP; each dot shows a participant’s view of the appropriate target federal funds rate at the end of each of the next three years and in the longer run.\nThe chart I am showing today reflects our views as of last March’s FOMC meeting. The next dot chart will be published after our upcoming meeting on June 14 and 15.\nFocus for a moment on the median of the policy projections, indicated by the red dots. In March, the median participant thought two rate hikes would be appropriate over the remainder of this year. The median FOMC participant foresaw an additional 100 basis points or so of tightening in 2017 and again in 2018. By historical standards, this is a very gradual path. It is even slower than the so-called measured pace of increases over the 2004–06 tightening cycle — that was 25 basis points per meeting, or 200 basis points a year.\n\nOne reason for this slow adjustment is the view among many participants that the neutral level of the federal funds rate today is even lower than its eventual long-run level that I just discussed. Indeed, by some estimates, given the variety of headwinds faced by the U.S. economy, the equilibrium inflation-adjusted rate is currently near zero. The degree of accommodation in actual policy needs to be judged against this benchmark. So the 75 to 100 basis point range for the nominal fed funds rate at the end of 2016 in the median SEP forecast may not be terribly far from neutral.10 The equilibrium real rate should rise gradually as the headwinds fade over time. And as it does, the benchmark to judge policy accommodation will also rise. But this is likely to be a slow adjustment — even in 2018, the dots aren’t back up to their long-run range, even though the SEP forecasts for unemployment are generally lower than their long-run levels and inflation is projected to be at its 2 percent target.\n\nI now want to spend some time talking about the dispersion in the SEP dots. As you can see, nine participants agreed with the median forecast of two rate increases in 2016. This is a strong consensus.\n\nStill, seven FOMC participants thought the federal funds rate at the end of this year should be higher than the median. As Fed speakers began talking after our April meeting, some news accounts suggested there had been a significant shift in Fed sentiment, as the commentary covering these speakers emphasized arguments for more aggressive tightening than that represented by the median. If you find this confusing, I have a simple piece of advice: Before you infer that the consensus has shifted so quickly, count to seven first!\n\nClearly, each individual’s policy view depends on his or her baseline forecast and perception of risks to that outlook. Naturally, these forecasts and risks will differ among participants. This is a feature of a healthy policy debate.\n\nSome analysts complain that the dispersion of dots clouds the Fed’s policy message, and some advocate eliminating the dot chart entirely. I disagree. The dots put on full display our robust policy discussions and differences of opinion. This adds value: Since policy assumptions are so critical for economic projections, omitting the dots would be pulling down a curtain to remove from view participants’ broad judgments relating to the range of issues surrounding our policy deliberations. Instead, our transparency conveys important information to the public.\n\nThe individual SEP projections are without attribution, so there are many untold stories behind the dots. But an individual’s public discourse often provides a good idea of that particular FOMC participant’s policy rationale. There is also useful information in the portion of the FOMC minutes describing the SEP, including discussion that goes some way toward connecting the dots. So while not perfect, the SEP dot chart and associated commentary provide very useful indications of the range of potential FOMC policy actions. And, in the end, the actual FOMC policy decision reflects a consensus-building process among these different views. Once made, this consensus is clearly communicated in the post-meeting statement, the Chair’s press conference, meeting minutes and speeches by Federal Reserve officials. These tell you where the weight of the Committee stands.\n\nAs I mentioned, the chart I’m showing you is from March. The next one will come out after our FOMC meeting two weeks from now. I can’t tell you what that dot chart will look like — the information we’ve received since March could change some participants’ forecasts and risk assessments in a way that will change their views of appropriate policy. But I can talk about how I am thinking about the process. And, frankly, I’m really of two minds at the moment, and I expect to take this quandary with me into the next FOMC meeting.\n\nOn the one hand, under the Committee’s current approach to renormalizing policy, I think it may be appropriate to have two 25 basis point moves between now and the end of the year. I see the value in making small and gradual adjustments to the fed funds rate as the data improve and confirm my positive baseline outlook for the U.S. And this is my base-case view of appropriate policy. On the other hand, if I think outside of the baseline, I also think that a reasonable case can be made for holding off increasing the funds rate until core inflation actually gets to 2 percent on a sustainable basis.\n\nLet me explain my thinking behind these two views.\n\nFirst, let me give the rationale behind supporting two rate hikes this year. As I noted earlier, I see growth picking back up to the 2 to 2-1/2 percent range for the rest of this year and next and inflation gradually returning to target. This is essentially the forecast I had in March and in April, and it is conditioned on a policy path that is broadly consistent with the median portion of the March SEP dot chart.\n\nThe FOMC began policy renormalization last December because the Committee judged it had sufficient confidence in continued U.S. growth and in inflation rising to 2 percent over the medium term. These were the preconditions we had set for liftoff. But in March, in the face of strong first-quarter headwinds, it seemed appropriate to delay the next move and monitor developments. Since our March meeting, the data have improved, and two rate increases this year could be viewed as just confirming our earlier expectations for a gradual renormalization conditional on a solid economic outlook with confidence in inflation firming.\n\nI see recent data improvements as largely in line with my March baseline economic forecast. Notably, the pullback in risk spreads and market volatility that have occurred since mid-February provide important support to my outlook for growth. I believe not raising rates in March and April and the FOMC’s communication of a more gradual path for the fed funds rate — communicated importantly by the downward shift in the policy dots between the December and March SEPs — contributed significantly to the improvement in financial conditions. So, any move toward more aggressive tightening than two 25 basis point moves in 2016 would risk undoing these positive developments.\n\nI view risk-management issues to be of great importance today. As I noted earlier, I still see the risks as weighted to the downside for both my growth and inflation outlooks. And given that the fed funds rate is still barely above its effective lower bound, policy is much better positioned to counter unexpected strength than to address downside shocks. So I still judge that risk-management arguments continue to favor providing more accommodation than usual to deliver an extra boost to aggregate demand. Such a boost would provide a buffer against possible future downside shocks that might otherwise drive us back to the effective lower bound.\n\nFocusing more on risk management brings me to a second policy option. One can advance risk-management arguments further and come up with a reasonable case for holding off increasing the funds rate for much longer, namely, until core inflation actually gets to 2 percent on a sustainable basis.\n\nThe past several years have been a period of disinflationary pressures around the world. Global monetary policies have responded, albeit with unwelcome delays in some cases. In the U.S., we have experienced an unsatisfactory slow crawl back toward 2 percent inflation. We have a symmetric inflation objective, and we have undershot it for so long that the public’s belief in our commitment to that objective seems under fire — just look at the survey and market measures of long-term inflation expectations. In order to ensure confidence that the U.S. will get to 2 percent inflation, it may be best to hold off raising interest rates until core inflation is actually at 2 percent. The downside inflation risks seem big — losing credibility on the downside would make it all that more difficult to ever reach our inflation target. The upside risks on inflation seem smaller. Currently, financial market bets on core inflation rising above 2-1/2 percent are well out of the money. That’s just half a percentage point above target, and symmetric inflation-targeting central banks will experience inflation deviations of one percentage point (or more) periodically. After all, we have certainly experienced this magnitude deviation on the downside in the U.S., even for core inflation measures. The question is whether such upside risks would increase substantially under a policy of holding the funds rate at its current level until core inflation returned to 2 percent. I just don’t see it. Given the shallow path of market policy expectations today, there is a good argument that inflationary risks would not become serious even under this alternative policy threshold. And when inflation rises above 2 percent, as it inevitably will at some point, the FOMC knows how to respond and will do so to provide the necessary, more restrictive financial conditions to keep inflation near our price stability objective.\n\nSo these are two potential policy options that have some attraction from my perspective. And, of course, I am sure other FOMC participants have additional thoughts, as well as everyone here today. I can’t say I know how our policy deliberations will come out, but I can confidently predict that we will have a healthy discussion of all of the issues! There is a lot to mull over, and I can guarantee my colleagues and I will be preparing hard and thinking deeply about the tough issues facing the Committee today. Let me close with one final prediction: Our robust discussions will be evident in our June dot chart.\n\nThank you.\nNotes\n1 This was first acknowledged in Federal Open Market Committee (2012a); for the most recent statement of our longer-run goals see Federal Open Market Committee (2016b).\n2 Aaronson and Sullivan (2002).\n3 Indeed, Fernald (2014) estimates that contributions to labor productivity from increasing labor quality declined noticeably in the 2003–07 period and, on average, he does not expect any boost to productivity growth from increases in labor quality going forward.\n4 Byrne, Fernald and Reinsdorf (2016).Total factor productivity captures the residual growth in total output of the national economy that cannot be explained by the accumulation of measured inputs, such as labor and capital.\n5 See Federal Open Market Committee (2012b).

            "content": "Introduction\nGood afternoon and thank you. It is a pleasure to be here.\nToday, I would like to briefly give you my outlook for the U.S. economy before discussing some long-term economic trends and my views of appropriate monetary policy. Let me note that my comments will reflect my own views and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System.\nI will start my remarks this afternoon with a forecast for the U.S. economy. My baseline outlook has real gross domestic product (GDP) growing at a moderate 2 to 2-1/2 percent annual rate in 2016 and inflation gradually approaching 2 percent over the next three years. But given the current economic landscape in the U.S. and internationally, I see the risks to both of these projections as weighted to the downside.\nI will next discuss some underlying structural trends that are likely to have important effects on long-term growth prospects and interest rates in the U.S. and around much of the world. By most estimates, growth and real interest rates will be lower in the long run than we thought they would be just a couple of years ago. Monetary policy cannot alter these structural trends. However, they do factor into benchmarking policy neutrality and, hence, have direct implications for monetary policy.\nI’ll finish with my views of appropriate monetary policy in the U.S. You will see how these views are shaped by the structural trend benchmarks, the nearer-term economic outlook and, importantly, risk-management considerations. Currently, I believe it will be appropriate to make two more rate hikes this year and then follow a very gradual path of rate increases thereafter. This is the policy path underlying my economic forecast. Of course, whether or not this path will, in fact, be appropriate depends on how the incoming data influence the FOMC’s outlooks for growth and inflation as well as its assessments of the risks to those forecasts. So you’ll have to stay tuned to see how policy actually turns out.\nLet me now turn to my outlook for the U.S. economy.\nU.S. Economic Outlook\nI anticipate U.S. GDP will grow in the range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent in 2016. So, close to or a bit better than last year’s 2 percent rate. The U.S. consumer is the linchpin behind this outlook. I think this winter’s somewhat softer readings on consumption will prove to be transitory. This is because the most important fundamental factor supporting household spending is the substantially improved labor market in the U.S. Over the past two years, the unemployment rate has fallen to 5 percent, half its 2009 peak, and job growth has averaged well over 200,000 per month. These gains have raised incomes and buoyed confidence over future job prospects. Lower energy prices and accommodative monetary policy have provided additional support to the spending wherewithal of households. All of these factors should continue to generate fairly solid increases in consumer spending — particularly given my assumption that interest rates will stay quite low for some time.\nHowever, juxtaposed against the relatively solid prospects for household spending, there are several factors weighing on economic activity in the U.S. The slowdown in global economic growth — notably in emerging market economies — and uncertainty about international prospects have contributed to a rising dollar and declining commodity prices since mid-2014. The trade-weighted dollar has appreciated almost 20 percent since June 2014, while oil prices are down around 65 percent over the same period. U.S. firms that sell their products in global markets and those exposed to commodity markets have felt the brunt of these relative price movements. All told, net exports have made noticeable negative contributions to U.S. growth in the past two years.\nAs the uncertainties over foreign growth prospects resolve — hopefully, for the better — the upward pressure on the dollar should diminish and the international headwinds on domestic growth should dissipate. Still, I do not expect the international sector to be an engine for U.S. growth for some time. This view of moderate global growth is fairly mainstream. For example, in its latest projections, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expected world output to increase around 3.5 percent per year over the next couple of years. This is considerably slower than the 5 percent pace in the pre-crisis period.1\nIn part reflecting these global issues, financial conditions in the U.S. have tightened noticeably since the middle of last year, likely dampening the spending of both households and businesses. Indeed, business capital expenditures have been lackluster since late 2014, and the most recent indicators suggest that a rebound is unlikely in the near future. In a partial reversal, we have seen some improvement in credit conditions over the past several weeks; hopefully, these will be sustained and contribute to firmer business-sector spending not too far down the road.\nAll told, I see real GDP increasing in the range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent over the next couple of years. This pace is somewhat stronger than where I think the underlying trend for growth is right now, but not by a great deal.\nAs you know, the U.S. Congress has mandated that the Federal Reserve foster economic conditions with the aim of promoting two economic goals — maximum employment and price stability. How are we doing in achieving these goals? Along with most of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee, I judge that an unemployment rate that averages somewhat under 5 percent over the longer run is consistent with the Federal Reserve’s maximum employment mandate. The current unemployment rate is 5 percent. However, a broader array of measures — subdued wage growth being a particularly important one — suggests that today there remains some additional resource slack in labor markets. Let me be clear: We have made tremendous progress. But I’m not completely confident that we have met our employment objective just yet, and probably won’t be until the unemployment rate is modestly below its long-run normal level. Now, given my outlook for growth, I expect the unemployment rate will edge down to between 4-1/2 and 4-3/4 percent by the end of next year. So, I do think the FOMC’s employment objective is within sight.\nHow about the inflation objective? Well, the performance on this leg of the dual mandate has not been as good. In January 2012 the FOMC set 2 percent inflation — measured by the annual change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) — as the explicit inflation target consistent with our price stability mandate.2 However, over the past eight years, PCE inflation has averaged only 1.5 percent. To get a sense of where total inflation is likely to be headed over the next year or so, I prefer to strip out the volatile and transitory food and energy components and look at so-called core inflation. Core PCE inflation also has run well below 2 percent for quite a long time. Over the past couple of months, however, core inflation moved up to 1.7 percent on a year-over-year basis. I am encouraged by this development, and have raised my forecast for core inflation in 2016 to 1.6 percent. Looking further ahead, I see both core and total inflation moving up gradually to approach our 2 percent inflation target within the next three years. This path reflects the dissipating effects on consumer prices of earlier declines in energy prices and the appreciation in the dollar, as well as the influence of further improvements in labor markets and growth in economic activity.\nHowever, I am a bit uneasy about this forecast. It is too early to tell whether the recent firmer readings in the inflation data will last or prove to be temporary volatility and reverse in coming months. We saw this happen in 2012. And there are some other downside risks to consider. International developments may result in further declines in energy prices or greater appreciation of the dollar. Most worrisome to me is the risk that inflation expectations might drift lower. Here, I find it troubling that the compensation for prospective inflation built into a number of financial market asset prices has fallen considerably over the past two years. More recently, some survey-based measures of inflation expectations, which had previously seemed unmovable, edged down to historically low levels. True, financial market inflation compensation and some survey measures of inflation expectations have risen a bit of late, but they still remain quite low.\nTo recap, I expect the U.S. economy to grow at a moderate pace over the next few years. This growth will be primarily driven by further increases in household spending. I also expect to make additional progress toward our 2 percent inflation target. While I see this path for the U.S. economy as the most likely outcome, there are a number of downside risks to my outlook for both growth and inflation. Before discussing the implications of this forecast for my views on appropriate monetary policy, let me put my growth outlook in a longer-run context.\nMy Growth Forecast in Longer-Run Context\nBy historical standards, my forecast of real GDP growth in the range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent doesn’t seem particularly optimistic. It’s in line with the average pace of growth since 2009, which is about 2-1/4 percent. By comparison, over the previous three expansions real GDP growth averaged closer to an annual rate of 3-1/2 percent. The decline from 3-1/2 percent growth to 2-1/4 percent makes one sit back and take notice. What’s going on? Why has growth in real activity been so subdued in the current expansion?\nFor one thing, the financial crisis and the ensuing Great Recession had far-reaching negative effects. You are all too well aware of these scars. With the support of accommodative monetary policy, these impediments to growth have been slowly dissipating. Nonetheless, I think these and other headwinds will take some more time to completely fade away.\nIn addition, as I survey the economic landscape, I see other factors that could hold growth back even after these impediments recede. Broadly speaking, an economy’s long-run growth potential depends upon increases in its productive resources and the technological improvements that enable those resources to produce more. And these trends don’t look favorable.\nOne important productive resource is labor. Here, demographics are working against us. The U.S. Census Bureau projects that the population aged 16 and over will grow a little less than 1 percent per year over the next ten years; by comparison, between 1990 and 2010 the average annual growth of the adult population was 1.2 percent. Moreover, our population is graying, and consequently, fewer of us will be working. Over the next ten years, the share of the population that is 65 or older is expected to increase about 4 percentage points from 15 to 19 percent. Since about 2000, this aging of the population and other long-running trends have been bringing down the fraction of the population participating in the labor force. My staff’s estimates suggest that these structural factors will reduce the growth of available workers by about a quarter of a percentage point per year over the next ten years or so. Slower growth in available workers translates into less potential output growth.\nMy staff also estimates that between 1980 and 2000, higher educational attainment and increases in workforce experience added more than half a percentage point a year to labor quality — that is to say, the effective labor input into the aggregate production function for the U.S. grew a half a percentage point a year faster than the increase in total number of hours worked.3 However, further progress seems to have stalled as new entrants to the labor force have roughly similar educational attainment as retiring baby boomers, but less work experience. This is another possible reason for slower potential economic growth.4\nEconomic growth over the longer run also depends upon technological progress. By one carefully estimated measure — made by John Fernald at the San Francisco Fed and his co-authors — the underlying trend in total factor productivity (TFP) growth has declined from 1.8 percent during the productivity boom of the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s to a mere half a percent today.5 That is in line with the period of low productivity growth from the 1970s to the mid-1990s. Some economists, such as Robert Gordon (2012) at Northwestern, think that the slowdown in trend productivity growth possibly is here to stay. Gordon argues that the search for transformative technologies that spurred productivity and economic growth in the past has become increasingly costly and more difficult to harvest: We have already picked the low-hanging fruit. The gloomy conclusion of his line of reasoning is that slow productivity growth will hold back potential economic growth for the foreseeable future.\nNot everyone subscribes to the view that TFP growth will inevitably slow because of the dearth of new inventions. Rapid advances in the field of medicine and in energy production are two examples of where we have seen huge productivity improvements. Furthermore, it takes time for innovations to work their way into productive technologies. It may be that transformative innovations are being created today, but have yet to make their way through the pipeline to show up as measurable increases in factor productivity.\nIt remains to be seen if the current slowdown in productivity growth is temporary or more long lasting. That said, the notion that longer-run potential growth is slowing is a view that has been gaining traction lately. This assessment is reflected to some degree in the economic projections of FOMC participants. As recently as January 2012, FOMC participants assessed the long-run potential growth rate of the economy to be around 2-1/2 percent.6 Today, the median FOMC participant believes that longer-run real GDP growth is only 2 percent. Even the most optimistic of my colleagues places this number at around 2.4 percent.7\nWhen measured against these benchmarks, my forecast of real GDP growth in the range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent in 2016 is simply saying that the economy will expand a bit faster than its longer-run productive capabilities. This number may be disappointing — we would certainly like stronger sustainable growth — but there is nothing much that monetary policy can do about labor force trends or technical progress. Still, these are structural conditions the FOMC must recognize when setting monetary policy.\nLower Potential Growth, Lower Equilibrium Interest Rates\nImportantly, lower potential output growth implies lower returns to investment. As a result, all else equal, equilibrium real interest rates, which are the rates consistent with fully employed resources, are lower in an economy with lower potential output growth. And, of course, lower real rates imply lower nominal rates, even when inflation is at its target. So, the equilibrium federal funds rate — which is the funds rate associated with a neutral monetary policy (policy that is neither expansionary nor contractionary) — is lower in an economy with a lower potential output growth. Therefore, the FOMC must take estimates of potential output growth into account when calibrating the stance of monetary policy.\nOf course, there are other reasons why equilibrium interest rates are likely lower than they were in the past. For example, former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke has frequently discussed the global savings glut. As the world population has aged and as residents of fast-growing emerging economies have grown wealthier, the saving rate in most countries has increased. This has resulted in a larger pool of funds seeking safe, profitable opportunities for investment. However, domestic investment opportunities in most of these countries often have not kept pace with the increased saving rates. This higher supply of investable funds relative to domestic demand has driven down interest rates across the globe. In addition, former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers has expanded on these influences, speculating that soft aggregate demand worldwide has discouraged structural investment and capital stock growth (his view of the “secular stagnation” hypothesis). These two ideas are closely related.\nAll of these factors imply that the federal funds rate consistent with a neutral stance for monetary policy may be lower than we used to think. How big might these changes be? Well, in March, FOMC participants’ projections for the longer-run nominal federal funds rate were in the range of 3 to 4 percent, with the median projection at 3-1/4 percent.8\nFour years ago, when forecasts of potential growth were higher, the Committee was projecting the long-run funds rate would be in the range of 3-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent — about 50 basis points higher than today’s estimates.9\nGlobal — Not Just U.S. — Trends\nAging populations, lower productivity, greater propensities to save, increased demand for relatively safe assets and declining real equilibrium interest rates are worldwide phenomena. Two recent studies — one by the IMF, another by the staff at the Bank of England — document how common these developments are in both advanced and developing economies.10 The studies also argue that these trends are likely to persist into the future, leading to lower potential growth for the overall world economy and lower real interest rates at both the short and long ends of the yield curve. So, unless there is a significant increase in trend inflation rates, nominal interest rates would be low as well. To be sure, this all isn’t exactly new news; in advanced countries real and nominal yields on long-term bonds have been declining since the mid-1990s.\nWhat Is Next for Monetary Policy?\nLower long-run structural trends mean that, even after policy has normalized, the federal funds rate will likely end up at a lower level than in the past. I’d now like to talk about what the transition path to that new level might look like.\nAgain, I will refer to the Summary of Economic Projections. Here is the well-known and extremely valuable “dot plot.” The chart shows each FOMC participants’ views of the appropriate target federal funds rate at the end of each of the next three years and in the longer run. These views are conditional on the data and outlook as of our March FOMC meeting.\nFocus for a moment on the median of the policy projections, indicated by the red dots. The median participant expects only two more rate hikes over the remainder of this year and then an additional 100 basis points or so of tightening in each of 2017 and 2018. By historical standards, this certainly is a gradual path. It is even slower than the so-called measured pace of increases over the 2004–06 tightening cycle — that was 25 basis points per meeting, or 200 basis points a year.\nAt the same time, the median FOMC projection for the next three years envisions growth averaging slightly better than its long-run potential, the unemployment rate falling below its long-run natural rate 11 and inflation gradually reaching our target. Given such relatively good projections for the economy’s performance, why is the median expected policy path so low?\nNaturally, I cannot speak for my colleagues on the FOMC. However, there are several reasons why I think a very shallow funds rate path, such as the one envisioned by the median FOMC participant, is appropriate.\nFirst, my forecasts for above-potential growth and lower unemployment depend critically on the accommodative boost from a gradual path for policy rates. Given my interpretation of conditions today, a faster pace of tightening than the one I envision would lead me to a less optimistic economic forecast.\nSecond, as I noted earlier, the FOMC needs to be concerned about inflation expectations slipping below its inflation target. If the public doesn’t believe policymakers are trying to hit a symmetric 2 percent inflation target, it will be all that much harder for us to reach that policy goal. To convince them of this, appropriate policy should provide enough accommodation to generate a reasonable likelihood that inflation in the future could moderately exceed 2 percent 12\nThird, the very shallow path also reflects my view that the neutral level of the federal funds rate today is lower than its eventual long-run level. By some estimates, the equilibrium inflation-adjusted rate is currently near zero. The degree of accommodation in actual policy needs to be judged against this benchmark. So the 75 to 100 basis point range for the nominal fed funds rate at the end of 2016 in the median SEP forecast is not terribly far below neutral.13 The equilibrium real rate should rise gradually as headwinds fade over time. And as it does, the benchmark to judge policy accommodation will also rise. But this is likely to be a slow adjustment\nAnd finally, my view of optimal policy also provides for risk management. Here is what I mean.\nAlthough I foresee moderate growth, that forecast faces a number of risks. On the upside, the solid labor market and continued low energy prices could lead to stronger household spending than expected — with attendant spillovers to other components of domestic demand. On the downside, the international situation could deteriorate — with related movements in the dollar and financial conditions weighing more heavily on domestic spending than assumed. Similarly, my inflation forecast faces two-sided risks. On the upside, the recent higher readings on core prices could prove to be more persistent than I have assumed. On the downside, the recent improvements could prove to be ephemeral, or there could be further declines in energy prices, appreciation of the dollar, or slippage in inflation expectations.\nFaced with such uncertainty, policymakers could make two potential policy mistakes. The first mistake is that the FOMC could raise rates too quickly, only to be hit by one or more of the downside surprises. In order to put the economy back on track, we would have to cut interest rates back to zero and possibly even resort to unconventional policy tools, such as more quantitative easing.14 I think unconventional policy tools have been effective, but they clearly are second-best alternatives to traditional policy and something we would all like to avoid. I should note, too, that with the economy facing a potentially lower growth rate and lower equilibrium interest rates, the likelihood of some shock forcing us back to the effective lower bound may be uncomfortably high. The difficulties experienced in Japan and Europe come to mind.\nAlthough I foresee moderate growth, that forecast faces a number of risks. On the upside, the solid labor market and continued low energy prices could lead to stronger household spending than expected, with attendant spillovers to other components of domestic demand. On the downside, the international situation could deteriorate, with related movements in the dollar and financial conditions weighing more heavily on domestic spending than assumed. Similarly, my inflation forecast faces two-sided risks. On the upside, the recent higher readings on core prices could prove to be more persistent than I have assumed. On the downside, the recent improvements could prove to be ephemeral or there could be further declines in energy prices, appreciation of the dollar or a slippage in inflation expectations.\nThe second (alternative) potential policy mistake the Committee could make is that sometime during the gradual normalization process the U.S. economy experiences upside surprises in growth and inflation. Well, policymakers have the experience and the appropriate tools to deal with such an outcome; we probably could keep inflation in check with only moderate increases in interest rates relative to current forecasts. Given how gradual the rate increases are in the baseline SEP, policy could be made a good deal more restrictive, for example, by simply increasing rates 25 basis points at every meeting — just as we did during the measured pace adjustments of 2004–06. A question for the audience: Who thinks those were fast? So, to me, concerns about the risks of rapid increases in rates in this scenario seem overblown.\nTo recap, policymakers would have to resort to second-best policy tools to deal with unexpected weakness in activity or inflation, but we can use our old tried-and-true instruments for addressing stronger-than-expected outcomes. Even if the odds of upside and downside shocks are the same, the costs are not. How should the FOMC address these asymmetric risks? Well, we should buy some insurance against unexpected weakness by accepting a somewhat higher likelihood of stronger outcomes. Translated into monetary policy, this means being more accommodative than usual to provide an extra boost to aggregate demand as a buffer against possible future downside shocks that might otherwise drive us back to the effective lower bound.\nEven beyond this asymmetry in costs, I see the distribution of future shocks as skewed in the direction of output running somewhat softer and inflation somewhat lower than what I have written down in my baseline projection. This tilting of the odds strengthens the rationale for shading policy in the direction of accommodation and provides additional support for a gradual path in normalizing policy.\nTo sum up, in 2016, I expect growth that is somewhat above trend and further progress in moving inflation toward our 2 percent target. As I consider how to calibrate monetary policy in the months and years ahead, I see two general — but key — considerations to keep in mind: 1) There are a number of downside risks to my near-term forecast; and 2) the equilibrium real federal funds rate is likely lower today than in the past (not only in the short run, as the economy continues to heal from the past wounds, but also in the long run). Today, the confluence of these considerations leads me to conclude that a very shallow path — such as the one envisioned by the median FOMC participant in March — is the most appropriate path for policy normalization over the next three years.\nThank you.\nNotes\n1 International Monetary Fund (2016).\n2 This was first acknowledged in Federal Open Market Committee (2012a); for the most recent statement of our longer-run goals see Federal Open Market Committee (2016b).\n3 Aaronson and Sullivan (2002).\n4 Indeed, Fernald (2014) estimates that contributions to labor productivity from increasing labor quality declined noticeably in the 2003–07 period and, on average, he does not expect any boost to productivity growth from increases in labor quality going forward.\n5 Byrne, Fernald and Reinsdorf (2016).Total factor productivity captures the residual growth in total output of the national economy that cannot be explained by the accumulation of measured inputs, such as labor and capital.\n6 See Federal Open Market Committee (2012b). The full range of the longer-run estimates was 2.2 percent to 3 percent, and the central tendency was in the 2.3 percent to 2.6 percent range.\n7 Federal Open Market Committee (2016a).\n8 Federal Open Market Committee (2016a).\n9 Federal Open Market Committee (2012b).\n10 International Monetary Fund (2015) and Rachel and Smith (2015).\n11 The natural (or trend) rate of unemployment is the unemployment rate that would prevail in an economy making full use of its productive resources.\n12 This is not as heretical as it might first appear. After all, it is a simple consequence of having a symmetric inflation target: It is difficult to average 2 percent inflation over the medium term if there is little chance of inflation ever running above 2 percent. If policy preempts this possibility, the public could begin to mistakenly believe that 2 percent inflation is a ceiling — and not a symmetric target. As a result, expectations for average inflation could fall, lessening the upward pull on actual inflation and making it even more difficult for us to achieve our 2 percent target.\n13 Federal Open Market Committee (2016a).\n14 For more about the quantitative easing programs (also referred to as large-scale asset purchases) and the rationale behind them, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2015).\n\nReferences\nAaronson, Daniel, and Daniel G.

            "content": "Introduction\nGood afternoon and thank you. It is a pleasure to be here. Let me begin by noting that my comments today reflect my own views and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System.\nSharing an outlook with this group is a bit like carting sand to the beach. You already know the details of the latest data. And you have spent a good deal of time and effort applying your own expertise in putting together your projections. What more, then, can I offer? Well, I can bore you with my own outlook for the U.S. economy, of course! But, I’ll also try to spice things up by focusing on some broader economic issues facing the U.S. today, their implications for our longer-term growth prospects and how best to steer monetary policy in this complicated environment.\nSo, first, let me give you a preview of my comments today:\nLike many of you in this room, I expect real gross domestic product (GDP) to increase in the range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent in 2016, with the U.S. household sector leading the way in supporting growth in aggregate demand. This is my modal outlook; but I see the balance of risks as tilted to the downside.\nI will next discuss the pretty modest assumption for the potential growth rate of the U.S. economy that underlies this projection. Ten years ago, potential growth was around 3 percent. Today, I think it is around 2 percent. This is an enormous difference.\nWith regard to monetary policy, lower long-run potential growth means that the long-run equilibrium real interest rate—our good friend, r*—will likely be lower than it has been in the past.\nFurthermore, given the headwinds from the international sector and some remaining hangovers from the Great Recession, the current level of r* probably is even lower than its long-run level.\nI will finish up by talking about how my views of appropriate monetary policy are shaped by these assessments of the equilibrium real interest rate, as well as by the importance of risk management in policymaking.\nFor the punch line: My fed funds rate assumptions used to be some of the most accommodative ones on the FOMC. Today, with the latest changes in the Committee’s well-known “dot plot,” I am comfortable with the path for the federal funds rate projected by the median FOMC participant in the March Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).1\nNow let me turn to my outlook for the U.S. economy.\nU.S. Economic Outlook\nI anticipate growth will be in the range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent in 2016. So, close to or a bit better than last year’s 2 percent rate. The U.S. consumer is the linchpin behind this outlook. I think this winter’s somewhat softer readings on consumption will prove to be transitory.  This is because the most important fundamental supporting household spending is the substantially improved labor market in the U.S. Over the past two years, employment growth has averaged more than 200,000 per month and the unemployment rate has fallen to below 5 percent, half its 2009 peak. Such job gains, the attendant growth in households’ income and improved confidence over future job prospects should continue to support fairly solid increases in consumer spending.\nLower energy prices also add to the health of the American consumer. Two years ago the average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was about $3.50 per gallon.2 Today, it is around $2. Those savings at the pump are available to support spending on other items, pay off debt or add to the household’s nest egg. Furthermore, for my forecast, I assume interest rates will stay quite low for some time, which should further bolster consumer spending. For example, low borrowing rates helped push new motor vehicle sales in 2015 to a near-record level, and vehicle sales have remained strong so far in 2016. Healthy labor markets, improved balance sheets and low interest rates will also help housing markets. Indeed, although new home building still remains below what would be considered normal, growth in residential investment has been improving slowly but steadily for the past four years.\nHowever, juxtaposed against the relatively solid prospects for household spending, there are several factors weighing on growth in the U.S. The slowdown in global economic growth — notably in emerging market economies — and uncertainty about future international prospects have contributed to a rising dollar and declining commodity prices since mid-2014. The trade-weighted dollar has appreciated almost 20 percent since June 2014, while oil prices are down around 65 percent over the same period. As a result, U.S. manufacturers and agricultural producers that sell their products in global markets face challenges, as do oil, gas and mining companies and their suppliers. As the uncertainties over foreign growth prospects resolve — hopefully, for the better — the upward pressure on the dollar should diminish and the international headwinds on domestic growth should dissipate. Still, I do not expect the international sector to be an engine for U.S. growth for some time.\nIn part reflecting these global issues, financial conditions in the U.S. have tightened noticeably since the middle of last year. While stock prices are about the same, they have been at times highly volatile, perhaps reflecting the heightened uncertainty among investors. Although declining somewhat in recent weeks, spreads on corporate bonds, particularly for riskier borrowers, have on net widened significantly over the past year or so. All told, tighter financial conditions have presented an additional headwind for growth, likely dampening the spending by both households and businesses. Indeed, business capital expenditures have been lackluster since late 2014, reflecting a sharp pull-back in energy-related spending, as well as a heightened degree of caution and tighter credit for a broader set of firms.\nGiven my growth outlook, I expect that the unemployment rate will edge down further to between 4-1/2 and 4-3/4 percent by the end of next year. Along with most of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee, I judge that an unemployment rate that averages somewhat under 5 percent over the longer run is consistent with the Federal Reserve’s maximum employment mandate. I expect the unemployment rate to go slightly below this benchmark. That said a few other labor market indicators — such as the large number of people who are employed part time but who would prefer a full-time job and subdued wage growth — suggest that today there remains some additional resource slack beyond what is indicated by the unemployment rate alone. So I’m not completely confident that we have met our employment objective just yet. And there are additional benefits from reinforcing labor market attachment to greater numbers of workers. Let me be clear, we have made tremendous progress in recent years. However, I don’t think that, broadly speaking, labor market conditions will reach neutral until the unemployment rate is modestly below its long-run normal level.\nLet me now turn to inflation. We have not done well on this leg of our dual mandate. As you all know, in January 2012 the FOMC set 2 percent inflation — measured by the annual change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) — as the explicit inflation target consistent with our price stability mandate.3 Well, over the past eight years PCE inflation has averaged only 1.5 percent. I am of the school that likes to strip out the volatile and transitory food and energy components and look at core inflation. This is because core inflation gives a better indicator of where total inflation is likely to be headed over the next year or so than total inflation itself. Core PCE inflation also has run well below 2 percent for quite a long time. Over the past couple of months, however, core inflation moved up to 1.7 percent on a year-over-year basis. I am encouraged by this development, and have raised my forecast for core inflation in 2016 to 1.6 percent. Looking further ahead, I see both core and total inflation moving up gradually to approach our 2 percent inflation target within the next three years. This path reflects the dissipating effects on consumer prices of earlier declines in energy prices and the appreciation in the dollar. It also reflects the influence of further improvements in labor markets and growth in economic activity.\nHowever, I am a bit uneasy about this forecast. It is too early to tell whether the recent firmer readings in the inflation data will last or prove to be temporary volatility and reverse in coming months. We saw this happen in 2012. And there are some other downside risks to consider. International developments may result in further declines in energy prices or greater appreciation of the dollar. Most worrisome to me is the risk that inflation expectations might drift lower. Undershooting our 2 percent inflation target for as long as we have raises the risk that the public will expect persistently low inflation in the future. If such a mind-set becomes embedded in decisions regarding wages and prices, then returning inflation to 2 percent will be that much more difficult. Here, I find it troubling that the compensation for prospective inflation built into a number of financial market asset prices has drifted down considerably over the past two years. More recently, some survey-based measures of inflation expectations, which had previously seemed unmovable, edged down to historically low levels. True, financial market inflation compensation and survey measures of inflation expectations have risen some of late, but they still remain quite low.\nTo recap, I expect the U.S. economy to grow at a moderate pace over the next few years. This growth will be primarily driven by further increases in household spending. I also expect to make additional progress toward our 2 percent inflation target. While I see this path for the U.S. economy as the most likely outcome, there are a number of downside risks to my outlook for both growth and inflation. Before discussing the implications of this forecast for my views on appropriate monetary policy, let me put my growth outlook in a longer-run context.\nMy Growth Forecast in Longer-Run Context\nBy historical standards, my forecast of real GDP growth in the range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent doesn’t seem particularly optimistic. It’s in line with the average pace of growth since 2009, which is about 2-1/4 percent. By comparison, over the previous three expansions real GDP growth averaged closer to an annual rate of 3-1/2 percent. The decline from 3-1/2 percent growth to 2-1/4 percent makes one sit back and take notice. What’s going on? Why has growth in real activity been so subdued in the current expansion?\nFor one thing, the financial crisis and the ensuing Great Recession had far-reaching negative effects. You are all too well aware of these scars. With the support of accommodative monetary policy, these impediments to growth have been slowly dissipating. Nonetheless, I think these and other headwinds will take some more time to completely fade away.\nIn addition, as I survey the economic landscape, I see other factors that could hold growth back even after these impediments recede. Broadly speaking, an economy’s long-run growth potential depends upon increases in its productive resources and the technological improvements that enable those resources to produce more.\nOne of those key productive resources is labor. Here, demographics are working against us. Population growth has slowed. Moreover, the labor force participation rate has been declining steadily. Some of this decline is due to the graying of the population, but other trends are at work as well. Slower labor force growth translates directly into slower potential output growth. Additionally, for the economy to make the best use of its labor resources, workers must possess the right skills. My staff estimates that between 1965 and 1985, educational improvement added more than half a percent annually to labor quality — that is, effective labor input into the aggregate production function for the U.S. grew a half a percentage point a year faster than the increase in total hours worked.4 However, further progress seems to have stalled as new entrants to the labor force have roughly similar educational attainment as retiring baby boomers, but less work experience.   This is another possible reason for slower potential economic growth.\nEconomic growth over the longer run also depends upon technological progress. By one carefully estimated measure — made by John Fernald and co-authors at the San Francisco Fed — the underlying trend in total factor productivity growth has declined from 1.8 percent during the productivity boom of the mid-1990s to mid-2000s to a mere half a percent today.5 That is in line with the low productivity growth period from the 1970s to the mid-1990s. Some economists, such as Robert Gordon (2012) at Northwestern, think that the slowdown in trend productivity growth is probably here to stay. Gordon argues that the search for transformative technologies that spurred productivity and economic growth in the past has become increasingly costly and more difficult to harvest: We have already picked the low-hanging fruit. Consequently, Gordon sees limited potential for a continuing stream of transformative inventions.6 The gloomy conclusion of his line of reasoning is that slow productivity growth will hold back potential economic growth for the foreseeable future.\nThe notion that longer-run potential growth is slowing is a view that has been gaining traction lately. This assessment is reflected to some degree in the economic projections of FOMC participants. As recently as January 2012, FOMC participants assessed the long-run potential growth rate of the economy to be around 2.5 percent.7 Today, the median FOMC participant believes that longer-run real GDP growth is only 2 percent. Even the most optimistic of my colleagues places this number at around 2.4 percent.8\nWhen measured against these benchmarks, my forecast of GDP growth in the range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent in 2016 is simply saying that the economy will expand a bit faster than its longer-run productive capabilities. This number may be disappointing — we would certainly like stronger sustainable growth — but only in Lake Wobegone can growth be above trend every year. There is nothing much that monetary policy can do about labor force trends or technical progress. These are structural conditions the FOMC must recognize when setting monetary policy.\nLower Potential Growth, Lower Equilibrium Interest Rates\nThat is not to say, however, that these benchmarks do not influence policy. Importantly, lower potential output growth implies lower returns to investment. As a result, equilibrium short-term real interest rates, which are the rates consistent with fully employed resources, are lower in an economy with lower potential output growth. And, of course, lower real rates imply lower nominal rates, even when inflation is at its target. So, the equilibrium federal funds rate — which is the funds rate associated with a neutral monetary policy (policy that is neither expansionary nor contractionary) — is lower in an economy with a lower potential output growth.9 Possibly reflecting these new circumstances, in March FOMC participants’ projections for the longer-run nominal federal funds rate were in the range of 3 to 4 percent, with the median projection at 3-1/4 percent.10 Four years ago, when forecasts of potential growth were higher, the Committee was projecting the long-run funds rate would be in the range of 3-3/4 to 4-1/2 percent — about 50 basis points higher than today’s estimates. 11\nWhat Is Next for Monetary Policy?\nSo, even after normalizing policy, the federal funds rate will likely end up at a lower level than in the past. I’d now like to talk about what the transition path to that new level might look like.\nAgain, I will refer to the Summary of Economic Projections. Here is the well-known and extremely valuable dot plot. The chart shows each FOMC participant’s views of the appropriate target federal funds rate at the end of each of the next three years and in the longer run. These views are conditional on the data and outlook as of our March FOMC meeting.\n  Focus for a moment on the median of the policy projections, indicated by the red dots. The median participant expects only two more rate hikes over the remainder of this year and then an additional 100 basis points or so of tightening in each of 2017 and 2018. By historical standards, this certainly is a gradual path. It is even slower than the so-called measured pace of increases over the 2004–06 tightening cycle — that was 25 basis points per meeting, or 200 basis points a year.\nAt the same time, the median FOMC projection for the next three years envisions growth averaging slightly better than its long-run potential, the unemployment rate falling below its long-run natural rate12 and inflation gradually reaching our target. Given such relatively good projections for the economy’s performance, why is the median expected policy path so low?\nNaturally, I cannot speak for my colleagues on the FOMC. However, there are several reasons why I think a very shallow funds rate path, such as the one envisioned by the median FOMC participant, is appropriate.\nFirst, my forecasts for above-potential growth and lower unemployment depend critically on the accommodative boost from a gradual path for policy rates. Given my interpretation of conditions today, a faster pace of tightening than the one I envision would lead me to a less optimistic economic forecast.\nSecond, as I noted earlier, the FOMC needs to be concerned about inflation expectations slipping below its inflation target. If the public doesn’t believe policymakers are trying to hit a symmetric 2 percent inflation target, it will be all that much harder to reach that policy goal. To convince them of this, appropriate policy should provide enough accommodation to generate a reasonable likelihood that inflation in the future could moderately exceed 2 percent.13\nThird, the very shallow path also reflects my view that the neutral level of the federal funds rate today is lower than its eventual long-run level. By some estimates, the equilibrium inflation-adjusted rate is currently near zero. The degree of accommodation in actual policy needs to be judged against this benchmark. So the 75 to 100 basis point range for the nominal fed funds rate in the median SEP forecast for the end of 2016 is not terribly far below neutral.14 The equilibrium real rate should rise gradually as headwinds fade over time. And as this rate does, the benchmark to judge policy accommodation will also rise. But this is likely to be a slow adjustment.\nAnd finally, my view of optimal policy also provides for risk management. Here is what I mean.\nAlthough I foresee moderate growth, that forecast faces a number of risks. On the upside, the solid labor market and continued low energy prices could lead to stronger household spending than expected, with attendant spillovers to other components of domestic demand. On the downside, the international situation could deteriorate, with related movements in the dollar and financial conditions weighing more heavily on domestic spending than assumed. Similarly, my inflation forecast faces two-sided risks. On the upside, the recent higher readings on core prices could prove to be more persistent than I have assumed. On the downside, the recent improvements could prove to be ephemeral or there could be further declines in energy prices, appreciation of the dollar or a slippage in inflation expectations.\nFaced with such uncertainty, policymakers could make two potential policy mistakes.\nThe first mistake is that the FOMC could raise rates too quickly, only to be hit by one or more of the downside surprises. In order to put the economy back on track, we would have to cut interest rates back to zero and possibly even resort to unconventional policy tools, such as more quantitative easing.15 I think unconventional policy tools have been effective, but they clearly are second-best alternatives to traditional policy and something we would all like to avoid. I should note, too, that with the economy facing a potentially lower growth rate and lower equilibrium interest rates, the likelihood of some shock forcing us back to the effective lower bound may be uncomfortably high. The difficulties experienced in Japan and Europe come to mind.\nThe second (alternative) potential policy mistake the Committee could make is that sometime during the gradual normalization process the U.S. economy experiences upside surprises in growth and inflation. Well, policymakers have the experience and the appropriate tools to deal with such an outcome; we probably could keep inflation in check with only moderate increases in interest rates relative to current forecasts. Given how gradual the rate increases are in the baseline SEP, policy could be made a good deal more restrictive, for example, by simply increasing rates 25 basis points at every meeting — just as we did during the measured pace adjustments in 2004–06. A question for the audience: Who thinks those were fast? So, to me, concerns about the risks of rapid increases in rates in this scenario seem overblown.\nTo summarize, policymakers would have to resort to second-best policy tools to deal with unexpected weakness in activity or inflation, but we can use our old tried-and-true instruments for addressing stronger-than-expected outcomes. Even if the odds of upside and downside shocks are the same, the costs are not. How should the FOMC address these asymmetric risks? Well, we should buy some insurance against unexpected weakness by accepting a somewhat higher likelihood of stronger outcomes. Translated into monetary policy, this means being more accommodative than usual to provide an extra boost to aggregate demand as a buffer against possible future downside shocks that might otherwise drive us back to the effective lower bound.\nBut beyond this asymmetry in costs, I see the distribution of future shocks as skewed in the direction of output running somewhat softer and inflation somewhat lower than what I have written down in my baseline projection. This tilting of the odds strengthens the rationale for shading policy in the direction of accommodation and provides additional support for a gradual path in normalizing policy.\nTo sum up, in 2016, I expect growth that is somewhat above trend and further progress in moving inflation toward our 2 percent target. As I consider how to calibrate monetary policy in the months and years ahead, I see two general — but key — considerations to keep in mind: 1) There are a number of downside risks to my near-term forecast; and 2) the equilibrium real federal funds rate is likely lower today than in the past (not only in the short run, as the economy continues to heal from past wounds, but also in the long run). Today, the confluence of these considerations leads me to conclude that a very shallow path — such as the one envisioned by the median FOMC participant in March — is the most appropriate path for policy normalization over the next three years.\nThank you.\nNotes\n1 Federal Open Market Committee (2016a). The Summary of Economic Projections, which is released four times a year, gives FOMC participants’ forecasts of key economic variables over the next three years and for the longer run.\n2 See U.S. Energy Information Administration (2016).\n3 This was first acknowledged in Federal Open Market Committee (2012a). It remains in the most recent statement of our longer-run goals; see Federal Open Market Committee (2016b).\n4 Aaronson and Sullivan (2002).\n5 Byrne, Fernald and Reinsdorf (2016).Total factor productivity captures the residual growth in total output of the national economy that cannot be explained by the accumulation of measured inputs, such as labor and capital.\n6 Not everyone subscribes to this viewpoint. Information technology has transformed production in ways we may not fully comprehend. Moreover, transformative technological advances are inherently difficult to predict. Although measured productivity growth has slowed in recent years, the transformative innovations of tomorrow may well be in the pipeline. We just may not be able to see measurable widespread evidence yet.\n7 See Federal Open Market Committee (2012b). The full range of the longer-run estimates was 2.2 percent to 3 percent and the central tendency was in the 2.3 percent to 2.6 percent range.\n8 Federal Open Market Committee (2016a).\n9 Of course, there are other reasons why equilibrium interest rates are likely lower than they were in the past. For example, former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke has frequently discussed the global savings glut as a key factor driving down equilibrium interest rates. As the world population has aged and as residents of fast-growing emerging economies have grown wealthier, the saving rate in most countries has increased. This has resulted in a larger pool of funds seeking safe, profitable opportunities for investment. However, domestic investment opportunities in most of these countries have not kept pace with the increased saving rates. This higher supply of investable funds relative to domestic demand has driven down interest rates worldwide. In addition, former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers has expanded on these influences, speculating that soft aggregate demand worldwide has discouraged structural investment and capital stock growth (his view of the “secular stagnation” hypothesis). These two ideas are closely related.\n10 Federal Open Market Committee (2016a).\n11 Federal Open Market Committee (2012b).\n12 The natural (or trend) rate of unemployment is the unemployment rate that would prevail in an economy making full use of its productive resources.\n13 This is not as heretical as it might first appear. After all, it is a simple consequence of having a symmetric inflation target: It is difficult to average 2 percent inflation over the medium term if there is little chance of inflation ever running above 2 percent. If policy preempts this possibility, the public could begin to mistakenly believe that 2 percent inflation is a ceiling — and not a symmetric target. As a result, expectations for average inflation could fall, lessening the upward pull on actual inflation and making it even more difficult for us to achieve our 2 percent target.\n14 Federal Open Market Committee (2016a).\n15 For more about the quantitative easing programs (also referred to as large-scale asset purchases) and the rationale behind them, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2015).\n\nReferences\nAaronson, Daniel, and Daniel G.

            "content": "Introduction\nGood afternoon and thank you. Before I begin my remarks today, I should note that my comments reflect my own views and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System.\nFor me, the start of each new year marks a time for contemplating the past and for looking forward to the future. As many of you likely do, I begin each year optimistically, resolving to do things better, such as exercising more and eating more healthily. But as the months pass, I generally get sidetracked, despite the best of intentions. Of course, this is the year it will be different.\nRecently, when I was putting together my forecast for the economy, I was struck by the realization that in each of the past six years I began with an optimistic view of how fast the economy was going to grow — only to be disappointed with the numbers coming in below my projections. To be candid, my batting average has been similar to my forecasts for exercise and healthy eating. For example, as 2015 began, I was expecting growth for the year to be in the range of 2-1/2 to 3 percent. Instead, it looks like real gross domestic product (GDP) rose roughly 2 percent. As errors go, this isn’t a particularly big one. But it is a noticeable one, and continues a string of downside misses that, frankly, has been getting tiresome.\nSo what about this year? Well, I’ve scaled things back a bit, and anticipate the economy will grow in the range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent in 2016. So, close to or a bit better than this past year. I also expect the unemployment rate to come down a couple of tenths and end the year at about 4-3/4 percent.\nThe central point underlying my forecast is that the fundamentals for most components of domestic spending are good. Most importantly, we’ve seen a substantial improvement in labor markets over the past several years. The unemployment rate is currently 5.0 percent; that’s down from its high of 10.0 percent in late 2009. Let me put this into context: One of the two goals for Federal Reserve policy mandated by Congress is to help the economy achieve maximum employment. Along with most of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee, I judge that maximum employment is consistent with an unemployment rate that averages a little under 5 percent over the longer run. Now a few other labor market indicators — such as the large number of people who are employed part time but who would prefer a full-time job and subdued wage growth — suggest there remains some additional resource slack beyond what is indicated by the unemployment rate alone. So I don’t think we have quite met our employment mandate. But we certainly have made great progress toward meeting that goal.\nHealthy labor markets portend continued job gains, growth in households’ income, and buoyant consumer confidence. These developments, along with low energy prices and some further increases in household wealth, should support fairly solid gains in consumer spending. Furthermore, as I’ll talk about more in a minute, my forecast also assumes interest rates will stay quite low for some time. This should help bolster consumer spending — for example, low borrowing rates helped push new motor vehicle sales in 2015 to near-record levels. Healthy labor markets and low interest rates will also help housing markets. Indeed, although new home building still remains below what would be considered normal, growth in residential investment has picked up over the past couple of quarters. Another plus for domestic spending is that the recent budget deal should mean we’ll see a modest increase in federal spending this year.\nDevelopments abroad, however, are offsetting the positive momentum in domestic fundamentals to some degree. The slow-down in global economic growth — notably in emerging markets — and uncertainty about future prospects have contributed to a rising dollar and declining commodity prices over the past two years. As a result, U.S. manufacturers and agricultural producers that sell their products in global markets face challenges — as do oil, gas and mining companies and their suppliers. That said, if foreign growth prospects and the dollar stabilize, as most expect, these headwinds on domestic growth should dissipate. Still, we should not expect the international sector to be an engine for U.S. growth for some time.\nMy Growth Forecast in Context\nNow, by historical standards, GDP growth in the range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent doesn’t seem particularly optimistic. It’s in line with the average annualized growth rate of 2.2 percent since the end of the Great Recession. By comparison, GDP growth averaged closer to an annual rate of 3.5 percent over the previous three expansions. What’s going on?\nOf course, the financial crisis and the ensuing Great Recession had far-reaching negative effects. And even though we’ve come a long way in healing those wounds, some related headwinds still remain and will take some time to dissipate. But other factors could also be in play that mean lower long-run growth may be a troubling feature of the U.S. economy even after the effects of Great Recession are behind us.\nBroadly speaking, an economy’s long-run growth potential depends upon increases in its productive resources and the technological improvements that enable those resources to produce more. One important productive resource is labor. Here, demographic trends are working against us. The U.S. Census Bureau projects that the population aged 16 and over will grow a little less than 1 percent per year for the rest of this decade; this is lower than what we experienced during the late 1990s, when average annual growth of the adult population was 1.3 percent.\nMoreover, our population is greying. Over the next 10 years, the share of the population that is 65 or older is expected to increase about 4 percentage points from 15 to 19 percent.\nThis aging of the population and other long-running trends have been bringing down the fraction of the population that is actually in the labor force since about 2000. The labor force participation rate has also likely been pushed somewhat lower by what was, for many years, a poor labor market.1 However, the labor force participation rate dropped approximately 2-1/2 percentage points even as labor market conditions began to improve. And estimates suggest the decline will continue, reducing the growth of available workers in the long run by about 0.5 percent per year.2 Slower growth in available workers translates into less potential output growth.\nAs I just mentioned, economic growth over the longer run also depends upon technological progress. Unfortunately, we can’t measure technological progress directly. Instead, it is inferred as a residual only after accounting for other tangible reasons for growth in a measure that is referred to as total factor productivity (TFP). By its very nature, TFP is not measured precisely, and it’s difficult to discern its underlying trends. Nonetheless, there have been noticeable shifts in estimated TFP growth in the past several decades. From the early 1970s to the mid-1990s, the growth rate of TFP slowed down from its post-World War II highs. With the advances in information technology and their widespread adoption, we experienced a surge in TFP growth from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s. Since then, however, TFP growth has reverted to its pre-1994 pace.3 Moreover, there is concern among many analysts that it may now be persistently lower than in the past. If this weaker TFP growth proves to be the new normal, potential economic growth would decline in tandem.\n\nWhether these factors that hold down the potential growth rate of the economy are temporary or more permanent is a matter of considerable debate. But if you come down on the side that these are quite persistent developments, then you must conclude that we face a lower potential growth rate today than we did in previous post- World War II expansions.\n\nThis assessment is reflected to some degree in the economic projections of FOMC participants. Four times a year, the FOMC releases its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which gives FOMC participants’ forecasts of key economic variables over the next three years and for the longer run.4 As recently as January 2012, FOMC participants assessed the long-run potential growth rate of the economy to be in the 2-1/4 to 3 percent range.5 Today, the median participant believes that longer-run real GDP growth is only 2.0 percent. Even the most optimistic of my colleagues places this number only slightly higher at 2.3 percent.\n\nWhen measured against these benchmarks, my forecast of GDP rising in the range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent in 2016 doesn’t look so bad. It’s simply saying that the economy will expand near its longer-run productive capabilities. This number may be disappointing — we would certainly like stronger sustainable growth — but there is nothing much that monetary policy can do about working-age population growth, labor force participation trends, and technical progress. These trend estimates are the benchmarks we must take as given when deciding how to set monetary policy.\nLower Potential Growth, Lower Equilibrium Interest Rates\nThat is not to say, however, that these benchmarks do not influence policy. Importantly, lower potential output growth implies lower returns to investment. As a result, the equilibrium real interest rates, which are consistent with fully employed resources, are lower in an economy with lower potential output growth. And, of course, lower real rates imply lower nominal rates even when inflation is at its target. So, the equilibrium federal funds rate, which is associated with a neutral monetary policy — policy that is neither expansionary nor contractionary — is lower in an economy with a lower potential output growth. Therefore, the FOMC must take estimates of potential output growth into account when calibrating the stance of monetary policy.\n\nOf course, there are other reasons why equilibrium interest rates are likely lower than they were before the crisis. For example, former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke has discussed frequently the global savings glut. As the world population has aged and as residents of fast-growing emerging economies have grown wealthier, the saving rate in most countries has increased. This has resulted in a larger pool of funds seeking safe, profitable opportunities for investment. However, domestic investment opportunities in most of these countries have not kept pace with the increased saving rates. This higher supply of investable funds relative to domestic demand has driven down interest rates worldwide. In addition, former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers has expanded on these influences, speculating that soft aggregate demand worldwide has discouraged structural investment and capital stock growth — his view of the “secular stagnation” hypothesis. These two ideas are closely related.\n\nAll of these factors imply that the federal funds rate consistent with a neutral stance for monetary policy may be lower than we used to think. How big might these changes be? Well, in December, FOMC participants’ projections for the longer-run nominal federal funds rate were in the range of 3 to 4 percent, with the median projection at 3.5 percent.6 Three years ago, when forecasts of potential growth were higher, the Committee was projecting the long-run funds rate would be in the range of 3-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent — about 50 basis points higher than today’s estimates.7\n\nWhat Is Next for Monetary Policy?\nSo we are likely headed toward a lower resting point for the federal funds rate than before. What is the path to that level likely to look like over the next several years?\nAs I’m sure you are aware, in December the FOMC voted to increase the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 1/4 to 1/2 percent. It was the first time since June 2006 that the FOMC has raised its policy rate. As Chair Janet Yellen explained during her press conference after the meeting, “With the economy performing well and expected to continue to do so, the Committee judged that a modest increase in the federal funds rate target is now appropriate, recognizing that even after this increase monetary policy remains accommodative.”8\n Yellen’s words underscore the intention for the stance of monetary policy to remain accommodative for some time, and the Committee’s latest statement anticipates making gradual adjustments during policy normalization.9 But, if we are near our employment mandate and the prospects for growth look solid, why are we expecting to take this gradual approach? What is different during this tightening cycle?\n\nOne issue is that the equilibrium, or the neutral, federal funds rate can move over the business cycle for a variety of reasons, and can be either above or below its long-run level. Currently, we think some remaining fallout from the financial crisis and international headwinds mean that the neutral level of the federal funds rate today is even lower than it will be in the long run. By some estimates, the equilibrium inflation-adjusted rate is currently near zero. This rate should rise gradually as the headwinds fade over time. But until they do, monetary policy rates must be even lower than they otherwise would be to provide adequate accommodation for economic growth.\nPersistently Low Inflation\nBut that is only part of the answer to why monetary policy rates are below long-run neutral levels. The other part is that we have yet to achieve our inflation goal. We need to pursue a sufficiently accommodative monetary policy if we are to achieve the inflation goal over the medium term.\n\nThus far, my remarks have focused on only one aspect of our policy goals: full employment. But monetary policy has another objective: The other goal Congress has set for us is the achievement of price stability. The FOMC interprets this objective to mean that inflation should average 2 percent over the medium term as measured by the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE).\n\nWe have not done well relative to this objective. Over the past eight years, PCE inflation has averaged 1.5 percent, with the latest reading at just 0.4 percent. We often look at core inflation, which strips out the volatile food and energy components, as a good indicator of where total inflation is likely to be headed over the next year or so. Well, core inflation has been just 1.3 percent over the past 12 months.\n\nOverall inflation is being held down in part by lower energy prices. The higher dollar is also weighing on both total inflation and core inflation. I expect these effects to dissipate as we move through the year. Further improvements in labor markets and growth in economic activity should also boost inflation. And so I see inflation moving up gradually to approach our 2 percent inflation target within the next three years.\n\nHowever, there are some downside risks to this forecast. We might see further declines in energy prices or greater appreciation of the dollar. In addition, undershooting our 2 percent inflation target for as long as we have invites the risk of the public beginning to expect persistently low inflation in the future. If this mindset becomes embedded in decisions regarding wages and prices, then getting inflation back to 2 percent will be that much more difficult. Here, I find it troubling that the compensation for prospective inflation built into a number of financial market asset prices has drifted down considerably over the past two years. More recently, some survey-based measures of inflation expectations, which had previously seemed unmovable, have also edged down. So to achieve our inflation target — and to provide a buffer against downside risks — it is appropriate that we follow a gradual path to policy normalization.\n\nWhat is the gradual path that FOMC participants anticipate? Here is the well-known “dot plot,” which shows FOMC participants’ views of the appropriate target federal funds rate at the end of each of the next three years and in the longer run. Each participant’s fed funds rate forecast is shown as a distinct dot at each of these time horizons. The chart I’m showing here is the most recent one we did for last December’s FOMC meeting.\n\n\nFocus for a moment on the median policy projections, indicated by the red dots. Most of my colleagues thought that it would be appropriate to raise the target federal funds rate at our last meeting. By the end of 2016, the median participant envisioned the fed funds rate to be about a percentage point higher than it is today. With eight FOMC meetings a year, this path is consistent with the target federal funds rate, on average, increasing by 25 basis points at every other FOMC meeting. By historical standards, this is certainly a gradual path. It is even slower than the so-called measured pace of increases over the 2004–06 tightening cycle, which was 25 basis points per meeting.\n\nOverall, I think appropriate policy is consistent with some of the most accommodative dots on the chart. One reason I arrive at this conclusion is because I am less optimistic about the inflation outlook than most of my colleagues. Given the persistently-low- inflation record of the past six years and given how slowly inflation evolves when it is at such low levels, it may be difficult to return inflation to target over the next two or three years. So I’m in favor of very gradual policy normalization to help ensure that we meet our inflation goal within a reasonable amount of time. Moreover, as I have argued many times, prudent risk management calls for a slower removal of accommodative monetary policy. From my perspective, the costs of raising the federal funds rate too quickly far exceed the costs of removing accommodation too slowly. So taking both of these concerns into account — and considering how I think economic conditions will evolve over time — I believe that policy should plan to follow an even shallower path for the federal funds rate than currently envisioned by the median FOMC participant.\n\nI would like to conclude by noting that as much as we would like to be able to convey the exact timing and magnitude of future policy actions, there is no single, predetermined rate path that is consistent with a gradual approach. This is because while our goal is clear — to reach our dual mandate targets — our view of the road ahead may need to be modified. It is what you hear FOMC participants and market commentators often refer to as being “data dependent.” To use a metaphor, it’s a little like my golf game. My plan is to hit a drive smack down the center of the fairway; stick an iron close to the pin; and drain a putt for the birdie. But my actual shot-making depends upon how well I judge the crosswinds or if that unfair bounce off the sprinkler head leaves me with a nasty lie in the fairway bunker. As I stand on the tee and think through my approach, one thing is certain: I have to play the next shot from wherever I end up. Adjustments may need to be made.\n\nSo it is with monetary policy. My views are not set in stone. If the incoming data move my inflation projections up, I would adjust my policy views in tandem and would raise my federal funds rate projection more quickly than I currently envision. If we were hit by an unexpected shock that set back the growth outlook, I would favor a more accommodative policy than I envision today. This is what it means to be data dependent. Of course, I will not be alone in taking this approach. As the December FOMC statement announcing the policy change made clear over the coming months and years, “the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.” 10\n\nThank you.\nNotes\n1 The labor force participation rate dropped 1 percentage point while the unemployment rate escalated during the downturn.\n2 This projection contrasts with what happened during the late 1990s, when increasing labor force participation was raising available labor supply by 0.2 percent per year.\n3 For example, Congressional Budget Office (2015) and Fernald (2014) provide estimates of TFP growth and discuss the changes that have taken place in the past.\n4 For the most recent summary, see Federal Open Market Committee (2015b).\n5 See Federal Open Market Committee (2012).\n6 Federal Open Market Committee (2015b).\n7 Federal Open Market Committee (2012).\n8 Yellen (2015).\n9 Federal Open Market Committee (2015a).\n10 Federal Open Market Committee (2015a).\n\nReferences\nColby, Sandra L., and Jennifer M.

            "content": "Introduction\nGood afternoon and thank you. Before I begin my remarks today, I should note that my comments reflect my own views and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System.\nFor me, the start of each new year marks a time for contemplating the past and for looking forward to the future. As many of you likely do, I begin each year optimistically, resolving to do things better, such as exercising more and eating more healthily. But as the months pass, I generally get sidetracked, despite the best of intentions. Of course, this is the year it will be different.\nRecently, when I was putting together my forecast for the economy, I was struck by the realization that in each of the past six years I began with an optimistic view of how fast the economy was going to grow — only to be disappointed with the numbers coming in below my projections. To be candid, my batting average has been similar to my forecasts for exercise and healthy eating. For example, as 2015 began, I was expecting growth for the year to be in the range of 2-1/2 to 3 percent. Instead, it looks like real gross domestic product (GDP) rose roughly 2 percent. As errors go, this isn’t a particularly big one. But it is a noticeable one, and continues a string of downside misses that, frankly, has been getting tiresome.\nSo what about this year? Well, I’ve scaled things back a bit, and anticipate the economy will grow in the range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent in 2016. So, close to or a bit better than this past year. I also expect the unemployment rate to come down a couple of tenths and end the year at about 4-3/4 percent.\nThe central point underlying my forecast is that the fundamentals for most components of domestic spending are good. Most importantly, we’ve seen a substantial improvement in labor markets over the past several years. The unemployment rate is currently 5.0 percent; that’s down from its high of 10.0 percent in late 2009. Let me put this into context: One of the two goals for Federal Reserve policy mandated by Congress is to help the economy achieve maximum employment. Along with most of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee, I judge that maximum employment is consistent with an unemployment rate that averages a little under 5 percent over the longer run. Now a few other labor market indicators — such as the large number of people who are employed part time but who would prefer a full-time job and subdued wage growth — suggest there remains some additional resource slack beyond what is indicated by the unemployment rate alone. So I don’t think we have quite met our employment mandate. But we certainly have made great progress toward meeting that goal.\nHealthy labor markets portend continued job gains, growth in households’ income, and buoyant consumer confidence. These developments, along with low energy prices and some further increases in household wealth, should support fairly solid gains in consumer spending. Furthermore, as I’ll talk about more in a minute, my forecast also assumes interest rates will stay quite low for some time. This should help bolster consumer spending — for example, low borrowing rates helped push new motor vehicle sales in 2015 to near-record levels. Healthy labor markets and low interest rates will also help housing markets. Indeed, although new home building still remains below what would be considered normal, growth in residential investment has picked up over the past couple of quarters. Another plus for domestic spending is that the recent budget deal should mean we’ll see a modest increase in federal spending this year.\nDevelopments abroad, however, are offsetting the positive momentum in domestic fundamentals to some degree. The slow-down in global economic growth — notably in emerging markets — and uncertainty about future prospects have contributed to a rising dollar and declining commodity prices over the past two years. As a result, U.S. manufacturers and agricultural producers that sell their products in global markets face challenges — as do oil, gas and mining companies and their suppliers. That said, if foreign growth prospects and the dollar stabilize, as most expect, these headwinds on domestic growth should dissipate. Still, we should not expect the international sector to be an engine for U.S. growth for some time.\nMy Growth Forecast in Context\nNow, by historical standards, GDP growth in the range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent doesn’t seem particularly optimistic. It’s in line with the average annualized growth rate of 2.2 percent since the end of the Great Recession. By comparison, GDP growth averaged closer to an annual rate of 3.5 percent over the previous three expansions. What’s going on?\nOf course, the financial crisis and the ensuing Great Recession had far-reaching negative effects. And even though we’ve come a long way in healing those wounds, some related headwinds still remain and will take some time to dissipate. But other factors could also be in play that mean lower long-run growth may be a troubling feature of the U.S. economy even after the effects of Great Recession are behind us.\nBroadly speaking, an economy’s long-run growth potential depends upon increases in its productive resources and the technological improvements that enable those resources to produce more. One important productive resource is labor. Here, demographic trends are working against us. The U.S. Census Bureau projects that the population aged 16 and over will grow a little less than 1 percent per year for the rest of this decade; this is lower than what we experienced during the late 1990s, when average annual growth of the adult population was 1.3 percent.\nMoreover, our population is greying. Over the next 10 years, the share of the population that is 65 or older is expected to increase about 4 percentage points from 15 to 19 percent.\nThis aging of the population and other long-running trends have been bringing down the fraction of the population that is actually in the labor force since about 2000. The labor force participation rate has also likely been pushed somewhat lower by what was, for many years, a poor labor market.1 However, the labor force participation rate dropped approximately 2-1/2 percentage points even as labor market conditions began to improve. And estimates suggest the decline will continue, reducing the growth of available workers in the long run by about 0.5 percent per year.2 Slower growth in available workers translates into less potential output growth.\nAs I just mentioned, economic growth over the longer run also depends upon technological progress. Unfortunately, we can’t measure technological progress directly. Instead, it is inferred as a residual only after accounting for other tangible reasons for growth in a measure that is referred to as total factor productivity (TFP). By its very nature, TFP is not measured precisely, and it’s difficult to discern its underlying trends. Nonetheless, there have been noticeable shifts in estimated TFP growth in the past several decades. From the early 1970s to the mid-1990s, the growth rate of TFP slowed down from its post-World War II highs. With the advances in information technology and their widespread adoption, we experienced a surge in TFP growth from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s. Since then, however, TFP growth has reverted to its pre-1994 pace.3 Moreover, there is concern among many analysts that it may now be persistently lower than in the past. If this weaker TFP growth proves to be the new normal, potential economic growth would decline in tandem.\n\nWhether these factors that hold down the potential growth rate of the economy are temporary or more permanent is a matter of considerable debate. But if you come down on the side that these are quite persistent developments, then you must conclude that we face a lower potential growth rate today than we did in previous post- World War II expansions.\n\nThis assessment is reflected to some degree in the economic projections of FOMC participants. Four times a year, the FOMC releases its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which gives FOMC participants’ forecasts of key economic variables over the next three years and for the longer run.4 As recently as January 2012, FOMC participants assessed the long-run potential growth rate of the economy to be in the 2-1/4 to 3 percent range.5 Today, the median participant believes that longer-run real GDP growth is only 2.0 percent. Even the most optimistic of my colleagues places this number only slightly higher at 2.3 percent.\n\nWhen measured against these benchmarks, my forecast of GDP rising in the range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent in 2016 doesn’t look so bad. It’s simply saying that the economy will expand near its longer-run productive capabilities. This number may be disappointing — we would certainly like stronger sustainable growth — but there is nothing much that monetary policy can do about working-age population growth, labor force participation trends, and technical progress. These trend estimates are the benchmarks we must take as given when deciding how to set monetary policy.\nLower Potential Growth, Lower Equilibrium Interest Rates\nThat is not to say, however, that these benchmarks do not influence policy. Importantly, lower potential output growth implies lower returns to investment. As a result, the equilibrium real interest rates, which are consistent with fully employed resources, are lower in an economy with lower potential output growth. And, of course, lower real rates imply lower nominal rates even when inflation is at its target. So, the equilibrium federal funds rate, which is associated with a neutral monetary policy — policy that is neither expansionary nor contractionary — is lower in an economy with a lower potential output growth. Therefore, the FOMC must take estimates of potential output growth into account when calibrating the stance of monetary policy.\n\nOf course, there are other reasons why equilibrium interest rates are likely lower than they were before the crisis. For example, former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke has discussed frequently the global savings glut. As the world population has aged and as residents of fast-growing emerging economies have grown wealthier, the saving rate in most countries has increased. This has resulted in a larger pool of funds seeking safe, profitable opportunities for investment. However, domestic investment opportunities in most of these countries have not kept pace with the increased saving rates. This higher supply of investable funds relative to domestic demand has driven down interest rates worldwide. In addition, former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers has expanded on these influences, speculating that soft aggregate demand worldwide has discouraged structural investment and capital stock growth — his view of the “secular stagnation” hypothesis. These two ideas are closely related.\n\nAll of these factors imply that the federal funds rate consistent with a neutral stance for monetary policy may be lower than we used to think. How big might these changes be? Well, in December, FOMC participants’ projections for the longer-run nominal federal funds rate were in the range of 3 to 4 percent, with the median projection at 3.5 percent.6 Three years ago, when forecasts of potential growth were higher, the Committee was projecting the long-run funds rate would be in the range of 3-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent — about 50 basis points higher than today’s estimates.7\n\nWhat Is Next for Monetary Policy?\nSo we are likely headed toward a lower resting point for the federal funds rate than before. What is the path to that level likely to look like over the next several years?\nAs I’m sure you are aware, in December the FOMC voted to increase the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 1/4 to 1/2 percent. It was the first time since June 2006 that the FOMC has raised its policy rate. As Chair Janet Yellen explained during her press conference after the meeting, “With the economy performing well and expected to continue to do so, the Committee judged that a modest increase in the federal funds rate target is now appropriate, recognizing that even after this increase monetary policy remains accommodative.”8\n Yellen’s words underscore the intention for the stance of monetary policy to remain accommodative for some time, and the Committee’s latest statement anticipates making gradual adjustments during policy normalization.9 But, if we are near our employment mandate and the prospects for growth look solid, why are we expecting to take this gradual approach? What is different during this tightening cycle?\n\nOne issue is that the equilibrium, or the neutral, federal funds rate can move over the business cycle for a variety of reasons, and can be either above or below its long-run level. Currently, we think some remaining fallout from the financial crisis and international headwinds mean that the neutral level of the federal funds rate today is even lower than it will be in the long run. By some estimates, the equilibrium inflation-adjusted rate is currently near zero. This rate should rise gradually as the headwinds fade over time. But until they do, monetary policy rates must be even lower than they otherwise would be to provide adequate accommodation for economic growth.\nPersistently Low Inflation\nBut that is only part of the answer to why monetary policy rates are below long-run neutral levels. The other part is that we have yet to achieve our inflation goal. We need to pursue a sufficiently accommodative monetary policy if we are to achieve the inflation goal over the medium term.\n\nThus far, my remarks have focused on only one aspect of our policy goals: full employment. But monetary policy has another objective: The other goal Congress has set for us is the achievement of price stability. The FOMC interprets this objective to mean that inflation should average 2 percent over the medium term as measured by the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE).\n\nWe have not done well relative to this objective. Over the past eight years, PCE inflation has averaged 1.5 percent, with the latest reading at just 0.4 percent. We often look at core inflation, which strips out the volatile food and energy components, as a good indicator of where total inflation is likely to be headed over the next year or so. Well, core inflation has been just 1.3 percent over the past 12 months.\n\nOverall inflation is being held down in part by lower energy prices. The higher dollar is also weighing on both total inflation and core inflation. I expect these effects to dissipate as we move through the year. Further improvements in labor markets and growth in economic activity should also boost inflation. And so I see inflation moving up gradually to approach our 2 percent inflation target within the next three years.\n\nHowever, there are some downside risks to this forecast. We might see further declines in energy prices or greater appreciation of the dollar. In addition, undershooting our 2 percent inflation target for as long as we have invites the risk of the public beginning to expect persistently low inflation in the future. If this mindset becomes embedded in decisions regarding wages and prices, then getting inflation back to 2 percent will be that much more difficult. Here, I find it troubling that the compensation for prospective inflation built into a number of financial market asset prices has drifted down considerably over the past two years. More recently, some survey-based measures of inflation expectations, which had previously seemed unmovable, have also edged down. So to achieve our inflation target — and to provide a buffer against downside risks — it is appropriate that we follow a gradual path to policy normalization.\n\nWhat is the gradual path that FOMC participants anticipate? Here is the well-known “dot plot,” which shows FOMC participants’ views of the appropriate target federal funds rate at the end of each of the next three years and in the longer run. Each participant’s fed funds rate forecast is shown as a distinct dot at each of these time horizons. The chart I’m showing here is the most recent one we did for last December’s FOMC meeting.\n\n\nFocus for a moment on the median policy projections, indicated by the red dots. Most of my colleagues thought that it would be appropriate to raise the target federal funds rate at our last meeting. By the end of 2016, the median participant envisioned the fed funds rate to be about a percentage point higher than it is today. With eight FOMC meetings a year, this path is consistent with the target federal funds rate, on average, increasing by 25 basis points at every other FOMC meeting. By historical standards, this is certainly a gradual path. It is even slower than the so-called measured pace of increases over the 2004–06 tightening cycle, which was 25 basis points per meeting.\n\nOverall, I think appropriate policy is consistent with some of the most accommodative dots on the chart. One reason I arrive at this conclusion is because I am less optimistic about the inflation outlook than most of my colleagues. Given the persistently-low- inflation record of the past six years and given how slowly inflation evolves when it is at such low levels, it may be difficult to return inflation to target over the next two or three years. So I’m in favor of very gradual policy normalization to help ensure that we meet our inflation goal within a reasonable amount of time. Moreover, as I have argued many times, prudent risk management calls for a slower removal of accommodative monetary policy. From my perspective, the costs of raising the federal funds rate too quickly far exceed the costs of removing accommodation too slowly. So taking both of these concerns into account — and considering how I think economic conditions will evolve over time — I believe that policy should plan to follow an even shallower path for the federal funds rate than currently envisioned by the median FOMC participant.\n\nI would like to conclude by noting that as much as we would like to be able to convey the exact timing and magnitude of future policy actions, there is no single, predetermined rate path that is consistent with a gradual approach. This is because while our goal is clear — to reach our dual mandate targets — our view of the road ahead may need to be modified. It is what you hear FOMC participants and market commentators often refer to as being “data dependent.” To use a metaphor, it’s a little like my golf game. My plan is to hit a drive smack down the center of the fairway; stick an iron close to the pin; and drain a putt for the birdie. But my actual shot-making depends upon how well I judge the crosswinds or if that unfair bounce off the sprinkler head leaves me with a nasty lie in the fairway bunker. As I stand on the tee and think through my approach, one thing is certain: I have to play the next shot from wherever I end up. Adjustments may need to be made.\n\nSo it is with monetary policy. My views are not set in stone. If the incoming data move my inflation projections up, I would adjust my policy views in tandem and would raise my federal funds rate projection more quickly than I currently envision. If we were hit by an unexpected shock that set back the growth outlook, I would favor a more accommodative policy than I envision today. This is what it means to be data dependent. Of course, I will not be alone in taking this approach. As the December FOMC statement announcing the policy change made clear over the coming months and years, “the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.” 10\n\nThank you.\nNotes\n1 The labor force participation rate dropped 1 percentage point while the unemployment rate escalated during the downturn.\n2 This projection contrasts with what happened during the late 1990s, when increasing labor force participation was raising available labor supply by 0.2 percent per year.\n3 For example, Congressional Budget Office (2015) and Fernald (2014) provide estimates of TFP growth and discuss the changes that have taken place in the past.\n4 For the most recent summary, see Federal Open Market Committee (2015b).\n5 See Federal Open Market Committee (2012).\n6 Federal Open Market Committee (2015b).\n7 Federal Open Market Committee (2012).\n8 Yellen (2015).\n9 Federal Open Market Committee (2015a).\n10 Federal Open Market Committee (2015a).\n\nReferences\nColby, Sandra L., and Jennifer M.

            "content": "Executive summary1\nReal activity in the U.S. is solid, but inflation is—and has been for quite some time—too low.\nI am concerned that persistent factors are holding down inflation, rather than idiosyncratic transitory ones. Namely, the public’s inflation expectations appear to me to have drifted down below the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) 2 percent symmetric inflation target.\nIn order to dispel any impression that 2 percent is a ceiling, our communications should be much clearer about our willingness to deliver on a symmetric inflation outcome, acknowledging a greater chance of inflation at 2-1/2 percent in the future than what has been communicated in the past.\nSuch communications would shore up our credibility and demonstrate our commitment. They would also increase policymakers’ ability to attain their goals in normal times and to strengthen the policy framework to deal with future challenges presented by unexpected economic and financial developments.2\nIntroduction\nThe real economy in the U.S. is on solid footing, and I expect this momentum to carry forward into 2018. Many private sector forecasts see annualized gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the fourth quarter of 2017 in the range of 2-1/2 to 3 percent; if realized, this would put the increase in output for the year as a whole at about 2-1/2 percent. This is noticeably above the 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent pace we at the Chicago Fed see as the current underlying trend, or potential, growth rate of the economy.\nFor some time now, activity in the U.S. has been led by solid gains in consumer spending; and more recently, growth in business capital spending has picked back up as well. With healthy labor markets and much improved household and business balance sheets, the fundamentals for continued solid growth in 2018 look pretty good.\nThe news on inflation, however, has not been as good. The 12-month change in core PCE prices was just 1.3 percent in September. This is well below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent inflation target.3\nInflation has been too low for many years\nIndeed, inflation has underrun our target throughout most of the post-crisis period. Core inflation did briefly reach target in early 2012, aided by the pass-through of earlier increases in energy costs, but it soon retreated. In the summer of 2016, core inflation rose to just under 2 percent, but it then fell sharply last March and has remained in the 1.3 to 1.5 percent range since then.\nMany economists subscribe to the view that this latest drop in core inflation simply reflects temporary factors and that by early next year inflation will be back close to target. I agree this is possible. After all, we can point to some apparently one-off idiosyncratic factors that contributed to the March decline. And if this were our first bout of unexpectedly low inflation this policy cycle, I’d be quite receptive to looking through the most recent inflation data in formulating policy.\nBut this is not our first bout of unexpectedly low inflation during this policy cycle. For years, the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) have had us reaching our 2 percent target in another year or two.4 And for years this hasn’t happened.\nAt times we’ve been able to explain our misses with some easily identifiable transitory factors, such as energy price pass-through or a higher dollar. But that isn’t true now. And with each low monthly reading, it gets harder and harder for me to feel comfortable with the idea that the step-down last spring was simply transitory.\nInflation expectations have drifted down\nIndeed, I’m concerned something more persistent is holding down inflation today. Namely, I feel we are facing below-target inflation expectations.\nOver the past several years, numerous measures of longer-run inflation expectations have moved down noticeably. Of course, inflation expectations serve as an important benchmark for the wage demands of workers and the pricing decisions of businesses, and thus are key determinants of actual inflation itself.\nThe movements in these measures haven’t gone unnoticed by the FOMC. With regard to inflation compensation in financial markets, since October 2014 the first paragraph of our policy statements have acknowledged either that it had moved down or that it had remained substantially unchanged from last time, but at a low level. Only once—with the rise in ten-year Treasuries after the presidential election—did we note a sizable increase, but we still had to caution that inflation compensation remained low.5\nSome take comfort in the observation that inflation compensation hasn’t declined further this year as actual inflation has fallen. But the fact remains that the level of inflation compensation is still low.\nThere are other measures of inflation expectations which are collected from surveys of households and businesses. The FOMC statements at times have noted the low levels of some of these measures, but they more often refer to the surveys as being stable.\nPersonally, I think the stability assessment overweights the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) long-run PCE inflation expectations.6 This is the average of the ten-year inflation forecasts made by about 40 professional economic forecasters. It’s been almost rock solid at 2 percent since 2013.\nIt reminds me of when I was doing math homework in high school. At least in the U.S., the answers to the odd-numbered questions are in the back of the textbook. Well, I think everyone answering the SPF is reading the Fed’s back-of-the-book answer—our inflation target of 2 percent.\nNow the Fed does not have a back-of-the-book answer for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) because we don’t target that index. And sure enough, the SPF’s ten-year CPI projections have generally drifted lower and are about 25 basis points below where they were before the recession. I don’t think there is good reason to forecast a narrowing of the CPI–PCE wedge.\nFurthermore, inflation expectations measured by surveys of households have also come down. An important one in the U.S. is done by the University of Michigan, and its five- to ten-year inflation expectations measure has fallen 50 basis points since 2006.7\nWhen I look at the downward drift in multiple expectations measures, I find it tougher to confidently buy into the idea that inflation today is just temporarily low once again.\nThe need for clear communications about symmetry of 2 percent inflation target\nWhy might inflation expectations have drifted down? The FOMC’s 2 percent inflation target is a symmetric one—that is, the Committee is concerned about inflation running either persistently above or persistently below 2 percent. One concern I have is that the public instead thinks the Fed views 2 percent as a ceiling that it aims to keep inflation under.\nBy and large, central bankers are conservative types who view their most important task as preventing an outbreak of 1970s-style inflation. So perhaps then it’s not surprising that we as a group have not convincingly demonstrated to the public our commitment to a symmetric inflation target.\nIndeed, actual inflation outcomes in the U.S. have been far from symmetric. As I noted earlier, core PCE inflation has come close to 2 percent only a couple of times since the recession ended in mid-2009, and these periods were far too short to be consistent with symmetry. This performance could easily be confused with a purposeful strategy in which 2 percent is a ceiling.\nOur projections and our commentary about them could reinforce this impression as well. For multiple rounds, SEP forecasts have had inflation gliding up to target under policy paths that do not generate a meaningful risk of inflation rising much above 2 percent. In one sense, this is a natural feature of a forecast. You’re thinking about a path that, in the absence of future shocks, will bring inflation to your target. Once there, you know unexpected events will push you above and below 2 percent; but these deviations will be by accident, not by design.\nIn order to dispel the view that 2 percent is a ceiling, I feel our communications should be much clearer about our willingness to deliver on a symmetric inflation outcome. This means our public commentary needs to acknowledge a much greater chance of inflation running at 2-1/2 percent in the coming years than I believe we have communicated in the past.\nFailure to achieve 2 percent symmetric inflation target poses a risk\nI believe this issue is especially important now because there is a big strategic risk in failing to get core PCE inflation symmetrically around 2 percent before this economic cycle ends.\nAt some point in the future, some unexpected economic shock will generate a downturn in activity. When it comes, monetary policy will likely need to provide substantial accommodation to address rising unemployment and below-target inflation.\nAs many economists have been talking about, we currently live in a world with low trend output growth and low equilibrium interest rates.8 For example, the FOMC’s consensus view for the long-run equilibrium federal funds rate is 2-3/4 percent.9 This means that we don’t have as much room as we have in the past to lower rates in response to a negative shock. In such an environment, a return to the zero lower bound (ZLB) on rates is much more likely.\nEffective monetary policy actions at the ZLB often take the form of commitments regarding future policy rates or the scale and scope of nonstandard policies. For these to work, central banks need substantial credibility for meeting their mandated policy responsibilities, particularly their inflation targets. For the U.S, this means achieving our symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.\nI also worry that giving too much prominence to financial stability considerations in discussions of monetary policy could erode the public’s confidence in our commitment to our 2 percent inflation objective. Financial stability is obviously very important. But there are better tools than monetary policy for promoting it. In contrast, when it comes to meeting our inflation objective, monetary policy is the only game in town.\nIf we let that credibility deteriorate toward a public belief that 2 percent is a ceiling for inflation, we could be in for the kind of trouble that the Bank of Japan has faced for so long. So we should now be fortifying our efforts—reinforcing our commitment to symmetry—so that future policy actions have the best chance for success in a low equilibrium interest rate world.\nNotes\n1 The views expressed here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or within the Federal Reserve System.\n2 See Evans (2017) for my views on the role of communications in strengthening the monetary policy framework so that it has the flexibility and the reach to attain policy goals even in unusual and unexpected circumstances.\n3 In January 2012, the FOMC set 2 percent inflation—measured by the annual change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE)—as the explicit inflation target consistent with our price stability mandate (Federal Open Market Committee, 2012). While our objective is stated in terms of overall PCE inflation, core inflation—which strips out the volatile food and energy sectors—is a better gauge of sustained inflationary pressures and where inflation is headed in the future.\n4 Four times a year the FOMC releases its Summary of Economic Projections, which presents FOMC participants’ forecasts of key economic variables over the next three years and for the longer run. Participants also provide their assessments of the appropriate monetary policy that supports those forecasts. For the most recent SEP, see Federal Open Market Committee (2017).\n5 Federal Open Market Committee (2016).\n6 Details on the SPF are available online.\n7 Details on the University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers are available online.\n8 Equilibrium real interest rates are the rates consistent with the full employment of the economy’s productive resources. The equilibrium interest rate is sometimes called the “natural” or “neutral” interest rate.\n9 The equilibrium federal funds rate is the funds rate associated with a neutral monetary policy (policy that is neither expansionary nor contractionary).\nReferences\nEvans, Charles L., 2017, “The future of Odyssean and Delphic guidance,” speech, Central Bank Communications Conference: Communications Challenges for Policy Effectiveness, Accountability and Reputation, European Central Bank, Frankfurt, Germany, November 14, available online.\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2017, Summary of Economic Projections, Washington, DC, September 20, available online.\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2016, press release, Washington, DC, December 14, available online.\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2012, press release, Washington, DC, January 25, available online.",

            "content": "Executive summary1\n  Today, in discussing “Delphic” and “Odyssean” forward guidance, I am going to expand a bit beyond narrow, technical definitions.2 In a recent NBER Macroeconomics Annual Conference paper, my colleagues Jeffrey Campbell, Jonas Fisher, Alejandro Justiniano, and Leonardo Melosi developed an empirical framework to assess Delphic versus Odyssean contributions for post-financial-crisis Fed actions (Campbell et al., 2017). They found important roles for both.\nI want to relate this language to some broader issues regarding monetary policy frameworks. Specifically, I will talk about Delphic communications as those associated with a well-functioning, well-understood monetary policy framework. A foundation for these communications is a variety of state-contingent responses to economic developments that are well understood and well expected by the public.\nI’ll refer to Odyssean communications as those arising when unexpected events expose weaknesses and shortcomings in a Delphic framework. In such times, the need for outcome-based policies is paramount, and policymakers may be compelled to take less-well-understood actions to meet their mandated goals. These actions may dispense with usual norms and could entail entirely new commitments about future central bank behavior. As such, these Odyssean policies might be difficult to communicate and might lack strong credibility. These shortcomings could dilute their effectiveness. So my question is this: How do you convert nonstandard Odyssean policies into a better-understood and more effective Delphic framework?\nWell, you do so by strengthening your current monetary policy framework. Ben Bernanke’s recent proposal at the Peterson Institute for International Economics regarding temporary price-level targeting (PLT) is one such example.3\nFurthermore, the journey from the Fed’s 2010 policy debates about temporary price-level targeting at the zero lower bound (ZLB) to Bernanke’s recent proposal illustrates the challenges in transforming Odyssean policies into Delphic ones. I will get to this story momentarily, but let me develop the Delphic and Odyssean issues a bit more first.\nCentral bank communications—Delphic and Odyssean\nCentral banks employ a wide variety of communications. Just for a moment, let me ask, why do central banks need to communicate anything?\nOne reason is to inform the public about the broad contours of the likely path of monetary policy over the next three to five years. Clear and transparent communications help both the public and the policymakers. Information about the likely path of future policy helps shape the public’s expectations of key economic factors that, in turn, influence their spending and investment decisions. Clear communications also make monetary policy more effective by better aligning private sector expectations with the actions central banks take to achieve their goals.\nOne can imagine that—in an ideal world—it would be enough for a central bank to describe the goals of monetary policy, provide the economic outlook, explain how it would adjust the policy tools in order to achieve these goals over the appropriate time period, and leave it at that.\nIn earlier times, we at the Fed didn’t think we needed to do much communicating. Indeed, before 1994, Fed communications following a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting was simply: “The FOMC meeting has ended.” Markets had to figure out the policy decision from the New York Fed trading desk’s daily trading actions. Minutes and the actual directive to the trading desk were published three months later, after the next meeting ended. Back in the late 1980s, most other central banks shared the Fed’s lack of transparency.\nSince then, policymakers have come to appreciate more fully the critical role of clear communications in setting policy and achieving their goals. Starting with innovators such as the Bank of England and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, central banks have come a long way. They set specific inflation targets, publish inflation reports, provide economic and policy rate projections, hold press conferences, and so on.\nStill, these communications channels, by and large, are about business-as-usual monetary policy in normal times. However, as you know, the challenges of the past ten years exposed the shortcomings of these channels. In light of this experience, how should we use communications to implement effective and credible monetary policy going forward? Does the nature of the uncertainty over different policy actions require different forms of communications?\nLet’s start by framing our past communications in the Delphic and Odyssean terminology I introduced at the start of my talk.\nDelphic communications is about conveying monetary policy during normal times. This is when the central bank—based on forecast inferences and a well-understood policy framework—gives its best assessments of where monetary policy is likely to be going. This framework can encompass the responses to even large shocks if there is ample scope to adjust the policy instrument accordingly. Inflation and monetary policy reports are central bank documents that support these communications. Ideally, 1) the framework is credible; 2) it encompasses a variety of economic conditions; 3) it can be described by objectively measured variables; and 4) it has well-defined and verifiable policy goals. Delphic communications would then be a central bank describing its policy response function—say, either as a traditional Taylor rule4 or as the solution of an optimal control problem.\nBut the macroeconomic environment can change beyond the scope of an existing policy framework. In the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis, a large variety of unconventional monetary policies were developed and deployed around the world. Generally, such new tools begin as small adjustments to more conventional and Delphic policies. But at some point, in extreme circumstances, monetary policy is more likely to enter the realm of Odysseus. The new tools required new communications.\nLet me use the Fed’s recent experiences at the ZLB to illustrate what I mean.\nFed unconventional policies and Odyssean guidance\nIn March 2009, the FOMC initiated QE1 that expanded its balance sheet by nearly $2 trillion.5 The hope was that $2 trillion would be sufficient to support a strong rebound in activity. But in the summer of 2010, the core PCE inflation rate6 in the U.S. was below 1.5 percent and the unemployment rate was near 10 percent. Moreover, no significant improvements were projected in the near term. As a result, the Taylor rule at that time prescribed setting the U.S. policy rate roughly at −5 percent.7 Clearly, such a negative rate was far beyond the scope of the existing monetary policy framework.\nNonetheless, more stimulus was needed. In the fall of 2010, the consensus of the FOMC was to initiate another $600 billion of asset purchases (QE2).8 Economic and inflation improvements through mid-2011 gave rise, once again, to the hope that this additional $600 billion would be sufficient. Indeed, the FOMC began to publicly plan for unwinding the stimulus, publishing a set of “Exit Strategy Principles” following the June 2011 meeting.9 But only a month later, it became clearer that more action was needed to achieve our policy goals of maximum employment and price stability.\nFrom this point on, the FOMC undertook several additional actions. In August 2011, the FOMC used calendar-date forward guidance to communicate that it anticipated keeping the funds rate at zero at least until mid-2013.10 And shortly afterward we announced the Maturity Extension Program, or Operation Twist, both to further support the credibility of the calendar-date forward guidance and to extend the portfolio balance effect.11\nEven though these policies were nominally conditional on economic outcomes, the first-order inference was that—like Odysseus—we had bound ourselves to the mast of a time-inconsistent policy to keep rates on hold until mid-2013. But if inflation and activity accelerated in 2012, would the public really believe that we would follow through on our promise? As we all know, such doubts about credibility dilute the effects of any policy, but they are particularly damaging for Odyssean actions.\nIn the end, more actions were needed—and were taken. I strongly believe our unconventional policy moves at the ZLB were effective. But there is no doubt that they were challenging to communicate. And I have little doubt that the policy actions might have been even more effective if they were part of a previously established, well-understood, and credible framework.\nAt this point, you have to ask yourself a number of questions. What are the challenges of introducing a new framework in the midst of a crisis? How important is it to develop the framework before the crisis? How do you ensure it is effective and credible? Let me address these questions with a story that takes us back a few years. In the summer of 2010, the FOMC was looking at FRB/US simulations12 that showed optimal policy with a real federal funds rate of −6 percent or so.13 As I mentioned earlier, at that time, we were well short of both legs of our dual mandate, with forecasts pointing to continued shortfalls from our goals for the foreseeable future.\nAt the ZLB, the only way we could come anywhere close to −6 percent was through a dose of higher expected inflation.\nOne option I pitched to the Committee was to administer that dose through state-contingent price-level targeting. This was quite similar to Bernanke’s recent proposal. This policy would hold the funds rate at the ZLB until the price level recovered to a 2 percent trend line starting from the end of the previous expansion. If successful, the U.S. economy would experience a temporary period of above-2 percent inflation, which would lower real interest rates and boost economic activity. I first spoke about this issue at the August 2010 FOMC meeting, circulated a written proposal for the September meeting, and gave a public presentation at a Boston Fed conference that fall.14\nNow recall that around this time Blanchard, Dell’Ariccia, and Mauro (2010) and others were suggesting—in the spirit of blue-sky thinking—that central banks could consider raising their long-run inflation objective to something like 4 percent in order to avoid the threat of the ZLB. But at the August 2010 Jackson Hole conference, Chairman Bernanke said that the FOMC had no taste for inflation much higher than 2 percent over the medium term, which was loosely what he was referring to as “price stability” in 2010.15\nNow, one issue with price-level targeting is that its promise of above-target inflation for a limited period of time could be confused with the central bank raising its longer-run target. Given the prominent public debate over inflation targets in 2010, avoiding the misperception of a stealth increase in the inflation target would have required Odyssean communications of enormous (Herculean) proportions.\nAnd indeed, my state-contingent price-level targeting proposal didn’t gain any traction. Read the September 2010 FOMC transcript16 and note the unsympathetic but wise reaction from soon-to-be Vice Chair Yellen. This example illustrates the difficulties of introducing a new framework in the midst of unfamiliar circumstances. If you want to use policies that are outside of the current framework, then you need to do some very elaborate promising and hard work to establish the credibility of those actions. And this just may not be possible to do when you’re in such uncharted waters.\nUltimately, the FOMC did adopt a series of policies that had a mild Odyssean flavor. The continued disappointing economic performance into 2012 convinced the Committee that it was worth taking these additional actions. But we never did get to something as extreme as temporary price-level targeting.\nTurning Odyssean policies into Delphic ones\nFast forward to about a month ago. As I mentioned before, at a conference at the Peterson Institute—Rethinking Macroeconomic Policy—Ben Bernanke proposed a new state-contingent monetary policy framework.17 In normal times, the framework calls for business-as-usual policy. But, if constrained by the ZLB, the framework would switch to temporary price-level targeting. This is a well-defined change in the monetary policy rule, objectively triggered by the federal funds rate falling to zero.\nSo what has changed between 2010 and 2017 to make temporary price-level targeting more feasible?\nWell, we face better and calmer economic circumstances. More importantly, though, we now recognize that we could face more frequent and prolonged bouts of policy constrained by the ZLB than we had ever previously imagined. So it is now more apparent that we should think ahead about how our framework can be adjusted to more effectively address this circumstance. I applaud efforts such as the Peterson Institute conference and the one here today as important contributions for our future work.\nDeveloping a new framework prior to the next ZLB episode allows time for a shift in the nature of forward guidance—and communications more generally. Suppose, for example, the FOMC were to adopt Bernanke’s proposal today. If we then hit the ZLB, the contours of the unconventional PLT policy would already be known. All that would be left is communication of its technical parameters. In other words, the policy would be essentially Delphic instead of Odyssean.\nAdopting this policy in the fall of 2010 was asking a great deal. The forward guidance needed to communicate the brand-new state-contingent price-level targeting would have been a lot for the public to absorb without any credible prior experience. We need to prepare the public ahead of time for implementing unconventional policies in unconventional times. The policies would then be better understood ex ante, better studied, and better critiqued and refined; they would, therefore, likely be more effective.\nFurthermore, policymakers need to prepare themselves. Delphic forward guidance is the most likely strategy that can garner a consensus position because it is close to a standard operating procedure and because it largely entails technical, quantitative guidance. Of course, adequate policy flexibility and reach requires a robust framework with many state-contingent branches worked out ahead of time. A number of policies could fit into the mix, but you need to get agreement on them ex ante. With regard to price-level targeting, it may be possible to implement now following careful analysis and deliberative discussions; but in 2010, it was just too hard.\nLet me be very clear: My aim today is not to argue for state-contingent price-level targeting. That may be a good way to go, but at this point I just don’t know.\nMy point is that we should be planning for these inevitable future situations today. A good starting point may be to consider nonstandard policies that are not very far from our familiar operating framework. The thresholds-based forward guidance the FOMC adopted in December 2012 was one such example;18 so was the optimal-control-based “lower-for-longer” policy path that Chair Yellen discussed in a June 2012 speech.19 Still, the new quantitative commitments in even such less radical policies may be difficult to grasp. But a key to success is keeping any nonstandard policies outcome-based. This is crucial to guiding policymakers and informing the public about where we aim to go.\nFinally, for new policies to have a chance of succeeding, at a minimum, it’s essential to ensure policy remains credible in more normal circumstances. I’ve spoken on this many times elsewhere. I believe our credibility challenge in the U.S. today is delivering on the FOMC’s symmetric 2 percent inflation target. If we fail to do so under our current relatively normal circumstances, why then would the public believe us in the future when we try again to implement unconventional policies? And what if the circumstances are so large that they require Odyssean efforts? Where would we be then?\nThank you.\nNotes\n1 The views expressed here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or within the Federal Reserve System.\n2 The terms “Delphic” and “Odyssean” are used to describe different types of monetary policy communications.

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you, Birgit, for that kind introduction. It is always a pleasure to visit Grand Rapids, which is notable for many reasons, native son Gerald Ford and micro-breweries not least among them.\nToday, I would like to share with you my thoughts on the course of the economy and monetary policy. First, though, I need to issue the usual disclaimer, namely, that the views I will express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System.\nAs you know, to combat the financial crisis, the Fed made dramatic cuts in its main interest rate policy tool, the federal funds rate, bringing it essentially to zero in December 2008. That is about as low as it can go. Seven years later, in December 2015, the Fed finally felt economic and financial conditions had improved enough that we could lift the funds rate from this lower bound. Since then, we have very gradually increased the funds rate, and today it lies in a range between 1 and 1-1/4 percent.1\nMy main message this afternoon is that such a gradual and cautious approach continues to be the appropriate strategy as we contemplate the next steps in our path toward policy normalization.\nCongress has mandated the FOMC formulate monetary policy to achieve the dual goals of full employment and price stability.2 The fundamentals for economic growth in the U.S. are sound, and we are close to our full employment goal. But inflation has been lower than the FOMC’s 2 percent target for too long, and there is little in the recent data to suggest that inflation will soon rise to target. So I believe maintaining policy accommodation until we are more demonstrably on a sustainable path to 2 percent is key for reaching that objective—and for maintaining the credibility of our price stability goal.\nOutlook: Close to full employment but inflation is too low\nNow for the details. Let me start with the economic outlook.\nThe U.S. economy has made tremendous progress in recent years, and the fundamentals are sound. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the first half of this year averaged about 2 percent, moderately above the U.S. economy’s current trend rate of growth, which my staff estimates at around 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent.\nThe outlook for the rest of the year is complicated by the devastation caused by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. It is too early to assess the impact of these terrible events on the national economy. Based on past experiences with natural disasters, we should expect lower national output growth in the third quarter. Of course, there is a lot of uncertainty about the size of the effects—current private-sector estimates of the hurricanes’ effects range between 1/2 to 3 percent, with most centering around 1 percent or a little less. After that, we should see some boost to growth as economic activity recovers and rebuilding efforts get under way. But even though the GDP growth numbers may average out in the end, we should not lose sight of the horrible costs of the hurricanes—first and foremost, in terms of the human suffering and, second, in terms of the destruction of economic infrastructure and personal and business property.\nLooking past the hurricane effects, we can expect solid growth for the aggregate U.S. economy. In projections made just last week, the median FOMC participant anticipates real GDP will grow in the range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent over the next few years before settling in at 1-3/4 percent over the longer term.3\nOver the past few years, the consumer sector has been the main driver of growth, and it should continue to play this role. Consumer spending grew about 3-1/4 percent last quarter and appears on track for another solid gain in the second half of the year. Of course, Michigan is importantly linked to the auto industry, where sales have fallen off some this year. This drop in vehicle sales is unlikely to be a precursor to a more general weakening in consumer spending. The labor market is strong, household balance sheets have improved, interest rates are still low, and consumer confidence is high. Furthermore, the nearly 17-1/2 million unit annual rate that light vehicle sales reached in 2015 and 2016 was likely above a longer-run sustainable trend, so some drop in sales clearly was to be expected.\nFor some time, growth in other sectors of the economy has not been as robust as in consumption. Housing markets have only been trending up slowly since the recession ended. And compared with previous recoveries, business investment generally has been lackluster, as firms have been reluctant to expand capacity in the face of uncertain and uneven demand. However, on a positive note, the capital spending numbers have looked a good deal better in recent months.\nWe at the Chicago Fed are very fortunate to be advised by an engaged board of directors and to hear from contacts from a range of industries and organizations throughout our District. The data are pretty consistent with what I have been hearing from my directors and other contacts for some time: Businesses that primarily supply the consumer sector have been experiencing stronger demand than those that primarily serve other firms, but, lately, business spending has improved. By the way, if your organization is on our Beige Book contact list or is represented on one of our industrial roundtables or advisory councils, thank you for your participation. I assure you that your insights are very important to us for taking the pulse of the economy.\nAs I just noted, a big part of the strong consumer story is the labor market. Progress here has been steady and unmistakable. Since the beginning of the year, an average of over 175,000 jobs has been added each month. This pace continues to be well above what is needed to absorb new entrants to the labor force.\nBy most measures, the economy is close to achieving our full employment goal. Today the unemployment rate stands at 4.4 percent—in stark contrast to 10 percent eight years ago. In addition, during the Great Recession and for years afterward, many people exited the labor market altogether and the labor force participation rate fell. Some of this was to be expected as baby boomers entered retirement, but some was due to workers becoming discouraged about job prospects and simply giving up on looking for a job. Over the past year or so, however, the participation rate has leveled off and is back near its underlying trend. We also continue to hear anecdotes of firms having difficulty finding workers with specific skills. These are all signs of a strong labor market.\nI anticipate further progress in the coming years. Again, the most recent SEP provides a useful guide. The median FOMC participant sees the unemployment rate declining to between 4 and 4-1/4 percent in the next couple years.4\nOf course, long-run job market challenges remain. As a society, we have much work to do in providing many of our members with the appropriate skills and opportunities to achieve even stronger labor market outcomes than they have today. But the structural policies aimed at achieving these important goals are beyond the scope of monetary policy.\nNow let me turn to our price stability mandate. Here, progress has been unsatisfactory. The FOMC has operationalized its price stability mandate by setting an inflation target of 2 percent, as measured by the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE). This is a symmetric target, meaning the Committee is equally concerned if inflation is either persistently above or persistently below 2 percent. This also means that a healthy outcome would be for inflation to be moderately above 2 percent about as often as it is moderately below 2 percent, leading to an average 2 percent inflation over a reasonably sufficient period of time.\nWhile our objective is stated in terms of overall PCE inflation, core inflation—which strips out the volatile food and energy sectors—is a better gauge of sustained inflationary pressures and where inflation is headed in the future. Unfortunately, by either measure, inflation has been below the FOMC’s 2 percent target almost continuously since 2008. The situation looked to be improving in late 2016 and early 2017, but then inflation retreated. For the 12 months ending in July, core inflation was only 1.4 percent.\nOver the next two to three years, FOMC participants expect inflation to gradually increase, with the median SEP projection showing both core and total PCE inflation moving up to our 2 percent target by 2019. While my forecast is slightly less optimistic, I still think that—with appropriate monetary policy—we will reach our target over the medium term.\nHowever, given the recent data and a nine-year track record of low inflation, it’s reasonable to ask why we expect inflation to get back to 2 percent.\nFactors influencing inflation\nAlthough economists argue over the details (we love to argue—you should meet my staff), there is general agreement that inflation can be explained by three elements: 1) temporary cost factors, 2) resource pressure, and 3) inflation expectations.\nTemporary cost factors are, by definition, transitory. For example, a stronger dollar and associated declines in import prices played a large role in reducing inflation at various times over the past nine years. But the stronger dollar is not a factor holding back inflation today: The dollar was relatively stable through most of 2015 and 2016, and then has depreciated against most currencies so far this year. However, temporary idiosyncratic declines in the prices of certain goods and services earlier this year—such as cell phone plans and prescription drugs—might offer a partial explanation for the low inflation readings since spring.\nWhat about the second element, resource pressure? In general, tight resource constraints put upward pressure on costs and lead to increases in prices. It’s perhaps easiest to think of this in terms of the labor market. Think about how your company’s payroll expenses increase in a tight job market: When it is increasingly difficult to hire and retain qualified staff, you would have to raise wages to get the workers you need. Since this is usually occurring in an environment of strong demand, you are able to recover at least some of these cost increases with higher prices on your products and services. Conversely, loose labor market conditions are associated with lower wage growth and lower inflation.5\nConceptually, resource slack or pressure must be measured against some benchmark. Because these conditions often occur at the same time in many markets and because labor is the largest cost of production for the economy as a whole, the benchmark for the labor market is a useful aggregate standard. We call this benchmark the natural rate of unemployment. It is the unemployment rate that would prevail in an economy making full use of its productive resources or, put differently, the rate that we would experience over the longer run in the absence of shocks to the economy. When the labor market is tight, the unemployment rate is below the natural rate and wages and prices tend to rise. Conversely, slack labor markets are characterized by an unemployment rate that exceeds the natural rate and correspondingly weaker wages and prices.\nThe natural rate is a theoretical concept that is not directly observable and, therefore, must be estimated. Moreover, it changes over time, depending on the structure of the labor market. One good proxy for it is the long-run forecast for the unemployment rate made by the median FOMC participant—that number is currently 4.6 percent.\nThroughout most of the recovery, the unemployment rate far exceeded its estimated natural rate, and so resource slack offered a reasonable partial explanation for low inflation readings. However, by most metrics, we are at or very near full employment today. Therefore, with resource slack close to zero, it’s generally a neutral factor for the current inflation rate.\nMost FOMC participants anticipate that the unemployment rate will continue to fall and further undershoot its 4.6 percent longer-term level. According to the standard paradigm, we should see some upward pressures on wages and inflation. How much can we expect?\nIn my view, they will be modest—tighter labor markets will contribute to a gradual increase in wage and price pressures, but not an outsized increase in inflation. First, I do not foresee a large undershooting of the natural rate, so that the pressure on resources will not be too great. Second, statistical evidence indicates that the linkage between unemployment and inflation is not as powerful today as it was in earlier times. In other words, any given amount of labor market slack today plays a smaller role in generating inflation than it did, say, in the 1970s or 1980s.\nThese are arguments for why wage and price increases have been so modest and why I expect them to firm only gradually over time. However, some economists argue that there is a significant risk of a return to stronger inflation—indeed, of inflation rising well above our 2 percent objective. One reason is a concern that inflation will respond more and more to larger and larger deviations of the unemployment rate from its natural rate. That is, when the unemployment rate is close to the natural rate, changes in unemployment are associated with only small changes in inflation and wage growth. However, as the unemployment rate falls further, each additional decline may result in a larger change in inflation and wage growth. Indeed, there may be some threshold unemployment rate below which outsized wage and price pressures will emerge. If such effects are important—and if the threshold will soon be breached—then the high-inflation risk is more salient and needs to be accounted for by monetary policy.\nThis is an important question. And, appropriately, many researchers have investigated the issue. My evaluation of the literature is that the evidence that we may be on the precipice of escalating inflation is not strong.\nAs one example, in one innovative exercise, my staff looked into the question using state-level wage and unemployment data, searching for effects that might be masked in the national data. They found only spotty evidence of such thresholds. And the results are sensitive to the way the relationship is modeled and the time periods used to estimate their model.\nOther researchers have found evidence of thresholds in the relation between unemployment and inflation, but the effects either are economically small or become evident only at very low levels of the unemployment rate.6 For example, one researcher concluded that the threshold is more than a percentage point below the natural rate. That would be somewhere below 3-1/2 percent.7 And FOMC participants’ current forecasts don’t see the unemployment rate falling that low anytime over the next several years.\nIn light of such evidence, under the current outlook, I don’t see much risk of an outsized breakout in inflation. More colorfully, my colleague from the Minneapolis Fed, President Kashkari, has referred to current concerns about an acceleration in inflation due to increasing labor market tightness as a “ghost story”—scary tales we tell each other, based more on imagination than evidence.8\nInstead, I am more concerned about our ability to get inflation back up to target within a reasonable period. One reason is, as I mentioned, the natural rate is difficult to measure and changes over time. So, it is possible that there is actually greater slack in labor markets than we currently estimate. However, there is another, more troublesome potential development: I am concerned that inflation expectations—the third element in the standard inflation model—may be too low.\nExpectations of future inflation play an important role in the inflation process. For example, workers build these expectations into their wage demands—they want to make sure their salaries will maintain purchasing power in the face of higher prices. Such higher wages feed directly into the cost structure of firms. Inflation expectations also influence the pricing decisions of firms; for example, think about how your views of future inflation affect the structure of longer-term contracts you may be negotiating. In effect, actual inflation can take on a bit of a self-fulfilling nature, as expectations of future inflation become embedded in current wage and price decisions. I am concerned that inflation expectations are too low today, making it harder to achieve our 2 percent target.\nAdmittedly, we do not have clean, accurate measures of the inflation expectations being used by workers and firms as they decide how to set wages and prices. But some of the measures that we do have—say, the pricing of financial market instruments that are linked to inflation outcomes, such as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), and survey measures from households—suggest inflation expectations are low.\nExpectations for continued low inflation appear to be embedded in the labor market as well. For instance, strong wage growth has been the one piece missing from the rosy picture of labor markets I painted earlier. Over the past year, average hourly earnings have risen only 2-1/2 percent. This is a full percentage point lower than the wage gains we saw before the financial crisis. Other measures of labor compensation have been similarly sluggish.\nSlow wage growth is, in part, due to the low productivity growth in recent years. However, it also likely reflects expectations for low inflation. For instance, imagine that an employee in your firm increases the value of your products in real terms by 1 percent and that you both expect inflation to be only 1-1/2 percent. Well, 2-1/2 percent would seem to be a fair increase in wages for that worker. If you both thought inflation would be 2 percent, then you’d probably end up at a 3 percent wage hike.\nThis worry about inflation expectations is not mere hyperbole. As I pointed out earlier, inflation has been below 2 percent for many years and, although the FOMC has declared a 2 percent symmetric inflation target, people may doubt that we will be able to deliver on that objective any time soon. So I am concerned that low inflation expectations may exert a strong influence to keep inflation low for some time.\nCautious approach remains appropriate for monetary policy\nWhat does all of this mean for monetary policy? As I noted earlier, the fundamentals for economic growth are good and, in cyclical terms, labor markets are robust. The real economy looks to be on a solid footing. But disappointingly low core inflation is telling us that important pricing headwinds persist. There is more for our accommodative policy to do to reach our 2 percent inflation objective.\nOur actions must strongly defend our strategic commitment to a symmetric inflation objective. This calls for communicating a policy path that truly generates the possibility that inflation will rise moderately above 2 percent during this rate cycle. This is because under a symmetric inflation objective, 2 percent is not a ceiling that inflation should never breech. Rather, it is a rate around which we should expect to see modest movements both above and below over time.\nTo reinforce expectations of future inflation that are aligned with our stated policy objectives, an appropriate policy path should incorporate only a gradual removal of monetary accommodation. The FOMC’s actions taken last week to begin to reduce the size of our balance sheet are consistent with this gradual approach. The planned path of reductions is very shallow and has been well communicated to markets. Accordingly, it should generate only a modest change in financial conditions. Moreover, we plan for balance sheet normalization to be essentially on autopilot, adjusting the stance of monetary policy primarily with the federal funds rate. Looking ahead at the future path for the funds rate, given my current outlook, I am broadly comfortable with the projections associated with the median SEP, which see the rate rising to 2.7 by the end of 2019.\nHowever, my views about this path are not set in stone. As the FOMC comes to decision points over the coming months, I think we need to see clear signs of building wage and price pressures before taking the next step in removing accommodation. We should avoid taking policy steps that could be misread as a lack of concern over the inflation outlook. In my view, that would be a policy misstep that would further delay achieving our inflation objective.\nMore generally, we should always keep a strong focus on our mandated objectives—something I like to call “outcome-based” policy. The appropriate metrics for judging policy success are how actual outcomes for inflation and employment measure up against our mandated policy goals. Ultimately, our actions should appropriately be driven by how events transpire to influence the outlook for achieving our policy goals. Setting our tools with a steadfast adherence to meeting the Federal Reserve’s mandated objectives should be the overarching determinant of monetary policy.\nNotes\n1 The history of changes to the FOMC’s target federal fund rate is available online.\n2 For more on the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate, see our dual mandate webpage.\n3 Quarterly, each of the FOMC participants submits his or her projections of key economic variables, along with assumptions for the appropriate monetary policy path that underlies those forecasts. These are published in what is known as the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP. For the most recent one, see Federal Open Market Committee (2017).\n4 Federal Open Market Committee (2017).\n5 This is the so-called Phillips curve relationship. The Phillips curve was named after William Phillips, who noted an inverse relationship between money wage changes and the unemployment rate in the British economy. See Phillips (1958).\n6 For instance, Babb and Detmeister (2017) look for evidence of thresholds using metropolitan-statistical-area-level data from the Consumer Price Index. Instead of using price data, Fisher and Koenig (2014) and Kumar and Orrenius (2015) focus on the relation between the unemployment rate and wage growth. However, the direction of causation from wage growth to inflation has always been weak. So, even if there were evidence found in the unemployment–wage growth link, the implications for inflation are unclear. See Hu and Toussaint-Comeau (2010) on this point.\n7 Nalewaik (2016).\n8 See President Kashkari’s recent comments, as reported by Boesler and Bachman (2017).\nReferences\nBabb, Nathan R., and Alan K.

            "content": "David Marshall1\nGood afternoon. It’s a pleasure to be here. I’d like to thank the WFE for giving me a chance to discuss some thoughts about the role that liquidity plays in markets. I’ll particularly focus on the increasing use of liquidity to mitigate settlement risk. But I also want to discuss implications for systemic stability that may be associated with this increasing liquidity dependence.\nPlease keep in mind that my remarks this afternoon are my own opinions, and do not reflect positions of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago or the Federal Reserve System.\nI’d like to focus on three points:\nFirst, there are huge benefits to society from expanding the scope of trading in financial markets. But expanding these gains from trade necessarily requires markets to expand their ability to manage counterparty credit risk and other forms of settlement risk.\nSecond, the infrastructures and processes developed to mitigate counterparty credit risk all do so through ever more intensive utilization of time-critical liquidity.\nThird, this increased reliance on liquidity could have adverse implications for future crises. These implications should be recognized and should be addressed if possible.\nLet’s start with the gains from trade. A foundational insight for the discipline of economics is that the gains from trade can make everyone better off. You may remember Adam Smith’s pin factory from Econ 101. Smith’s original insight was that trade allows for specialization, and specialization generates massive efficiencies. This same insight is at work in David Ricardo’s idea of comparative advantage – that international trade facilitates specialization at the country level, which, again, can generate enormous surplus value. Gains from trade also underlie the importance of well-functioning securities markets, since traded securities allow savings by households to be deployed as capital investment by businesses.\nMore recently, the growth of derivatives markets allows risk itself to be traded as a commodity. This allows risk to be borne by those most capable of bearing the risk, and having these risk-bearing services priced by market forces.\nTo give one final example, few would have thought 30 years ago that the right to pollute could be traded as a commodity, like corn or wheat. But the U.S. sulfur dioxide cap-and-trade program, implemented in 1995, achieved the targets for acid rain abatement at a cost estimated at less than 1/5th of the cost that would have been incurred had we used traditional command-and-control regulation. The trading program incented those for whom pollution abatement would be cheapest to bear the lion’s share of emissions reduction.2\nSo future growth of societal well-being depends in no small measure on expanding the range of things that trade on organized markets, whether goods, specialized labor, loanable funds, risk, or sulfur dioxide emissions. But expanding these gains from trade also depends on our ability to expand the range of counterparties with whom we trade.\nIn particular, there are major benefits from being able to trade anonymously, or to trade with counterparties whose credit worthiness is less than stellar. But this means that, to fully exploit gains from trade, we need to manage counterparty credit risk. In fact, credit risk is only one form of the more general phenomenon of settlement risk: the risk that, for whatever reason, a counterparty fails to complete its obligations in accord with the agreed upon terms.\nSo it’s no surprise that over the past 40 years we’ve seen a series of innovations designed to mitigate settlement risk. And what I find fascinating is that they all do so in the same way – through enhanced use of time-critical liquidity: liquidity that must be provided at a particular location, in a particular currency, and in a precise time frame measured not in days, but in hours or even minutes.\nAn important example is the adoption of payment-vs.-payment (PvP) settlement in foreign exchange transactions to mitigate so-called \"Herstatt\" risk, where asynchronous settlement of the two legs of a foreign exchange transaction allows for the possibility that the later payment leg might fail. PvP, as implemented by CLS Bank, depends on time-critical liquidity provision because participating banks must provide liquidity in the correct currencies during tightly defined funding windows.3\nTo take another example, consider the gradual adoption since the 1970s of real-time gross settlement (RTGS) mechanisms for interbank payments. Prior to the emergence of RTGS, most interbank payments used deferred net settlement approaches. Deferred net settlement, by allowing for netting, is far less liquidity-intensive than RTGS systems. However, deferred net settlement systems cannot provide real-time finality of settlement. This is a major problem with such systems, which was demonstrated by the chaotic conditions following the failure of Bankhaus Herstatt in 1974. At that time, several banks attempted to reverse payments that had been made previously without finality. The result was widespread payments gridlock.4\nIn contrast, a real-time gross settlement mechanism can deliver real-time finality. But its ability to do so is dependent on time-critical liquidity, since an RTGS system transfers funds only if the sender has sufficient liquid balances immediately available.\nThe G20 swaps clearing mandate also falls into this pattern. A central counterparty (CCP) mitigates counterparty credit risk by concentrating all such risks into the CCP through novation. It then manages these risks largely by requiring adequate initial margin, and by marking positions to market using variation margin cash transfers according to a strict timetable. So reliance on time-critical liquidity for these variation margin transfers is at the heart of CCP risk management.\nA similar use of time-critical liquidity to mitigate credit risk is inherent in the G20’s movement toward expanded minimum collateral requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives (again, with daily mark-to-market transfers).5\nAnd, looking forward, distributed ledger technology could facilitate near-real-time security settlement– whereby we could move from T+3 or T+2 settlement all the way to T + few seconds. If implemented, this would clearly reduce settlement risk, but at the expense of increasing the time-criticality of liquidity required from both sellers and purchasers.6\nSo we’re seeing a pattern that repeats itself over and over. It suggests that there may be a basic principle of financial markets in operation: once gains from netting are exhausted, further reductions in counterparty credit risk require increased dependence on liquidity provision.\nIt’s easy to see why this might be so. If you don’t fully trust your counterparty, or if you don’t have full confidence in a settlement mechanism, then the logical way to control settlement risk is to require that one’s counterparty guarantee their performance via provision of collateral, preferably in a highly liquid form — cash, or something that can be turned into cash with high reliability.\nThe creative uses of liquidity to mitigate settlement risk have brought enormous benefits to society by enabling us to expand gains from trade. But this ever-growing dependence on time-critical liquidity has a downside: it exposes markets to the risk that liquidity may become unavailable. Specifically, market participants may have plenty of illiquid assets, but they may be incapable of converting these assets into the cash required to meet a time-critical deadline. This could happen if, for example, their illiquid assets sell for a price much lower than expected, or if these assets can secure liquidity loans only with a prohibitive haircut.\nThis sort of liquidity risk is especially problematic in a financial crisis, because crises typically are characterized by pervasive liquidity hoarding. Such episodes are, in effect, generalizations of bank runs or banking panics, although they can occur in markets quite distinct from commercial banking.\nNotably, the financial crisis of 2007-2008 was characterized by a series of debilitating liquidity panics that occurred outside the traditional banking system. Rather, panics occurred in the so-called “shadow banking system,” a nexus of markets and institutions that performed bank-like intermediation and credit allocation without the costly superstructure of bank regulation. We should keep in mind that the scale of shadow banking activity was huge: by 2007, the size of the shadow banking sector exceeded the traditional banking sector by around 60%.7 So these shadow banking panics were enormously debilitating for the economy.\nAmong the more notable instances of such liquidity panics were\nRun on asset backed commercial paper in August 2007\nRun on Bear Stearns March 2008\nIncreased haircuts in the tri-party repo market late 2008–2009\nRuns on AIG Sept. 2008\nRun on prime money market funds Sept. 2008\nRun on the commercial paper market Sept. 2008\nRun on the asset backed security market 2008\nI don’t have time to go through each of these in detail, but they all involved liquidity-dependent entities, sectors, or markets that were unable to obtain sufficient liquidity to continue their normal functioning.\nThe Bear Stearns run in March 2008 was particularly illustrative. While this example does not specifically focus on the use of liquidity to mitigate settlement risk, it shows how liquidity can dry up in unexpected and counterintuitive ways. Specifically, both Bear Stearns and its regulator, the SEC, estimated that Bear had sufficient collateral to obtain needed liquidity via the repo market and other sources of secured credit. No one anticipated that Bear would be frozen out of the market for secured short-term funding. In the words of Christopher Cox, SEC chair at the time:8\n“[SEC liquidity] requirements are designed to ensure that an investment bank holding company can meet all of its cash needs even in the face of a complete cutoff of unsecured financing that lasts for a full year. ... But what neither the [SEC] regulatory approach nor any existing regulatory model has taken into account is the possibility that secured funding, even if it's backed by high-quality collateral such as U.S. Treasury and agency securities, could become unavailable.” [Italics added]\nSo the increased dependence on liquidity carries with it an increase in liquidity risk. This raises a particularly unpleasant question: does the use of liquidity to mitigate counterparty credit risk actually reduce risk in total? Or does it merely transform one kind of risk (counterparty credit risk) into a different kind of risk (liquidity risk)? Put another way, have we constructed a system that mitigates garden variety day-in-day-out credit risk in exchange for exacerbated liquidity risk that manifests itself once every 20 years or so in the form of a liquidity panic?\nI don’t claim to know the answer to this question. But as we double-down on the use of time-critical liquidity to mitigate settlement risk, we clearly need to consider whether, in doing so, we are simultaneously increasing systemic liquidity risk, and, if so, whether there should be a policy response.\nA good starting point for this inquiry is to recognize that the problem of scarce liquidity during crises is not new. Liquidity crises are pervasive throughout history. The earliest documented liquidity crisis was a banking panic that swept the Roman Empire in A.D. 33. In the U.S. from 1792 to 1933 liquidity panics occurred every 10 years or so.\nFurthermore, there is general agreement about how to address the problem of liquidity scarcity: empower a liquidity provider of last resort.\nIn the banking crisis of 33 A.D., there was, of course, no notion of a central bank. Instead, the Emperor Tiberius took on the role of liquidity provider of last resort. He deposited the equivalent of $2 billion in surviving banks with instructions for the banks to lend the money out, collateralized by real assets. The crisis ended shortly thereafter.9\nIn the liquidity crisis of 1792 in the U.S., the nascent central bank of the United States was not yet operative. So Alexander Hamilton, the Secretary of the Treasury at the time, instructed a private institution, the Bank of New York, to buy government scrip on the open market for their own account, with an informal understanding that the U.S. Treasury would provide a backstop if necessary. Again, the presence of this credible source of market liquidity unfroze the financial market, ending the crisis.10\nThe general rules for such a liquidity provider were articulated by Walter Bagehot11 back in 1873. Bagehot said that to avert panic, the liquidity provider should lend early and freely, to solvent firms, against good collateral, and at a penalty rate. We are comfortable with public sector provision of liquidity, in accord with Bagehot’s rules, when the recipients are banking institutions. That’s the function of the discount window. It’s not that big a stretch to extend such liquidity provision to systemically important, and liquidity intensive, financial market infrastructures, such as payments, clearing, and settlement systems. The key step is to ensure that the institution receiving liquidity be fully solvent, albeit temporarily illiquid. Bagehot makes it clear that under no circumstances should liquidity be provided to an insolvent institution. That principle remains critical to this day.\nSpecifically, suppose a systemically important infrastructure were subject to a liquidity run. This could happen, for example, if expected liquidity inflows did not materialize. If the liquidity provider of last resort, working closely with the infrastructure’s prudential regulator, makes a determination that the infrastructure is solvent, it would be reasonable for the liquidity provider to extend short-term credit. Of course, such credit must be fully secured by high-quality collateral, in accord with Bagehot’s rules. And public sector liquidity should only be used as a last resort, after private sources of liquidity have been exhausted. The benefits of such a policy are clear, and the risks to the taxpayer would be minimal. So it is no surprise that this sort of policy is broadly consistent with existing U.S. and E.U. law.\nOne class of infrastructures where this approach is particularly workable is CCPs. CCPs are relatively transparent institutions. Their risk management assets consist largely of cash, Treasuries, and other low-risk instruments. So it is relatively easy to assess CCP solvency and to determine the quality of collateral. Furthermore, the use of cash margin, which obviously is the most liquid form of collateral, can be further encouraged by allowing customer margin to be deposited in accounts with their central bank, thereby eliminating custodial risk from customer concerns.\nThe key take-away from this brief discussion of liquidity in financial markets is that liquidity is a two-edged sword. It has proven to be an extremely effective tool to mitigate settlement risk. At the same time, expanded dependence on liquidity may exacerbate systemic risk in a crisis. Like any powerful tool, it must be handled with care.\nOf course, there are a number of questions that I have not addressed. What are the trade-offs in extending the range of a liquidity provider of last resort? Are there moral hazard considerations that must be taken into account? What might an optimal regulatory structure look like for liquidity-dependent institutions? Clearly, we need the best thinking on these tough issues. I certainly look forward to your comments and thoughts during the remainder of the conference.\nNotes\n1 Senior Vice President and Director of Financial Markets Group, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. david.marshall@chi.frb.org\n2 Robert Stavins, Gabriel Chan, Robert Stowe, Richard Sweeney, 2012, “The US sulphur dioxide cap and trade programme and lessons for climate policy,” August, available online.\n3 Bank for International Settlements, Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems, 2003, Payment and Settlement Systems in Selected Countries, Basel, Switzerland, April, available online and Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Payments Risk Committee, Cross-border Collateral Pool Task Force, 2003, Managing Payment Liquidity in Global Markets: Risk Issues and Solutions, report, March, available online.\n4 Herring, Richard J., and Robert E.

            "content": "Due to weather-related travel problems, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans canceled his attendance July 13 at the Ninth Annual Rocky Mountain Economic Summit in Victor, Idaho, hosted by the Global Interdependence Council. This is the outline of the speech he was to deliver.\n\n\nBefore I begin, I need to remind you that my comments this morning are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).    \nI’ve been involved in a number of conferences and other public forums recently discussing the monetary policy lessons learned from our experience at the zero lower bound (ZLB).\nThere is always a lot of debate at these events about the efficacies of unconventional policies, such as negative interest rates, quantitative easing (QE), and forward guidance.1 Such debate is natural: First of all, as economists, we love to argue; but more importantly, we just don’t have a lot of historical experience with such policies to provide definitive answers.\nStill, one consistent lesson I’ve taken away is that a key element to success is strong policymaker focus on mandated objectives—something I like to call “outcome-based” policy. Indeed, this focus is important for the conduct of monetary policy not just at the ZLB, but also in more conventional policy regimes.\nAll central banks have mandates: All have inflation objectives, and the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate that includes supporting maximum employment.2 Some commentators judge central banks by how good our forecasts are or how closely monetary policy follows a particular rule. Although these are instructive ingredients for the policy process, they are not the ultimate goal. Our goal is to hit our objectives. Therefore, to judge success, the appropriate metrics are how actual outcomes for inflation and employment measure up against our mandated policy goals. And to achieve success, central bankers need to keep their scorecards with these metrics in mind.\n\nToday I will discuss three lessons around this theme that struck home for me from our experience in the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis and to the current environment, in which the real economy is performing well, though inflation remains stubbornly below our 2 percent objective:3\nFirst, outcome-based policies are especially critical during crises—and they are indispensable in the face of the zero lower bound.\nSecond, a symmetric inflation target is a challenging policy objective for conservative central bankers to deliver on.\nAnd third, given the ZLB, risk management likely will remain a key best-practice consideration for policy decision-making for some time to come.\n\nLesson #1: Let’s start with the lesson that outcome-based policies become even more critical during crises and are indispensable in the face of the ZLB.\nTough monetary policy challenges are not new. Economic fundamentals are subject to varying degrees of volatility over time. But there were crucial differences between the Great Financial Crisis and previous episodes.\nFirst, there were the historically large magnitudes of the shortfalls from our policy objectives.\nSecond, the earlier episodes began with the policy rate high enough above zero such that there was substantial cushion for cutting rates. This cushion allowed the Fed to successfully combat disinflationary forces. Unfortunately, during this cycle, we ran out of any cushion in December 2008. That is when the policy rate was reduced to the 0 to 1/4 percent range—the effective lower bound.\nIn such circumstances, it is essential to credibly commit to achieving our policy goals. Stating the goals clearly is crucial, but so are actions that display a “do whatever it takes” mentality. This requires a willingness to take bold steps.\nYou all are familiar with the impressive set of unconventional monetary policy tools the FOMC used after hitting the ZLB: for instance, QE1, QE2, calendar-date forward guidance, and the 2011 maturity extension program.4 (And I am deliberately omitting the special liquidity programs.) But all of these still were not enough to meet our policy mandates.\nBy the fall of 2012, the FOMC, as well as other policymakers around the globe, had recognized the need for further actions to achieve their policy objectives. At the Fed, we made what I think were two of our most important and successful nontraditional policy moves that year.\nThe first was our open-ended QE3, which began in September 2012 and committed us to purchase long-term assets until we saw evidence of substantial improvement in the labor market.5 The second was our December 2012 forward guidance that stated we would hold the fed funds rate at the ZLB at least as long as unemployment was above 6.5 percent and while inflation didn’t exceed 2.5 percent.6\nI believe the explicit linking of these expansionary policies to economic outcomes was key to their success. And it makes them outstanding examples of outcome-based policies.\nNow, as former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke likes to say, while QE doesn’t work in theory, it does work in practice.7\nThe FOMC was pretty confident that QE3 and threshold-based forward guidance would provide stimulus. But there was substantial uncertainty over how and when these policies would affect the economy. So by linking the policies’ open-ended duration to progress toward our policy mandates, we assured markets we were committed to doing whatever it took to improve outcomes. This bolstered the important self-reinforcing linkages between more positive private sector expectations and better current economic outcomes.\nIn my opinion, these policies successfully demonstrated strong commitment to our objectives—and they produced results.\nUnemployment began to fall more quickly than anticipated in 2013, and as a result we were able to scale back the QE3 purchases beginning in late 2013 and the threshold-based forward guidance ended in March 2014. Today, we have essentially returned to full employment in the U.S.—indeed, at 4.4 percent, the unemployment rate is somewhat below the range FOMC participants see as the long-run normal level.\nWhat comes next for outcome-based monetary policy?\nTo be sure, gross domestic product (GDP) growth was weak in the first quarter. But that seems to have been transitory. The data in hand and our forecasts point to continued improvements in real activity.\nLast month, the FOMC released its quarterly Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).8 The median participant sees GDP growth of 2.2 percent for 2017 and a slightly more modest pace of expansion in 2018 and 2019.\nThe unemployment rate is expected to be about 4-1/4 percent throughout the projection period, and this is moderately below the longer-run level of 4.6 percent.\nUnfortunately, low inflation continues to be a challenge. From 2009 to the present, core PCE inflation has generally underrun 2 percent—and often by substantial amounts.9 This is over eight full years below target. This is a serious policy outcome miss.\nThe U.S. economy made some noticeable progress toward the FOMC’s inflation goal when core PCE inflation rose from 1.4 percent in 2015 to 1.7 percent in 2016. But, as of last May, it had slipped back to 1.4 percent. Furthermore, with energy prices and the dollar stabilizing and resource slack diminishing, this slowdown has occurred as some of the earlier headwinds holding down inflation have receded.\nThe median FOMC participant now forecasts core PCE inflation to be 1.7 percent this year (this is two-tenths below the March projection). But the median participant also sees it rising to our 2 percent target by the end of 2018.10\nMy inflation outlook is not quite as sanguine as this projection. I also see downside risks to this outlook. So I believe we need to demonstrate a strong commitment to hitting our symmetric inflation objective sooner rather than later. That is, we need to pursue an outcome-based policy to actually help us achieve our symmetric inflation goal.\n\nThis leads me to Lesson #2: A symmetric inflation target can be a tough policy objective for conservative central bankers to deliver on.\nIn addition to core inflation underrunning 2 percent for some time, there has been accumulating evidence since the summer of 2014 that long-run inflation expectations have drifted down.\nThe declines in TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) inflation breakevens and consumer surveys are particularly telling.\nAnd clearly, lower inflation expectations make it all the more difficult for the central bank to achieve its inflation objective.\nLow energy prices, the lack of international inflationary pressures, and the low core inflation experience certainly have contributed to this drop in expectations. But I think there is an institutional factor in play, too. Namely, it is difficult for some central bankers to tolerate above-target inflation even for limited and controlled periods of time. And when the public recognize this low-inflation bias, they form expectations accordingly.\nHere, I am thinking of the solution to the Barro–Gordon (1983) dilemma of time-inconsistent decision-making as articulated by Ken Rogoff (1985). This theory emerged to explain how a well-intentioned Federal Reserve could end up delivering the excessively high inflation we experienced in the 1970s.\nIn the classic Barro–Gordon world, benevolent central bankers seek to bring the unemployment rate below its sustainable natural rate11 and they set policy with discretion every period. The public recognize the policymakers’ bias and know that it would be against their best interests to ignore its impact on inflation. So they adjust their expectations accordingly. In the Barro–Gordon model, this combination of policy bias and public expectations generates above-target inflation.\nCentral bankers wish to avoid such inflationary outcomes. But how do you do that? Many economists and policymakers think the solution lies in central banks following policy rules rather than discretion. But Professor Kenneth Rogoff provides a different solution that doesn’t involve policy rules.\nRogoff suggests appointing conservative central bankers who place less weight on achieving lower unemployment. This will correct for the upward inflation bias that Barro and Gordon noted and can deliver inflation at target through standard period-by-period decision-making.\nNow, a crucial element underlying the Barro–Gordon excess inflation result is that soft-hearted policymakers will try to pursue unemployment below the sustainable natural rate. But if central bankers learn they should not attempt to permanently deliver unsustainable levels of unemployment, then no correction for inflation bias is needed. Indeed, I think the economic literature and actual high inflation experience of the 1970s and ’80s taught all monetary economists this lesson.\nI spent my formative high school and college years in the 1970s, when inflation ranged between 6 percent and 10 percent. And then I spent my formative years as a monetary economist in the disinflations of the 1980s and 1990s.\nDuring most of this time, the direction of monetary policy was always pretty clear: Inflation was much too high—well above any sensible inflation objective—and monetary policy tried to engineer lower inflation whenever it was opportune.\nAnd there were some truly substantial Fed tightenings to bring inflation down, some of which were associated with very painful recessions.12 Cumulatively, the FOMC’s resolve to pursue low and stable inflation in the Volcker–Greenspan era was strong and obvious—and it was successful.\nSo, central bankers appear to have learned to avoid the Barro–Gordon inflationary bias. Indeed, the May 2003 FOMC statement13 even explicitly acknowledged a new two-sided risk, as inflation at that time was flirting with uncomfortably low levels.\nAfter a brief respite from 2004 to 2008, we have again been living with the risk of too-low inflation. Unlike the 1970s, ’80s, and ’90s, when policymakers were starting from inflation and inflation expectations that were too high, today we are starting from a position in which they are too low.\nBut Rogoff-appointed conservative central bankers may find it difficult to believe there is no upward inflation bias to correct. Indeed, think how often you hear economists and policymakers say that discretionary policy leads to excess inflation without also stating the necessary precondition that the public believe policymakers are pursuing unsustainably low unemployment. Such misreading would lead conservative central bankers to pursue overly restrictive conditions on average and deliver lower-than-optimal inflation.\nTo state this a bit differently, conservative central bankers will find it difficult to ever deliver inflation above the policy objective. In this case, our 2 percent target would not be a level around which inflation fluctuates symmetrically. Instead, it would become a ceiling for inflation.\nMoreover, the public make inferences regarding the inflation target based on our past performance, not just on our words. When they see inflation below 2 percent for eight-plus years, they might logically think 2 percent is a ceiling. If so, the public would likely push down their expectations for average inflation over the longer run, making it all the more difficult for the central bank to achieve its inflation objective.\nNote that the original Barro–Gordon problem and the conservative central banker bias both arise because policymakers fail to focus on actual outcomes relative to their ultimate objectives.\nThe scorecard for the soft-hearted central banker has inflation averaging above target over the long run, while the scorecard for the conservative central banker records persistent downside misses on inflation.\nIn either case, policymakers would score better if they focused on the outcomes—that is, if they would recognize their biases and adjust policy accordingly to eliminate the persistent misses.\nAligning policy to avoid the risk of biased outcomes can be a meaningful feature of monetary policy more generally. Indeed, the current situation provides an important example.\nAs I and many of my FOMC colleagues have noted, lower productivity and labor force growth appear to have reduced long-run output growth in the U.S. Along with massive global demand for safe assets, these trends result in lower equilibrium real interest rates.14 Lower equilibrium real rates and, if it holds, lower expected inflation add up to lower nominal policy rates in the steady state.\nThis then means monetary policy will likely have less headroom to provide adequate rate cuts when large disinflationary shocks hit the economy. In other words, the odds of returning to the ZLB—and the associated risks to our employment and inflation objectives—may be higher than we would like for some time.\nThis brings me to my third and final lesson, which is about managing against this risk.\n\nLesson #3: Unconventional tools are effective, but they are unconventional because conventional tools are stronger. So the more likely we are to encounter shocks that might take us to the ZLB in the future, the stronger we should lean policy ex ante in the direction of accommodation—that is, we need to manage against the risks of the ZLB. And with a greater likelihood of low equilibrium real rates, we now might be facing more elevated ZLB risks than in earlier times.\nBack in 2015 I wrote a Brookings conference paper with three of my colleagues at the Chicago Fed—Jonas Fisher, François Gourio, and Spencer Krane.15 In that paper, we formalized these risk-management arguments in the workhorse forward-looking New Keynesian model, as well as in a second standard backward-looking macro model.\n\nWe considered a scenario in which the current natural real interest rate, or r*, was temporarily low and expected to rise slowly over time. But the actual path for the rate was subject to random (and serially correlated) shocks. This means that a bad shock could drive you to the ZLB. If r* was known with certainty, the optimal policy would set the policy rate to follow upward the path for the equilibrium rate. But with an uncertain r* and concerns about ZLB risks, we show that optimal policy prescribes a lower rate path to reduce the risk that future unexpected shocks would drive the economy to the ZLB.\nThe chart displays the results from the New Keynesian model. The dashed line shows the optimal nominal rate if policymakers and the private sector assumed there would be no future shocks to the path for the real rate. (The nominal federal funds rate starts off at 1-1/2 percent in 2015. This is simply adding the minus 1/2 percent real equilibrium federal funds rate assumed to prevail in 2015 and the 2 percent inflation target.) The solid line shows the optimal policy that accounts for uncertain shocks that may drive the economy to the ZLB. This risk-management adjustment is quite large, particularly early in the simulations.\n\n\nFor reference, the squares here are the median end-of-year forecasts for the federal funds rate from the March 2015 SEP.16 As you can see, the median SEP policy path for 2015–16 wasn’t that different from the optimal policy prescription of this simple model.\nIn this exercise, the starting point was calibrated to economic conditions that existed in the first quarter of 2015. Again, we assumed that the real equilibrium interest rate was minus 1/2 percent and would slowly trend up over time to 1-3/4 percent. Given our 2 percent inflation objective, this is consistent with the 3-3/4 percent forecast for the long-run nominal federal funds rate in the FOMC’s March 2015 Summary of Economic Projections.17\nHowever, today, a little over two years later, most economists now believe the long-run real rate in the U.S. is lower—probably more like 1 percent or lower, according to the June 2017 SEP.18 The next figure displays how this new endpoint influences our results.\n\nFisher, Gourio, and Krane (2017) separately reran our Brookings exercise calibrating economic conditions to the first quarter of 2017 and assuming r* trends up from zero to 1 percent. As before, the solid and dashed red lines in this chart are the resulting policies with and without adjustment for uncertainty over r*.\n\nA few things to note on the chart. First, look at how in 2017:Q1 the blue and red dashed lines are pretty close. So our current starting point isn’t far from the 2015 exercise. Second, notice the new lower r* endpoint of 1 percent on the red lines means higher odds of hitting the ZLB. Hence, the adjustment for risk management—the difference between the dashed and solid red lines—is even greater now than it was at this point in the 2015 simulations. Third, note that the solid and dashed lines do not converge until the policy rate is nearly back to neutral, meaning the role for risk management persists until that time.\nI should emphasize that these are very stylized models, calibrated to approximate just a few macroeconomic data. The analysis also abstracts from a range of important modeling and monetary policy issues. So these results are mostly illustrative rather than strictly prescriptive.\nNevertheless, they do suggest that ZLB risks associated with a low long-run value of the natural rate of interest have the potential to influence risk-management considerations for some time during the policy rate normalization process.\nSo the takeaway from Lesson #3 is as follows: Taking extra care to avoid the substantial costs of hitting the ZLB increases the odds for achieving the central bank’s policy goals over the medium term.\nLet me conclude with a brief discussion of the current monetary policy environment.\nAs you know, in June the Committee voted to increase the target range for the federal funds rate to 1 to 1-1/4 percent.19 I think the improvements in the real economy to date justified this move.\nIn the Summary of Economic Projections from that meeting, the median participant thought that appropriate policy would incorporate one more 25 basis point rate hike in 2017—bringing the total for this year to three—and then three more increases in each of 2018 and 2019.20 And as Chair Yellen stated in her post-meeting press conference, the Committee expects to begin gradually reducing the size of the Fed’s balance sheet sometime this year.21\nIt remains to be seen whether there will be two rate hikes this year or three or even four—and exactly when we will start paring back reinvestments of maturing assets. Regardless, the important feature is that the current environment supports very gradual rate hikes and slow predetermined reductions in our balance sheet.\nI have already touched on the reasons why I support this approach. So, let me recap.\nIn my view, slow removal of accommodation by the FOMC is necessary to boost inflation and symmetrically achieve our 2 percent inflation goal in a timely fashion. We also have to assure the public that we are concerned about the current challenges to our inflation objective and that we are not overly conservative central bankers who view our inflation target as a ceiling.\nFurthermore, given that we may be facing more elevated ZLB risks for some time, risk-management considerations argue for tilting toward accommodative policies that help reduce the odds of returning to the ZLB.\nMuch ink will be spilled on the importance of the exact number of rate increases we’ll see this year and on various subplots regarding our balance sheet policy. I don’t want to get hung up over small differences. Ultimately, our exact actions will appropriately be driven by how events transpire to influence the outlook for achieving our policy goals. This steadfast adherence to meeting the Federal Reserve’s mandated objectives will be the overarching determinant of monetary policy.\nNotes\n1 For further details on the quantitative easing (QE) programs (or large-scale asset purchases) and forward guidance, see the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2015a, 2015b).\n2 For more details on the Fed’s dual mandate, see https://www.chicagofed.org/research/dual-mandate/dual-mandate.\n3 In January 2012, the FOMC set 2 percent inflation—measured by the annual change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE)—as the explicit inflation target consistent with our price stability mandate.

            "content": "I would like to thank the Money Marketeers for their kind invitation to speak here again today.\nAnd before I continue, I need to remind you that my comments this evening are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nIt has been just over five years since I was last here. At that time I offered my thoughts on monetary policy in a talk with the riveting title “Monetary policy: Recurring themes.\"1\nTo refresh your memory, in 2012 the Federal Open Market Committee was grappling with the zero lower bound (ZLB) on the federal funds rate. I argued then that we should consider forward guidance for the federal funds rate that was based on numerical thresholds for the unemployment rate and inflation. I believed such an outcome-based policy could ensure we added enough monetary stimulus to boost employment while also providing a safeguard against inflation rising too high.\nOf course, times are much different now. The real economy is performing well, and we essentially have met our employment mandate. The FOMC has begun to remove accommodation, increasing the federal funds rate four times since late 2015. But inflation has remained stubbornly below our 2 percent objective.2 How should this subpar outcome influence our policy strategy?\nToday, I want to focus more on this recurring theme that monetary policy has to be outcome-based.\n\nAll central banks have mandates: All have inflation objectives, and the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate that includes supporting maximum employment.3 Some commentators judge central banks by how good our forecasts are or how closely monetary policy follows a particular rule. Although these are instructive ingredients for the policy process, they are not the ultimate goal. Our goal is to hit our objectives. Therefore, to judge success, the appropriate metric is how actual outcomes for inflation and employment measure up against our mandated policy goals.\nToday I will discuss three lessons around this theme that struck home for me from our experience in the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis: First, outcome-based policies are especially critical during crises—and they are indispensable in the face of the zero lower bound; second, a symmetric inflation target is a challenging objective for conservative central bankers to deliver on; and third, given the ZLB, risk-management likely will remain a key best-practice consideration for policy decision-making for some time to come.\nLesson 1: Let’s start with the lesson that outcome-based policies become even more critical during crises and are indispensable in the face of the ZLB.\n\n\n\nTough monetary policy challenges are not new. Economic fundamentals are subject to varying degrees of volatility over time. But there were crucial differences between the Great Financial Crisis and previous episodes.\nFirst, there were the historically large magnitudes of the shortfalls from our policy objectives.\nSecond, the earlier episodes began with the policy rate high enough above zero that there was a large enough cushion for cutting rates to successfully combat disinflationary forces. This time, however, we ran out of that cushion in December 2008, when policy rates were reduced to their zero lower bound.\nIn such circumstances, it is essential to credibly commit to achieving our policy goals. Stating the goals clearly is crucial, but so are actions that display a “do whatever it takes” mentality. This requires a willingness to take bold steps.\nYou all are familiar with the impressive set of unconventional monetary policy tools the FOMC used after hitting the ZLB: for instance, QE1, QE2, calendar-date forward guidance, and the maturity extension program.4 (And I am deliberately omitting the special liquidity programs.) But these still were not sufficient to meet our policy mandates.\nBy 2012, the FOMC, as well as other policymakers around the globe, had recognized the need for further actions to achieve their policy objectives. At the Fed, we made what I think were two of our most important and successful nontraditional policy moves that year.\nThe first was our open-ended QE3, which began in September 2012 and committed us to purchase long-term assets until we saw evidence of substantial improvement in the labor market.5 The second was our December 2012 forward guidance that stated we would hold the fed funds rate at the ZLB at least as long as unemployment was above 6.5 percent and while inflation didn’t exceed 2.5 percent.6\nI believe the explicit linking of these expansionary policies to economic outcomes was key to their success. And it makes them outstanding examples of outcome-based policies.\nNow, as former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke likes to say, while QE doesn’t work in theory, it does work in practice. 7\nThe FOMC was pretty confident that QE3 and the thresholds-based forward guidance would provide stimulus. But there was substantial uncertainty over how and when these policies would affect the economy. So by linking the policies’ open-ended duration to progress toward our policy mandates, we assured markets we were committed to doing whatever it took to improve outcomes. This bolstered the important self-reinforcing linkages between more positive private sector expectations and better current economic outcomes.\nIn my opinion, these policies successfully demonstrated strong commitment to our objectives—and they produced results.\nUnemployment began to fall more quickly than anticipated in 2013, and as a result we were able to scale back the QE3 purchases beginning in late 2013 and forward guidance in March 2014. Today, we have essentially returned to full employment in the U.S.—indeed, at 4.3 percent, the unemployment rate is somewhat below the range FOMC participants see as the long-run normal level.\nWhat comes next for outcome-based monetary policy?\nTo be sure, gross domestic product (GDP) growth was weak in the first quarter. But that seems to have been transitory, and the data in hand point to a strong rebound in the second quarter.\nLast week, the FOMC released its quarterly Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).8 The median participant sees GDP growth of 2.2 percent for 2017 and a slightly more modest pace of expansion in 2018 and 2019.\nThe unemployment rate is expected to be about 4-1/4 percent throughout the projection period, so moderately below its longer-run level of 4.6 percent.\nUnfortunately, low inflation has been more stubborn. From 2009 to the present, core PCE inflation has generally underrun 2 percent—and often by substantial amounts.9 This is eight full years below target. This is a serious policy outcome miss.\nWe made some noticeable progress toward our inflation goal when it rose from 1.4 percent in 2015 to 1.7 percent in 2016. But, as of last April, core PCE inflation had slipped to 1-1/2 percent, and last week’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) data do not bode well for PCE inflation in May. Furthermore, this slowdown has occurred as some of the earlier headwinds holding down inflation—declining energy prices, a stronger dollar, and resource slack—have receded.\nThe median FOMC participant forecasts core PCE inflation to be 1.7 percent (this is two-tenths below the March projection) but then sees it rising to our 2 percent target by the end of 2018.10\nMy inflation outlook is not quite as sanguine as this projection. I also see downside risks to this outlook. So I believe we need to demonstrate a strong commitment to hitting our symmetric inflation objective sooner rather than later. That is, we need to pursue an outcome-based policy to actually help us achieve our inflation goal.\nThis leads me to Lesson 2: A symmetric inflation target can be a tough policy objective for conservative central bankers to deliver on.\n\n\nIn addition to core inflation underrunning 2 percent for some time, there has been accumulating evidence since the summer of 2014 that long-run inflation expectations have drifted down.\nHere, the declines in TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) inflation breakevens and consumer surveys are particularly telling.\nAnd, clearly, lower inflation expectations make it all the more difficult for the central bank to achieve its inflation objective.\nLow energy prices, the lack of international inflationary pressures, and the low core inflation experience certainly have contributed to this drop in expectations. But I think there is an institutional factor in play, too. Namely, it is difficult for some central bankers to tolerate above-target inflation even for limited and controlled periods of time. When the public recognizes this low-inflation bias, it forms expectations accordingly.\nHere, I am thinking of the solution to the Barro–Gordon (1983) dilemma of time-inconsistent decision-making as articulated by Ken Rogoff (1985). This theory emerged to explain how a well-intentioned Federal Reserve could end up delivering the excessively high inflation we experienced in the 1970s.\nIn the classic Barro–Gordon world, benevolent central bankers seek to bring the unemployment rate below its sustainable natural rate,11 and they set policy with discretion every period. This policy strategy produces a bias toward excessively low unemployment. The public understands this bias, and adjusts its expectations accordingly. In the Barro–Gordon analysis, this combination of policy bias and public expectations generates above-target inflation.\nThis outcome is something that central bankers wish to avoid. But how do you do so? Many economists and policymakers think the solution lies in central banks following policy rules rather than discretion. But Professor Kenneth Rogoff provided a different solution that didn’t involve policy rules.\nRogoff suggests appointing conservative central bankers who place less weight on achieving lower unemployment. This will correct for the upward inflation bias that Barro and Gordon noted and can deliver lower average inflation through standard period-by-period decision-making.\nNow, a crucial element underlying the Barro–Gordon excess inflation result is that soft-hearted policymakers will try to pursue unemployment below the sustainable natural rate. But if central bankers learn they should not attempt to permanently deliver unsustainable levels of unemployment, then no bias correction is needed.\nIndeed, I think the economic literature and actual inflation experience of the 1970s and ’80s taught all monetary economists this lesson.\nI spent my formative high school and college years in the 1970s, when inflation ranged between 6 percent and 10 percent. And then I spent my formative years as a monetary economist in the disinflations of the 1980s and 1990s.\nDuring most of this time, the direction of monetary policy was always pretty clear: Inflation was much too high—well above any sensible inflation objective—and monetary policy tried to engineer lower inflation whenever it was opportune.\nAnd there were some truly substantial Fed tightenings to bring inflation down, some of which were associated with painful recessions.12 Cumulatively, the FOMC’s resolve to pursue low and stable inflation in the Volcker–Greenspan era was strong and obvious—and it was successful.\nSo, central bankers appear to have learned to avoid the Barro–Gordon inflationary bias. Indeed, the May 2003 FOMC statement13 even explicitly acknowledged a new two-sided risk, as inflation then was flirting with uncomfortably low levels.\nAfter a brief respite from 2004 to 2008, we have again been living with the risk of too-low inflation. Unlike the 1970s, ’80s, and ’90s, when policymakers were starting from inflation and inflation expectations that were too high, today we are starting from a position in which they are too low.\nBut given this history, Rogoff-appointed conservative central bankers may find it difficult to believe there is no bias to correct. Indeed, think how often you hear economists and policymakers say that discretionary policy leads to excess inflation without also stating the precondition that the public believes policymakers are pursuing unsustainably low unemployment. This misreading would lead conservative central bankers to pursue overly restrictive conditions on average and deliver lower-than-optimal inflation.\nTo state this a bit differently, conservative central bankers will find it difficult to ever deliver inflation above the policy objective. In this case, our 2 percent target would not be a level around which inflation fluctuates symmetrically. Instead, it would become a ceiling for inflation.\nMoreover, the public makes inferences regarding the inflation target based on our past performance, not just on our words. When they see inflation below 2 percent for eight-plus years, they might logically think 2 percent is a ceiling. If so, the public would likely push down their expectations for average inflation over the longer run, making it all the more difficult for the central bank to achieve its inflation objective.\nThe current situation is even more difficult when we recognize that lower U.S. productivity and labor force growth have reduced long-run output growth. Along with massive global demand for safe assets, these trends result in lower equilibrium real interest rates.14 Lower equilibrium real rates and lower expected inflation add up to lower nominal policy rates in the steady state. All told, monetary policy will likely have less headroom to provide adequate rate cuts when large disinflationary shocks hit the economy. In other words, the risks of returning to the ZLB may be higher than we would like for some time.\nThis brings me to my third and final lesson, which is regarding risk-management.\nLesson 3: Unconventional tools are effective, but they are unconventional because conventional tools are stronger. So the more likely we are to encounter shocks that might take us to the ZLB in the future, the stronger we should lean policy ex ante in the direction of accommodation—that is, we need to manage against the risks of the ZLB. And with a greater risk of low equilibrium real rates, we now might be facing more elevated ZLB risks than in earlier times.\nBack in 2015 I wrote a Brookings conference paper with three of my colleagues at the Chicago Fed—Jonas Fisher, François Gourio, and Spencer Krane. We formalized these risk-management arguments in the workhorse forward-looking New Keynesian model, as well as in a second standard backward-looking macro model.15\nWe considered a scenario in which the current natural real interest rate, or, r*, was temporarily low and expected to rise slowly over time. But the actual path for the rate was subject to random (and serially correlated) shocks. This means that a bad shock could drive you to the ZLB. If r* was known with certainty, the optimal policy would set the policy rate to follow upward the path for the equilibrium rate. But with an uncertain r* and concerns about ZLB risks, we show that optimal policy prescribes a lower rate path to reduce the risk that future unexpected shocks would drive the economy to the ZLB.\nThe chart displays the results from the New Keynesian model. The dashed line shows the optimal nominal rate if policymakers and the private sector assumed there would be no future shocks to the path for the real rate. The solid line shows the optimal policy that accounts for uncertain shocks that may drive the economy to the ZLB. This risk-management adjustment is quite large, particularly early in the simulations.\n\nFor reference, the squares here are the median end-of-year forecasts for the federal funds rate from the March 2015 SEP.16 As you can see, the median SEP policy path for 2015–16 wasn’t that different from the optimal policy prescription of this simple model.\nIn this exercise, the starting point was calibrated to economic conditions that existed in the first quarter of 2015 and we assumed that the natural real rate was minus one-half percent and would slowly trend up over time to 1-3/4 percent. Given our 2 percent inflation objective, this is consistent with the 3-3/4 percent forecast for the long-run nominal federal funds rate in the FOMC’s March 2015 Summary of Economic Projections.17\nHowever, today, a little over two years later, most economists now believe the long-run real rate in the U.S. is lower—maybe more like 1 percent, according to the June 2017 SEP.18 The next figure displays how this new endpoint influences our results.\nFisher, Gourio, and Krane (2017) separately reran our Brookings exercise calibrating economic conditions to the first quarter of 2017 and assuming r* trends up from zero to 1 percent. As before, the solid and dashed red lines in this chart are the resulting policies with and without adjustment for uncertainty over r*.\nLook at how in 2017Q1 the blue and red dotted lines are pretty close. So our current starting point isn’t far from the 2015 exercise. But the new lower r* endpoint of 1 percent means higher odds of hitting the ZLB. Hence, the adjustment for risk-management—the difference between the dashed and solid lines—is even greater now than it was at this point in the 2015 simulations. Note, too, that the solid and dashed lines do not converge until the policy rate is nearly back to neutral, meaning the role for risk-management persists until that time.\nI should emphasize that these are very stylized models, calibrated to approximate just a few macroeconomic data. The analysis abstracts from a range of important modeling and monetary policy issues. So the results are only illustrative.\nNevertheless, they do suggest that ZLB risks associated with a low long-run value of the natural rate of interest have the potential to influence risk-management considerations for some time during the policy rate normalization process.\nTaking extra care to avoid the substantial costs of hitting the ZLB increases the odds for achieving the central bank’s policy goals.\nLet me conclude with a brief discussion of the current monetary policy environment.\nAs you know, the Committee voted to increase the target range for the federal funds rate to 1 to 1-1/4 percent.19 In the most recent Summary of Economic Projections, the median participant thought that appropriate policy would incorporate one more 25 basis point rate hike in 2017—bringing the total for this year to three—and then three more increases in each of 2018 and 2019.20 And as Chair Yellen stated in her press conference’s opening remarks, the Committee expects to begin gradually reducing the size of the Fed’s balance sheet sometime this year.21\nIt remains to be seen whether there will be two rate hikes this year, or three, or four—or exactly when we start paring back reinvestments of maturing assets. Regardless, the important feature is that the current environment supports very gradual rate hikes and slow preset reductions in our balance sheet.\nI have already touched on the reasons why I support this approach. To recap,\nI view slow removal of accommodation as necessary support to symmetrically achieving our 2 percent inflation goal in a timely fashion. We have to assure the public that we recognize the new low-inflation environment and that we are not overly conservative central bankers who see our inflation target as a ceiling.\nAnd given we may be facing more elevated ZLB risks for some time, risk-management considerations argue for tilting toward accommodative policies that help reduce the risk of returning to the ZLB.\nMuch ink will be spilled on the importance of two, versus three, versus four rate increases this year and subplots regarding our balance sheet policy. I don’t want to get hung up over small differences. Ultimately, our exact actions will appropriately be driven by how events transpire to influence the outlook for achieving our policy goals. This steadfast adherence to meeting the Federal Reserve’s mandated objectives will be the overarching determinant of monetary policy.\nNotes\n1 Evans (2012).\n2 In January 2012, the FOMC set 2 percent inflation—measured by the annual change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE)—as the explicit inflation target consistent with our price stability mandate.

This has been an outstanding conference, and it’s a real pleasure to be here.\nAnd before I continue, I need to remind you that my comments here today are my own and not those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nBack in October 2010, I was participating on a policy panel at a Boston Fed conference. I distinctly remember some very wise counsel provided by Kazuo Ueda, professor of economics at the University of Tokyo and a former member of the BOJ Policy Board. In essence, he said to the rest of us, whatever you do, don’t end up in the situation that Japan has faced for so long.\nI have always remembered that advice.\nToday, I will focus on lessons from the U.S. experience after the Great Financial Crisis. To me, the overarching theme is that monetary policy has to be outcome-based.\nAll central banks have mandates — we all have inflation objectives, and the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate that includes supporting maximum employment.1 Some commentators judge central banks by how good our forecasts are or how closely monetary policy follows a particular policy rule. Although these are instructive ingredients for the policy process, they are not the ultimate goal. Our goal is to hit our objectives. Therefore, to judge success, the appropriate metric is how actual outcomes for inflation and employment measure up against our mandated policy goals.\nTo amplify this theme, today I will discuss three lessons from the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis that struck home for me: First, outcome-based policies are especially critical during crises — and are indispensable in the face of the zero lower bound (ZLB); second, a symmetric inflation target is a challenging objective for conservative central bankers to deliver in; and third, given the ZLB, risk management likely will remain a key best-practice consideration for policy decision-making for some time to come.\nSo, now that I’ve given you this executive summary, let’s start with some familiar background. Financial strains began to emerge intensely in the summer of 2007, and the FOMC initiated its first policy rate cut in September of 2007. That, by the way, was my first FOMC meeting as the Chicago Fed president.\nAs the strains intensified through the summer of 2008, the FOMC was able to respond with deeper cuts in the federal funds rate: By August 2008, the federal funds rate target had been reduced more than 300 basis points to 2 percent.\nBut in December 2008 — following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, the ensuing financial dislocations and the intensification of recessionary dynamics — the FOMC’s attempts to provide further accommodation encountered the zero lower bound.\nYet we still were enormously far from our policy objectives: Unemployment had reached nearly 7 percent and was clearly headed higher, and disinflationary forces were fierce. So unconventional policies became essential. Essentially, it was no longer business as usual for monetary, and for me the first lesson emerged.\nLesson #1: Outcome-based policies become even more critical during crises and are indispensable in the face of the ZLB.\nTough monetary policy challenges are not new. Economic fundamentals are subject to varying degrees of volatility over time. But there were crucial differences with the Great Financial Crisis from previous episodes.\nFirst, there were the historically large magnitudes of the shortfalls from our policy objectives.\nSecond, the earlier episodes began with the policy rate high enough above zero that there was a large enough cushion for cutting rates to successfully combat disinflationary forces. We ran out of that cushion in December 2008.\nIn such circumstances, it is essential to credibly commit to achieving our policy goals. Stating the goals clearly is crucial, but so are the actions that display a “do whatever it takes” mentality. This requires a willingness to take bold steps.\nFrom March 2009 through mid-2012, the FOMC employed an impressive set of unconventional monetary policy tools. The tools are by now familiarly recognized as QE1; QE2; calendar-date guidance regarding how long the federal funds rate would remain unchanged; and the maturity extension program, which was also known as Operation Twist.2 (And I am deliberately omitting the special liquidity programs.)\nThe FOMC’s actions did not occur in a straight line.\nAlong the way, there were many unexpected developments, such as the Greek sovereign debt crisis, data revisions, and generally disappointing economic performance.\nNotably, in mid-2011, the FOMC displayed a desire to be finished with unconventional policies when it published its first set of “exit principles,” or how it planned to eventually unwind these nontraditional policies.3\nWithin weeks, however, GDP growth in the first half of 2011 was revised down substantially and there was a dawning realization that the recovery was still challenged and that any improvements in inflation were about to reverse again.\nOur subsequent policy moves provide forceful examples of the benefits of outcome-based policies aimed at hitting the objectives sooner rather than later — and not doing so asymptotically.\nWe first clarified our objectives. In January 2012, the Bernanke FOMC explicitly stated that our inflation objective is 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE); and we pointed to the median of our Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) forecasts for long-run unemployment as a measure of sustainable unemployment.4 And in case there was any doubt, Chairman Bernanke stated at an April 2012 press conference that our inflation objective is symmetric.5\nActually, this occasion turned out to be an interesting milepost in the FOMC’s journey.\nPress conferences were relatively new then for the U.S., as was the focus on our Summary of Economic Projections.\nAlthough the FOMC participants’ economic projections showed a slight deterioration of performance relative to our objectives, the Committee did not make any policy moves at that meeting. Because we had made our objectives more explicit, the press questioning was intense and implied great criticism of this lack of action.\nThe critics probably were right. As 2012 played out, policymakers around the globe recognized the need for further actions to achieve their policy objectives. At the Fed, we made what I think were two of our most important and successful nontraditional policy moves.\nThe first was our open-ended QE3, which began in September 2012 and committed us to purchase long-term assets until we saw evidence of substantial improvement in the labor market.6 The second was our December 2012 forward guidance that stated we would hold the fed funds rate at the ZLB at least as long as unemployment was above 6.5 percent and while inflation didn’t exceed 2.5 percent.7\nI believe the explicit linking of these expansionary policies to economic outcomes was key. Indeed, this is one of the best examples of what an outcome-based policy is.\nAs Ben Bernanke likes to say, while QE doesn’t work in theory, it does work in practice.8\nThe FOMC was pretty confident that QE3 and the thresholds-based forward guidance would provide stimulus. But the degree of uncertainty over how and when these policies would affect the economy was substantial. So by linking the policies’ open-ended duration to progress toward our policy mandates, we assured markets we were committed to doing whatever it took to improve outcomes. This bolstered the important self-reinforcing linkages between more positive private sector expectations and better current economic outcomes.\nIn my opinion, these policies successfully demonstrated strong commitment to our objectives — and they produced results. Unemployment began to fall more quickly than anticipated in 2013, and as a result we were able to scale back the QE3 purchases beginning in late 2013 and forward guidance in March 2014. Today, we have essentially returned to full employment in the U.S.\nUnfortunately, low inflation has been more stubborn, being slower to return to our objective. From 2009 to the present, core PCE inflation, which strips out the volatile food and energy components, has underrun 2 percent and often by substantial amounts. This is eight full years below target. This is a serious policy outcome miss.\nI believe demonstrating a strong commitment to our objectives by trying harder to hit our symmetric inflation objective sooner rather than later is key to actually achieving this goal. Nevertheless, this is difficult.\nThis leads me to lesson #2.\nLesson #2: A symmetric inflation target can be a tough policy objective for conservative central bankers to deliver on.\nAs I noted earlier, Chairman Bernanke stated at an April 2012 press conference that our inflation objective is symmetric. And the FOMC provided emphasis by adding explicit language about symmetry to our long-run strategy statement in January 2016.9\nBut I think there are some institutional tendencies that make it difficult for some central bankers to tolerate above-target inflation even for limited and controlled periods of time. Let me explain by starting with recent experience.\nIn addition to core inflation underrunning 2 percent for some time, more evidence began to accumulate in the summer of 2014 that long-run inflation expectations were drifting down.\nSome drop might be expected given the long period of below-target inflation and the numerous disinflationary shocks: the step-down of growth in China and related decline in global demand for commodities; new sources of energy supply and the fall in energy prices; and a stronger U.S. dollar.\nIn this environment, five-year, five-year forward inflation compensation measured from TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) data fell considerably. Subsequently, the Michigan survey of long-run inflation expectations moved down to 25-year historical lows.10\nSo there was substantial evidence of erosion of inflation expectations.\nI think there is another contributing institutional factor to this drop — namely, the solution to the Barro–Gordon (1983) dilemma of time-inconsistent decision-making as articulated by Ken Rogoff (1985).\nThe classic Barro–Gordon dilemma is that discretionary policy setting by benevolent central bankers who seek to bring unemployment below its sustainable natural rate11 level tends to lead to above-target inflation.\nRather than following a time-invariant policy rule to address the problem of discretionary policy, Rogoff suggests appointing conservative central bankers who place less weight on achieving lower unemployment. This will correct for the upward inflation bias and can deliver lower average inflation through standard period-by-period decision-making.\nNow, a crucial element underlying the Barro–Gordon excess inflation result is the soft-hearted policymaker’s pursuit of unemployment below the sustainable natural rate. If instead all central bankers — conservative or not — learn they should not attempt to permanently deliver unsustainable levels of unemployment, then no bias correction is needed. Indeed, I think the 1970s experience and the ensuing literature taught all monetary economists this lesson.\nBut Rogoff-appointed conservative central bankers may be less inclined to acknowledge that there is no bias to correct. Indeed, think how often you hear economists and policymakers say that discretionary policy leads to excess inflation without also stating the precondition that policymakers are pursuing unsustainably low unemployment. This misreading would lead conservative central bankers to pursue overly restrictive conditions on average and deliver lower-than-optimal inflation.\nTo state this a bit differently, conservative central bankers will find it difficult to ever deliver inflation above the policy objective. In this case, our 2 percent inflation target would not be a level we fluctuate symmetrically around. Rather it would become an inflation ceiling.\nMoreover, the public makes inferences regarding our inflation target based on past performance and not just on words. When they see inflation below 2 percent for eight-plus years, they might logically think 2 percent is a “ceiling.” If so, the public would likely push down their expectations for average inflation over the longer run, making it all the more difficult for the central bank to achieve its inflation objective.\nThe current situation is even more difficult when we recognize that lower U.S. productivity and labor force growth have reduced long-run output growth. Along with massive global demand for safe assets, these trends result in lower equilibrium real interest rates.12 Lower equilibrium real rates and lower expected inflation add up to lower nominal policy rates in the steady state. All told, monetary policy will likely have less headroom to provide adequate rate cuts when large disinflationary shocks hit the economy. In other words, the risks of returning to the ZLB may be higher than we would like for some time.\nThis brings me to my third and final lesson, which is regarding risk-management.\nLesson #3: Unconventional tools are effective, but they are unconventional because we know conventional tools are stronger. So the more likely we are to encounter shocks that might take us to the ZLB in the future, the stronger we should lean policy ex ante in the direction of accommodation — that is, manage against the risks of the ZLB. And, as I just noted, we now might be facing more elevated ZLB risks than in earlier times.\nBack in 2015 I wrote a Brookings conference paper with three of my colleagues at the Chicago Fed — Jonas Fisher, François Gourio, and Spencer Krane — in which we formalized these arguments in the workhorse forward-looking New Keynesian model as well as in a standard backward-looking macro model.13\nWe considered a scenario in which the current natural real interest rate was low and expected to rise slowly over time, but the path for the rate was subject to random (and serially correlated) shocks. We show that to reduce the ZLB risks — instead of simply following upward the path for the equilibrium rate — optimal policy under uncertainty prescribes a lower rate path to reduce the risk that future unexpected shocks would drive the economy to the ZLB.\nConsider the results from the New Keynesian model shown in this chart. The dashed line shows the optimal nominal rate if policymakers and the private sector assumed there would be no future shocks to the path for the real rate. The solid line shows the optimal policy that accounts for uncertain shocks that may drive the economy to the ZLB. This risk-management adjustment is quite large, particularly early in the simulations.\nFor reference, the squares here are the median end-of-year forecasts for the federal funds rate from the March 2015 SEP. As you can see, the projected policy path early on wasn’t that different from the optimal policy prescription of this simple model.\nThe starting point for this exercise was calibrated to economic conditions that existed in the first quarter of 2015:Q1 and an assumption that the natural real rate, or r*, was minus one-half percent. r* was assumed to slowly trend up over time to 1-3/4 percent — so consistent with the 3-3/4 percent forecast for the long-run nominal federal funds rate in the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections at that time14 and our 2 percent inflation target.\nHowever, as I just noted, most economists now believe the long-run real rate is lower — maybe more like 1 percent, according to the latest SEP.15 The next figure displays how this new endpoint influences our results.\nMy coauthors separately reran our exercise calibrating economic conditions to the first quarter of 2017 and assuming r* trends up from zero to 1 percent. The solid and dashed red lines in this chart are the resulting policies with and without adjustment for uncertainty over r*.\nComparing the blue and red dotted lines, we can see that the 2017:Q1 r* assumption isn’t far from where it was assumed it would be in 2015. But the lower r* endpoint means higher odds of hitting the ZLB. Hence, the adjustment for risk management — the difference between the dashed and solid lines — is even greater now than it was at that point in the 2015 simulations. Note, too, that the solid and dashed lines do not converge until the policy rate is nearly back to neutral, meaning a role for risk management until that time.\nI must emphasize that these are very stylized models, calibrated to approximate just a few macroeconomic data and abstracting from a range of important modeling and monetary policy issues. So the results are only illustrative. Nevertheless, they do suggest that ZLB risks associated with a low long-run value of the natural rate of interest have the potential to influence risk-management considerations for some time during the policy rate normalization process.\nTo sum things up, there are many lessons for monetary policymakers to learn from the Great Financial Crisis and its aftermath. But an overarching theme is that central bankers need to concentrate on achieving their ultimate policy mandates.\nSometimes substantial challenges may require policies that wouldn’t be our first choice in more normal times, and these policies may entail some uncomfortable trade-offs.\nBut they also may be necessary to reach our policy mandates and, if so, must be chosen. After all, these mandates are what all central banks are ultimately judged on, and we must do the best we can to meet them.\nNotes\n1 For more details on the Fed’s dual mandate, see https://www.chicagofed.org/research/dual-mandate/dual-mandate.\n2 For further details on the quantitative easing (QE) programs (or large-scale asset purchases), forward guidance, and the maturity extension program, see the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2013, 2015a, 2015b).\n3 Federal Open Market Committee (2011).\n4 See Federal Open Market Committee (2012c).\n5 Bernanke (2012).\n6 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2015a) and Federal Open Market Committee (2012b).\n7 Federal Open Market Committee (2012a).\n8 Berkowitz (2014).\n9 Federal Open Market Committee (2016).\n10 These data are from the University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers.\n11 Here the natural rate of unemployment refers to the rate of unemployment that would predominate over the longer run in the absence of shocks to the economy.\n12 Equilibrium real interest rates are the rates consistent with the full employment of the economy’s productive resources.

            "content": "Vice Governor Pan (PAHN), Chairman Xu, Chairman Betsill and distinguished panelists and guests, welcome to the OTC Derivatives Symposium. I am delighted to be here with such distinguished company. The organizers have brought together many of the leading authorities on systemic issues in financial markets and, in particular, on central counterparty clearing (CCP).\n\nWe’ve hosted a number of similar events at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. Our goal is to provide a forum for informed and sincere discussion among key members of the academic, regulatory, CCP, clearing member and user communities.\n\nWe are honored to cosponsor today’s event with the People’s Bank of China. We share with the People’s Bank a vision that, together, we can develop a better understanding of the issues presented by the use of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and we can foster a deeper understanding of the role that clearing can play in the management of systemic risk. We hope that we can make this an annual event that will come to be viewed as the premier derivatives risk-management conference in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nMore generally, this collaboration between the People’s Bank of China and the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago exemplifies the importance of close international communication and coordination on financial regulation and systemic stability issues. The main theme of today’s event is risk management for the clearing process. But there are many other financial stability issues that could benefit from joint inquiry and discussion between our two institutions. I look forward to our continued collaboration in the years to come.\n\nAnd before I continue, I need to remind you that my comments here today are my own and not those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nIn my remarks today, I’ll be focusing on the topic of resilience — resilience of financial institutions, markets and infrastructures. (This is the theme of the first panel this morning.)\n\nAny discussion of financial market resilience in 2017 is likely to start with this question: Are global markets more stable now than they were in 2006? Not to keep you in suspense, I think the answer is yes — global markets are more stable. And one reason is the expanded use of central counterparty clearing. But there are still notable areas of concern, to which I will return later in my remarks.\n\nWhen I think about financial crises, I find it useful to distinguish between “shocks” and “amplification mechanisms.”\n\nA shock is something unforeseen that disrupts the normal functioning of markets. Usually the shock involves an abrupt decline in the value of a class of assets. Examples might include the stock market crashes in 1929 and 1987; sovereign debt defaults, such as those that happened in Mexico in 1982 and Russia in 1998; the bursting of the so-called dot-com bubble in 2001; and, of course, the abrupt decline of U.S. housing prices in 2006.\n\nBut it’s interesting that not all shocks result in debilitating declines in economic activity. And often the value lost in the aftermath of a crisis far exceeds the magnitude of the shock that triggered the crisis in the first place. So shocks only represent part of the story.\n\nAnd that’s where amplification becomes crucial. An amplification mechanism is a process that magnifies the impact of the shock, potentially creating a financial crisis with systemic consequences. Most of the damage to economic well-being appears to result not so much from the initial shock as from the way the shock is amplified through the system.\n\nTo give an example, the triggering shock for the recent crisis was the dramatic fall in value of subprime mortgages in the U.S. A conservative estimate of the value lost in the subprime mortgage market is around a half-trillion dollars. That’s a big number. But it’s generally recognized that the loss in economic output due to the crisis, just for the U.S., was several times the direct losses due to the initial shock.1\n\nSo, in thinking about how to mitigate the destructive consequences of financial instability, we clearly should focus first and foremost on blocking the amplification mechanism.\n\nI’d like to examine this amplification process in a bit more detail. And I’ll do so from the perspective of monetary policy. When shocks hit the financial system, uncertainty increases across the board. In response, lenders become reluctant to provide credit; investors shift into safe assets; and households and businesses start to save more and spend less. The results are that credit spreads widen dramatically; short-term risk-free interest rates fall; and the pervasive reluctance to spend and invest leads consumer price inflation to fall as well.\n\nIn the case of a severe crisis, the huge demand for safe assets could drive the market-clearing short-term interest rate negative. This presents a major challenge for monetary policymakers trying to stabilize the economy.\n\nAlthough a central bank can take its policy rates a little below zero, it may not be able to reduce them as far negative as would be needed to restore equilibrium.\n\nThe central bank could turn to unconventional policies — such as quantitative easing2 — in order to provide accommodation. But, while somewhat effective, these alternatives are, at best, imperfect substitutes for conventional policy. Accordingly, it may be a long and difficult process to pull the economy out of such a situation. The experiences across the world of severe recessions and slow recoveries following the financial crisis speak to this point quite vividly.\n\nThe effective lower bound on monetary policy rates is a serious impediment to countering large financial shocks. So an important step toward ensuring a resilient economic and financial system is to make sure that nominal interest rates stay well above their effective lower bound.\n\nThe most important way to do so is for the central bank to be clear that it will undertake whatever policies are necessary to achieve its mandated goals. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve’s mandates are to achieve maximum employment and a symmetric inflation target of 2 percent.\n\nA credible commitment to these goals can generate positive self-reinforcing linkages between private sector expectations and economic outcomes, limiting the unhelpful precautionary saving behavior and attenuating the shock amplification process that characterizes financial crises.\n\nI would note here that the symmetry of our inflation target is important — the central bank should be equally concerned about undershooting the target as overshooting. If instead the public viewed our target as a ceiling, they likely would lower their expectations for average inflation over the longer run. These lower expectations would get built into lower nominal interest rates, and thus increase the risks of hitting the effective lower bound.\n\nWhile a credible inflation target is a key element for a robust economic and financial system, there are other steps that can be taken to attenuate the amplification of shocks.\n\nWhen a shock hits a market, it is known that investors have taken major losses. But it is often unclear who bears the losses. So the natural response of potential lenders is to withhold liquidity from any counterparty that might have been affected by the shock. In other words, those that have liquidity, hoard liquidity. And those that need liquidity can’t get sufficient liquidity.\n\nPolicy actions that increase public confidence in the ability of institutions to withstand financial shocks will tend to offset this destructive liquidity-hoarding behavior. The international community has taken a number of such actions since the crisis. Particularly noteworthy are changes in bank capital regulation, including higher capital requirements; the beginnings of a truly countercyclical capital regime; regular stress testing; and minimum standards for balance sheet liquidity. All of these developments make it less likely that a large systemically important bank will be as vulnerable to the next shocks that hit the financial system.\n\nOther recent reforms increase the resilience of critical nonbank institutions. A noteworthy example in the U.S. is the new regulations for money market funds. In particular, prime institutional funds are now required to mark their net asset value to market, rather than maintaining the fiction of a constant one-dollar value per share. These new rules make it less likely that a prime institutional fund would be subject to the sort of run that followed the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in 2008.\n\nAnother salutary reform is the reduced dependence on intraday credit in the triparty repo market.\n\nBut, arguably, one of the biggest reasons that markets are more stable today is the 2009 commitment by the G20 (Group of Twenty) that led to the swaps clearing mandate. This mandate requires that the vast majority of standardized swaps be centrally cleared.\n\nCentral clearing promotes financial stability in a number of ways. First, central clearing takes a huge amount of gross exposure out of the market through multilateral netting. For example, one major CCP reported that when it started clearing swaps contracts, it achieved notional compressions of 14-to-one, largely because of the netting of gross exposures.\n\n\nSecond, central counterparties have no direct exposure to market risk because they run a matched book: Their short positions exactly match their long positions, contract by contract. Market gyrations, fire-sale pricing, fluctuations in risk spreads do not affect the financial position of the CCP, as long as no clearing members default.\n\nThird, CCPs are fairly transparent entities: Clearing members have a good deal of information about the risk-management resources available to the CCPs. And the CCPs are fairly transparent about their rules and requirements for members to remain in good standing.\n\nIn addition, while CCPs manage the risks associated with their members, they do not originate risky positions. For example, they don’t have proprietary trading operations that could generate hidden losses unseen by their members.\n\nAs a result of all of these characteristics, market participants are likely to have a good deal of confidence in their ability to assess a central counterparty’s resilience to financial shocks. In contrast, bilateral counterparties in the OTC market present a greater array of risks to assess.\n\nSo perhaps it is no surprise that centrally cleared markets tended to perform fairly well in the recent crisis. Bid–ask spreads did widen somewhat, and market depth decreased.\n\nBut throughout the crisis, it was possible to trade sizable positions on centrally cleared markets without undue price concessions. In contrast, non-centrally cleared OTC markets often experienced episodes of widespread illiquidity and dysfunction.\n\nThe benefit of central clearing is perhaps best exemplified by the quick unwinding of Lehman Brothers’ cleared positions, as compared with the long uncertain process of sorting through and unwinding AIG’s and Lehman’s uncleared swap books.\n\nBut mandated central clearing is not a “free lunch.” There are issues related to the clearing mandate that still need to be fully addressed.\n\nMost importantly, the clearing mandate concentrates risk at a single node, the CCP. This makes the CCP a single point of failure for the entire market that it clears. As such, it is an institution that is highly systemic. Resolution of a CCP, should it become necessary, must be done in an orderly fashion. However, an essential principle of financial regulation in the post-crisis world is that no taxpayer funds may be used to resolve an insolvent institution.\n\nIt is therefore essential that procedures be established to rapidly restore a stressed CCP to matched-book status using only private funds. The burden must fall on the shareholders and members of the CCP — and preferably not on the nonfinancial household and business participants in the markets that the CCP ultimately serves. Operationalizing this essential principle is a matter of intense study and debate within the CCP policy community. Many of the key voices in this debate are in this room today. It is a matter that must be addressed conclusively on a global basis.\n\nAnother issue that needs attention is CCP liquidity. Access to adequate liquidity is essential for CCPs to function. There should never be any doubts about whether a CCP’s liquidity resources are sufficient.\n\nTo achieve this level of confidence, regulators must rigorously apply the liquidity standards in the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures.3 A central counterparty must arrange, ex ante, sufficient liquidity provision from private sources to enable it to withstand an extreme market event.\n\nIn addition, systemically important CCPs would benefit from having access to reserve accounts at the central bank. By depositing their cash with the central bank, CCPs can have ready access to the safest and most liquid monetary instrument — central bank funds.\n\nAnd I believe that in times of significant stress, a central bank can play a strong financial stability role when authorized to act as liquidity provider of last resort to systemically important CCPs. Of course, in such a situation, central bank liquidity provision should be the last alternative that a CCP might utilize. CCPs should strongly rely on commercial sources of liquidity before turning to the central bank. And any liquidity loans from the central bank must be secured with sufficient collateral — as the Federal Reserve does with all of its discount window lending to depository institutions — so that the taxpayers are never at risk.\n\nFinally, we still have work to do to harmonize the clearing mandate with recent developments in bank capital regulation. Specifically, the supplemental leverage ratio can have the unintended consequence of limiting the capacity of bank-affiliated clearing members to receive cash margin from their customers. This is ironic because increasing the provision of cash margin makes both the CCP and the clearing member more stable and should be encouraged, not discouraged. In addition, the capital rules as currently proposed could discourage bank-affiliated clearing members from accepting transfers of open customer positions in default scenarios. These issues should be kept in mind as we move forward.\n\nThese issues related to CCP risk management will require diligent global coordination. Today’s conference represents an opportunity to further this international process. It brings together one of the newest, most innovative of global CCPs, the Shanghai Clearing House, with the Reserve Bank of the city that was the global pioneer of central clearing, the city of Chicago. In addition, it is an opportunity for two great central banks, the People’s Bank of China and the Federal Reserve, to continue our important dialogue. We look forward to the next two days of productive engagement and hard work on these critical issues for global financial stability.\nNotes\n1 See, for example, Atkinson, Luttrell, and Rosenblum (2013), and Hall (2014).\n2 For more about the quantitative easing, or large-scale asset purchases, programs and the rationale behind them, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2015).\n3 Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and Technical Committee of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (2012).\nReferences\nAtkinson, Tyler, David Luttrell and Harvey Rosenblum, 2013, “How bad was it?

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you for that kind introduction. It is a pleasure to join you this afternoon.\n\nThe determination of monetary policy may at times seem mysterious. The issues are complex and difficult to convey. I view communication as an important part of my responsibilities as a member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Moreover, effective communication can help improve the efficacy of monetary policy actions. Today, I hope to give you an understanding of my outlook for the U.S. economy and why I supported the Fed’s recent rate increases; the implications of low potential output growth and inflation trends; and policymaking in the current economic environment.\n\nBut before I begin my remarks, I am obliged to remind you that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the FOMC or within the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe environment for setting monetary policy has improved notably since December 2015. That is when the FOMC voted to increase the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 1/4 to 1/2 percent.1 The action marked the first time the Committee had changed the rate since December 2008.2 After a year’s pause, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate target range another 25 basis points in December 2016 and again at its meeting earlier this month.3\nUnlike some other central banks, the Federal Reserve has what is referred to as a “dual mandate.”4 Specifically, we have been charged by the U.S. Congress to create financial conditions that support both full employment and price stability. Looking where we are today, I see we have made good progress on meeting those objectives.\n\nThe unemployment rate is close to what the Committee judges to be a mandate-consistent level. And the inflation outlook has improved, though we have not quite yet achieved our 2 percent symmetric inflation target, as measured by the annual change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE).5 These are important considerations that help explain why I supported our recent rate increases and why my current dual mandate outlook allows me to support another one or two increases this year.\n\nAn important reflection of our dual mandate progress is that the expected federal funds rate path is now confidently upward sloping. In the FOMC’s latest Summary of Economic Projections (SEP),6 the median participant’s federal funds rate expectation for the end of 2018 is about 2 percent. This anticipated higher fed funds rate provides a bit of a buffer to provide additional accommodation if growth were to slow or we don’t make sufficient progress toward our inflation target. In such a case, we could loosen policy by reducing the expected fed funds rate path through forward guidance7 or, if necessary, by an outright cut in rates. Uncertainties and risks remain. But in a rising rate environment that reflects both strong economic fundamentals and, possibly, stronger fiscal support over the medium term, the Fed has more room to manage downside risks.\n\nTo be clear, my modal expectation is that the fed funds rate will evolve roughly in line with the median SEP path. So, I expect monetary policy watching will recede into a more boring spectator sport over the next couple of years. Having taken over the helm of the Chicago Fed in 2007 — great timing — I am eagerly looking forward to this.\n\nNow let me turn to my economic outlook for the United States.\n\nOutlook\nCurrently, the fundamentals for the U.S. economy are good. The labor market (in a cyclical sense) is healthy. In October 2009 the unemployment rate in the U.S. stood at a daunting 10.0 percent. Today it is 4.7 percent. Payrolls have increased for 77 consecutive months, with job gains in recent months averaging more than 200,000. To be sure, we’ve seen only moderate improvement in wages, with many measures remaining below pre-crisis levels. Some of this, however, likely reflects low productivity trends and low inflation — topics I will return to later.\n\nThe healthy labor market and improved household balance sheet positions have helped fuel solid growth in consumer spending over the past couple of years. We’ve seen some weaker incoming data in the current quarter, but I expect this will prove transitory as the fundamentals underlying consumer spending continue to look good.\n\nIn contrast, business investment has been disappointing for some time. There are understandable reasons for this: The rising value of the dollar has weighed on U.S. firms with an international presence, and low and variable oil prices have held back energy exploration and drilling. Nonetheless, even after accounting for these factors, recent capital spending has still been weak. Fortunately, recent indicators are pointing to some recovery in expenditures. And business optimism generally has increased of late, which could further boost capital spending.\n\nTo characterize my forecast over the next few years, I see: 1) gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaging moderately above potential; 2) the unemployment rate undershooting the natural rate8 somewhat; and 3) the underlying trend in inflation gradually moving up to our 2 percent symmetric target. I will return to the inflation outlook later.\n\nFor those of you who are interested in only my medium-term growth forecast, this is a good time to doze off. But if you’re interested in hearing how I see the pieces of the monetary policy puzzle fitting together, I’d try to stay awake.\n\nUncertainties\nOf course, as a monetary policymaker, my job is to worry. I know I need to be vigilant for signs that my thinking needs to be adjusted. And right now, the uncertainties are actually pretty high.\n\nBut the uncertainties today are much different than those over much of the post-crisis period. We have been exposed to many risks and have been buffeted by many headwinds. These included\n\n1. the European sovereign debt predicaments (particularly the Greek crisis in 2010);\n2. the U.S. debt limit showdown beginning in 2011; and\n3. the downshift in Chinese growth in recent years.\n\nAll of these developments posed important downside risks to the U.S. outlook. Today, some downside risks remain, but they don’t seem as intense as they once did.\n\nWhat’s also different today is that, for the first time in quite a while, we can point to more notable upside growth scenarios as well. Growth in both advanced and emerging market economies picked up in the second half of 2016, and foreign economic prospects are looking better than they have for some time. In the U.S., there are many fiscal proposals before Congress. The precise details of any final legislation remain unclear, so it’s difficult to evaluate their potential implications. However, the general thinking is that such policies could boost growth for a time.\n\nBut the bar for what constitutes an upside growth scenario is a lot lower than what it used to be. This bar is the long-run sustainable growth rate of the economy. There was a time when we thought 3-1/2 percent was possible.9 Unfortunately, that no longer seems likely. Instead, many analysts now believe that sustainable growth is not even as high as 2 percent.\n\nThis brings me to the status of trend growth in the United States.\nLow potential output growth\nAs I have spoken about for over a year now, sustainable, or trend, growth for the U.S. has been and is likely going to remain lower than we all would prefer. Changing it by much would require some truly astounding turnarounds in demographic and technological trends.\n\nThe long-run sustainable growth rate in an economy is determined by the growth rates in its labor input and the productivity of that labor. This is simple arithmetic. When my research staff adds up their estimates of these factors, they see the sustainable growth rate in the U.S. currently at about 1-3/4 percent, with only a little upside potential over the next few years as various economic headwinds fade. Many analysts have similar projections.\n\nNow, what I am about to say is not new information. But it often is overlooked in rosy economic scenarios. The arithmetic I just cited dictates that if you want to raise this number to 3 or 4 percent, you need more sustainable growth in labor input and productivity. Unfortunately, we have seen a decline in both of these factors relative to the 1982–2007 period.\n\nThe U.S. trend in labor force participation has been declining for over 15 years: Baby boomers are retiring; men have less attachment to the workforce as they grow older; female participation rates have plateaued; and participation by 18–24 year olds has declined. These patterns won’t turn around soon. It just isn’t possible to instantaneously birth a large cohort of qualified 25-year-old workers.\n\nAlong with slower labor force growth, the U.S. also has experienced slower growth in labor productivity. Improvements in labor quality — that is, gains in education and experience — are no longer adding much to productivity in the aggregate. Capital deepening has the potential to boost labor productivity.10 However, as I noted earlier, business investment has been relatively weak, resulting in only modest capital deepening. And the pace of technological advancement appears to have slowed. In the late 1990s, there was a surge in capital-embodied technological change. These gains were then incorporated into better business practices in the early 2000s. But today, growth in what economists call total factor productivity11 seems to have reverted to the slow rates seen in the 1973–95 period.12 \nOf course, it would be wonderful to be able to boost productivity gains. Some policies can help. For example, well-designed tax reform may reduce tax inefficiencies for businesses, boost investment and allow for better focus on improving business processes. However, its overall effects on sustainable productivity growth are not likely to be very large. And, more broadly, we unfortunately just don’t know that much about how to spur the technological innovations and improvements in business processes that are so important to raising productivity.\n\nFurthermore, when consequential innovations do take place, it often takes time for them to disseminate throughout the economy. Transitions may even idle some capacity for a while as the workforce acquires the skills that are necessary to use new technologies and resources are reallocated across sectors, regions and borders.\n\nWe all certainly would like to have a surge in sustainable growth to the 3 to 4 percent range. But looking at the details of how it could be accomplished, I would argue the odds of achieving such large gains in the current demographic and economic environment seem to be pretty low.\n\nWhat does this all mean for monetary policy? It is certainly possible that we could see some large GDP growth numbers for a time. However, unless they reflect sustainable, structural improvements in labor and productivity, such growth would eventually put strong pressure on resources and drive up wages and prices. Clearly, in such a situation, financial markets and the Fed’s focus on our dual mandate responsibilities would ultimately lead to more restrictive financial conditions.\n\nThis brings me to my thoughts on inflation.\nInflation\nAs you know, inflation has been underrunning the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target almost continually since 2008. My outlook sees a sustained increase to 2 percent only by 2019. Forecasting inflation is quite difficult. The outlook depends on the evolution of resource slack; the pull — up or down — from inflationary expectations; and the variety of cost shocks that can hit an economy. And today we know a lot will depend on how the fiscal and international issues play out, as well as on the implementation of monetary policy.\n\nOne concern that I have is that the post-2008 experience has left long-term inflation expectations too low. If low inflation expectations are embedded in today’s pricing decisions, the resulting downward pull on inflation would make it all the more difficult to reach our 2 percent goal.\n\nSuppose, though, that inflation does rise more quickly than I expect. How would the FOMC likely respond? Well, it depends. The FOMC’s long-run price stability goal is 2 percent for overall PCE inflation. But it is important to remember that we strive for sustained symmetric achievement of 2 percent.\n\nWhile our objective is in terms of overall PCE inflation, core inflation —which strips out the volatile food and energy sectors — is a better gauge of sustained inflationary pressures. For example, a sharp drop in energy prices pulled overall PCE inflation down to under 1/2 percent in 2015; and the recent partial rebound has lifted headline inflation to 1.9 percent. But the rise in energy prices probably will carry headline PCE inflation higher only for a time. It is more likely to fall back to the underlying rate as measured by core inflation. Today that rate is 1.7 percent. And I don’t expect it to achieve 2 percent until 2019.\n\nI believe focusing on core inflation is important for U.S. monetary policymakers. It told us that we should not ease policy in 2015 in reaction to the energy-related drop in headline inflation, and today it is telling us that we should not be adjusting policy as if we had sustainably reached our inflation rate target.\n\nSo much for transitory swings in inflation. But what about more sustained inflationary developments? How is monetary policy positioned to react to those?\nThe policy environment\nAs I noted at the outset, an upward-sloping federal funds rate path and solid economic fundamentals make for a noticeably improved policy-setting environment. The median FOMC participant envisions two additional 25 basis point increases in the federal funds rate this year and three increases next year. This would put the fed funds rate at the end of 2018 at about 2 percent.13\nCompared with previous tightening cycles, this is a far more gradual path.14 So, if economic growth and inflation expectations pick up so that core inflation rises more strongly than I expect, a sturdier economy would be able to handle a steeper path of rate increases. Furthermore, even an inflation rate of 2-1/2 percent for a time is consistent with our symmetric inflation objective. Indeed, the best way to assuredly get to 2 percent inflation is to do it faster and with momentum. So I believe that a policy path that allows for some possibility of such an inflation outcome is a reasonably acceptable risk to take.\n\nSome fear such a modest overshooting of our inflation target. Their concern is that bringing inflation back to target might require a large policy tightening and, therefore, risk a recession. This reflects memories of past monetary tightening cycles.\n\nI don’t think these comparisons are quite right for today’s economy. During much of the post-World War II era, when the Fed increased rates, we were in the midst of fighting elevated inflation. In particular, there were some truly substantial tightenings during the Fed’s persistent attempts to bring down historically high inflation during the 1970s and 1980s. The FOMC’s resolve to pursue low and stable inflation in the Volcker and Greenspan eras was strong and obvious.15\nIndeed, during most of the period from the 1970s into the 1990s, the direction of monetary policy was always pretty clear: Inflation was much too high, well above any sensible inflation objective, and monetary policy tried to engineer lower inflation whenever it was opportune. This was not without risk. There was a large recession in the early 1980s with the Volcker disinflation. And even the more delicate attempts often risked recessions — especially when other events intervened (such as the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990).\n\nBut by 2003 or so, this disinflationary process appeared to be complete. Indeed, in May 2003 inflation was flirting with uncomfortably low levels and the FOMC statement explicitly acknowledged something new — a downside risk to our price stability mandate.16\nAfter a brief respite from 2004 to 2008, we have again been living with the risk of too-low inflation. Unlike the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s, when policymakers were starting with inflation and inflation expectations that were too high, today we are starting from a position in which they are too low. Therefore, while past inflationary episodes are important historical lessons, I don’t see us as living in the same economic environment today. So the odds of needing historically similar draconian rate increases to keep inflation in check seem quite low.\n\nWhat about the opposite problem? What if the economy faltered somewhat while inflation remained well below 2 percent? Well, here, the upward-sloping path for the federal funds rate gives us leverage: Monetary policy could provide some additional accommodation simply by lowering the expected path of the increases, as conveyed in the SEP policy communications from the FOMC. In model simulations, such forward guidance has some degree of effectiveness. And if more monetary easing is required, we could also reduce the fed funds rate, providing additional direct accommodation in the old, familiar way.\n\nAs a hypothetical, suppose we find ourselves in such a situation late next year. According to the latest SEP, expectations are that the fed funds rate then would be about 2 percent, and so there would that much room to cut rates.17 To judge the degree of accommodation this could provide, we need to look at the fed funds rate relative to its neutral level, or the rate at which policy is neither expansionary nor contractionary. The long-run neutral federal funds rate is about 3 percent as judged by the median SEP.18 But the shorter- and medium-run neutral rate is likely a good deal lower than that. So while that 2 percent funds rate buffer is important, it might not represent as much accommodative room as it would if we were further down the road and the neutral rate was at its long-run level. Also, because there is a good deal of uncertainty over the neutral rate, it is always difficult to precisely judge the degree of accommodation provided by the stance of policy.\n\nSo, in spite of the better situation we find ourselves in today, I still worry about darker scenarios in which we return to the zero lower bound (ZLB). That is one reason why I think it’s so important to get inflation and inflation expectations up to target, so that we have maximum rate cutting capacity.\n\nIf we do return to the ZLB, large-scale asset purchases (also referred to as quantitative easing, or QE, programs)19 and forward guidance are useful additional tools that the Fed could employ. They have proven their worth. But it can be difficult for a large committee such as the FOMC to come to a consensus about unconventional policies. That is my take-away from my participation on the FOMC over the past ten years. And you can get a good idea of how difficult it is by reading former Chairman Bernanke’s book.20\n\nIn 2008 there were no guidelines for using unconventional policies to provide additional accommodation. The FOMC had to learn (and agree on) how to use these tools, of which there were several variations — QE1, QE2, MEP,21 open-ended QE3 and forward guidance. We have also watched with attentiveness the experiences with negative interest rates here in Europe and in Japan.\n\nThe FOMC that learned how to use quantitative easing and forward guidance is now turning over. There will be a new composition, with new governors and new presidents. This changing of the guard is natural and inevitable. Future central bankers likely will be well attuned to using our traditional policy tool, the fed funds rate, to influence the level of short-term rates. But deciding on when and how to deploy asset purchases will be far less familiar. I worry that as institutional memory recedes, the hard-learned expertise will fade as well.\n\nThere is nothing easy about quantitative easing. The resulting large balance sheets are controversial. Criticism is fine, is expected, and is a normal part of being accountable for goals-based monetary policy. Still, future Committees may have to relearn how to take necessary but unpopular actions. This also drives home the need for central bank independence to protect against short-term political considerations.\nConclusion\nTo conclude, the FOMC’s experience during and since the financial crisis highlights the need for a willingness to deploy all reasonable monetary policy tools when the times call for them — even if they might be controversial. Now, monetary policy is not alone. Ample provision of other public policy tools, such as appropriate fiscal and tax policies to support maximum employment, are also important. A stronger fiscal picture likely raises the neutral fed funds rate and thus lowers the risk of hitting the ZLB and having to resort to outsized unconventional monetary policies.\n\nBut whatever the economic environment, in the end, monetary policymakers must be ready to do what they can to meet their legislated policy objectives. Central bankers need to address legitimate criticisms. However, they also need to be resilient to critiques that ultimately could jeopardize their ability to achieve their objectives. They have the responsibility to meet these mandates, and they need to act accordingly.\n\nThank you.\nExecutive summary\nIn my remarks today, I touched upon several issues. To sum up, here are my main points:\n\n1. The environment for setting monetary policy has improved considerably. For the first time in quite a while, I see more notable upside risks to growth. And though I still have concerns, I see inflation gradually moving up to target.\n2. I think the progress made toward the FOMC’s dual mandate goals justifies our recent rate increases, and my current outlook envisions the fed funds rate moving up over the next few years along a path roughly consistent with the median FOMC projection.\n\n3. However, given the apparent decline in the growth potential of the U.S. economy and the related low level of the neutral federal funds rate, I still worry about revisiting the zero lower bound and having to resort to unconventional monetary policies.\n\n4. We are well aware of the uncertainties and difficulties associated with these policies. Nonetheless, if they are necessary to achieve our mandated policy goals, then independent central bankers must be prepared to use them.\nNotes\n1 See Federal Open Market Committee (2015). The federal funds rate is a key short-term interest rate that influences other interest rates. For more on this key policy rate, see the dual mandate federal funds rate website. \n2 See Federal Open Market Committee (2008).\n3 See Federal Open Market Committee (2016, 2017b).\n4 For more on the dual mandate, see the dual mandate website.\n5 In January 2012, the FOMC set 2 percent as the explicit inflation target consistent with our price stability mandate. See Federal Open Market Committee (2012).\n6 The SEP is released quarterly. The summary presents FOMC participants’ forecasts of key economic variables over the next three years and for the longer run. Participants also provide their assessments of the appropriate monetary policy that supports those forecasts. For the most recent projections released on March 15, 2017, see Federal Open Market Committee (2017a).\n7 For details on the Federal Reserve’s use of forward guidance, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2015b).\n8 The natural rate of unemployment is the unemployment rate that would prevail in an economy making full use of its productive resources. Consequently, it is the rate of unemployment that would predominate over the longer run in the absence of shocks to the economy.\n9 The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that over the 1960s, ’70s, ’80s and ’90s, real potential output growth averaged 3.5 percent. See Congressional Budget Office (2016).\n10 Capital deepening is defined as the ratio of capital to labor. As this ratio increases, workers have more capital to use in performing their jobs.\n11 Total factor productivity refers to the technologies and operational systems that businesses use to combine various inputs into outputs. In other words, it captures the residual growth in total output of the national economy that cannot be explained by the accumulation of measured inputs, such as labor and capital.\n12 See Fernald (2016).\n13 Federal Open Market Committee (2017a).\n14 During the previous tightening cycle, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at every meeting between August 2004 and June 2006. And even this was considered a gradual, measured pace of rate increases.\n15 Paul Volcker was the Chairman of the Federal Reserve from August 6, 1979, until August 11, 1987.

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you for the kind introduction, Alicia. And thanks to the organizers at the Board of Governors and the Minneapolis Fed for inviting me to be part of this event. I regret that I can’t attend today. But I am grateful for the opportunity to comment on the important issues raised over the last two days.\n\nThe Fed’s mission is \"to foster the stability, integrity and efficiency of the nation's monetary, financial and payment systems so as to promote optimal macroeconomic performance.\"1 Ideally, a vibrant national economy translates to prosperity in all of our communities. Unfortunately, that ideal has not always been universally realized. For a variety of reasons, including major transformations in our manufacturing industries, some of our nation’s communities have faced difficult obstacles to achieving the kind of economic success that the American public and policymakers expect.\n\nWhen communities struggle, the consequences can be long lasting. Recent academic studies by Raj Chetty, Nathaniel Hendren and others2  are able to confirm what earlier work had hinted at but didn’t always have the statistical power to precisely describe — where you grow up or currently reside matters a great deal for academic performance, economic mobility and health. This conference has highlighted the harmful effects of growing up in neighborhoods that suffer from a scarcity of basic needs, such as quality schools, fresh food and child care facilities, to name just a few. Art Rolnick — the former research director at the Minneapolis Fed — and his colleagues proposed substantial investment in early childhood education programs many years ago as one very high return avenue to fighting persistent poverty.3\nWe should be particularly interested in these research questions because it is now well established that children growing up in the U.S. experience less intergenerational economic mobility and less equality of opportunity than children in most other advanced economies4 But has this always been the case? Or has the American economy or society changed in ways that has made it even harder for children to move up than in the past?\n\nFrom the end of World War II to the early 1970s, the U.S. experienced what is sometimes referred to as a “golden age” — where economic growth was rapid and salaries grew throughout the income spectrum. Starting around 1980, however, there was a sharp rise in income inequality, the causes of which economists are still trying to understand.\n\nOne simple question we ought to ask is this: Did the shift toward greater income inequality beginning around 1980 coincide with a decline in economic mobility? A series of papers from the Chicago Fed over the past decade suggests that intergenerational mobility did in fact start to decline precisely around this time. For example, a recently released working paper by Jonathan Davis and Bhashkar Mazumder documented a marked decline in mobility between two sets of cohorts: those born between 1942 and 1953 and those born between 1957 and 1964.5 The first group entered the workforce in 1960s and 1970s, well before inequality rose, while the second group joined the workforce largely after the big rise in inequality. Davis and Mazumder show that the magnitude of the decline in mobility is striking, and is the equivalent of moving from the top quintile of economically mobile U.S. cities to the bottom quintile.\n\nSince upward mobility may be particularly challenging for residents of low-income communities, it is imperative that we better understand what leads some communities to thrive and, just as important, what factors inhibit other communities from achieving success. Moreover, we need to do what we can to raise awareness of conditions in places in need of reinvestment and assistance. These objectives have made up the core mission of the Federal Reserve’s community development departments for decades.\n\nThe Fed’s community development function was created shortly after passage of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA),6 which marks its 40th anniversary on October 12 of this year. The CRA was one of a handful of laws designed to ensure credit would flow to places where banks typically did not lend, and was a reaction to policy decisions dating back to the New Deal.\n\nOne of the most infamous of these policies, based on 1930s era redlining maps, prevented banks from issuing mortgages to minority and some immigrant households or for older construction. New research by economists at the Chicago Fed is revealing the fingerprints of redlining practices from about 80 years ago on the characteristics of communities even today.7\nWhile the worst of these lending practices have been addressed by CRA and other legislative and private actions, the CRA continues to be an important tool in addressing more subtle behaviors and policies and in encouraging scaled and coordinated revitalization. The Fed’s community development function works in various ways to support and promote this work, to document innovative lending and development strategies and to improve conditions in marginalized communities.\n\nThis morning’s plenary session will focus on skill development and workforce preparedness. It’s encouraging that lending and investment in workforce development and job creation, with special emphasis on innovation in these areas, is now addressed directly in CRA guidance. It’s also promising that CRA guidance encourages lending to groups that support and advise small businesses, in recognition of the fact that entrepreneurs are the principal source of new jobs in low-income communities. There is a great deal of work going on at the Fed’s community development areas to provide technical assistance and interpretation to financial institutions on these fronts — both in one-on-one meetings and larger informational convenings.\n\nThe Fed’s community development staff also works to ascertain the challenges to improving economic mobility through qualitative information gathering. A Fed publication titled A Perspective from Main Street: Long-Term Unemployment and Workforce Development was derived from a multiyear series of meetings and information sessions that collected the views of employers, local government, trade associations, educators and others.8 Among the report’s findings are that workforce development systems are not well coordinated locally, regionally or nationally. Secondary education is essentially disconnected from the labor market, and the record of community colleges in meeting the technical skill needs of employers is mixed. In particular, manufacturers cited a dearth of skilled workers.\n\nIn short, the evidence we have leaves considerable room for policy improvements to better harmonize diverse efforts and resources aimed at, ultimately, bringing about a better prepared and educated workforce. The stakes for our future could scarcely be higher.\nI once again want to recognize the organizers at the Board and Minneapolis Fed, and look forward to organizing and hosting the 11th biannual conference in 2019 with the Board of Governors.\nNotes\n1 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012, p. 5).\n2 See, for example, Chetty et al.

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you for that kind introduction. It is a great pleasure to be here.\nThe past ten years have been challenging for the global economy. That’s certainly been true in the U.S. The Federal Reserve Act charges the Fed with promoting financial conditions that will help the economy achieve maximum employment and price stability. In pursuit of these goals during the financial crisis, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) drastically reduced the short-term interest rate that it controls, the federal funds rate. Indeed, we brought the rate all the way to its zero lower bound (ZLB) in December 2008.1 With the economy improving and inflation moving back toward target, the Committee has been able to move the federal funds rate off the ZLB. Admittedly, these adjustments have been small so far. We’ve only made two moves — one in December 2015 and one this past December2 — and the target range for the funds rate is still just 1/2 to 3/4 percent.\nWhat about the future? In my remarks today, I will discuss my outlook for the U.S. economy and share my views on U.S. monetary policy.\nNaturally, the views I express will be my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the FOMC or in the Federal Reserve System.\nTo begin, let me lay out my main points:\n1. I envision the U.S. will experience sound economic growth and a healthy labor market over the next several years. The achievement of the Fed’s employment goal looks to be on course.\n2. Inflation has been too low for too long, but we’ve seen some promising signs that it may be poised to return to the 2 percent target that the Fed judges to be consistent with its price stability mandate.3 Still, downside risks remain.\n3. An important structural feature to keep in mind when calibrating the future path for monetary policy is that the so-called equilibrium, or neutral, level of interest rates4 is likely a good deal lower than it has been in the past.\n4. In a world characterized by lower equilibrium interest rates, there is less room to reduce policy rates when, sometime in the future, the need will inevitably arise. Accordingly, risk-management considerations point policy toward lowering the chance that policymakers again will face difficult ZLB outcomes in the future. This is an important reason why I favor taking a gradual path for the adjustment of the funds rate back toward its long-run level.\nNow, for the details.\nEconomic outlook\nLet me start by briefly sharing my outlook for the U.S. economy. After a sluggish first half in 2016, economic activity accelerated in the second half, and real gross domestic product (GDP) ended up increasing 1.9 percent over the year (on a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis). I expect growth to run a bit higher over the next couple of years — somewhere in the 2 to 2-1/2 percent range, boosted in part by expansionary fiscal policies.\n1. Moderate GDP growth\n  A strong U.S. consumer is the linchpin of this forecast. The most important factor supporting household spending is the substantially improved labor market over the past four years. The unemployment rate currently stands at 4.8 percent — less than half its 2009 peak. Over the past year, job growth has averaged around 180,000 per month. This is well in excess of what my staff estimates to be the pace necessary to keep up with population growth.  Wage growth has picked up, too. These gains have raised incomes and buoyed consumer confidence. Accommodative monetary policy has provided additional backing to the spending wherewithal of households. All of these factors should continue to support consumer spending over the medium term. In addition, households may be seeing a cut in taxes before very long.\nOutside the consumer sector, improvement has been more uneven. Business fixed investment has been weak. There are understandable reasons for this: The rising value of the U.S. dollar has been an obstacle to manufacturers and other firms with an international presence, and low and variable oil prices have held back energy exploration and drilling. Even after accounting for these factors, recent capital spending has still been weak. Fortunately, incoming indicators are pointing to some recovery in spending, and business optimism generally has increased of late, which could further boost capital spending.\nAs I said earlier, I see growth in the U.S. running in the range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent for the next two to three years. For reference, this pace is modestly stronger than my assessment of the underlying growth trend, and this will support continued improvement in the labor market.\n2. Further reduction in the unemployment rate\n  In particular, I expect the unemployment rate to decline further over the next three years, to reach 4-1/4 percent by the end of 2019. My current estimate of the natural, or equilibrium, rate of unemployment is 4.7 percent;5 I think demographic factors will steadily lower this natural rate to about 4-1/2 percent by 2020. Therefore, I expect that under appropriate monetary policy the unemployment rate will undershoot the natural rate a bit over the medium term. Modestly undershooting the unemployment goal for a time will help boost inflation toward its target.\nThere are risks to my growth outlook. On the downside, the weak international economy could weigh further on exports. But on the upside, most analysts expect the new administration and Congress to enact a set of fiscal policy changes that will be stimulative on net. That is the main reason why I boosted my projection for growth in 2017 and 2018 by about 1/4 percentage point per year. My staff and I only made a modest change. It is early in the legislative process, and we need more details. Nevertheless, there certainly is a possibility of larger temporary stimulus, as well as some policies that might influence longer-run growth.\nInflation outlook and risks\nTurning to my outlook for inflation, I am more cautious. The FOMC has an inflation target of 2 percent as measured by the annual change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE). However, over the course of the recovery, PCE inflation has averaged only 1-1/2 percent. To get a sense of where total inflation is likely to be headed over the next year or so, I look at so-called core inflation, which strips out the volatile food and energy components. And here the record is not any better. Core PCE inflation also has averaged about 1-1/2 percent since the recovery began.6 And although core inflation moved up some last year, it has been stuck around 1.7 percent for the past several months.\n3. Gradual rise in inflation to 2% target\nStill, inflation expectations, which tend to anchor future inflation, may be headed back up to a range more consistent with our 2 percent objective. Also, tighter labor markets are feeding into somewhat higher wage growth. I expect this development to continue given the modest undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment in my economic outlook. Indeed, this undershooting is a positive feature of my forecast: It should help inflation move up to 2 percent. I also expect the effects of dollar appreciation to dissipate over the projection period. Given these factors, and assuming continued support from monetary policy, my baseline forecast is that both core and total inflation will move up to reach our 2 percent inflation target over the next three years.\nWith all that said, I see some downside risks to this inflation forecast. The U.S. and other advanced economies have experienced below-target inflation rates for several years. Given the disinflationary forces across the globe and the growth challenges faced by many countries, international developments may result in additional appreciation of the dollar. And while inflation expectations in the U.S. have moved up in recent months, they remain quite low when measured against historical norms. Similarly, despite some nascent evidence of rising wage growth, progress has been slow.\nI would note that my outlook is pretty mainstream. Notably, four times a year the FOMC releases its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which presents FOMC participants’ forecasts of key economic variables over the next three years and for the longer run.7 The median FOMC forecast from the December SEP had real GDP growing slightly above its longer-run rate for the next three years and the unemployment rate running at about 4.5 percent from late this year through 2019 — a bit below the SEP’s median estimate of 4.8 percent for its longer-run rate. My colleagues are a tad more optimistic about inflation than I am, with the median participant expecting core PCE inflation to reach 2 percent by the end of 2018, about a year before I do.\nMonetary policy in a low interest rate world\nWhat does this outlook mean for monetary policy? In the December SEP, the median FOMC participant’s assumption for appropriate monetary policy has three 25 basis point increases in the federal funds rate in each of the next three years, finishing 2019 close to its long-run neutral level of 3 percent.8 It will be a welcome development to end this low interest rate cycle by 2019. But the low 3 percent neutral level still presents challenges.\n4. Gradual policy normalization\nBusiness cycles are intrinsic to the economy. So, at some future date — hopefully, far in the future — the U.S. will find itself at risk of heading into a recession. When this has happened in the past, the FOMC has used its conventional policy tools and cut the federal funds rate by 500 basis points or more. Just look at the policy cycles beginning in 1983, 1990–92, 2000–03 and 2007–08.\nWhat’s different today is that there is a near consensus among economists that the trend rate of economic growth in the U.S. is much lower now than it was during those earlier episodes. For example, our Chicago Fed estimate for trend growth is currently 1-3/4 percent.9 Standard economic theory teaches that, all else being equal, in a low-trend-growth environment, short-term real interest rates will be lower. At the moment, the assumption that the equilibrium, or neutral, real rate is as high as 1 percent may be optimistic. But let’s go for now with that 1 percent number for the sake of discussion. Together, this value and the FOMC’s symmetric 2 percent inflation target point to a nominal neutral federal funds rate of around 3 percent.10\n5. Federal funds rate\nIf monetary policy begins the next easing cycle from this 3 percent neutral rate, monetary policymakers would be able to cut the federal funds rate by only 300 basis points before hitting the zero lower bound — 200 basis points short of the 500 or so reduction implemented in other slowdowns. To be fair, most of these earlier rate cuts started with the fed funds rate above its long-run neutral level. But that doesn’t change the fact that a 3 percent neutral funds rate presents an enormous challenge if conventional monetary policy alone is deployed to help return the economy to target inflation and maximum employment.\nOf course, at the zero lower bound, central banks have unconventional policy tools that can provide additional policy accommodation. In the U.S., we dealt with the ZLB impediment in a number of ways, including the purchases of large volumes of Treasury bonds and government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) securities and the provision of forward guidance about how long the federal funds rate would stay very low.11 These were done to lower long-term borrowing rates — which never fell to zero — and to assure the public that we were committed to meeting our dual mandate goals.\nI think the evidence strongly supports the effectiveness of the Fed’s use of unconventional policy tools during the Great Financial Crisis. An eminent Great Depression scholar, former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, concluded that the shocks hitting the U.S. economy in 2007–08 were likely larger than those faced in 1929–32.12 But with the help of the extraordinary monetary, fiscal and supervisory policies made in response to crisis, the unemployment rate’s disastrous increase to 10 percent by 2009 was still much smaller than the 25 percent peak rate of the 1930s.\nNevertheless, the effects of nonconventional policies on the real economy are more uncertain than those of our conventional tools. So too are their potential costs. Indeed, the recent aggressive use of unconventional tools has also highlighted differential effects of our actions on households and businesses and other potential collateral costs, which have led to wide criticism of these tools. All in all, while extremely useful when necessary, the nonconventional policies are second-best relative to our usual instruments. But as long as equilibrium interest rates remain low, central bankers will face uncomfortably large odds of having to cut conventional policy rates to zero and then turn to these second-best tools. So unless equilibrium real interest rates move up substantially, ZLB risks will remain higher than we policymakers should feel comfortable with.\nLet me amplify on these points.\nPotential output growth is lower\nAs I mentioned earlier, my research staff estimates that potential GDP growth is currently about 1-3/4 percent, with only a little upside potential over the next few years as various economic headwinds fade. For U.S. living standards and global prospects, this is a remarkably troublesome assessment. By comparison, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that over the 1960s, ’70s, ’80s and ’90s, real potential output growth averaged 3.5 percent.13\n6. Slower potential output growth rate\nWhat would it take to achieve such sustainably high growth today? The long-run sustainable growth rate in an economy is determined by the growth rates in its labor input and the productivity of that labor. This is simple arithmetic. So, if you want 3 percent or 4 percent economic growth to be sustainable, you need more sustainable growth in labor input and in productivity.\nNow, unfortunately, we’ve seen a decline in both of these factors relative to the 1982–2007 period. The trend in labor force participation has been declining for over 15 years. Baby boomers are retiring. Men have less attachment to the workforce as they grow older. Female participation rates that were increasing for so long have plateaued. And participation by 18 to 24 year olds has declined. This won’t turn around soon. It just isn’t possible to instantly birth a large cohort of qualified 25 year olds.\nWe’ve also seen slower growth in labor productivity. Improvements in labor quality are no longer adding much to productivity in the aggregate. Gains in educational attainment and experience in the labor force have plateaued. Business investment has been relatively weak, resulting in only modest capital deepening. And the pace of technological increase appears to have slowed. After a surge in capital embodied technological change in the late 1990s and strong gains from incorporating that technology and better business practices in the early 2000s, total factor productivity14 growth seems to have reverted back toward the slow pace of the 1973–95 period.15\nOf course, the U.S. economy could experience a burst of 4 percent GDP growth for a year or two, maybe more, for a variety of reasons. But unless that’s accompanied by a sustainable structural improvement in labor and productivity growth, such GDP growth would eventually put strong pressure on resources and drive up wages and prices. Clearly, in this situation, financial markets and the Fed’s focus on our dual mandate responsibilities would ultimately lead to more restrictive financial conditions.\nSlower growth implies lower short-term real interest rates\nWhy did I spend so much time on lower potential output growth in a monetary policy discussion? Well, it’s because of what I noted earlier and many others have pointed out too: Standard economic theory indicates that all else being equal, real neutral interest rates will be lower in a lower-trend-growth regime. This is because the long-run average rate of return on investment projects is tied to the trend rate of growth of the economy. In turn, these returns determine the interest rates borrowers are willing and able to pay to finance those projects. So lower trend growth means lower returns and lower equilibrium interest rates.\n7. Lower equilibrium real interest rates\nThere are other forces that influence equilibrium interest rates, both lower and higher. For example, strong global demand for safe assets relative to the supply of those assets has been pushing rates lower. Even before the lower trend in U.S. economic growth was evident, the unmet demand for safe assets was noted as a factor driving down long-term interest rates. I can refer you to then Fed Governor Bernanke’s (2005) global saving glut hypothesis and then Fed Chair Alan Greenspan’s (2005) comments on the long-term Treasury rate conundrum for details about how the lack of safe investment opportunities in high-saving emerging markets has contributed to reduced interest rates in advanced economies.\nOf course, it’s possible that fiscal expansion, lower tax collections and bigger U.S. government budget deficits could increase the supply of safe assets. But unless these deficits are very large, the effect on equilibrium rates would likely be modest. An increase in stable and safe investment opportunities in emerging market economies could also boost rates, and so could a strong global economy, though such developments likely would be slow to unfold.\nNote that I did not mention monetary policy as a primary determinant of the equilibrium real interest rate. This is because the effects of monetary policy on the long-run growth potential of the economy or the saving preferences of economic players are small and indirect. True, the Fed sets the federal funds rate, but with the economy at full employment and inflation at target, the Fed's job is to simply guide the target fed funds rate to the equilibrium determined by these nonmonetary factors.\nAnd, for now, the balance of these nonmonetary factors remains tilted toward lower real rates. For example, by one estimate made by colleagues Thomas Laubach and John Williams and shown here, the real neutral federal funds rate averaged 3.4 percent over the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s in the U.S.;16 today, the real neutral fed funds rate is estimated to be only 20 basis points and will likely remain low for some time to come.17 That’s a 325 basis point difference. Taken at face value, this means that from comparable starting points, conventional monetary policy has 325 basis points less room to react to negative aggregate demand shocks than it had during the earlier period. Now, it is true that there are many reasons why the equilibrium real rate is likely unusually low right now. Still, under many forecasts, including those by the FOMC, the equilibrium real fed funds rate is expected to rise only to about 1 percent over the next few years. That’s still almost 250 basis points lower than the Laubach–Williams estimates for the 1970s. This is a big deal. And it demands an approach to policy setting that explicitly entertains contingency planning against the risk of running back into the zero lower bound.\nManaging risks in setting monetary policy\nMany policy analysts feel highly confident of their views, even when economic conditions are unusual by historical standards. I’m no exception. However, when navigating in uncharted territory, I think it’s important for everyone trying to market their policy proposals to ask themselves publicly the following questions: What if I’m wrong about my projection? What kind of robust policies can I consider to manage against the risks associated with unexpected outcomes?18\n8. Risk management considerations\nWith regard to current risk-management issues, many have made the following argument, and so I’ll just state it briefly. Central bankers have a pretty good handle on how to address rising inflation concerns: Use conventional policies and raise short-term policy interest rates. But when inflation is too low inflation and our policy rate is stuck at the zero lower bound, we struggle to provide adequate accommodation with unconventional policies. Because of this asymmetry, risk-management policies would favor skewing policy today to lower the chances of facing more difficult zero-lower-bound outcomes in the future. I think this strategy is important now. And it will likely continue to be important as we adjust to a low equilibrium interest rate environment. With these considerations in mind, I believe that appropriate policy calls for a slow pace of normalization in order to give the real economy an adequate growth buffer to withstand downside shocks that might otherwise drive us back down to the ZLB.\nThere is another facet to consider, namely, Fed credibility. When making their decisions, economic agents — households and businesses alike — depend on the ability of policymakers to reliably obtain their objectives. If policymakers are unable to achieve their mandated objectives within a reasonable period of time, then credibility will suffer and make those goals even more difficult to achieve. Today, given how long we have been below our inflation objective, I believe the risks are greater that the public doubts our resolve to bring inflation up to 2 percent than they question our will to bring it back down if we were to overshoot 2 percent by a meaningful amount. So, in my opinion, preserving the Fed’s credibility currently requires providing sufficient accommodation to achieve our symmetric inflation objective and maximum employment. One aspect of this strategy is the willingness to accept a modest undershooting of our unemployment goal in order to insure meeting our inflation target. I think the international experiences in Japan and the eurozone show that it is cheaper and more effective to follow policies that establish this credibility before the ZLB looms large.\nOf course, we would be in a better place if we had stronger sustainable output growth — both in the U.S. and abroad. Hopefully, nonmonetary policymakers, innovative businesses and hardworking households throughout the world will implement the new policies, develop the new technologies and gain the education and workplace skills that will support stronger growth in structural labor inputs and productivity. The resulting boost to potential output growth would yield rising equilibrium interest rates and important improvements in our many nations’ standards of living. Such success would also better allow monetary policy to become boring again and let monetary policymakers recede further into the background — something that I very much look forward to.\nThank you.\nNotes\n1 See Federal Open Market Committee (2008).\n2 See Federal Open Market Committee (2015, 2016b).\n3 This was first acknowledged in Federal Open Market Committee (2012b).\n4 Equilibrium real interest rates are the rates consistent with the full employment of the economy’s productive resources. The equilibrium interest rate is sometimes called the “natural” or “neutral” interest rate.\n5 The natural rate of unemployment is the unemployment rate that would prevail in an economy making full use of its productive resources. Consequently, it is the rate of unemployment that would predominate over the longer run in the absence of shocks to the economy.\n6 Specifically, except for a brief period at the beginning of 2012, core PCE inflation has been below 2 percent since the third quarter of 2008.\n7 See Federal Open Market Committee (2016a).\n8 The neutral, or equilibrium, federal funds rate is the funds rate associated with a neutral monetary policy (policy that is neither expansionary nor contractionary).\n9 The median FOMC participant’s longer-run projection for growth is 1.8 percent. See Federal Open Market Committee (2016a).\n10 The median FOMC participant placed the longer-run federal funds rate at 3.0 percent in December 2016. See Federal Open Market Committee (2016a).\n11 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2015a, 2015b).\n12 Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (2011, p. 354).\n13 Congressional Budget Office (2016).\n14 Total factor productivity refers to the technologies and operational systems that businesses use to combine various inputs into outputs. In other words, it captures the residual growth in total output of the national economy that cannot be explained by the accumulation of measured inputs, such as labor and capital.\n15 See Fernald (2016) for a discussion of changes in total factor productivity growth over time.\n16 See Laubach and Williams (2003, 2016).\n17 Laubach and Williams (2016) updated estimates of the baseline model described in Laubach and Williams (2003). The implications of a permanently lower rate until another shock arrives is a consequence of the I(1) statistical framework being estimated.\n18 I like to think that the FOMC’s December 2012 threshold expansionary forward guidance with an inflation safeguard was a good example of such a policy design. As stated in the Federal Open Market Committee (2012a) press release announcing the policy, the “Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.” See the press release introducing the policy for further details.\nReferences\nBernanke, Ben, 2005, “The global saving glut and the U.S. current account deficit,” remarks of Federal Reserve Governor at the Sandridge Lecture, Virginia Association of Economists, Richmond, VA, March 10.\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 2015a, “What were the Federal Reserve's large-scale asset purchases?,” Current FAQs, December 22.\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 2015b, “What is forward guidance and how is it used in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy?,” Current FAQs, December 16.\n\nCongressional Budget Office, 2016, An Update to the Budget and Economic Outlook: 2016 to 2026, report, Washington, DC, August.\n\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2016a, Summary of Economic Projections, Washington, DC, December 14.\n\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2016b, press release, Washington, DC, December 14.\n\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2015, press release, Washington, DC, December 16.\n\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2012a, press release, Washington, DC, December 12.\n\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2012b, press release, Washington, DC, January 25.\n\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2008, press release, Washington, DC, December 16.\n\nFernald, John G., 2016, “Reassessing longer-run U.S. growth: How low?,” Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, working paper, No. 2016-18.\nFinancial Crisis Inquiry Commission, 2011, The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report, Washington, DC.\n\nGreenspan, Alan, 2005, testimony of the Federal Reserve Chair before the U.S. Senate, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Washington, DC, February 16.\n\nLaubach, Thomas, and John C.

I envision the U.S. will experience sound economic growth and a healthy labor market over the next several years. The achievement of the Fed’s employment goal looks to be on course.\n2. Inflation has been too low for too long, but we’ve seen some promising signs that it may be poised to return to the 2 percent target that the Fed judges to be consistent with its price stability mandate.3 Still, downside risks remain.\n3. An important structural feature to keep in mind when calibrating the future path for monetary policy is that the so-called equilibrium, or neutral, level of interest rates4 is likely a good deal lower than it has been in the past.\n4. In a world characterized by lower equilibrium interest rates, there is less room to reduce policy rates when, sometime in the future, the need will inevitably arise. Accordingly, risk-management considerations point policy toward lowering the chance that policymakers again will face difficult ZLB outcomes in the future. This is an important reason why I favor taking a gradual path for the adjustment of the funds rate back toward its long-run level.\nNow, for the details.\nEconomic outlook\nLet me start by briefly sharing my outlook for the U.S. economy. After a sluggish first half in 2016, economic activity accelerated in the second half, and real gross domestic product (GDP) ended up increasing 1.9 percent over the year (on a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis). I expect growth to run a bit higher over the next couple of years — somewhere in the 2 to 2-1/2 percent range, boosted in part by expansionary fiscal policies.\n1. Moderate GDP growth\n  A strong U.S. consumer is the linchpin of this forecast. The most important factor supporting household spending is the substantially improved labor market over the past four years. The unemployment rate currently stands at 4.7 percent — less than half its 2009 peak. Over the past year, job growth has averaged around 180,000 per month. This is well in excess of what my staff estimates to be the pace necessary to keep up with population growth.  Wage growth has picked up, too. These gains have raised incomes and buoyed consumer confidence. Accommodative monetary policy has provided additional backing to the spending wherewithal of households. All of these factors should continue to support consumer spending over the medium term. In addition, households may be seeing a cut in taxes before very long.\nOutside the consumer sector, improvement has been more uneven. Business fixed investment has been weak. There are understandable reasons for this: The rising value of the U.S. dollar has been an obstacle to manufacturers and other firms with an international presence, and low and variable oil prices have held back energy exploration and drilling. Even after accounting for these factors, recent capital spending has still been weak. Fortunately, incoming indicators are pointing to some recovery in spending, and business optimism generally has increased of late, which could further boost capital spending.\nAs I said earlier, I see growth in the U.S. running in the range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent for the next two to three years. For reference, this pace is modestly stronger than my assessment of the underlying growth trend, and this will support continued improvement in the labor market.\n2. Further reduction in the unemployment rate\nIn particular, I expect the unemployment rate to decline further over the next three years, to reach 4-1/4 percent by the end of 2019. My current estimate of the natural, or equilibrium, rate of unemployment is 4.7 percent;5 I think demographic factors will steadily lower this natural rate to about 4-1/2 percent by 2020. Therefore, I expect that under appropriate monetary policy the unemployment rate will undershoot the natural rate a bit over the medium term. Modestly undershooting the unemployment goal for a time will help boost inflation toward its target.\nThere are risks to my growth outlook. On the downside, the weak international economy could weigh further on exports. But on the upside, most analysts expect the new administration and Congress to enact a set of fiscal policy changes that will be stimulative on net. That is the main reason why I boosted my projection for growth in 2017 and 2018 by about 1/4 percentage point per year. My staff and I only made a modest change. It is early in the legislative process, and we need more details. Nevertheless, there certainly is a possibility of larger temporary stimulus, as well as some policies that might influence longer-run growth.\nInflation outlook and risks\nTurning to my outlook for inflation, I am more cautious. The FOMC has an inflation target of 2 percent as measured by the annual change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE). However, over the course of the recovery, PCE inflation has averaged only 1-1/2 percent. To get a sense of where total inflation is likely to be headed over the next year or so, I look at so-called core inflation, which strips out the volatile food and energy components. And here the record is not any better. Core PCE inflation also has averaged about 1-1/2 percent since the recovery began.6 And although core inflation moved up some last year, it has been stuck around 1.7 percent for the past several months.\n3. Gradual rise in inflation to 2% target\nStill, inflation expectations, which tend to anchor future inflation, may be headed back up to a range more consistent with our 2 percent objective. Also, tighter labor markets are feeding into somewhat higher wage growth. I expect this development to continue given the modest undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment in my economic outlook. Indeed, this undershooting is a positive feature of my forecast: It should help inflation move up to 2 percent. I also expect the effects of dollar appreciation to dissipate over the projection period. Given these factors, and assuming continued support from monetary policy, my baseline forecast is that both core and total inflation will move up to reach our 2 percent inflation target over the next three years.\nWith all that said, I see some downside risks to this inflation forecast. The U.S. and other advanced economies have experienced below-target inflation rates for several years. Given the disinflationary forces across the globe and the growth challenges faced by many countries, international developments may result in additional appreciation of the dollar. And while inflation expectations in the U.S. have moved up in recent months, they remain quite low when measured against historical norms. Similarly, despite some nascent evidence of rising wage growth, progress has been slow.\nI would note that my outlook is pretty mainstream. Notably, four times a year the FOMC releases its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which presents FOMC participants’ forecasts of key economic variables over the next three years and for the longer run.7 The median FOMC forecast from the December SEP had real GDP growing slightly above its longer-run rate for the next three years and the unemployment rate running at about 4.5 percent from late this year through 2019 — a bit below the SEP’s median estimate of 4.8 percent for its longer-run rate. My colleagues are a tad more optimistic about inflation than I am, with the median participant expecting core PCE inflation to reach 2 percent by the end of 2018, about a year before I do.\nMonetary policy in a low interest rate world\nWhat does this outlook mean for monetary policy? In the December SEP, the median FOMC participant’s assumption for appropriate monetary policy has three 25 basis point increases in the federal funds rate in each of the next three years, finishing 2019 close to its long-run neutral level of 3 percent.8 It will be a welcome development to end this low interest rate cycle by 2019. But the low 3 percent neutral level still presents challenges.\n4. Gradual policy normalization\nBusiness cycles are intrinsic to the economy. So, at some future date — hopefully, far in the future — the U.S. will find itself at risk of heading into a recession. When this has happened in the past, the FOMC has used its conventional policy tools and cut the federal funds rate by 500 basis points or more. Just look at the policy cycles beginning in 1983, 1990–92, 2000–03 and 2007–08.\nWhat’s different today is that there is a near consensus among economists that the trend rate of economic growth in the U.S. is much lower now than it was during those earlier episodes. For example, our Chicago Fed estimate for trend growth is currently 1-3/4 percent.9 Standard economic theory teaches that, all else being equal, in a low-trend-growth environment, short-term real interest rates will be lower. At the moment, the assumption that the equilibrium, or neutral, real rate is as high as 1 percent may be optimistic. But let’s go for now with that 1 percent number for the sake of discussion. Together, this value and the FOMC’s symmetric 2 percent inflation target point to a nominal neutral federal funds rate of around 3 percent.10\n5. Federal funds rate\nIf monetary policy begins the next easing cycle from this 3 percent neutral rate, monetary policymakers would be able to cut the federal funds rate by only 300 basis points before hitting the zero lower bound — 200 basis points short of the 500 or so reduction implemented in other slowdowns. To be fair, most of these earlier rate cuts started with the fed funds rate above its long-run neutral level. But that doesn’t change the fact that a 3 percent neutral funds rate presents an enormous challenge if conventional monetary policy alone is deployed to help return the economy to target inflation and maximum employment.\nOf course, at the zero lower bound, central banks have unconventional policy tools that can provide additional policy accommodation. In the U.S., we dealt with the ZLB impediment in a number of ways, including the purchases of large volumes of Treasury bonds and government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) securities and the provision of forward guidance about how long the federal funds rate would stay very low.11 These were done to lower long-term borrowing rates — which never fell to zero — and to assure the public that we were committed to meeting our dual mandate goals.\nI think the evidence strongly supports the effectiveness of the Fed’s use of unconventional policy tools during the Great Financial Crisis. An eminent Great Depression scholar, former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, concluded that the shocks hitting the U.S. economy in 2007–08 were likely larger than those faced in 1929–32.12 But with the help of the extraordinary monetary, fiscal and supervisory policies made in response to crisis, the unemployment rate’s disastrous increase to 10 percent by 2009 was still much smaller than the 25 percent peak rate of the 1930s.\nNevertheless, the effects of nonconventional policies on the real economy are more uncertain than those of our conventional tools. So too are their potential costs. Indeed, the recent aggressive use of unconventional tools has also highlighted differential effects of our actions on households and businesses and other potential collateral costs, which have led to wide criticism of these tools. All in all, while extremely useful when necessary, the nonconventional policies are second-best relative to our usual instruments. But as long as equilibrium interest rates remain low, central bankers will face uncomfortably large odds of having to cut conventional policy rates to zero and then turn to these second-best tools. So unless equilibrium real interest rates move up substantially, ZLB risks will remain higher than we policymakers should feel comfortable with.\nLet me amplify on these points.\nPotential output growth is lower\nAs I mentioned earlier, my research staff estimates that potential GDP growth is currently about 1-3/4 percent, with only a little upside potential over the next few years as various economic headwinds fade. For U.S. living standards and global prospects, this is a remarkably troublesome assessment. By comparison, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that over the 1960s, ’70s, ’80s and ’90s, real potential output growth averaged 3.5 percent.13\n6. Slower potential output growth rate\nWhat would it take to achieve such sustainably high growth today? The long-run sustainable growth rate in an economy is determined by the growth rates in its labor input and the productivity of that labor. This is simple arithmetic. So, if you want 3 percent or 4 percent economic growth to be sustainable, you need more sustainable growth in labor input and in productivity.\nNow, unfortunately, we’ve seen a decline in both of these factors relative to the 1982–2007 period. The trend in labor force participation has been declining for over 15 years. Baby boomers are retiring. Men have less attachment to the workforce as they grow older. Female participation rates that were increasing for so long have plateaued. And participation by 18 to 24 year olds has declined. This won’t turn around soon. It just isn’t possible to instantly birth a large cohort of qualified 25 year olds.\nWe’ve also seen slower growth in labor productivity. Improvements in labor quality are no longer adding much to productivity in the aggregate. Gains in educational attainment and experience in the labor force have plateaued. Business investment has been relatively weak, resulting in only modest capital deepening. And the pace of technological increase appears to have slowed. After a surge in capital embodied technological change in the late 1990s and strong gains from incorporating that technology and better business practices in the early 2000s, total factor productivity14 growth seems to have reverted back toward the slow pace of the 1973–95 period.15\nOf course, the U.S. economy could experience a burst of 4 percent GDP growth for a year or two, maybe more, for a variety of reasons. But unless that’s accompanied by a sustainable structural improvement in labor and productivity growth, such GDP growth would eventually put strong pressure on resources and drive up wages and prices. Clearly, in this situation, financial markets and the Fed’s focus on our dual mandate responsibilities would ultimately lead to more restrictive financial conditions.\nSlower growth implies lower short-term real interest rates\nWhy did I spend so much time on lower potential output growth in a monetary policy discussion? Well, it’s because of what I noted earlier and many others have pointed out too: Standard economic theory indicates that all else being equal, real neutral interest rates will be lower in a lower-trend-growth regime. This is because the long-run average rate of return on investment projects is tied to the trend rate of growth of the economy. In turn, these returns determine the interest rates borrowers are willing and able to pay to finance those projects. So lower trend growth means lower returns and lower equilibrium interest rates.\n7. Lower equilibrium real interest rates\nThere are other forces that influence equilibrium interest rates, both lower and higher. For example, strong global demand for safe assets relative to the supply of those assets has been pushing rates lower. Even before the lower trend in U.S. economic growth was evident, the unmet demand for safe assets was noted as a factor driving down long-term interest rates. I can refer you to then Fed Governor Bernanke’s (2005) global saving glut hypothesis and then Fed Chair Alan Greenspan’s (2005) comments on the long-term Treasury rate conundrum for details about how the lack of safe investment opportunities in high-saving emerging markets has contributed to reduced interest rates in advanced economies.\nOf course, it’s possible that fiscal expansion, lower tax collections and bigger U.S. government budget deficits could increase the supply of safe assets. But unless these deficits are very large, the effect on equilibrium rates would likely be modest. An increase in stable and safe investment opportunities in emerging market economies could also boost rates, and so could a strong global economy, though such developments likely would be slow to unfold.\nNote that I did not mention monetary policy as a primary determinant of the equilibrium real interest rate. This is because the effects of monetary policy on the long-run growth potential of the economy or the saving preferences of economic players are small and indirect. True, the Fed sets the federal funds rate, but with the economy at full employment and inflation at target, the Fed's job is to simply guide the target fed funds rate to the equilibrium determined by these nonmonetary factors.\nAnd, for now, the balance of these nonmonetary factors remains tilted toward lower real rates. For example, by one estimate made by colleagues Thomas Laubach and John Williams and shown here, the real neutral federal funds rate averaged 3.4 percent over the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s in the U.S.;16 today, the real neutral fed funds rate is estimated to be only 20 basis points and will likely remain low for some time to come.17 That’s a 325 basis point difference. Taken at face value, this means that from comparable starting points, conventional monetary policy has 325 basis points less room to react to negative aggregate demand shocks than it had during the earlier period. Now, it is true that there are many reasons why the equilibrium real rate is likely unusually low right now. Still, under many forecasts, including those by the FOMC, the equilibrium real fed funds rate is expected to rise only to about 1 percent over the next few years. That’s still almost 250 basis points lower than the Laubach–Williams estimates for the 1970s. This is a big deal. And it demands an approach to policy setting that explicitly entertains contingency planning against the risk of running back into the zero lower bound.\nManaging risks in setting monetary policy\nMany policy analysts feel highly confident of their views, even when economic conditions are unusual by historical standards. I’m no exception. However, when navigating in uncharted territory, I think it’s important for everyone trying to market their policy proposals to ask themselves publicly the following questions: What if I’m wrong about my projection? What kind of robust policies can I consider to manage against the risks associated with unexpected outcomes?18\n8. Risk management considerations\nWith regard to current risk-management issues, many have made the following argument, and so I’ll just state it briefly. Central bankers have a pretty good handle on how to address rising inflation concerns: Use conventional policies and raise short-term policy interest rates. But when inflation is too low inflation and our policy rate is stuck at the zero lower bound, we struggle to provide adequate accommodation with unconventional policies. Because of this asymmetry, risk-management policies would favor skewing policy today to lower the chances of facing more difficult zero-lower-bound outcomes in the future. I think this strategy is important now. And it will likely continue to be important as we adjust to a low equilibrium interest rate environment. With these considerations in mind, I believe that appropriate policy calls for a slow pace of normalization in order to give the real economy an adequate growth buffer to withstand downside shocks that might otherwise drive us back down to the ZLB.\nThere is another facet to consider, namely, Fed credibility. When making their decisions, economic agents — households and businesses alike — depend on the ability of policymakers to reliably obtain their objectives. If policymakers are unable to achieve their mandated objectives within a reasonable period of time, then credibility will suffer and make those goals even more difficult to achieve. Today, given how long we have been below our inflation objective, I believe the risks are greater that the public doubts our resolve to bring inflation up to 2 percent than they question our will to bring it back down if we were to overshoot 2 percent by a meaningful amount. So, in my opinion, preserving the Fed’s credibility currently requires providing sufficient accommodation to achieve our symmetric inflation objective and maximum employment. One aspect of this strategy is the willingness to accept a modest undershooting of our unemployment goal in order to insure meeting our inflation target. I think the international experiences in Japan and the eurozone show that it is cheaper and more effective to follow policies that establish this credibility before the ZLB looms large.\nOf course, we would be in a better place if we had stronger sustainable output growth — both in the U.S. and abroad. Hopefully, nonmonetary policymakers, innovative businesses and hardworking households throughout the world will implement the new policies, develop the new technologies and gain the education and workplace skills that will support stronger growth in structural labor inputs and productivity. The resulting boost to potential output growth would yield rising equilibrium interest rates and important improvements in our many nations’ standards of living. Such success would also better allow monetary policy to become boring again and let monetary policymakers recede further into the background — something that I very much look forward to.\nThank you.\nNotes\n1 See Federal Open Market Committee (2008).\n2 See Federal Open Market Committee (2015, 2016b).\n3 This was first acknowledged in Federal Open Market Committee (2012b).\n4 Equilibrium real interest rates are the rates consistent with the full employment of the economy’s productive resources. The equilibrium interest rate is sometimes called the “natural” or “neutral” interest rate.\n5 The natural rate of unemployment is the unemployment rate that would prevail in an economy making full use of its productive resources. Consequently, it is the rate of unemployment that would predominate over the longer run in the absence of shocks to the economy.\n6 Specifically, except for a brief period at the beginning of 2012, core PCE inflation has been below 2 percent since the third quarter of 2008.\n7 See Federal Open Market Committee (2016a).\n8 The neutral, or equilibrium, federal funds rate is the funds rate associated with a neutral monetary policy (policy that is neither expansionary nor contractionary).\n9 The median FOMC participant’s longer-run projection for growth is 1.8 percent. See Federal Open Market Committee (2016a).\n10 The median FOMC participant placed the longer-run federal funds rate at 3.0 percent in December 2016. See Federal Open Market Committee (2016a).\n11 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2015a, 2015b).\n12 Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (2011, p. 354).\n13 Congressional Budget Office (2016).\n14 Total factor productivity refers to the technologies and operational systems that businesses use to combine various inputs into outputs. In other words, it captures the residual growth in total output of the national economy that cannot be explained by the accumulation of measured inputs, such as labor and capital.\n15 See Fernald (2016) for a discussion of changes in total factor productivity growth over time.\n16 See Laubach and Williams (2003, 2016).\n17 Laubach and Williams (2016) updated estimates of the baseline model described in Laubach and Williams (2003). The implications of a permanently lower rate until another shock arrives is a consequence of the I(1) statistical framework being estimated.\n18 I like to think that the FOMC’s December 2012 threshold expansionary forward guidance with an inflation safeguard was a good example of such a policy design. As stated in the Federal Open Market Committee (2012a) press release announcing the policy, the “Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.” See the press release introducing the policy for further details.\nReferences\nBernanke, Ben, 2005, “The global saving glut and the U.S. current account deficit,” remarks of Federal Reserve Governor at the Sandridge Lecture, Virginia Association of Economists, Richmond, VA, March 10.\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 2015a, “What were the Federal Reserve's large-scale asset purchases?,” Current FAQs, December 22.\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 2015b, “What is forward guidance and how is it used in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy?,” Current FAQs, December 16.\n\nCongressional Budget Office, 2016, An Update to the Budget and Economic Outlook: 2016 to 2026, report, Washington, DC, August.\n\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2016a, Summary of Economic Projections, Washington, DC, December 14.\n\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2016b, press release, Washington, DC, December 14.\n\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2015, press release, Washington, DC, December 16.\n\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2012a, press release, Washington, DC, December 12.\n\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2012b, press release, Washington, DC, January 25.\n\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2008, press release, Washington, DC, December 16.\n\nFernald, John G., 2016, “Reassessing longer-run U.S. growth: How low?,” Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, working paper, No. 2016-18.\nFinancial Crisis Inquiry Commission, 2011, The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report, Washington, DC.\n\nGreenspan, Alan, 2005, testimony of the Federal Reserve Chair before the U.S. Senate, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Washington, DC, February 16.\n\nLaubach, Thomas, and John C.

            "content": "Good morning. I am Charlie Evans, president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. I am pleased to welcome you to the sixth annual Summit on Regional Competitiveness. It’s a pleasure for us to work with Kelly O’Brien and the leadership team at the Alliance for Regional Development to host these convenings each fall. In 2012, the creation of the Alliance was spurred by the release of a Territorial Review of the Chicago Tri-State Metropolitan Area by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Since then, the Alliance has focused on strengthening the economic competitiveness of the 21-county, tri-state area covered by that report.1 And in many ways the Alliance’s interests align with some important work that the Chicago Fed does across our five-state region.2 Today, my remarks will highlight some of these common interests and underscore their importance in the current economy. I will close my remarks with some food for thought for the discussions that will follow.\nLet me begin by noting that any opinions I express this morning are my own, and they do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\nA major part of the Federal Reserve’s mission is to foster “the stability, integrity, and efficiency of the nation’s monetary, financial, and payment systems in order to promote optimal macroeconomic performance.\"3 Fulfilling this mission includes our work addressing the economic challenges faced by workers, families, businesses, and communities at both the regional and local levels.4\nWe know that competitive metropolitan areas contribute to a strong and stable national economy. However, to keep ours competitive, we have to address several ongoing challenges. Some of them include encouraging the efficient movement of people and goods within our metro areas; matching employers and workers in an increasingly specialized labor market; and promoting innovation and entrepreneurship. Additionally, there is a growing realization that equity and inclusion—across the socioeconomic spectrum—are essential to the sustained economic success of a region.5\nThe 2012 review of the Chicago metro area was the first of its kind conducted by the OECD in the United States. It assessed the region’s capacity to contribute effectively to Midwest and national economic performance and quality of life. While a little dated, the OECD report and others like it are motivated by a key principal that is explained in the foreword to the report:\nThe need to pursue regional competitiveness and governance is particularly acute in metropolitan regions. Although they produce the bulk of national wealth, metropolitan economies are often held back not only by unemployment and distressed areas but because opportunities for growth are not fully exploited. Effective metropolitan governance is called for if a functional region as a whole is to reach its full potential.6\nAccording to the OECD’s Territorial Review, that call for “effective metropolitan governance” in the Chicago area rests mainly on four thematic policy issues:\nthe effectiveness and coordination of workforce development programs,\nthe metro area’s capacity for innovation,\nits role as a major center for logistics in North America, and\nits capacity to encourage green growth over the long term.7\nI’d like to highlight some key Chicago Fed initiatives that closely parallel the work of the Alliance and that address some of the OECD’s policy themes.\nFirst, it’s worth recalling that the 12 Federal Reserve Banks are by definition regional entities charged with responding to the specific credit-access challenges and economic characteristics of their respective parts of the country. The 21-county, tri-state area covered in the OECD report is the core of our five-state region. We have a research group dedicated to studying our regional economy, including its industries, strengths, and growth opportunities. Our Community Development and Policy Studies, or CDPS, team has both research and outreach staff. CDPS focuses on our District’s economically marginalized communities and populations, and works to inform sensible and inclusive policy development. I want to take a few minutes to delve further into some specific components of our work in CDPS that I think is particularly relevant to today’s discussion.\nA key component of the Chicago Fed’s community development mission is to understand how economic opportunity extends to communities and households. So, in addition to analyzing macroeconomic and broad financial developments, CDPS promotes the identification and study of trends at the local level—especially in those communities and households facing the greatest barriers to labor and housing markets. Not surprisingly, these communities and households also face tremendous obstacles to new skills attainment and investment capital.8\nOver the past several years, CDPS has developed a body of work that explores regional trends in older industrial cities. This work has explored how leadership in these places connects their residents to regional labor markets so that they may take advantage of the opportunities and benefits of economic growth and mobility.\nBeginning with the Industrial Cities Initiative,9 we looked at ten industrial cities around our District, including Racine. This initiative coincided in many ways with our early engagement with the Regional Alliance. Although the ten cities all shared a common manufacturing legacy, some of them were experiencing higher income, population, and job growth. We wanted to understand why—and whether there were lessons or strategies that could be shared or scaled. Through more than 200 interviews with city and regional leaders, we identified three key principles they said would be critical to the success of their cities’ economic development.\nThe first one is investing in human capital: Many places are making efforts to attract a more educated workforce, often through downtown revitalization efforts. But the places that outperform their peers are those that are working to expand opportunities for existing residents. Post-industrial cities lag national averages for postsecondary educational attainment. Closing this gap is likely to be essential to meeting employer demands for a skilled workforce.\nThe second is addressing diversity: Some of the cities profiled were destinations during the early twentieth-century “Great Migration” of blacks from the South. Other places profiled saw increasing diversity through recent waves of immigration. As I’ve mentioned before, ensuring that all residents can benefit from economic growth is an important component of the success of a city and its region.\nAnd the final principle is that cities that are more “connected” to their regions tend to thrive. Cities that provide their residents with more links to regional labor market opportunities—perhaps through education and infrastructure—strengthen the potential for business attraction and retention.10\nDuring those interviews with local leaders, we also heard that they wanted to better understand how they are faring relative to other cities that share common traits. They also wanted to learn from others who may be facing similar challenges, for example, around housing affordability or demographic shifts that affect their labor force. We developed the Peer City Identification Tool11 to help leaders identify potential peers in terms of economic resilience, equity, housing affordability, and demographic outlook. The “P-CIT,” as we refer to it, is accessible through the ChicagoFed.org website and is one of our most visited pages. I encourage you to explore this tool when you have a chance.\nOur current work is around efforts to understand what older (often smaller) cities are doing to ensure positive labor market outcomes for all of their residents who are affected by regional, national, and global economic trends. The next iteration of our industrial cities work will explore how economic growth and inclusion can be achieved. Let me offer a preview of some of the findings from a forthcoming paper that summarizes extensive qualitative research.12 I encourage you to think about how these findings connect to today’s discussions.\nFirst, labor markets matter: Whether a labor market is tight or loose will shape how opportunities are extended to individuals. A tight labor market provides an opportunity to bring some individuals who have dropped out of the labor force back in. In places where there is little or no economic growth, the practice of labor market inclusion becomes much more challenging.\nSecond, cities can become more inclusive by addressing barriers to employment. These often include substandard public transportation, limited child-care options, scarce workforce training resources, and underfunded education and training. Affordable housing shortages near employment centers represent a longstanding issue in many regions; city leaders can expect more demand for affordable workforce housing if labor market inclusion is made a top priority.\nAnd third, coordination among several actors of different backgrounds is needed to account for the diversity among current and potential workers. Some people are more attached to the labor market than others.13 It takes careful coordination across a diverse set of actors to ensure that economic growth provides real opportunities to all—or at least a much broader set of prospective labor market participants than in earlier times.\nOur CDPS group will continue to leverage the benefits of connecting diverse places. Facilitating such connections allows cities to keep on learning about effective strategies for inclusive growth from each other. Over the past couple of months I have met personally with leaders in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Flint, Michigan. I’ve also spoken to a national convening of community development financial institutions. Today, we will hear from leaders in Spartanburg, South Carolina, and Racine, Wisconsin—areas that may share some common demographic and economic traits that might not be readily apparent.\nEmployers in Spartanburg and Racine draw workers from broad geographic footprints, which cross county and state lines. Both Spartanburg and Racine counties have seen increasingly tight labor market conditions, with unemployment at or below 4 percent, and have significant concentrations of manufacturing jobs. However, these two places also include communities with persistent barriers to economic inclusion, as well as poverty rates exceeding the national average. You can use our Peer City Identification Tool to see that both Spartanburg and Racine exhibit high levels of racial segregation, which present challenges for the economic and social inclusion of communities of color.14\nIn our growing economy, tight labor market conditions in these places currently allow for labor market opportunities to be extended to more people, including those traditionally marginalized. While monetary policy is too blunt a tool to address labor force challenges at the regional and local level, we continue to work with leaders and practitioners like yourselves to find efficient and effective ways to expand the opportunities that economic growth provides in our region.\nOver the next several hours, you’ll hear a variety of perspectives around the themes of human capital, workforce, and talent development. My job this morning has been to offer some framing observations that have emerged from our current research.\nIn closing, I want to recall some of the findings and recommendations of that OECD report15 that was the genesis of the Alliance and the annual summit:\nWhen the report was released in 2012, our region’s economic growth had slowed in the wake of the Great Recession. In more recent years, we have seen signs of a stronger recovery.\nOur workforce is aging, which some of our research suggests will be a headwind to economic growth.16\nThe overall unemployment rate in our region is at a near all-time low, but black and Hispanic workers are continuing to experience much higher rates of unemployment than white workers.\nConcentrated poverty and the spatial segregation of minority populations17 compound this problem.18\nAlso making this problem worse is a chronic educational attainment gap between whites and blacks and Hispanics.\nWhile regional economic conditions have changed somewhat since the publication of the OECD report, it nonetheless calls attention to challenges that persist. Our work within the Federal Reserve has shown us that extending economic opportunities to all individuals is a complex task that must engage a broad range of participants. Gatherings such as this one help us make progress.\nI’m sorry that I cannot stay for today’s discussions myself, but I look forward to my staff’s report on what we learn from the rest of the proceedings and how that will inform our work. I congratulate the Alliance on its successes to date, and I thank all of you for your participation and engagement in this important work.\nThank you.\nNotes\n1 The report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2012) covers the Chicago metropolitan area comprising parts of Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin.\n2 The Chicago Fed serves the Seventh Federal Reserve District, an economically diverse region that comprises all of Iowa and most of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin.\n3 Our full vision and mission statements are available online.\n4 For a discussion on gaining a grounded perspective of the underlying realities the economic data are trying to capture, see Raskin (2013).\n5 For a discussion on the connections between economic policymaking and inclusive growth, see Brainard (2017).\n6 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2012, p. 3).\n7 The four policy issues explored in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2012) are stated in supporting materials available online.\n8 Brainard (2017).\n9 Longworth (2014).\n10 Longworth (2014, pp. 15–16).\n11 Our Peer City Identification Tool is available online.\n12 George, Longworth, and O’Dell (forthcoming).\n13 See, for example, Aaronson et al.

            "content": "Introduction\nGood morning, and thank you for inviting me to this important annual gathering of the community development financial institution (CDFI) industry. Thank you to Lisa Mensah and the Opportunity Finance Network (OFN) for organizing what promises to be an enlightening and timely event over the next few days.\nAlthough I don’t intend to spend a great deal of time on the national economy, I do need to preface my remarks, as I always do, with the caveat that my comments and opinions are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.\nAs you are likely aware, by most measures, the economy has been solid in 2017 and 2018, and I believe that we will see continued growth in the near term. I could spend a good deal of time talking about the many ways that the overall economy is performing well. However, we at the Fed are aware the benefits of growth in the national economy have been slow to reach many of the communities that your organizations serve. Low- and moderate-income communities and communities of color are lagging the national economy in measures of employment, labor force participation, wage growth, and household net worth. Moreover, housing affordability in these communities remains one of the many growing challenges.\nAs the leading national network of community development financial institutions, OFN and its members address a wide range of financial needs from small rural communities to neighborhoods in the country’s major cities. As your conference theme highlights, you are agents of change in a rapidly changing environment. We find ourselves at the crossroads of several policy areas relevant to CDFIs—including potential revisions to the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA); the emergence of Opportunity Zones as a means to transform economically distressed communities with targeted capital;1 and continued consolidation in the banking industry.\nMany of you are probably familiar with the Federal Reserve’s roles in fostering “the stability, integrity, and efficiency of the nation’s monetary, financial, and payment systems in order to promote optimal macroeconomic performance.\"2 But you may be less familiar with our work to address the economic challenges faced by workers, families, and businesses in economically struggling places.\nFor example, recent research conducted here at the Chicago Fed looked at the long-term impacts of the way that the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) created residential security maps in the wake of the Great Depression to delineate where the federal government would commit financial resources in cities across the country—and where it would not. These maps were the precursor to redlining, a practice that has had lasting effects on household wealth disparities. Our researchers found “evidence of a long-run decline in homeownership, house values, rents, and credit scores along the lower graded side of borders that persists today,” and “strongly suggestive evidence that the HOLC maps had a causal and lasting effect on the development of urban neighborhoods through credit access.\"3 \nOur Community Development and Policy Studies team has done extensive analysis of the changing landscape of bank branches, minority-owned depository institutions, and community banks. It has also studied the impact of those changes in low- and moderate-income communities throughout the Chicago Fed’s five-state region. Some team members have also taken deeper dives into these issues in Detroit, exploring how small and minority-owned businesses are doing at gaining access to capital and credit. Others have focused their research on the Chatham neighborhood in Chicago, bringing data analysis together with insights from practitioners in support of the emerging revitalization effort known as the Greater Chatham Initiative. And in April 2019, we will lead the Federal Reserve System Community Development Research Conference, held in Washington, DC, and titled Renewing the Promise of the Middle Class, where researchers, policymakers, and practitioners will discuss ways to strengthen and widen paths to the middle class.4\nI recently had the opportunity to tour some neighborhoods on Chicago’s South Side with several of your members. For this tour, I’d like to thank representatives from Accion, the Chicago Community Loan Fund, Community Investment Corporation, IFF, the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, and Neighborhood Housing Services. For the better part of a day, they took me throughout the South Side to explore not just the challenges facing the neighborhoods there, but also the range of assets and opportunities that CDFIs offer to improve the lives of the people residing in those places. I understand that many of you will get the benefit of a similar tour as a part of your time here. I think you’ll find that tour both enlightening and uplifting. I know I did.\nThe tour left me with a deeper appreciation for the important work that your organizations do individually—as well as the accomplishments that were made possible by the extraordinary level of cooperation and collaboration among a committed and effective group of CDFIs. The efforts on the South Side are great examples of both the independent and collaborative work of CDFIs.\nFor decades, CDFIs have served as a bridge between what traditional banks can do in the way of financing and what needs to get done. Today, mainstream banks are moving into some lending markets that—at least in economically fragile areas—were once served only by CDFIs or other nontraditional lenders. These include lending markets for charter schools, low-income housing, fresh food stores, primary care clinics, and other facilities. So, credit access is improving for some areas because CDFIs have led the way. Just as important, through their work, CDFIs have become important and indispensable advocates for people and communities in the policymaking process at the local, regional, and national levels.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago remains committed to engaging with CDFIs throughout the Seventh Federal Reserve District and across the nation. We hope that you continue to benefit from our research and conferences on topics relevant to your work, just as we benefit from learning from you on mitigating risk and expanding access to credit, capital, and opportunities in markets around the country.\nThank you again for the opportunity to be with you today. I hope you enjoy your time here in Chicago, and I look forward to hearing more about the ideas and information that emerge from this gathering.\nNotes\n1 Further details on Opportunity Zones are available online.\n2 This excerpt is from the mission statement of the Chicago Fed, which is available online.\n3 Daniel Aaronson, Daniel Hartley, and Bhash Mazumder, 2018, \"The effects of the 1930s HOLC 'redlining' maps,\" Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, working paper, No. 2017-12, revised August 2018, available online.\n4 Details about the conference are available online.",

            "content": "Introduction\nToday, I would like to briefly share with you my outlook for the U.S. economy before turning to my views on some of the key factors that will likely influence U.S. monetary policy in the future. Naturally, my comments are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThis is not a mystery novel, so let me preview some of my comments.\nThe U.S. economy is firing on all cylinders: Growth is strong, unemployment is low, and inflation is approaching our 2 percent symmetric target on a sustained basis.1 Like my colleagues on the FOMC, I expect this good performance to continue over the next few years. While there are some risks to the outlook, I see them as being balanced.\n\nGiven the strong near-term growth fundamentals and positive inflation outlook, it is time for the Fed to return to something akin to the conventional monetary policymaking of yesteryear. Such policy will rely on gradual adjustments in interest rates to meet our mandated objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation, rather than the unconventional tools we had to use in response to the financial crisis and ensuing Great Recession.\n    There is, however, an important way this policymaking regime will differ from that in the past. I am not talking about over the immediate future. I am talking about when, at some inevitable time down the road, the next economic downturn occurs. As I will discuss in a moment, it is all too likely that policymakers would then again face a difficult monetary policy environment in which our traditional interest rate tool will prove inadequate and financial instability issues could be germane. So, with the economy close to both our goals of maximum employment and price stability, now is a good time to take a hard look at whether—and how—the Fed’s strategic monetary policy framework might be modified to better deal with these potential challenges.\n\nCurrently, economists are discussing a number of alternative monetary policy frameworks that might do so.\n\no These frameworks all share the feature that during meaningful economic downturns, they would likely entail extended periods with short-term policy rates at the effective lower bound (ELB) and the aggressive use of nonconventional policies. In the U.S., this means forward guidance about future policy rates and large-scale purchases of financial assets. And as the economy recovers, these frameworks also likely would require an extended period of inflation above 2 percent—perhaps substantially so for some time.\n\no How will policymakers communicate the use of these tools and these inflationary outcomes to the public? How will the public react, and how will this reaction in turn influence the efficacy of the policy? How should we assess the interplay in any particular alternative framework between aggressive monetary accommodation, financial instability risks, and the stance of financial regulatory oversight and supervision? These are all important questions that I will talk about in more detail today.\n\no Now, even if no sweeping changes are made to our monetary policy framework, there are opportunities to improve our existing strategy. My personal view is that we should concentrate more explicitly and publicly on outcome-based policy settings aimed at delivering maximum employment and 2 percent inflation on average through the business cycle. Bolstering the credibility that the FOMC will deliver on its policy mandates makes those goals more readily achievable—whether operating in something like our current framework or when executing any of the alternative frameworks under consideration.\nThe current economic situation and outlook\nWith that preview, let me briefly discuss my economic outlook. As we approach the tenth year of the expansion, the fundamentals for growth in the U.S. are solid. We’re moving through 2018 with a good deal of momentum, with real gross domestic product (GDP) increasing at a very robust 3.2 percent annual rate in the first half of the year. Consumer spending and business investment have been key drivers of growth. This dynamism reflects healthy labor markets, asset price increases, favorable credit conditions, fiscal policy impetus, and relatively accommodative monetary policy. Forward-looking indicators of both consumer and business spending point to continued strength, but there are concerns that ongoing uncertainty over the international trade situation may impinge on some firms’ investment plans. The one sector where activity has been a bit soft is housing, where higher mortgage rates and supply constraints have held back activity.\n\nThe Fed has a dual mandate to generate economic conditions consistent with maximum employment and low and stable inflation. So, what about inflation? I am more comfortable with the inflation outlook today than I have been for the past several years. Core consumer inflation averaged only 1.6 percent between 2010 and 2017—well below our symmetric 2 percent target.2 However, core inflation picked up earlier this year and has been running close to 2 percent since last March.\n\nMy economic outlook is generally in line with those of my colleagues on the FOMC—as indicated by the median of the projections we all submitted during our regular quarterly forecasting exercise last week.3 Most FOMC participants estimated that the economy’s long-run potential growth rate is somewhere between 1-3/4 and 2 percent. The median participant expects GDP to expand more quickly than that over the next two years, and then sees growth slowing close to potential in 2020 and 2021. The unemployment rate is projected to average a little over 3-1/2 percent over the next three years, so nearly a full percentage point below the median assumption for its long-run normal rate of 4-1/2 percent. Inflation is expected to edge up to 2.1 percent over the next three years—which is consistent with our symmetric 2 percent target.\nImplications for monetary policy\nWhat does this outlook imply for monetary policy? As the FOMC’s policy statement has said for some time, we expect that gradual increases in the federal funds rate target will be consistent with achieving our policy mandates. Last week we increased the target range 25 basis points, to between 2 and 2-1/4 percent. The median FOMC participant expects one more 25 basis point rate hike this year and then a slow rise in the funds rate to 3.4 percent by the end of 2020. At the same time, in the background we have a gradual reduction in the Fed’s balance sheet as securities acquired during our asset purchase programs mature.\n\nNote that most FOMC participants see the long-run neutral fed funds rate—that is, where the rate should settle at when policy is neither expansionary nor contractionary—somewhere in the range of 2-3/4 to 3 percent. Putting aside the uncertainties regarding the estimates of the neutral rate, this means that policy is expected to become mildly restrictive later in the projection period. Given an unemployment rate forecast below the natural rate,4 such a policy stance would be quite normal and consistent with some moderation in growth and a gradual return of employment to its longer-run sustainable level.\n\nOf course, these are just forecasts. In the end, we may need to tighten somewhat more if unexpected tailwinds emerge that push the economy too far beyond sustainable growth and cause inflation to rise too far above our symmetric 2 percent objective. Alternatively, we could face unexpected headwinds that threaten growth or inhibit inflation expectations from firmly centering around our 2 percent inflation target. In such a case we may need to take a more accommodative policy path.\n\nThe FOMC’s stated intention of gradual increases in the federal funds rate target sounds pretty much like the more conventional, mainstream monetary policy that characterized the Fed’s actions in the 20 years prior to the financial crisis. Considering the potential headwind or tailwind risks that might emerge, a gradual path gives us the flexibility to make appropriate risk-management adjustments to policy should they be called for.\n\nA basic tenet of such good conventional monetary policy is that it is a supporting actor: The lead roles in the economy are played by households and competitive private businesses making their best saving, investment, and employment decisions, along with governments at all levels (federal, state, and local) doing their best to design and execute effective public policy programs.\n\nAs a supporting actor, monetary policy focuses on 1) assessing the various headwinds and tailwinds influencing the economy and 2) moving policy into a modestly accommodative or modestly restrictive stance, when appropriate, to help the main actors achieve maximum sustainable employment and price stability.\n\nObviously, from 2008 to 2014, the Fed did much more than this. These other actions were controversial and provoked criticism. However, financial turmoil, fiscal restraint, and the international situation required us to take such a course. We are now happily returning to our supporting actor role.\n\nThere is, however, an important difference between the conventional monetary policy of today and conventional policy prior to the Great Recession. Specifically, the potential growth rate of the economy and the neutral interest rate are a good deal lower than they used to be.\n\nMy colleagues and I have talked extensively in public about the factors that are driving neutral interest rates lower: slower population growth; a falling trend labor force participation rate; lower labor productivity growth; higher demand for safe assets by investors around the world; and lower inflation.5  As you know, the U.S. isn’t alone here; most advanced economies are facing similar situations.\n\nThis new reality has important implications for monetary policy. Between the mid-1980s and early 2000s, the Federal Reserve typically cut short-term policy rates something in the neighborhood of 5 percentage points when mitigating economic downturns. And at times we cut by even more: Between 1990 and 1992, we dropped rates by 6-3/4 percentage points, from 9-3/4 to 3 percent. Today, given a neutral federal funds rate in the range of, say, 2-1/2 to 3 percent, we simply do not have that kind of rate-cutting capacity.\n\nSo, unfortunately, the risks of returning to the ELB are higher than we would like. Although it’s very hard to estimate, nearly 20 years ago one well-known study put these risks at about 15 percent; work done in 2017 put the odds today closer to 40 percent.6 This represents a very high risk of experiencing a costly economic event that could compel the Fed to fall back on remedies policymakers often find difficult, if not downright distasteful, to implement.\n\nThis problem has led economists to think more about alternative frameworks that might improve the performance of monetary policy in a world with higher risks of returning to the ELB. Ideas include an explicitly higher inflation target (say, 4 percent); nominal-GDP targeting; temporary, state-contingent price-level targeting; and unconditional price-level targeting.7 \nIt is not my intention today to offer any endorsements or critiques of these proposals. However, I would like to highlight some of the important issues to consider when evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the various frameworks.\nThe implications of alternative frameworks for inflation\nLet me begin with inflation. When the Federal Reserve started discussing an explicit inflation target in the 1990s, it certainly recognized that many factors play a role in determining the best inflation objective. I don’t have time to go into them in any detail, but they included things like how inflation may influence labor market behavior, especially as downwardly rigid nominal wages can throw sand in the gears of labor markets and boost unemployment.8 And, of course, another key consideration in target choice was how often we might encounter the effective lower bound. In the end, the Fed, like many other central banks around the world, ultimately settled on a 2 percent target.\n\nThe alternative monetary frameworks being discussed often allow for inflation much higher than 2 percent. Clearly, one way of reducing the ELB odds would be for inflation to average 3 or 4 percent over the long run, boosting the nominal neutral funds rate to 4 or 5 percent and providing more room to cut rates in a downturn. For this reason, a permanently higher inflation objective is on the list of possible alternative frameworks. The various level-targeting frameworks would produce temporary—though potentially protracted—periods of inflation above 2 percent. The reasoning is simple. Think about a price-level target. A period of subpar performance would open up a shortfall in the price level from its trend line target. To close the gap, policymakers would need to generate a period of above-trend-line inflation. Closing big gaps would require some big increases in inflation.\n\nWhat would be the public’s reaction to such higher inflation rates? Would they believe the Fed would bring inflation back to 2 percent in the long run? Or would they figure that higher inflation was here to stay? Would they tolerate this change?\n\nNaturally, a related set of issues would arise following a protracted period of overshooting a level target. Would the public support the monetary restraint required to deflate a large positive price-level or nominal-income gap? The experiences from applying such restraint in the 1980s were quite painful. But, because of the asymmetries inherent with the ELB and the ability of the Fed to confidently tighten monetary conditions by simply increasing short-term policy rates, I see such a scenario as less likely than a protracted undershooting of targets. Yet, it’s still an important consideration.\n\nIn sum, these alternative monetary frameworks might be attractive in theory, but as a policymaker I must also consider how practical they would be to implement. I don’t know the answer to that question yet.\nInteractions between monetary and regulatory frameworks\nLet’s now turn to the interactions of monetary policy with financial markets and regulatory policies. Achieving our maximum employment and inflation mandates might require some long periods of strong monetary policy accommodation. Is the financial market system and regulatory environment robust enough to limit financial instability risks in those circumstances? Can the Fed conduct an effective and independent monetary policy strategy irrespective of the state of financial markets and regulatory policies?\n\nFinancial stability is an important goal of the Federal Reserve. As was all too apparent during the crisis, a breakdown in financial intermediation can have severe consequences for the real economy. So we must ask if some alternative monetary policy frameworks might be more (or less) prone to generating financial instability risks.\n\nA robust financial market culture—in which excessive risk-taking is punished by market discipline first and regulatory restrictions second—would allow for stronger monetary strategies to be pursued. But a weak self-regulating market culture without adequate compensating public sector guardrails could prevent using the otherwise most effective monetary framework.\n\nOf course, given the spectrum of competing incentives, these financial regulatory challenges are quite difficult to manage. And I should note that a robust macroprudential structure is relevant for any monetary policy structure, including our current one. But—and this is my point here—when designing strategies, we must understand the interactions between the monetary and regulatory frameworks. And we must recognize that these will change over time and over the business cycle.\n\nWill strongly accommodative policies induce financial instability risks that require enhanced financial regulation? Or will market discipline alone be sufficient—regardless of the monetary framework we choose? The ultimate effectiveness of any strategy will depend on the answers to these questions. For example, suppose macroeconomic conditions called for an aggressive commitment to low policy rates and quantitative easing. If the regulatory regime was weak and financial instability risks were rising, then the public might doubt our will to carry through with these commitments. This loss of credibility would greatly diminish the efficacy of these policies. This quandary is not merely hypothetical. During the financial crisis, some opposed taking aggressive monetary policy actions over concerns about financial instability risks.\n\nSo policymakers will need to address the financial stability implications for each suggested alternative monetary framework. I certainly acknowledge that we have much important work to do on this front.\nConclusion: The need for outcome-based policies\nI want to reiterate that I am not prejudging any alternative framework today. That being said, within the mix of possible outcomes, the Fed needs to give strong consideration to staying with our current monetary policy strategy. If we do so, we must ensure that it is as robust as possible. I believe an important way of achieving this is to emphasize outcome-based policy. One example of such policy is the threshold-based forward guidance we undertook in December 2012. Former Chair Yellen’s lower-for-longer policy proposal to deal with ELB episodes can also be seen as falling into this category.9\nOver the past several years most of my monetary policy commentary has emphasized the need for policy setting aimed at achieving our maximum employment and price stability objectives as quickly as possible—with an eye toward insuring against costly risk scenarios. Importantly, I think outcome-based policy actions should take precedence over faithful adherence to time-invariant instrument-based decision rules. One example of such a rule is the well-known Taylor rule, which uses fixed parameters to mechanically link the setting of the policy interest rate to deviations in inflation and employment from their long-run targets.10 \nBut changes in the economic environment may reduce the effectiveness of such strict instrument-setting rules or, at times, even make them counterproductive. For instance, it clearly would be a mistake to insist on a 2 percent intercept in a Taylor rule when we think the neutral real federal funds rate is really closer to zero. Furthermore, such rules also do not allow for adjusting policy in one direction or the other as insurance against costly downside risks that might be evident to policymakers.11 Focusing on hitting mandated outcomes with risk management against adverse scenarios can avoid such missteps.\n\nTo summarize, after many years, we finally are close to achieving our dual mandate objectives and are finally returning to a more conventional policy approach. This is good. But the economy has fundamentally changed, and there will be less headroom to cut policy rates when the next downturn occurs. We need to plan ahead. And when judging whether we stay with our current framework or move to an alternative, we need to remember that the key criterion is the ability to deliver on the central bank’s mandated policy goals. Regardless of the policy framework, the goals of maximum employment and price stability remain unchanged—as does the Federal Reserve’s mandate to meet them as best as it can.\n\nThank you.\nNotes\n1 In January 2012, the FOMC set 2 percent inflation—measured by the annual change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE)—as the explicit symmetric inflation target consistent with our price stability mandate (Federal Open Market Committee, 2012). For more on the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate, see our dual mandate webpage.\n2 While our objective is stated in terms of overall PCE inflation, core inflation—which strips out the volatile food and energy sectors—is a better gauge of sustained inflationary pressures and where inflation is headed in the future.\n3 Four times a year the FOMC releases its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which presents FOMC participants’ forecasts of key economic variables over the next three years and for the longer run. Participants also provide their assessments of the appropriate monetary policy that supports those forecasts. For the most recent SEP, see Federal Open Market Committee (2018).\n4 The natural rate of unemployment is the unemployment rate that would prevail in an economy making full use of its productive resources. Consequently, it is the rate of unemployment that would predominate over the longer run in the absence of shocks to the economy.\n5 A partial list of my speeches highlighting this point include Evans (2016a, 2016b, 2017, 2018a). Other colleagues have made this point as well.

            "content": "Introduction\nI’d like to thank the Northeast Indiana Regional Economic Forum for the invitation to speak here this morning. It’s a pleasure to visit Fort Wayne and to observe firsthand the area’s flourishing economy. In my remarks this morning, I would like to share with you my outlook for the economy and my views on the future of monetary policy. Naturally, my comments are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nFirst, let me give you a preview of some of my comments: The U.S. economy is firing on all cylinders, with strong growth, low unemployment, and inflation approaching our 2 percent symmetric target on a sustained basis.1 I expect this good performance to continue over the next few years. While there are some risks to the outlook, I see them as being balanced.\nGiven the strong growth fundamentals and positive inflation outlook, it is time for the Fed to return to the conventional monetary policymaking of yesteryear. Such policy will rely on gradual adjustments in interest rates to meet our mandated objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation, rather than the unconventional tools we had to use in response to the financial crisis and ensuing Great Recession.\nThere is an important caveat, however. As I will discuss in more detail, the longer-run normal level of interest rates—what economists call the neutral level—is noticeably lower today than it was during earlier times of conventional monetary policymaking. This means we don’t have the same capacity to cut interest rates in response to adverse economic shocks as we did in the past. And if we run out of such room, then we may again have to turn to unconventional tools such as large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance about the funds rate to provide monetary accommodation. So, we aren’t quite going back to the same old monetary policy world that we had in the past. My son might refer to this as a “remix.”\nThe current economic situation and outlook\nWe are now approaching the tenth year of the expansion, and the fundamentals for growth are solid. We entered 2018 with a good deal of momentum, with real gross domestic product (GDP) increasing at a very robust 3.3 percent annual rate in the first half of the year.\nAs has been the case for some time, consumer spending has been quite strong. A key source of this strength comes from the income gains and job security associated with a healthy labor market. Over the course of 2017, job gains averaged over 180,000 per month; and they have risen to average over 200,000 per month so far this year. These increases far exceed the pace needed to absorb new entrants into the labor force; as a result, the unemployment rate has declined to 3.9 percent—near its lowest level since 2000. In addition, against the backdrop of a declining trend, the labor force participation rate—which is the share of the working-age population that is either working or actively seeking a job—has stabilized in recent years, as those with marginal attachments returned to the labor market. Other labor market indicators—such as job openings, quits, and the number of people working part time for economic reasons—also are quite positive.\nIn addition to the gains in households’ well-being generated by a healthy labor market, households’ disposable income has been boosted by recent tax cuts. And increases in the stock market and housing prices have boosted household net worth. So, all in all, the consumer is feeling pretty good.\nBusiness capital spending has been another source of strength in the economy, having risen more than 6-3/4 percent at an annual rate over the first half of the year. Moreover, forward-looking indicators—such as the backlog of unfilled orders for capital goods and upbeat business sentiment—point to a continuation of robust gains in investment. Likewise, my business contacts in Indiana and elsewhere report solid momentum in capital expenditures in the near term, but there are concerns that continued uncertainty over the international trade situation may impinge on some firms’ investment plans further out in the future.\nHousing, however, is one sector where activity has been soft. Residential investment, which had been on a modest uptrend since 2010, has flattened out over the past year and a half as mortgage rates have moved up. Still, at about 4-1/2 percent, the level of mortgage rates isn’t very high by historical standards. Indeed, favorable credit conditions continue to support household and business spending, with accommodative lending rates and ample access to credit for both consumers and firms with solid credit scores.\nOf course, recent fiscal policy actions also are influencing the economy. There are many details in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 and the Bipartisan Budget Act (BBA) of 2018 to evaluate. For the tax act in particular, there are a variety of channels that influence spending, and its overall effect on GDP growth is highly uncertain. That said, most analyses find that the two fiscal policy changes should boost aggregate activity by a moderate amount in the near and medium terms; but the longer-run effects are likely to be relatively small.\nAll told, I expect GDP growth in 2018 to be in the neighborhood of 3 percent. I anticipate growth will slow down some in 2019 and 2020, as the fiscal bump wears off and typical cyclical dynamics—including the normalization of monetary policy—result in activity settling into its long-run sustainable path. For reference, my staff estimates that the growth rate of GDP along this path is a bit under 2 percent.\nGiven this outlook for growth, I expect the unemployment rate will decline further to about 3-1/2 percent by the end of 2020. This is almost a full percentage point below my staff’s estimate of what economists call its natural rate. This is the unemployment rate consistent with the normal churning of people in and out of jobs at a time when the workforce is fully employed.\nWhat about inflation? I am more comfortable with the inflation outlook today than I have been for the past several years. Core consumer inflation, which cuts through a lot of the statistical noise in overall prices, averaged only 1.6 percent between 2010 and 2017—well below our symmetric 2 percent target. However, core inflation picked up earlier this year and has been running close to 2 percent since last March.\nLooking ahead, I expect inflation to rise a bit further over the next few years. If my forecast for the drop in the unemployment rate is correct, then we should see some more pressure developing on productive resources in the economy, generating higher costs and higher prices. I also expect to see some further firming in the inflation expectations of households and businesses, which have only partially recovered from their downturn in 2013 and 2014. Similarly, while wage increases have been disappointingly low, more and more of my business contacts—including those in Indiana—say they are willing to increase compensation to hire or keep qualified workers. So I expect tighter labor markets to lead to higher wage growth before too long.\nTo sum up, I expect the economy to expand at a solid rate over the next several years; the unemployment rate to decline somewhat further; and inflation to edge up a bit above 2 percent—but certainly not to anything high enough to be inconsistent with our symmetric 2 percent target. Let me also note that my economic outlook is generally in line with those of my colleagues on the FOMC as indicated by the median of the projections we all submitted during our last regular quarterly forecasting exercise this past June.2 In other words, we are more or less singing the same tune.\nA return to conventional monetary policymaking\nAs we move forward, what does this outlook imply for monetary policy? The current range for the federal funds rate target is between 1-3/4 and 2 percent. In the FOMC’s June projections, the median participant expected the federal funds rate to be 2.4 percent by the end of 2018 (so two more 25 basis point increases this year) and then to move up to 3.1 percent by the end of 2019 and 3.4 percent by the end of 2020. At the same time, in the background we have a gradual reduction in the Fed’s balance sheet as securities acquired during our asset purchase programs mature.\nTo put the projected interest rate path in perspective, note that in our quarterly forecasts each FOMC participant also writes down where the federal funds rate should settle at when policy is neutral—that is, when policy is neither expansionary nor contractionary. Most FOMC participants put this neutral federal funds rate somewhere in the range of 2-1/2 to 3 percent. This means that the 3 to 3-1/2 percent level of the funds rate projected for 2019 and 2020 is mildly restrictive. Given an unemployment rate forecast below the natural rate, such a policy stance would be quite normal and consistent with some moderation in growth and a gradual return of employment to its longer-run sustainable level.\nOf course, these are just forecasts. In the end, actual policy will differ from this path depending on whatever headwinds and tailwinds arise from the various shocks that inevitably will hit the economy.\nOn the one hand, we may need to tighten somewhat further if currently unexpected tailwinds emerge that push the economy too far beyond sustainable growth and employment levels, potentially leading to unacceptably high inflation beyond our symmetric 2 percent objective. This could happen if we discover that we underestimated the forward momentum imparted by earlier monetary accommodation. Another possibility is that we might experience greater-than-expected impetus from the fiscal policy changes I just spoke about and that extra growth is not accompanied by gains in the economy’s underlying productive potential.\nOn the other hand, we may need to take a shallower policy path if unexpected headwinds emerge. This could occur if, for example, continued uncertainty over the international trade situation generated adverse business sentiment and reduced spending or, alternatively, if the firming of inflation expectations stalls out before they are clearly centered around our 2 percent inflation target.\nAbsent these types of surprises, I expect the strong fundamentals for growth to continue and inflation will reach our symmetric 2 percent target on a sustained basis. Given this outlook, it is time to return to the more conventional, mainstream monetary policy that characterized the Fed’s policymaking in the 20 years prior to the financial crisis.\nA basic tenet of such good conventional monetary policy is that it is a supporting actor: The lead roles in the economy are played by households and competitive private businesses making their best saving, investment, and employment decisions and by governments at all levels (federal, state, and local) doing their best to design and execute effective public policy programs. As a supporting actor, monetary policy focuses on 1) assessing the various headwinds and tailwinds influencing the economy and 2) moving policy into a modestly accommodative or modestly restrictive stance, when appropriate, to help the main actors achieve maximum sustainable employment and price stability.\nLow equilibrium interest rates are challenging\nThere is, however, an important difference between the conventional monetary policy of today and conventional policy prior to the Great Recession. That is, the neutral interest rate—the rate when policy is neither expansionary nor contractionary—is a good deal lower than it used to be.\nBefore I talk about its implications for policy, let me describe why we think the neutral rate is lower. One reason is that, unfortunately, trend economic growth is quite a bit lower today than in earlier times. Standard economic theory teaches us that, all else being equal, the neutral real interest rate will be lower in a low-trend-growth economy.\nThe reasons for the slowdown are well known. Growth in the labor force has moderated with slower population growth and a downtrend in labor force participation. Furthermore, labor productivity has been disappointing, especially when compared with the large gains seen in the second half of the 1990s and the early 2000s. These realities will likely be with us for a long time. I should note, too, that the U.S. isn’t alone here; most advanced economies are facing similar situations.\nAs I mentioned before, at the Chicago Fed, we see the longer-run U.S. growth potential at a bit under 2 percent. I hope this assessment turns out to be too pessimistic. Higher sustainable growth would be great. However, we can’t get there without boosting the underlying trends in labor input or productivity. As a nation, we should work on public policy that could be effective in doing so. But such policies are clearly outside the realm of monetary policy.\nThere are other reasons why the neutral interest rate is lower now. One is the large demand—from both domestic and foreign sources—for U.S. Treasuries and other high-quality assets. And, of course, low inflation also reduces the neutral nominal interest rate.\nThis new reality has important implications for monetary policy. When the economy is hit with disinflationary shocks, the Fed provides offsetting stimulus by reducing its main policy tool, the federal funds rate. But there is a limit to how far the funds rate can be cut without causing large-scale counterproductive disruptions in short-term money markets. Some central banks found they could take their policy rates a touch negative, but not very much so; in the U.S. we think this so-called effective lower bound—or ELB—on the funds rate is essentially zero.\nWith this in mind, it’s clear that a lower neutral interest rate will mean that monetary policy will have less headroom to provide adequate rate cuts when large disinflationary shocks hit the economy. Between the mid-1980s and early 2000s, we typically reduced short-term policy rates something in the neighborhood of 500 basis points when mitigating economic downturns. Today, given a neutral federal funds rate in the range of, say, 2-1/2 to 3 percent, we simply do not have that kind of rate-cutting capacity. So, unfortunately, the risks of returning to the ELB are higher than we would like. Although it’s very hard to estimate, nearly 20 years ago one well-known study put these risks at about 15 percent; work done in 2017 put the odds today closer to 40 percent .3\nOnce at the ELB, policymakers must turn to alternative, nonconventional policies to provide accommodation. Of course, this is what happened during the Great Recession. By late 2008 we had reduced the federal funds rate to essentially zero and had to turn to purchases of large amounts of long-term Treasury and government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) securities and to forward guidance about the future path of interest rates.\nWhile these tools proved useful, they are not perfect substitutes for our usual interest rate policy. Indeed, there is a good deal of research going on today in academia and in central banks on alternative frameworks that might improve the performance of monetary policy in a world with higher risks of returning to the ELB.4 But there are no panaceas. Alternatives may lessen the odds of hitting the ELB, but they cannot drive them to zero. And whenever we are at the ELB, the question of alternative policy tools becomes relevant again.\nPersonally, the most important lesson I learned from our experience at the ELB is that policymakers have to promise to use all available means to bring inflation and employment back to their objectives within a reasonable period of time. And, crucially, this promise must be credible. Failing to back it up with actions and communications all along the way would have rendered our unconventional policies stillborn and ineffective. We must remember this lesson for any future encounters we may have with the ELB.\nIndeed, the FOMC has made clear that it stands ready to use alternative policies if needed. In an addendum to our Policy Normalization Principles and Plans made a little over a year ago, the Committee stated it would be ready to use its full range of tools if future economic conditions warranted more accommodative policy than could be achieved by use of the federal funds rate alone.5 You can find this point reiterated in the minutes of our meeting last month.6 And in his Jackson Hole address in August, Chair Powell reiterated the importance of the “do whatever it takes” approach to policy when faced with difficult situations such as the risk of a protracted period at the ELB or if inflation expectations were to move into material conflict with our inflation objective.7 \nSo, to conclude, while today the improvements in the economy are allowing us to return to a more conventional monetary policymaking, we must remain vigilant. There will be many challenges facing the Fed—as well as other central banks—as we make the transition. And we will have to be aware of the higher risks we face of hitting the ELB as we settle in to the “new normal” world. But hopefully, our challenges in the future will prove more familiar and easier to deal with than those we experienced over the past ten years.\nNotes\n1 In January 2012, the FOMC set 2 percent inflation—measured by the annual change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE)—as the explicit symmetric inflation target consistent with our price stability mandate (Federal Open Market Committee, 2012). For more on the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate, see our dual mandate webpage.\n2 Four times a year the FOMC releases its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which presents FOMC participants’ forecasts of key economic variables over the next three years and for the longer run. Participants also provide their assessments of the appropriate monetary policy that supports those forecasts. For the most recent SEP, see Federal Open Market Committee (2018b).\n3 See Reifschneider and Williams (2000) and Kiley and Roberts (2017).\n4 A number of alternative monetary policy frameworks have been proposed to address the ELB risks: Examples include an explicitly higher inflation target; nominal GDP targeting; temporary, state-contingent price-level targeting; and unconditional price-level targeting.

            "content": "Introduction\nIt’s been ten years since the Lehman Brothers crisis in the U.S. and the plunge of economies around the globe into the throes of the financial crisis and Great Recession. Monetary policymakers grappled with huge economic and financial stresses. In response to the turmoil, policymakers soon reduced short-term policy rates to somewhere around zero, with the precise values depending on what individual central banks saw as the practical effective lower bound (ELB) for their respective policy rates.\nTo provide further accommodation, central banks adopted many innovative unconventional monetary policies. You are all familiar with these tools. In the U.S., after hitting the effective lower bound on the federal funds rate, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) turned to large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance about the future path for the funds rate. Eventually, the U.S. economy grew slowly but reasonably surely once our open-ended QE3 asset purchase program took effect and we communicated—and followed through on—delaying interest rate increases until we were adequately assured that the recovery had gained traction.\nPersonally, the most important lesson I learned from this process was that policymakers have to promise to use all available means to bring inflation and employment back to their objectives within a reasonable period of time. And, crucially, this promise has to be credible. Failing to back it up with actions and communications all along the way would have rendered our unconventional policies stillborn and ineffective.\nThis lesson is important to remember because in our current environment of lower trend growth and low equilibrium real interest rates, the effective lower bound looms closer than should feel comfortable. Despite our best efforts, we will likely have to resort to alternative policies again in the future.\nNow, having said all of that, after a protracted period of slow and uneven progress, over the past few years the U.S. economy has finally returned to a path with strong growth fundamentals and inflation closer to target on a sustainable basis. Monetary policy needs to be recalibrated accordingly, and this is well under way in the U.S. We are well past the time when out-of-the-box thinking was needed to provide monetary accommodation, and we are pretty much back to monetary policy that is conventional, standard, mainstream—whatever you want to call it—with the important caveat of a higher risk of hitting the ELB.\nA description of conventional monetary policymaking\nNow that it’s been over a decade, we need to remind ourselves what such monetary policy looks like. A basic tenet of good conventional, mainstream monetary policy in the U.S. is that it is a supporting actor: The lead roles in the economy are played by households and competitive private businesses making their best saving, investment, and employment decisions and by governments at all levels (federal, state, and local) doing their best to design and execute effective public policy programs.\nAs a supporting actor, monetary policy focuses on 1) assessing the various headwinds and tailwinds influencing the economy and 2) moving policy into a modestly accommodative or modestly restrictive stance, when appropriate, to help the main actors achieve maximum employment and price stability. I am not saying monetary policy can fine-tune outcomes—the world is far too complicated for that. The broad goal is for policy settings that—in the absence of unforeseen shocks to the economy—are consistent with reaching these employment and inflation objectives within a reasonable amount of time.\nThis seems to describe the U.S. experience between 1984 and 2005, the period dubbed as the “Great Moderation.” Similar to today, the beginning of that time is marked by the exit from a difficult stretch of unusual economic and monetary circumstances—the challenge back then having been the defeat of the “Great Inflation” in the U.S. of the 1970s and early 1980s. Many monetary policy adjustments were made during the Great Moderation. These were designed to gradually move inflation trends downward toward something like a 2 percent objective; to mitigate headwinds or tailwinds that might be interfering with households and businesses achieving full employment; and, sometimes, to provide a dose of risk-management insurance against asymmetric risk to our policy goals.\nOutside of the recessions of 1990 and 2001, these adjustments usually were gradual—and even during these recessions, all of them were accomplished by use of our federal funds rate target. Indeed, the moves over this era are generally well described by simple policy rules, with deviations often associated with risk-management behavior by the FOMC.2 Examples of such deviations were the Fed’s response to the global financial turmoil following the Russian default in 1998 and our aggressive actions in the fall of 2001—this latter case in part reflecting a recognition of the asymmetric policy risks posed by the ELB.\nMonetary policymaking is finally returning to normal\nToday, long after the financial crisis and the Great Recession, we find ourselves stepping back into this role of supporting actor: With the unemployment rate at 3.9 percent and core inflation at 2 percent, our job is to facilitate the long-run, sustainable achievement of maximum employment and price stability.\nGiven the outlook today, I believe this will entail moving policy first toward a neutral setting and then likely a bit beyond neutral to help transition the economy onto a long-run sustainable growth path with inflation at our symmetric 2 percent target.\nOf course, we may need to tighten somewhat further if currently unexpected tailwinds emerge that push the economy well beyond sustainable growth and employment levels, potentially leading to unacceptably high inflation beyond our symmetric objective. For example, we might discover that we underestimated the forward momentum imparted by earlier monetary accommodation. Another possibility might be that we experience greater-than-expected fiscal impetus from the recent tax cuts and spending increases in the U.S. that is not accompanied by gains in the economy’s underlying productive potential.\nConversely, the emergence of currently unexpected headwinds could dictate a shallower policy path. One example would be if continued uncertainties over the international trade situation generated adverse effects on business sentiment and spending. Another downside risk is that the firming in inflation expectations could stall out before expectations are clearly centered about 2 percent—as such an alignment is a necessary condition for sustainable achievement of our symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.\nLow equilibrium interest rates are challenging\nThere is, however, an important difference between the boring conventional monetary policy of today and the boring policy of the 1984–2005 period. Today, equilibrium interest rates are a good deal lower than they used to be. As a result, the risk of hitting the effective lower bound is now higher. Trend economic growth is much lower than we would like. And, as standard economic theory teaches us, all else being equal, equilibrium real interest rates will be lower in a low-trend-growth economy.\nThe reasons for the slowdown in trend growth in the U.S. are well known. Growth in labor input has moderated with slower population growth and a downtrend in labor force participation. Furthermore, labor productivity has been disappointing, especially when compared with the large gains seen in the second half of the 1990s and the early 2000s.\nAt the Chicago Fed, we see the longer-run growth potential of the U.S. at a bit under 2 percent. I hope this assessment turns out to be too pessimistic. Higher sustainable growth would be great. However, we can’t get there without boosting the underlying trends in labor input or productivity. As a nation, we should work on public policies that could be effective in doing so. But such policies are clearly outside the realm of monetary policy.\nThere are other reasons why equilibrium interest rates are lower now. One is the large demand—from both domestic and foreign sources—for U.S. Treasuries and other high-quality assets.3 And, of course, low inflation also reduces equilibrium nominal interest rates. I should note, too, that the U.S. isn’t alone here; most advanced economies are experiencing similar downward pressures on equilibrium interest rates.\nAll told, lower equilibrium interest rates mean monetary policy will have less headroom to provide adequate rate cuts when large disinflationary shocks hit the economy. In other words, the risks of returning to the ELB are higher than we would like.\nAnalyses done in the 1990s and early 2000s indicated that the odds then were not large; for example, in 2000 Reifshneider and Williams (2000) estimated them at about 15 percent.4 But this calculus has changed; more recently, a 2017 Brookings paper by Kiley and Roberts found that, given today’s low productivity trends and a 2 percent inflation target, the probability of hitting the ELB is closer to 40 percent.5\nNow, there are lots of model-specific factors and other assumptions underlying these numbers, so you don’t want to take them too literally. But the result that the odds of hitting the ELB are notably higher today than they were in that period between the 1980s and the early 2000s is pretty solid. During that earlier era, when mitigating economic downturns, we typically reduced short-term policy rates something in the neighborhood of 500 basis points. Today, given an equilibrium federal funds rate in the range of, say, 2-1/2 to 3 percent, we simply do not have that kind of rate-cutting capacity.\nThis fact may require some rethinking of our monetary policy strategies. A number of alternative monetary policy frameworks have been proposed to address the risks of returning to the ELB: Examples include an explicitly higher inflation target; nominal gross domestic product (GDP) targeting; temporary, state-contingent price-level targeting; and unconditional price-level targeting.6\nI would note, though, that none of these alternatives necessarily free us from the use of forward guidance or large-scale asset purchases. Alternative frameworks might lessen the odds of hitting the ELB, but they cannot drive them to zero. And whenever we are at the ELB, the question of alternative policy tools becomes relevant again.\nIndeed, the FOMC has made clear that it stands ready to use alternative policies if needed. In an addendum to our Policy Normalization Principles and Plans made a little over a year ago, the Committee stated it would be ready to use its full range of tools if future economic conditions warranted more accommodative policy than could be achieved by use of the federal funds rate alone.7 You can find this point reiterated in the minutes of our meeting last month.8 And in his Jackson Hole address a couple of weeks ago, Chair Powell reiterated the importance of the “do whatever it takes” approach to policy when faced with a difficult situation such as the risk of a protracted period at the ELB or if inflation expectations were to move into material conflict with our inflation objective.9\nThe future of conventional monetary policy\nLet me finish with a brief description of the possible path for rates over the next few years as we return to more mainstream policymaking. In the FOMC’s most recent Summary of Economic Projections (SEP),10 which are from June, the median participant’s forecast showed the economy growing at a solid pace, the unemployment rate falling to a percentage point below its long-run normal level, and inflation edging slightly above our 2 percent target. I generally agree with this assessment. The current range for the federal funds rate target is between 1-3/4 and 2 percent. The median participant envisions the federal funds rate to be 2.4 percent by the end of 2018 (implying two more increases of 25 basis points each this year); 3.1 percent by the end of 2019; and 3.4 percent by the end of 2020. At the same time, in the background, we have a gradual reduction in the Fed’s balance sheet as securities acquired during our asset purchase programs mature.\nAs you can see, when compared with an assessment for the long-run neutral funds rate generally in the range of 2-1/2 to 3 percent, this path has policy becoming a bit restrictive sometime next year and tightening a touch further in 2020. Given an unemployment rate forecast below the natural rate, such a policy stance is quite natural and would be consistent with some moderation in growth and a gradual return of employment to its longer-run sustainable level.\nOf course, in the end, actual policy will differ from this path depending on the headwinds and tailwinds arising from the various shocks that inevitably will hit the economy. We also will be alert for developments informing our views on trend growth or other factors affecting the equilibrium real interest rate benchmark for policy. And we necessarily will be attentive to the fact that the risks of encountering the effective lower bound are larger than they were in the past.\nSo even though we are returning to more conventional, standard, mainstream policymaking, there will be many challenges facing the Fed—as well as other central banks, as they too make the transition. But, hopefully, these will prove more familiar and easier to deal with than those we experienced over the past ten years.\nNotes\n1 My comments are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n2 See Evans et al.

            "content": "Introduction\nBefore I begin, let me remind you that my comments here today are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). This session is about how innovations in technology may potentially influence the macroeconomy and, in response, how central banks should conduct monetary policy. As we’ve heard at this conference, advances in technologies such as machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are big news, with important implications for almost every sector of the economy. And for economists they provide lots of opportunities and lots of challenges.\n\nFirst, let’s consider the opportunities: Researchers now have access to masses of new data and better computing power. This is really cool for me and my staff as we are data users—after all, most economists are data scientists. These tools are great for basic economic research, especially for the work of microeconomists. But there’s lots of scope for macroeconomists as well. Some of these data may help us more precisely identify key policymaking parameters—for example, how consumer spending and business spending respond to tax changes.\n\nThese tools may also help improve our ability to forecast short-term movements in the economy. In particular, we could see some exciting new indicators of the business cycle derived from new sources of big data. Here, though, there may be limits to what we can learn from big data, at least for a while. The business cycle is in essence about small data. There just haven’t been a lot of business cycles, and each one has idiosyncratic features. And big data weren’t available during past business cycles, so cross-cycle comparisons are not possible. We’re stuck with this situation.\n\nBut this session isn’t really about the use of big data. It’s about the consequences of large-scale technological innovation. So, now let’s discuss the challenges: Such innovation could create challenges for monetary policymakers if it leads to hard-to-identify changes in the structure of macroeconomic relationships that might influence the business cycle. And in the end, that’s what we monetary policy folks are concerned about—the business cycle.\n\nThe potential structural changes that come with innovation can affect the evolution of inflation and employment. As such, they may have implications for the achievement of our dual mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability. For instance, these changes could generate headwinds for inflation that mean we might need to provide more accommodation to reach our inflation target than we have in the past. But we don’t know that. Perhaps these forces will lead to higher inflationary pressures that policy might have to counteract. There’s a lot we don’t really understand yet.\nDealing with an evolving economic structure is an old problem\nOf course, making policy in the presence of a changing economy is nothing new; we have dealt with lots of structural changes before. History offers plenty of examples.\n\nChairman Greenspan (1998) grappled with this issue almost 20 years ago when he considered the possibility of a “new economy.” He said, and I quote:\nThere is no question that events are continually altering the shape and nature of our economic processes, especially the extent to which technological breakthroughs have advanced and perhaps, most recently, even accelerated the pace of conceptualization of our gross domestic product. We have dramatically reduced the size of our radios, for example, by substituting transistors for vacuum tubes. Thin fiber-optic cable has replaced huge tonnages of copper wire. New architectural, engineering, and materials technologies have enabled the construction of buildings enclosing the same space but with far less physical material than was required, say, 50 or 100 years ago. Most recently, mobile phones have been markedly downsized as they have been improved. As a consequence, the physical weight of our GDP is growing only very gradually. The exploitation of new concepts accounts for virtually all of the inflation-adjusted growth in output.1\nGoing back even further, more than 50 years ago, a Time magazine article on “the automation jobless” reported that “automation may prevent the economy from creating enough new jobs… . In the past, new industries hired far more people than those they put out of business. But this is not true of many of today's new industries.”2 Sounds familiar, doesn’t it? And in 1964 these concerns were broad enough to warrant the creation of a presidential commission to study the implications of new technologies.3\nInfluences on the economy and policymaking\nWe don’t know how various innovations will ultimately play out and how they will affect the economy. Figuring out the effects of these developments is complicated: The sign, magnitude, and timing of their impact are all uncertain.\n\nTechnological advances can lead to conflicting effects. For instance, internet commerce may make markets more competitive. This might lead to lower prices and push inflation lower in the short run. But it may also allow companies to price-discriminate better, making markets less competitive and leading to higher average prices.\n\nI would also note that a decent-size literature has emerged on the rise of industry concentration in general, not just in internet retailing. This is an issue economists are thinking about a good deal, but there is as yet no consensus.4 \nThese new technologies can affect the natural rate of unemployment too. The natural rate of unemployment is the unemployment rate that would prevail in an economy making full use of its productive resources. We sometimes refer to this natural rate as u*. Online job boards and other technology may be improving matching efficiency. If so, u* would be lower. But these new technologies can also cause u* to rise. This would happen, for example, if people become more specialized and labor markets become less fluid as a result.\n\nWe’ve struggled to understand the effects of changing u* before. In the 1990s, there were indications that the rise of labor market intermediaries such as temporary help firms was lowering the natural rate. And in 2010, an increase in vacancy measures without a drop in unemployment led some to conclude the natural rate had risen.\n\nDynamic issues related to innovation may also cause difficulties for policymakers because some effects might be different in the short run than in the long run. For instance, firms might be charging low prices today to acquire a first-mover advantage in certain markets. They might for a time operate at a loss. But if successful in establishing a foothold, they hope to charge higher prices and be more profitable in the future.\n\nTechnological change also poses important challenges for the standard statistical measures of prices. Here too the effects can go both ways.5 On one side, standard measures might not be factoring in correctly the time cost borne by the user. For instance, when booking your travel tickets online, you cut out the intermediary, and that is probably efficient as a whole; but you also have to do more work for yourself than you used to. The same is true for pumping your own gas or using the self-checkout line. If not accounted for, this would understate inflation. But we might also be overstating inflation by not incorporating quality improvements, increased varieties of products, the value of free content, and the like. Of course, in either direction, such inflation mismeasurement has consequences for output mismeasurement as well.\n\nMonetary policy relies on the economic relationships between the tools we control—for instance, the short-term interest rate—and our policy objectives. Technological innovation may be changing these relationships. For example, it must be much easier for firms to change online prices than it is for them to change prices in a physical store. That might make prices in the overall economy less sticky, which would change the parameters of the Phillips curve relationship that is important to much of monetary policy analysis.6 But this is pure conjecture at this stage.\nOutcome-based policy is a robust response\nTechnological advances create a difficult picture to read and present a challenge for policymakers.\nThe FOMC’s goal is to reach the center of the bull’s-eye where the economy is at its natural rate of unemployment and inflation is 2 percent. The inflation target is the choice of the central bank. As I’ve just discussed, technological change could have some effect on the natural rate of unemployment. It could also influence how the economy responds to monetary policy adjustments—and thus the speed at which we are able to obtain our policy objectives. However, the magnitudes and even the signs of these effects are highly uncertain.\n\nOne message is that following a fixed rule to determine the setting of our instruments may not be the best strategy to follow in a changing environment. In general, such changes can reduce the effectiveness of a strict instrument-setting rule or, at times, even make it counterproductive. For instance, it would be a mistake to set policy according to a Taylor rule with a 2 percent intercept if we think the equilibrium funds rate is different from 2 percent—perhaps, for example, because of the influences of technological change and its diffusion on the economy.7\nAnd, while machine learning and artificial intelligence might become helpful in identifying emerging trends, I don’t see them coming up with a better rule that will replace us central bankers any time soon! We economists have a lot of experience data mining—and we know the pitfalls of taking it out of sample in a changing environment.\n\nFundamentally, what’s important is the Fed’s ability to deliver on our mandated policy goals of full employment and price stability. A policy focused on hitting mandated outcomes and managing risks against adverse scenarios—something I often refer to as outcome-based policy—can avoid missteps that might come from strict adherence to a fixed policy rule. Execution of outcome-based policy often requires using informed discretion in instrument setting. And by doing so, a central bank can do a better job in delivering on its ultimate employment and inflation targets.\n\nIndeed, we may never be able to come up with good estimates of how the various crosscurrents associated with AI and ML are affecting the aggregate economy. But we will be able to observe whether our current policy coincides with restrictive, disinflationary financial conditions or with undesired inflationary pressures. We can then adjust the setting of policy accordingly.\n\nSo, while structural change may make our task more challenging, it’s something we have been dealing with for a long time. And hopefully, we can continue to navigate our way through it by keeping a close eye on our policy objectives.\nNotes\n1 Greenspan (1998).\n2 Time Inc.

I’m going to state the issue this way because it starkly lays bare the dilemma that we face today.\n\nA softer and easier way to characterize the situation is to use that familiar description made famous in the 1950s by former Fed Chair William McChesney Martin: We’re at a cocktail party that has just hit its stride, and the host from the Fed has to decide when to take the punch bowl away.1 That’s a clever analogy, but since the Fed’s legislated dual mandate is in terms of maximum employment and price stability—and not in spiking the proverbial punch bowl—I’ll just stick with the labor market theme.\n\nBut first, let me briefly recap the economic situation.\nThe current economic situation and outlook\nEconomic activity was solid in 2017. For the year as a whole, real gross domestic product (GDP) rose 2.9 percent. Overall, the U.S. economy is firing on all cylinders and has plenty of momentum.\n\nConsumers have been the key engine of growth in recent years. There are a number of reasons for this. The household sector’s net worth has grown impressively, reaching record levels as a percentage of disposable income. Labor markets continue to strengthen. Over the course of 2017, job gains averaged over 170,000 per month and have picked up steam so far in 2018.2 This pace far exceeds the rate needed to absorb new entrants into the labor force; and not surprisingly, the unemployment rate declined by over half a percentage point in 2017 and is now at a very low 4.1 percent. The solid job market and increases in wealth have left households feeling pretty good, and surveys of consumer sentiment are at very high levels. Consumer spending was a bit soft during the first three months of the year. But this followed very strong growth in the fourth quarter of 2017. Moreover, the fundamentals underlying consumer spending remain quite strong.\nThese improvements in household fundamentals have generated a slow but steady recovery in housing markets as well. Residential construction, however, remains below estimates of longer-run trends, in part reflecting the severe disruptions to these markets during the financial crisis.\n\nIn the business sector, capital spending is also showing a good deal of forward momentum. In particular, outlays for equipment, which had been lackluster in 2016, picked up significantly in 2017, and orders for capital goods and other forward-looking indicators remain quite strong.\n\nAdding to this, fiscal policy has swung into a strong expansionary gear. Lower corporate and personal income taxes from last December’s tax legislation and higher government spending associated with the February budget agreement will boost economic activity. How all the changes—including large increases in the federal budget deficit—will translate into GDP growth is highly uncertain. Still, by most analyses, fiscal stimulus should add significantly to aggregate activity in the near and medium terms.\n\nThe U.S. isn’t the only economy doing well. Growth is picking up around the globe. Of course, there are concerns about potential changes to trade policy. At this point, we can only speculate on what we will actually see from both the U.S. and our trading partners. So this is an area of uncertainty in the outlook.\n\nPutting all these elements together, in their latest projections made in March, my colleagues on the FOMC expected the strength in economic activity to continue over the next several years.3 The median participant anticipates GDP growth of 2.7 percent this year and 2.4 percent next year—that’s about 1/4 percentage point higher than projected in December and quite a bit higher than the median estimate of the underlying trend in GDP growth, which is 1.8 percent. Growth above trend should reduce the unemployment rate further: The median FOMC participant expects the unemployment rate to fall to 3.8 percent by the end of this year and to reach 3.6 percent by the end of 2019.\nDespite the strength in economic activity, inflation continues to run somewhat below the FOMC’s explicit symmetric objective of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE). However, the median FOMC participant expects inflation to move up close to 2 percent this year.4\n\nRegarding monetary policy, the current setting remains accommodative, with the federal funds target range at 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent.5 This is about 100 to 150 basis points below the median participant’s assessment of where the funds rate will be in the long run, after all of the various transitory factors affecting the economy have run their course. But with the economy strong and inflation expected to improve, the federal funds rate is expected to rise gradually over the next couple of years.\n\nAt this point, I might as well admit that the most popular questions I get are the following:\nWhen will the next funds rate increase occur?\nWill rate increases only be at meetings with press conferences?\nAnd how high will the FOMC eventually raise interest rates?\nOf course, I can’t answer these questions! The details of our story have not been written yet, and details matter.\n\nSo let me now turn to a detail that I think about a lot and will be a key factor in my monetary policy decisions as we navigate the terrain ahead.\nAre we at maximum employment?\nI began paying attention to business conditions and inflation back in a 1974 high school economics class, and it is surprising to me that inflation remains low today given the strong economy. Most people over the age of 50 and everyone in my advanced AARP age group would associate strong growth and low unemployment with an expectation that higher inflation must be just around the corner as the economy overheats.\n\nIndeed, strong growth at this stage of the business cycle typically overheats the economy, driving up wages and other business costs and leading to undesirably high cyclical inflation. This conclusion emerges from careful economic analysis of the post-World War II economy through 2003. But the past 15 years have been somewhat different: The response of inflation to above-trend growth has been much more muted, raising some important challenges to the old overheating story.\n\nSo I now want to describe how our policy mandates interact with both my 1970s economic intuition and the changes we have seen over the past 15 years. And it turns out to be more complicated than my high school economics class made it out to be. In fact, it’s very difficult to determine whether today’s low unemployment rate is about right or is instead a signal of an overheating economy that poses significant risks to economic stability.\n\nLet’s start with the FOMC policy mandates. The Fed’s job is to promote financial conditions that support the attainment of maximum employment and price stability.6 Since 2012, the FOMC has defined its price stability goal explicitly as a symmetric 2 percent target for PCE inflation.\n\nThe maximum employment goal needs more detail to render it operational. Full employment cannot be reasonably defined as the entire population having a job. Obviously, young children and the elderly do not work, and some individuals choose not to seek work for reasons that are largely outside of the realm of monetary economics. So our employment benchmark needs to account for the working-age population, as well as trends in individuals’ willingness to seek work and engage in it—what economists refer to as the trend in labor force participation.7 Since about 2000, demographic trends and other factors have caused the trend participation rate to fall gradually, and this represents a downward influence on maximum employment.\n\nNow, the unemployment rate is about the best single gauge of labor market health.8 Of course, it moves around over time, both as recessions and expansions push it up and down and as long-term structural changes—mainly these factors affecting trend labor force participation—influence the labor market. For our maximum employment benchmark, we’d like a measure of the unemployment rate that accounts for these trends. One such measure is the FOMC participants’ estimate of the long-run sustainable unemployment rate—that is, the rate we would expect to prevail in the absence of cyclical ups and downs. We write down an estimate for this each time we publish our Summary of Economic Projections. In our March forecasts, the median estimate of this long-run unemployment rate—which is called u* by some—was 4-1/2 percent.9\n\nThree possibilities concerning low inflation and low unemployment and their implications for monetary policy\nAt 4.1 percent, the current unemployment rate is obviously below this long-run level.\nCan this be a bad thing? At face value, it seems like more employment should be associated with maximum employment. It must be a good thing for society, businesses, workers, and households when people choose voluntarily to work at the offered wage. This is a sign that markets are working, isn’t it?\n\nHowever, history clearly indicates we need to be careful in making this assessment without additional scrutiny. We need to ask if the FOMC’s forecast of 3.6 percent unemployment in 2019 represents an accomplishment with only positive implications or whether such low unemployment may portend trouble ahead. The latter could be the case if 4-1/2 percent is truly the best assessment of the economy’s sustainable unemployment rate.\n\nOf course, the immediate worry is what I noted earlier, that such an undershooting of the long-run unemployment rate often has been associated with an overheating economy and ever growing inflationary pressures. Today, however, inflation remains low. My high school economics class didn’t adequately prepare me for this scenario—nor did my undergraduate or graduate classes. What do we make of this apparent contradiction? Does it mean that the labor market is about to overheat enough that stronger, unwelcome inflation is just around the corner? Or does it mean the FOMC is wrong about its estimate of the long-run sustainable rate? Or, put somewhat differently, is it the case that the combination of low unemployment and low inflation is due to structural labor market inefficiencies that monetary policy cannot fix? These structural inefficiencies might still pose problems for society, and other policies might be able to address them. But interest rate policy won’t.\n\nThese are three pretty different economic scenarios. And they have quite different implications for what we should do with monetary policy. So let me go through each of these cases.\nFirst, let’s examine the overheating story. To start, I want to discuss the relationship between the labor market and other cyclical cost pressures and inflation—what economists call the Phillips curve.10 Until 2003, our post-World War II experience suggested that the Phillips curve was relatively steep, so that modest drops in the unemployment rate below the long-run, or natural, rate would result in markedly higher inflation. Moreover, we found that policies that sought to maintain unemployment below its natural rate had an accelerating influence and resulted in ever-escalating inflation, as households and businesses incorporated higher inflation expectations into their decision-making, which reinforced the inflationary cycle.\n\nIf we faced such an accelerationist situation today, the Fed would have to raise rates aggressively and push the unemployment rate above its natural rate in order to fight the self-reinforcing inflationary cycle.\n\nAt the moment these risks are not particularly high. For one thing, if you look at data over the past 15 or 20 years, the Phillips curve seems much flatter than it was when I first learned about it. Statistical evidence indicates that the linkage between unemployment and inflation is weaker. That is, any given amount of labor market slack today plays a smaller role in generating inflation than it did, say, in the 1970s or 1980s.\n\nFurthermore, most recent analyses of inflation see little risk today of the accelerating self-reinforcing inflation dynamics that were evident back then. As I mentioned, these dynamics occur as expectations of higher future inflation become embedded in current wage and price decisions. But, after many years of below-target inflation, inflation expectations today are actually too low. Ideally, someone would authoritatively publish accurate measures of the inflation expectations workers and firms use when deciding how to establish wages and prices. Instead, a good deal of analysis and inference is required to assess inflation expectations. Most measures—such as the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) whose returns are linked to inflation outcomes and survey measures from households—suggest inflation expectations are low relative to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective.\n\nJust as rising inflation seems less likely while inflation expectations are low, escalating inflation is also difficult to imagine in the absence of commensurate wage gains. Although I described a rosy picture of labor markets earlier, strong wage growth has been a missing piece. Over the past year, average hourly earnings have risen 2.7 percent. This is nearly a full percentage point lower than the wage gains we saw before the financial crisis. Other measures of labor compensation have been similarly sluggish.\n\nWith the Phillips curve apparently flatter, inflation expectations low and well anchored, and a lack of fuel from strong wage growth, I don’t foresee an outsized risk of a breakout in inflation. As long as this picture continues, the FOMC can increase rates gradually while monitoring any rising inflationary pressures.\n\nNow, let’s move on to the second scenario. It goes like this: Inflation is low because the sustainable rate of unemployment is actually much lower than the FOMC’s 4-1/2 percent estimate, so today’s 4.1 percent unemployment rate really isn’t putting any pressure on labor markets. In this scenario, low unemployment clearly reflects better labor market outcomes for workers and society. If this situation was permanent, then great! The risks of overheating would be lower, and perhaps interest rate adjustments could be smaller. We could enjoy our good fortune.\n\nBut—and here’s a different bad harbinger story—maybe the natural rate of unemployment is only temporarily lower, and before too long, this temporarily low u* will move back up to its long-run level. For example, u* could be temporarily reduced if memories of the Great Recession are still weighing on workers and they are willing to accept less attractive offers than they otherwise would, just to make sure they have a job. As these concerns fade over time, u* would drift back up to its long-run level. In this scenario, the appropriate role for monetary policy would be to let the unemployment rate rise in tandem with u* and not try to fight it.\n\nThis brings us to the third scenario. This is where unemployment running below its natural rate, u*, without rising inflation is due to labor market inefficiencies that are outside the purview of monetary policy.\n\nLet me sketch out this argument a little further: While low unemployment means it is easy for workers to find jobs, it also means it is difficult for employers to find workers. Instead of workers being matched to jobs for which they are particularly well suited, highly productive firms are unable to find the workers they need to reach their full capacity. In such a case, economic productivity may be less than ideal, resulting in subpar growth in output, investment, and household wealth.\n\nI admit right away that this is a vague and highly speculative view of possible labor market matching frictions, but anecdotal evidence suggests that this scenario is at least a possibility. Currently, many businesses report that they find it difficult to recruit the kind of workers they want to hire—especially for higher-skilled positions. Of course, standard economic principles would suggest that firms should offer higher wages to attract desired workers. But businesses often list many impediments to hiring that they claim higher wages won’t fix. Location is clearly one. The intensity of labor market shortages varies by locale. Some regions may do better than others in recruiting higher-skilled workers, depending on skill needs and location. For example, Chicago faces all of these challenges, but perhaps to a lesser extent than many other locations. Major metropolitan areas likely fare better than smaller midwestern municipalities. This seems likely to be the case around the country too. It’s like buying and selling real estate: It’s all about location, location, location.\n\nWhile such hiring difficulties clearly exist, it’s hard to see why they do not generate more wage growth and higher prices. If firms were exposed to excess competition for workers because scarce labor doesn’t move quickly enough or easily enough into new jobs, wages should increase—and perhaps by a lot. Rising wages ought to be an incentive for people to enter the labor force, change jobs, or move to a new location. They could also lead to inflation moving higher—and so the low unemployment situation wouldn’t be as puzzling. The situation would look more like the first possibility I discussed, and monetary policy should tighten accordingly.\nBut let’s consider the possibility that unemployment remains low and some structural problem keeps wages and prices from rising to attract workers. Is this really a problem that monetary policy is suited to address? I think the answer is no. We could make unemployment go up, but that would not be addressing any underlying impediments to markets efficiently matching workers and jobs. Other policy interventions may help, but they would be outside the purview of monetary policy.11\nSome might argue that the problem with low unemployment is not that it is associated with distortions in the labor market right now, but with building imbalances that might make the next downturn more severe. For example, low unemployment could be associated with the creation of many jobs in which workers are not very productively employed and thus could be quickly terminated in response to even a modest downturn. This would make the economy vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks.12 While this is a logical possibility we should be aware of, I currently don’t see much, if any, evidence of this kind of overhiring. Indeed, many firms continue to report that they are being very cautious in bringing on new workers. Thus I don’t think such concerns make a persuasive case for more aggressive monetary policy tightening.\nStill another possibility is that low unemployment is a sign of excess liquidity in the economy that may be manifested in rising asset prices rather than in rising goods prices. Excessive asset price inflation raises concerns about financial stability. But as I have argued elsewhere, the best way to address those concerns is through appropriately rigorous supervision and regulation rather than monetary policy.13\nWage and price data will be important clues\nI just laid out three possible scenarios for thinking about current low unemployment and low inflation. In the first two scenarios, a response from monetary policy is called for, but the calibrations are different. In the third scenario, monetary policy is not going to be able to solve the real structural problem.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no way to know for sure which situation we are in: u* is a latent variable, and despite a great deal of cutting-edge analysis, its level will always be subject to some uncertainty. That said, as growth in economic activity proceeds, wage and price data should help sort out which of the three scenarios is most relevant. If wages and prices don’t start rising faster, then either the natural rate of unemployment is lower than our current estimate and policy does not need to tighten much or we are facing nonmonetary issues that also would not elicit an interest rate response. However, if wages and inflation started rising above levels consistent with our symmetric 2 percent inflation objective, then the sustainable unemployment rate is very likely higher after all and policy should react.\n\nHow strong might that policy response be? Here, too, it’s problematic if we rely on our experiences in the 1970s and early 1980s. Back then, the Fed faced two problems with regard to inflation: 1) cyclical inflation was rising as the economy overheated and productive resources were under great pressure, and 2) inflation was already much too high, and had been so for some time. As a result, the FOMC had to fight both cyclically rising inflation and an unacceptably higher long-run inflation trend. The situation required large increases in interest rates at certain times—like the Volker tightening in 1979–80 or the Greenspan moves in 1988–89.\n\nToday, our problem is different: We face low inflation trends and low inflation expectations. Indeed, some cyclical upturn in inflation is actually welcome because it should help solidify expectations symmetrically around our 2 percent objective. This is necessary for achieving our inflation target on a sustainable basis.\n\nIn this setting, the federal funds rate does not need to be increased as much above its neutral setting as in the past when trend inflation needed to be taken down several notches. Gradual policy increases in this context make sense—certainly as a way to limit the damage if policy ever actually becomes overly tight too soon.\n\nSometimes I wonder if I risk having my PhD revoked for being seduced into amnesia about the Great Inflation of the 1970s. A lot of ink has been spilled on this topic, and Nobel prizes have been awarded for path-breaking insights on it. The pursuit of unsustainably low unemployment below its natural rate with unanchored inflation expectations was an integral part of the double-digit inflation story. The monetary policy responses required to tame unacceptably high inflation produced painful results and recessions. The federal funds rate had to be hiked to nearly 20 percent between 1979 and 1982, and 10 percent unemployment followed. No one wants to repeat such a scenario. And I don’t think we will.\n\nThe lessons from that painful experience are embodied in the FOMC’s adoption of its long-run strategy. We have a dual mandate that includes a symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. As long as we act to keep inflation within the symmetry envisioned, inflation expectations should be contained.\n\nAnd while it is incumbent upon policymakers not to forget the painful lessons of the 1970s and 1980s, we are living under different circumstances today. For the reasons I discussed, I think we have the opportunity to more patiently read—and react to—the incoming data. That is, I think we can undertake more moderate monetary policy adjustments today than often was the case in the past.\n\nThank you.\nPlease Note\nThis speech was previously presented on April 17, 2018, before the Chicago Rotary Luncheon.\nNotes\n1 Martin (1955).\n2 Job gains averaged over 200,000 for the first quarter of 2018.\n3 Four times a year the FOMC releases its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which presents FOMC participants’ forecasts of key economic variables (including the appropriate path for monetary policy) over the next three years and for the longer run. For the most recent projections, see Federal Open Market Committee (2018a).\n4 In February 2018, 12-month core PCE inflation, which cuts through a lot of the statistical noise in overall prices, was 1.6 percent.

More information is available online.\n8 According to the BLS, the unemployed are all persons aged 16 years and older who had no employment during the reference week for the Current Population Survey; were available for work, except for temporary illness; and had made specific efforts to find employment sometime during the four-week period ending with the reference week. Persons who were waiting to be recalled to a job from which they had been laid off need not have been looking for work to be classified as unemployed. Further details are available online.\n9 Federal Open Market Committee (2018a). Some also refer to this long-run rate of unemployment as the natural rate of unemployment.\n10 The Phillips curve is a statistical relationship that describes a negative correlation between inflation and unemployment—that is, lower unemployment is associated with higher price and wage inflation. It is often drawn as a negatively sloped curve that has a measure of labor market tightness, such as the unemployment rate, on the horizontal axis and a measure of wage or price inflation on the vertical axis. See Phillips (1958).\n11 An example of using monetary policy to address a structural problem concerns the case where monopolistic competition creates an equilibrium level of output that is too low relative to the competitive equilibrium outcome.

The Fed’s job is to promote financial conditions that support the attainment of maximum employment and price stability.6 Since 2012, the FOMC has defined its price stability goal explicitly as a symmetric 2 percent target for PCE inflation.\n\nThe maximum employment goal needs more detail to render it operational. Full employment cannot be reasonably defined as the entire population having a job. Obviously, young children and the elderly do not work, and some individuals choose not to seek work for reasons that are largely outside of the realm of monetary economics. So our employment benchmark needs to account for the working-age population, as well as trends in individuals’ willingness to seek work and engage in it—what economists refer to as the trend in labor force participation.7 Since about 2000, demographic trends and other factors have caused the trend participation rate to fall gradually, and this represents a downward influence on maximum employment.\n\nNow, the unemployment rate is about the best single gauge of labor market health.8 Of course, it moves around over time, both as recessions and expansions push it up and down and as long-term structural changes—mainly these factors affecting trend labor force participation—influence the labor market. For our maximum employment benchmark, we’d like a measure of the unemployment rate that accounts for these trends. One such measure is the FOMC participants’ estimate of the long-run sustainable unemployment rate—that is, the rate we would expect to prevail in the absence of cyclical ups and downs. We write down an estimate for this each time we publish our Summary of Economic Projections. In our March forecasts, the median estimate of this long-run unemployment rate—which is called u* by some—was 4-1/2 percent.9\n\nThree possibilities concerning low inflation and low unemployment and their implications for monetary policy\nAt 4.1 percent, the current unemployment rate is obviously below this long-run level.\nCan this be a bad thing? At face value, it seems like more employment should be associated with maximum employment. It must be a good thing for society, businesses, workers, and households when people choose voluntarily to work at the offered wage. This is a sign that markets are working, isn’t it?\n\nHowever, history clearly indicates we need to be careful in making this assessment without additional scrutiny. We need to ask if the FOMC’s forecast of 3.6 percent unemployment in 2019 represents an accomplishment with only positive implications or whether such low unemployment may portend trouble ahead. The latter could be the case if 4-1/2 percent is truly the best assessment of the economy’s sustainable unemployment rate.\n\nOf course, the immediate worry is what I noted earlier, that such an undershooting of the long-run unemployment rate often has been associated with an overheating economy and ever growing inflationary pressures. Today, however, inflation remains low. My high school economics class didn’t adequately prepare me for this scenario—nor did my undergraduate or graduate classes. What do we make of this apparent contradiction? Does it mean that the labor market is about to overheat enough that stronger, unwelcome inflation is just around the corner? Or does it mean the FOMC is wrong about its estimate of the long-run sustainable rate? Or, put somewhat differently, is it the case that the combination of low unemployment and low inflation is due to structural labor market inefficiencies that monetary policy cannot fix? These structural inefficiencies might still pose problems for society, and other policies might be able to address them. But interest rate policy won’t.\n\nThese are three pretty different economic scenarios. And they have quite different implications for what we should do with monetary policy. So let me go through each of these cases.\nFirst, let’s examine the overheating story. To start, I want to discuss the relationship between the labor market and other cyclical cost pressures and inflation—what economists call the Phillips curve.10 Until 2003, our post-World War II experience suggested that the Phillips curve was relatively steep, so that modest drops in the unemployment rate below the long-run, or natural, rate would result in markedly higher inflation. Moreover, we found that policies that sought to maintain unemployment below its natural rate had an accelerating influence and resulted in ever-escalating inflation, as households and businesses incorporated higher inflation expectations into their decision-making, which reinforced the inflationary cycle.\n\nIf we faced such an accelerationist situation today, the Fed would have to raise rates aggressively and push the unemployment rate above its natural rate in order to fight the self-reinforcing inflationary cycle.\n\nAt the moment these risks are not particularly high. For one thing, if you look at data over the past 15 or 20 years, the Phillips curve seems much flatter than it was when I first learned about it. Statistical evidence indicates that the linkage between unemployment and inflation is weaker. That is, any given amount of labor market slack today plays a smaller role in generating inflation than it did, say, in the 1970s or 1980s.\n\nFurthermore, most recent analyses of inflation see little risk today of the accelerating self-reinforcing inflation dynamics that were evident back then. As I mentioned, these dynamics occur as expectations of higher future inflation become embedded in current wage and price decisions. But, after many years of below-target inflation, inflation expectations today are actually too low. Ideally, someone would authoritatively publish accurate measures of the inflation expectations workers and firms use when deciding how to establish wages and prices. Instead, a good deal of analysis and inference is required to assess inflation expectations. Most measures—such as the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) whose returns are linked to inflation outcomes and survey measures from households—suggest inflation expectations are low relative to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective.\n\nJust as rising inflation seems less likely while inflation expectations are low, escalating inflation is also difficult to imagine in the absence of commensurate wage gains. Although I described a rosy picture of labor markets earlier, strong wage growth has been a missing piece. Over the past year, average hourly earnings have risen 2.7 percent. This is nearly a full percentage point lower than the wage gains we saw before the financial crisis. Other measures of labor compensation have been similarly sluggish.\n\nWith the Phillips curve apparently flatter, inflation expectations low and well anchored, and a lack of fuel from strong wage growth, I don’t foresee an outsized risk of a breakout in inflation. As long as this picture continues, the FOMC can increase rates gradually while monitoring any rising inflationary pressures.\n\nNow, let’s move on to the second scenario. It goes like this: Inflation is low because the sustainable rate of unemployment is actually much lower than the FOMC’s 4-1/2 percent estimate, so today’s 4.1 percent unemployment rate really isn’t putting any pressure on labor markets. In this scenario, low unemployment clearly reflects better labor market outcomes for workers and society. If this situation was permanent, then great! The risks of overheating would be lower, and perhaps interest rate adjustments could be smaller. We could enjoy our good fortune.\n\nBut—and here’s a different bad harbinger story—maybe the natural rate of unemployment is only temporarily lower, and before too long, this temporarily low u* will move back up to its long-run level. For example, u* could be temporarily reduced if memories of the Great Recession are still weighing on workers and they are willing to accept less attractive offers than they otherwise would, just to make sure they have a job. As these concerns fade over time, u* would drift back up to its long-run level. In this scenario, the appropriate role for monetary policy would be to let the unemployment rate rise in tandem with u* and not try to fight it.\n\nThis brings us to the third scenario. This is where unemployment running below its natural rate, u*, without rising inflation is due to labor market inefficiencies that are outside the purview of monetary policy.\n\nLet me sketch out this argument a little further: While low unemployment means it is easy for workers to find jobs, it also means it is difficult for employers to find workers. Instead of workers being matched to jobs for which they are particularly well suited, highly productive firms are unable to find the workers they need to reach their full capacity. In such a case, economic productivity may be less than ideal, resulting in subpar growth in output, investment, and household wealth.\n\nI admit right away that this is a vague and highly speculative view of possible labor market matching frictions, but anecdotal evidence suggests that this scenario is at least a possibility. Currently, many businesses report that they find it difficult to recruit the kind of workers they want to hire—especially for higher-skilled positions. Of course, standard economic principles would suggest that firms should offer higher wages to attract desired workers. But businesses often list many impediments to hiring that they claim higher wages won’t fix. Location is clearly one. The intensity of labor market shortages varies by locale. Some regions may do better than others in recruiting higher-skilled workers, depending on skill needs and location. For example, Chicago faces all of these challenges, but perhaps to a lesser extent than many other locations. Major metropolitan areas likely fare better than smaller midwestern municipalities. This seems likely to be the case around the country too. It’s like buying and selling real estate: It’s all about location, location, location.\n\nWhile such hiring difficulties clearly exist, it’s hard to see why they do not generate more wage growth and higher prices. If firms were exposed to excess competition for workers because scarce labor doesn’t move quickly enough or easily enough into new jobs, wages should increase—and perhaps by a lot. Rising wages ought to be an incentive for people to enter the labor force, change jobs, or move to a new location. They could also lead to inflation moving higher—and so the low unemployment situation wouldn’t be as puzzling. The situation would look more like the first possibility I discussed, and monetary policy should tighten accordingly.\nBut let’s consider the possibility that unemployment remains low and some structural problem keeps wages and prices from rising to attract workers. Is this really a problem that monetary policy is suited to address? I think the answer is no. We could make unemployment go up, but that would not be addressing any underlying impediments to markets efficiently matching workers and jobs. Other policy interventions may help, but they would be outside the purview of monetary policy.11\nSome might argue that the problem with low unemployment is not that it is associated with distortions in the labor market right now, but with building imbalances that might make the next downturn more severe. For example, low unemployment could be associated with the creation of many jobs in which workers are not very productively employed and thus could be quickly terminated in response to even a modest downturn. This would make the economy vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks.12 While this is a logical possibility we should be aware of, I currently don’t see much, if any, evidence of this kind of overhiring. Indeed, many firms continue to report that they are being very cautious in bringing on new workers. Thus I don’t think such concerns make a persuasive case for more aggressive monetary policy tightening.\n\nStill another possibility is that low unemployment is a sign of excess liquidity in the economy that may be manifested in rising asset prices rather than in rising goods prices. Excessive asset price inflation raises concerns about financial stability. But as I have argued elsewhere, the best way to address those concerns is through appropriately rigorous supervision and regulation rather than monetary policy.13\nWage and price data will be important clues\nI just laid out three possible scenarios for thinking about current low unemployment and low inflation. In the first two scenarios, a response from monetary policy is called for, but the calibrations are different. In the third scenario, monetary policy is not going to be able to solve the real structural problem.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no way to know for sure which situation we are in: u* is a latent variable, and despite a great deal of cutting-edge analysis, its level will always be subject to some uncertainty. That said, as growth in economic activity proceeds, wage and price data should help sort out which of the three scenarios is most relevant. If wages and prices don’t start rising faster, then either the natural rate of unemployment is lower than our current estimate and policy does not need to tighten much or we are facing nonmonetary issues that also would not elicit an interest rate response. However, if wages and inflation started rising above levels consistent with our symmetric 2 percent inflation objective, then the sustainable unemployment rate is very likely higher after all and policy should react.\n\nHow strong might that policy response be? Here, too, it’s problematic if we rely on our experiences in the 1970s and early 1980s. Back then, the Fed faced two problems with regard to inflation: 1) cyclical inflation was rising as the economy overheated and productive resources were under great pressure, and 2) inflation was already much too high, and had been so for some time. As a result, the FOMC had to fight both cyclically rising inflation and an unacceptably higher long-run inflation trend. The situation required large increases in interest rates at certain times—like the Volker tightening in 1979–80 or the Greenspan moves in 1988–89.\n\nToday, our problem is different: We face low inflation trends and low inflation expectations. Indeed, some cyclical upturn in inflation is actually welcome because it should help solidify expectations symmetrically around our 2 percent objective. This is necessary for achieving our inflation target on a sustainable basis.\n\nIn this setting, the federal funds rate does not need to be increased as much above its neutral setting as in the past when trend inflation needed to be taken down several notches. Gradual policy increases in this context make sense—certainly as a way to limit the damage if policy ever actually becomes overly tight too soon.\n\nSometimes I wonder if I risk having my PhD revoked for being seduced into amnesia about the Great Inflation of the 1970s. A lot of ink has been spilled on this topic, and Nobel prizes have been awarded for path-breaking insights on it. The pursuit of unsustainably low unemployment below its natural rate with unanchored inflation expectations was an integral part of the double-digit inflation story. The monetary policy responses required to tame unacceptably high inflation produced painful results and recessions. The federal funds rate had to be hiked to nearly 20 percent between 1979 and 1982, and 10 percent unemployment followed. No one wants to repeat such a scenario. And I don’t think we will.\n\nThe lessons from that painful experience are embodied in the FOMC’s adoption of its long-run strategy. We have a dual mandate that includes a symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. As long as we act to keep inflation within the symmetry envisioned, inflation expectations should be contained.\n\nAnd while it is incumbent upon policymakers not to forget the painful lessons of the 1970s and 1980s, we are living under different circumstances today. For the reasons I discussed, I think we have the opportunity to more patiently read—and react to—the incoming data. That is, I think we can undertake more moderate monetary policy adjustments today than often was the case in the past.\n\nThank you.\nNotes\n1 Martin (1955).\n2 Job gains averaged over 200,000 for the first quarter of 2018.\n3 Four times a year the FOMC releases its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which presents FOMC participants’ forecasts of key economic variables (including the appropriate path for monetary policy) over the next three years and for the longer run. For the most recent projections, see Federal Open Market Committee (2018a).\n4 In February 2018, 12-month core PCE inflation, which cuts through a lot of the statistical noise in overall prices, was 1.6 percent.

More information is available online.\n8 According to the BLS, the unemployed are all persons aged 16 years and older who had no employment during the reference week for the Current Population Survey; were available for work, except for temporary illness; and had made specific efforts to find employment sometime during the four-week period ending with the reference week. Persons who were waiting to be recalled to a job from which they had been laid off need not have been looking for work to be classified as unemployed.

It is often drawn as a negatively sloped curve that has a measure of labor market tightness, such as the unemployment rate, on the horizontal axis and a measure of wage or price inflation on the vertical axis.

            "content": "Introduction\nI would like to thank the Shadow Open Market Committee (SOMC) for the opportunity to speak here this afternoon. The SOMC is a distinguished and knowledgeable group that encourages public discourse on important issues related to monetary policy. I hope to add to this morning’s stimulating discussion in my prepared remarks. However, before I begin, let me remind you that my comments here today are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nI became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago in September 2007, just a few months before the business cycle peak. The subsequent story line is familiar to all of you. The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) dated the beginning of the recession as December 2007, and by the fall of 2008, we were dealing with the largest financial crisis since the Great Depression.\n\nThese difficult times required extraordinary monetary policy responses. The Fed established emergency lending facilities to support financial market functioning. Between September 2007 and December 2008 the FOMC cut the federal funds rate target from 5-1/4 percent to essentially zero. Thereafter, providing further accommodation required turning to nonconventional policy tools: Two important ones were large-scale purchases of Treasury and agency securities, which increased our balance sheet to $4.5 trillion, and forward guidance about how long we would maintain the funds rate at its effective lower bound.\n\nThese policies were effective. And, today, the fundamentals for the U.S. economy are strong. By most assessments, the U.S. has achieved full employment. While the attainment of sustainable 2 percent inflation has taken longer, it now appears closer. Since December 2015, the FOMC has raised the federal funds rate to a range of 125 to 150 basis points, and the Committee is in the process of a slow, steady renormalization of the balance sheet.\n\nIf we are lucky, the future economic and financial climate will more closely resemble the pre-Great Recession experience (if not exactly a Great Moderation economy). Such a relatively benign environment hopefully would allow changes in the federal funds rate target alone to provide adequate monetary accommodation when needed.\n\nBut, for a host of reasons, it is all too likely that policymakers will face more difficult monetary policy challenges when the next downturn occurs. So, with the economy close to maximum employment and price stability, now is a good time to take a hard look at whether—and how—the Fed’s monetary policy framework might be retooled to better deal with less favorable circumstances that inevitably will arise.\nSummary of three messages\nBefore I go further, let me state the three messages I want to develop this afternoon.\n\nFirst, most alternative monetary policy frameworks that have been discussed exhibit two pretty clear characteristics: During meaningful economic downturns they likely will generate periods of aggressive monetary accommodation with short-term policy rates at the effective lower bound; and they also likely will require an extended period of inflation above 2 percent—and perhaps substantially so for some time. These features are obvious to everyone in this room. And they beg the question: How will these policies be communicated to the public and how will the public view these outcomes? Policymakers need to plan for this.\n\nSecond, in selecting and designing any particular alternative framework, what will be the roles of financial competition and regulatory policies and what will be the implications for market functioning? These alternative frameworks will likely feature long periods of low or negative real interest rates and the use of instruments such as large-scale asset purchases. How do we assess the interplay between the choice of monetary policy framework and the “stance” of financial regulatory oversight and supervision? Will these policies induce behavior that requires enhanced regulation in order to mitigate financial instability risks? Or, for each framework, are markets inherently self-equilibrating such that market discipline alone will be sufficient?\n\nThe ultimate effectiveness of any strategy will depend on the answers to these questions. So policymakers will need to address the financial stability implications for each suggested alternative.\n\nThird, even if nothing much comes of these discussions and no dramatic changes are made to our monetary policy framework, there are opportunities to improve our existing strategy. Namely, I think additional communications enhancements are needed to bolster the credibility that the FOMC will deliver on its policy mandates. We should concentrate more explicitly and more publicly on outcome-based policy settings aimed at delivering maximum employment and 2 percent inflation on average through the cycle. It is of great importance to strengthen the public’s understanding of potential policy actions to better deliver symmetric 2 percent inflation expectations. We need to reduce the percentage of the public that believes the FOMC’s 2 percent objective is a ceiling.\n\nBetter communicating such an outcome-based approach is a more useful enhancement for bolstering credibility than strict adherence to instrument-based policy rules—a prescription that theoretical analysis often relies on to deliver monetary credibility. Of course, such an outcome-based emphasis would also be beneficial for executing any of the alternative policies under consideration.\n\nTo address these issues, I think context and historical perspective are critically important. I am reminded of my time in Bennett McCallum’s monetary economics class at Carnegie Mellon back in the 1980s. I distinctly remember Ben saying that much of economics comes down to two simple propositions: 1) people do pretty well for themselves; and 2) there is no such thing as money illusion. This is just a common sense way of saying that the public cares about real quantities; relative prices matter; and that because the public knows and lives by this, they can’t be fooled repeatedly.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s post-1978 monetary policy strategy has embodied these insights. This was formally stated in the Bernanke era as a long-run strategy for monetary policy statement announced in January 2012.1 Monetary policy is to pursue maximum employment—disciplined by an assessment of structural and sustainable labor market realities—and low and stable inflation, explicitly defined by a symmetric objective of 2 percent personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price inflation.\nAny changes that might be made to our policy framework must be faithful to this overarching strategy of doing our best to satisfy our dual mandate objectives.\n\nOf course, the immediate impetus for thinking about alternative monetary frameworks is the zero lower bound (ZLB) and the extraordinary monetary efforts taken during the Great Recession and its aftermath. Here, I thought Larry Summers’s comments at a recent Brookings/Hutchins conference framed the issue quite well.2\n\nIf we faced a steady-state neutral nominal policy rate of 5 percent, in most circumstances we would have enough monetary capacity to deliver the accommodation necessary to react to downturns or to counter undesired disinflation. Five hundred basis points of easing ought to be enough to provide substantial financial support to the economy while avoiding the ZLB and maintaining an upward-sloping yield curve with vibrant credit intermediation to facilitate the business needs of Main Street.\n\nBut today we live in a world where, for well-known reasons, the long-run equilibrium real federal funds rate might optimistically be 1 percent, but it is perhaps lower. Adding in our 2 percent inflation target leaves the long-run nominal rate at 3 percent or lower. That falls well short of that 500-basis-point buffer that Federal Reserve policymakers have needed in the past.\n\nA number of alternative monetary policy frameworks that could provide additional accommodation have been proposed: An explicitly higher inflation target—say, 4 percent; nominal gross domestic product (GDP) targeting; temporary, state-contingent price-level targeting; and unconditional price-level targeting (PLT).\n\nIt is not my intention today to offer any endorsements or critiques of these proposals. As I emphasized previously, I would like to highlight some of the important issues that will likely inform us about the strengths and weaknesses of the various frameworks.\nAlternative frameworks and their implications for inflation\nLet me turn now more directly to the subject of alternative frameworks and their implications for inflation. These alternative frameworks often allow for a higher inflation rate—either permanently, with a higher inflation target, or temporarily, as policymakers close price-level or nominal-GDP gaps that opened up during protracted periods of below-target performance. What would be the public’s reaction to such higher inflation rates? To think about this, it’s useful to consider the costs of inflation and the choice of an inflation target.\n\nTraditional monetary theory often focused on the shoe-leather transactions costs associated with high steady-state inflation—notably, those incurred in minimizing holding non-interest-bearing money. Later discussions included menu costs, relative price distortions arising from sticky prices, and interactions between the tax code and inflation.\n\nI would think such costs are lower today than, say, in the 1950s, when Cagan (1956) wrote about money demand and provided foundations for assessing these costs. Interest-bearing transactions accounts, other financial innovations, e-commerce, and partial indexation of the tax code likely reduced these costs substantially.\n\nHigh inflation variability presents a different set of costs. A common argument for lower inflation objectives is that high average levels of inflation are associated with more variable inflation and that such variability generates real costs for the private sector.\n\nAs Herbert Stein said in my undergraduate macro seminar in 1978, the way a country like Israel got to 60 percent inflation was not by starting at 10 percent and increasing it by 10 percentage points each year. It instead followed an extremely volatile path with inflation going from 5 percent to 8, 15, 30, 60, and eventually above 400 percent by 1984—but that was after I graduated from the University of Virginia in 1980!\n\nThe risk of this type of out-of-control inflation acceleration and volatility is clear for dysfunctional monetary regimes. And it certainly is very costly. But I am not aware of a theory that delivers such outcomes without the additional fuel of aberrant central banks pursuing objectives other than a stable inflation objective—for instance, if monetary policy were to be subjugated to supporting unsustainable fiscal conditions.\n\nThese are general concepts. What about a specific number for the inflation target?\n\nMany monetary economists start their thinking with the Friedman rule, which says that to compensate for the opportunity cost of holding money, the optimal inflation rate is negative and equal in absolute value to the risk-free interest rate. Others have argued that zero is the appropriate natural focal point.\n\nAlan Greenspan offered up another way to think about price stability: We should seek a rate low enough and stable enough that businesses and households won’t factor inflation into their planning (too much).3  One could argue that because in today’s advanced economies we see few real resources expended to mitigate inflation costs, the Greenspan definition supports something around 2 percent for an inflation target.\n\nCentral banks around the world have largely settled on 2 percent as an inflation target. I guess it is tempting to think that this consensus must mean that 2 percent is the right answer. I won’t go there. But it is useful to explain why 2 percent PCE inflation might be the right answer.\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve started discussing an explicit inflation target in the 1990s, it certainly recognized that many factors play a role in determining the best inflation objective.\n\nFor example, there is the interplay between sticky wages and productivity. As highlighted by Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry (1996), downwardly rigid nominal wages can throw sand in the gears of labor markets and boost unemployment. The basis for trend nominal wage growth is the productivity trend plus long-run inflation, which should equal the inflation target. Accordingly, higher productivity growth—such as we experienced in the late 1990s and early 2000s—can support lower inflation objectives while maintaining nominal wage trends that are high enough to support adequately flexible real wages without undue reliance on a large percentage of nominal wage cuts in order to equilibrate labor markets.\n\nOf course, another key consideration in target choice is how often our monetary policy framework might encounter the zero lower bound. Analyses done in the 1990s and early 2000’s indicated that the odds were not large; for example, Reifshneider and Williams (2000) estimated it at about 15 percent. But this calculus has changed; more recently, a 2017 Brookings paper by Kiley and Roberts found that, given today’s low productivity trends and a 2 percent inflation target, the probability of hitting the ZLB is closer to 40 percent.4 This represents a very high risk of experiencing a costly economic event that would require remedies policymakers often find difficult, if not downright distasteful.\n\nClearly, these ZLB odds would be less under 3 or 4 percent inflation. So a higher inflation objective should be included in any complete list of possible alternative frameworks. The other frameworks under consideration also would include potentially protracted periods of inflation above 2 percent. Closing an underrun of a price-level target necessitates producing higher inflation for a time; and closing a big gap would require a major inflation episode.\n\nBut how do we know such policies will be acceptable to the public? Here, we have to return to the costs of inflation rates and variability that I just ran through.\nThere are a lot of questions to ask:\nHow big are the “inflation tax” and shoe-leather costs at the relevant inflation rates?\nHow much of other perceived costs of higher inflation rest on aversion to nominal wage cuts or other issues regarding the differences between real and nominal variables?\nWith regard to pursuing a moderately higher inflation objective, is higher variability preordained, even if only temporarily in the level-targeting regimes? Or is our monetary policymaking apparatus robust and credible enough to deliver low variability over a range of inflation objectives?\nCould the central bank successfully communicate the benefits of less protracted and shallower cyclical shortfalls in employment and economic activity that might accompany a higher inflation policy that avoids the zero lower bound? And if it could, how would the public weigh them against the perceived costs of inflation?\nThe bottom line is that the acceptability of 2 percent versus a higher inflation objective—even temporarily—probably comes down to 1) how well various innovations and indexing have reduced the costs of inflation; 2) perceptions about real and nominal variables; and 3) the ability of central banks to consistently implement policy so that inflation variability is relatively contained at different inflation targets.\n\nOf course, a related set of issues would arise following a protracted period of overshooting a level target. Would the public support the monetary restraint required to deflate a large positive nominal-income or price-level target gap? The lessons of the 1980s were painful. However, because of the asymmetries inherent with the ZLB and the ability of the Fed to confidently enact monetary restraint by simply increasing short-term policy rates, I see the overshooting scenario as less likely than a protracted undershooting of target.\nInteractions between monetary and regulatory frameworks\nLet’s now turn to the second point about interactions with financial markets and regulatory policies. Achieving our maximum employment and inflation mandates might require some long periods of strong monetary policy accommodation. Is the financial market system and regulatory environment robust enough to limit financial instability risks in such circumstances? Can the Fed conduct an effective and independent monetary policy strategy irrespective of the state of financial markets and regulatory policies?\n\nFinancial stability is an important goal of the Federal Reserve. Indeed, the Fed was established to provide an elastic currency that supports credit intermediation. As we were all too aware during the crisis, a breakdown in financial intermediation can have severe consequences for the real economy. So we must ask if some alternative monetary policy frameworks might be more (or less) prone to generating financial instability risks.\n\nAn important channel through which any accommodative monetary policy works is to increase incentives for prudent risk-taking, particularly with respect to physical capital investment opportunities. Lower-for-longer interest rates or policies aimed at reducing term premiums also incentivize financial risk-taking. But most economic models are silent on the regulatory parameters that could check excessive risk-taking should it take place.\n\nWhat should the FOMC do if our economic and financial stability objectives come into conflict?\n\nI am in the camp that believes that monetary policy tools should focus on achieving our legislative mandates to support maximum employment and price stability. And I’d note that a healthy real economy generally supports financial stability. I believe remaining financial stability concerns are best met by well-structured macroprudential policies supported by vigilant micro-level supervisory and regulatory oversight.\n\nAccordingly, I see the state of financial regulation as important for assessing the effectiveness of these new alternatives. As I mentioned earlier, the proposed alternative frameworks have the potential for requiring protracted periods of accommodation and, if facing the ZLB, heavy use of nontraditional policy tools.\n\nIf market discipline and our regulatory structures were too weak and the financial system became too fragile during such actions, then the ability of monetary policy to achieve its dual mandate responsibilities would be harmed. In the extreme, if the actions needed to achieve, say, a price-level target, turned out to be impractical owing to financial fragility concerns, then the credibility of the PLT approach itself would be damaged from the start.\n\nSo it is clear that the state of financial regulation must be taken into account whenever a particular monetary framework is being considered. A robust financial market culture, in which excessive risk-taking is punished by market discipline first and regulatory restrictions next, would allow for stronger and likely more effective monetary strategies to be pursued. But a weak self-regulating market culture, without adequate compensating public-sector guard-rails, could perhaps preclude the otherwise most effective monetary framework strategies.\n\nOf course, given the spectrum of competing incentives, these financial regulatory challenges are quite difficult. And a robust macroprudential structure is relevant for any monetary policy structure, including our current one. But—and this is my point here—when designing strategies, we must understand the interactions between the monetary and regulatory frameworks. And we must recognize that these will change over time—both secularly and with the business cycle. I certainly acknowledge that we have much important work to do on this front.\nNeed for outcome-based policies\nAs I turn to the third and last issue, I want to reiterate that I am not prejudging any alternative framework today. That being said, within the mix of possible alternatives, the Fed needs to give strong consideration to staying with our current monetary policy strategy. If we do so, we must ensure that it is as robust as possible. I believe an important way of achieving this is to emphasize outcome-based policies.\n\nOver the past several years, most of my monetary policy commentary has emphasized the need for policy setting aimed at achieving our maximum employment and price stability objectives more quickly and with more insurance against costly risk scenarios relative to many other policies—notably, those generated by the well-known monetary policy rules. This is what I mean by focusing on outcome-based policies.\n\nI know that many react by saying this looks like time-inconsistent discretionary policy, and that the literature favors following policy rules. This brings me to the role of policymaker discretion versus adherence to strict policy rules in monetary policy strategy discussions.\n\nThis topic is extremely relevant whether we stick with our existing strategy or turn to a new one. For example, price-level and nominal-GDP-level targeting provide relatively specific guidance on how monetary policy should evolve from period to period (if not FOMC meeting to FOMC meeting); the degree of discretion would likely be a good deal less than in the Fed’s current “balanced approach” long-run policy strategy. How should we weigh this difference when assessing the policies?\n\nIn such discussions, I think outcome-based policy action should take precedence over instrument-based decision rules. Changes in the economic environment may reduce the effectiveness of a strict instrument-setting rule or, at times, even make it counterproductive—for instance, if we were to insist on a 2 percent intercept in a Taylor rule when we think the equilibrium funds rate is really closer to zero. A policy focused on hitting mandated outcomes and risk management against adverse scenarios can avoid such missteps. By using informed discretion in instrument setting, a central bank can do a better job in delivering on its ultimate employment and inflation targets.\n\nTherefore, when judging one alternative against another, it’s not a particular policy’s adherence to an instrument decision rule that is important, but instead its ability to deliver on the central banks’ mandated policy goals.\n\nHere I would also note that that discretion and time inconsistency in an optimal-control policy rule need not lead to undesirably high inflation. Of course, it does in the familiar benchmark for this topic—the Barro–Gordon model.5 But this is because the model hardwires pursuing an unsustainably low level of unemployment in policymakers’ preferences. The central bankers succumb to the lure, break the predetermined optimal plane, and, voilà, generate inflation.\nBut by a similar argument, extreme distaste for inflation among conservative central bankers could lead to a downward bias in inflation. Ken Rogoff’s conservative policymakers’ preferences not only eschew unsustainably low unemployment, they create a policy strategy that, on average, generates below-target inflation. In effect, the inflation target is no longer symmetric. It is more like a ceiling that the conservative central banker is loath to breach.\n\nNow, I don’t want to be misread as saying that time consistency is unimportant. Rather, I feel in practice the issue is less about instrument setting and more about the need for policymakers to maintain a consistent, clear view of their long-run objectives and implement the best policies that will achieve these goals.\n\nIndeed, successfully communicating such a commitment in advance and demonstrating it strongly when the time comes would be key to establishing and maintaining the credibility of any new operating framework. The new framework must be seen as an innovative way to achieve the existing policy mandate—and not as a simple change in the goalposts.\n\nIn sum, I think that emphasizing outcome-based policies is key for our current policy framework and for evaluating any alternatives we consider. Critiques over time consistency, discretion, and bias in policymaker preferences all need to be judged against the strategy’s ability to deliver on the central bank’s mandated policy objectives. We must remember that not every theoretical impurity translates into a real-world stumbling block and that the real world is not as straightforward as the simple economies we write down in our models.\n\nThank you.\nNotes\n1 Federal Open Market Committee (2012).\n2 Summers participated in the conference titled Should the Fed Stick with the 2 Percent Inflation Target or Rethink It?, held on January 8, 2018, in Washington, DC, by the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at Brookings.

            "content": "Introduction\nI’d like to thank the Iowa Bankers Association for inviting me to speak here today. And a special thank-you goes to Abe Tubbs for the kind introduction and for all his contributions as a director of the Chicago Fed. I always listen carefully to his thoughtful comments.\nAbe tells me that the Iowa economy is generally in very good shape. Well, Iowa is not alone—economic activity across the country is also doing well. Today, I would like to first share with you my economic outlook and my views on monetary policy. I will then address some questions that I often get when I speak in public. I suspect you were thinking of asking some of these questions yourself, so this ought to put me a leg up in the Q&A.\nBut before I begin, let me remind you that my comments here today are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nCurrent economic situation and outlook for activity\nEconomic activity was solid in 2017. Growth in gross domestic product (GDP) picked up noticeably after the first quarter, and for the year as a whole, real GDP rose 2.5 percent. Consumers have been the key engine of growth in recent years. Indeed, in the fourth quarter of last year, real personal consumption expenditures rose at a quite robust 3.8 percent annual rate.\nConsumers are spending for a number of reasons. The household sector’s net worth has grown impressively, reaching record levels as a percentage of disposable income. Labor markets continue to strengthen. Over the course of 2017, job gains averaged over 170,000 per month, and were even higher last month. This far exceeds the pace needed to absorb new entrants into the labor force; and not surprisingly, the unemployment rate declined by over half a percentage point to 4.1 percent over the course of 2017, and it remains there still. The solid job market and increases in wealth have left households feeling pretty good—with measures of consumer sentiment being at high levels since 2015.\nThese improvements in household fundamentals have generated a slow but steady recovery in housing markets as well. Residential construction, however, remains well below its pre-recession peak, in part reflecting the severe disruptions to these markets during the financial crisis.\nIn the business sector, equipment spending, which had been lackluster in 2016, picked up significantly in 2017, rising nearly 9 percent over the year. Orders for capital goods and other related indicators remain quite strong, so clearly there is a good deal of forward momentum to capital spending as we enter 2018.\nAdding to this litany of positive trends, growth is picking up around the world. When I talk with CEOs of firms that have a broad global footprint, I am really impressed with how widespread these gains are. Given the slow growth advanced economies experienced in recent years, this is indeed a very positive sign. All told, the U.S. economy is firing on all cylinders and has plenty of momentum heading into this year.\nOf course, another factor that will be influencing growth is the recently passed tax package. It is difficult to determine how households and firms will respond to the provisions in the bill, which could influence economic activity through a variety of channels.\nIn January we asked our Beige Book1 contacts about the likely impact of the tax package on their businesses.2 Their responses indicated that, on average, about a quarter of the tax savings is expected to go toward capital spending and about 15 percent to labor. Most of the remaining 60 percent is planned to be used to pay down debt, fund mergers and acquisitions, and return funds to shareholders.\nHow all these various activities will translate into GDP growth is highly uncertain. Still, by most analyses, the act should boost aggregate activity in the near and medium terms. The estimates for 2018 generally range between 0.4 and 0.8 percent.3\nThe longer-term impacts of the package are more uncertain. Long-term sustainable growth depends on the available labor in the economy, the capital stock that this labor works with, and the technology used in production. Aspects of the package could potentially boost capital spending and labor inputs. These obviously are difficult to estimate. Most analysts see the effects as being relatively small.\nWhen I sum everything up, I expect GDP growth in 2018 to be in the 2-1/2 to 2-3/4 percent range. For the following two years, I anticipate growth to slow down some, as the tax cut bump wears off. These gains should be benchmarked against the underlying trend in GDP growth, which my staff estimates will be between 1-3/4 to 2 percent over the next few years.\nWith this growth outlook, I expect the unemployment rate to decline further to about 3.5 percent by the end of 2020. This is a full percentage point below my staff’s estimate of what economists call its natural rate, which is the unemployment rate consistent with the normal churning of people in and out of jobs at a time when the workforce is fully employed.4\nWhat about inflation? Currently, core consumer inflation, which cuts through a lot of the statistical noise in overall prices, is 1.5 percent. That is also the average inflation rate we had over the past eight years. So, inflation has consistently undershot the FOMC’s 2 percent objective for quite some time.5\nI expect inflation to rise gradually over the next few years. If my forecast for the drop in the unemployment rate is correct, then we should see some pressures developing on productive resources in the economy, generating higher costs and higher prices.\nThere is a hint that this may be in train today. Some inflation indicators over the past couple of months have been positive. I also am hearing a bit more commentary from manufacturers about higher commodity prices. While wage increases have been disappointingly low, the most recent data exhibit a firming trend. And I’ve recently been hearing from more of my business contacts that firms are raising wages, giving additional bonuses, and boosting benefits. These are all positive signs for wage growth and clear signs of tighter labor markets.\nIn my forecast, I expect inflation to rise gradually to our 2 percent target, perhaps reaching it in late 2019 or in 2020. But despite the indicators I just noted, I have not yet seen many actual increases in consumer prices. So, my forecast of reaching our target is still just a forecast. There is still a role for accommodative monetary policy to bring us back to our 2 percent inflation target.\nThis brings me to the first question I’ve been getting lately.\nThe case for delaying rate increases\nThat is, if real activity in the U.S. is on such a solid footing and you expect further improvements that will take the unemployment rate below its natural rate, why did you prefer to delay a rate increase in December?﻿6\nI thought the December decision was a close one, and at the time, I carefully considered all the arguments for and against raising rates. In the end, my decision rested on my concerns about the inflation outlook. As I just noted, core PCE inflation is 1.5 percent and has averaged about that over the past eight years. This is noticeably below the FOMC’s 2 percent symmetric inflation target.\nEarly in 2017, inflation had moved up to 1.9 percent, and it looked as if our inflation goal was finally within reach. But our hopes were dashed last spring when inflation dropped unexpectedly. In delving into the details, we saw a few developments—such as less expensive cell phone plans—that could explain a portion of the decline. Some think that once these and other unusual declines are past us, inflation will bounce back up this coming spring. And if these earlier declines were truly transitory, then there is more justification for raising rates today.\nHowever, I am concerned that more persistent factors are holding down inflation. In particular, I am concerned that the public’s inflation expectations may have drifted down below the FOMC’s symmetric 2 percent inflation target.\nExpectations of future inflation are a key determinant of actual inflation because they serve as an important benchmark for the wage demands of workers and the pricing decisions of businesses.\nOver the past several years, numerous measures of longer-run inflation expectations have moved down noticeably, and they remain uncomfortably low today. To be sure, compensation for inflation that investors price into inflation-protected Treasury securities has risen some in recent months. Nonetheless, it remains 30 to 50 basis points below where it was in 2014. And some survey-based measures, such as the University of Michigan’s Index of Consumer Sentiment,7 haven’t budged much from their relatively low levels.\nI am also concerned that too many observers have the impression that the FOMC’s 2 percent objective is a ceiling that policymakers do not want to breach. This belief would then cause them to think inflation over the long run would average somewhere below 2 percent.\nLet me stress that the FOMC has stated firmly that our inflation objective is symmetric. In the long run, we would like to see the odds of inflation running modestly below 2 percent be equal to the odds of it running modestly above this target. But what matters for expectations is what the public thinks we will do. And I am not sure they believe our commitment to such symmetry.\nWhen looking at all of these factors, I thought a pause in our normalization process was the best policy. I believe it would have provided a useful nudge up to inflation expectations. Such a pause also would have better allowed us time to assess the incoming inflation data and better determine how transitory last year’s soft readings really were.\nThis leads me to another question I get frequently.\nThe monetary policy path and managing risk\nI often get asked this: Can you describe the kinds of things that you will be concentrating on when making your monetary policy decisions going forward? And I’m also often asked these related questions: What if you are wrong and inflation starts to increase a good deal more rapidly than you expect? What would you do then?\nI should start by saying that I am comfortable with the general strategy the FOMC has laid out—namely, the planned gradual approach to removing monetary policy accommodation, with the federal funds rate eventually settling at around 2.8 percent in the long run. I agree with that.\nIn determining the exact path I think we should follow, I will approach the future in the same way that I have approached every policy decision in the past. It all begins with a careful evaluation of incoming data. Armed with that new information, I think critically about its implications for my outlook and update my thinking on monetary policy accordingly.\nWhat does this mean for the near term? With the data I see today, my policy strategy would be to keep policy on hold until midyear or so in order to assess the incoming inflation data. If we get to that point and have more confidence that inflation is moving up sustainably, then further rate increases would be warranted.\nIn contrast, suppose inflation picks up more assuredly, as many expect. Then, we still could easily raise rates another three or even four times in 2018 if that were necessary. And I would support such a faster pace if the data point convincingly in this direction.\nThis logic carries over to faster-than-expected increases in inflation more generally. That’s an issue the FOMC knows how to fix. We would respond by increasing the federal funds rate more quickly. During the current tightening cycle, the FOMC has raised rates by 125 basis points over the course of two years. This is a very gradual path by historical standards. Even during the so-called measured pace of increases during the 2004−06 tightening cycle, the target rate rose by 125 basis points in six months. So raising rates more rapidly without derailing economic growth is clearly an option.\nThis brings me to the last question. Whenever I mention that the long-run neutral level of the funds rate is 2.8 percent,8 even those with only a little gray hair think, “Gee, that is really low!” We’re used to thinking about interest rates averaging much higher. So a question I frequently get asked, particularly if there are bankers in the audience, is the next one.\nThe challenges of low interest rates and a flatter yield curve9\nWhy are interest rates so low? This question is typically followed by another: Are you also concerned that long-run interest rates are not much higher than short-term rates—that the yield curve is so flat?\nOf course, the concerns here are that low rates pose special challenges for financial investors. The flat yield curve can test the business models of many financial institutions. Some argue that together, these could induce a “reach for yield” and increase financial stability risks.\nI have spoken extensively in previous speeches on why short-term neutral rates are lower today than they were in the past. So I will spare you the details today and just mention some of the forces that have been driving rates lower.\nAs you may know, there is near consensus among economists that the trend rate of economic growth in the U.S. is much lower now than in the past on account of a number of factors: slower growth in total labor force; declines in labor force participation; and the slower pace of technological innovations. Standard economic theory teaches us that, all else being equal, in a low-trend-growth economy, short-term real interest rates will be lower. Note, too, that these factors pushing down rates have nothing to do with monetary policy.\nBy one estimate made by colleagues Thomas Laubach and John Williams, the real, or inflation-adjusted, neutral federal funds rate averaged 3.4 percent over the three decades from the 1970s through the 1990s.10 Today, the real neutral fed funds rate is estimated to be near zero.11 Now most expect some increase in this over time, but not too much. The median FOMC participant’s estimate is that the long-run real neutral federal funds rate is just 80 basis points. Taking this estimate and adding our 2 percent inflation target, we get a nominal neutral funds rate of 2.8 percent.12\nWhat about long-term interest rates? First of all, because the principle component of long-term interest rates is the average expectation for future short-term interest rates, the low neutral fed funds rate translates into low long-term interest rates. There are several other forces exerting downward pressure on long rates: Strong global private demand for safe assets, the continuing effects of quantitative easing by central banks around the world,13 and the fact that long-term U.S. Treasury bonds are perceived to be a good hedge against downside economic risks.\nSo, today we are facing low short- and long-term interest rates and a fairly flat differential between the two—although not as flat as a few weeks ago.\nNow, for financial institutions whose bread-and-butter business is maturity transformation that relies on an upward-sloping yield curve, the current situation might seem challenging.\nIf higher short-term rates cause funding costs to rise faster than the rates on interest-earning assets, net interest margins and overall profitability might decline. In turn, this could put a check on lending activity.\nHowever, for the banking sector as a whole, bank profitability has not been challenged significantly during past episodes of flat yield curves associated with policy normalizations. For one thing, deposit rates generally are slow to increase, so for those who rely on deposit funding, costs may not rise immediately. At the same time, a lot of bank lending is at variable rates that increase more in tandem with policy rates. So, net interest margins often will initially increase when the yield curve flattens as assets reprice faster than liabilities.\nUltimately, the profitability of bank lending depends on the underlying strength of the economy.14 In the past, the macroeconomic environment has been more important than the yield curve per se in determining bank behavior. Today, the vigor of the economy can only be considered a positive for the sector.\nOf course, some financial intermediaries may adjust their business practices in light of these yield curve conditions. We need to be on the lookout for behaviors that could have financial stability implications. Today, these don’t appear to be emanating from the banking sector, which is generally well capitalized. And many of our financial market contacts, who extend outside of banking, also do not see today’s flat yield curve as being a significant driver of risk-taking activity.\nThis concludes my prepared remarks. I hope I’ve preemptively answered a few of your questions. I look forward to taking the rest of them now.\nNotes\n1 Before every FOMC meeting, the Fed publishes a report we call the Beige Book, which summarizes what the regional Federal Reserve Banks have heard from their contacts across a range of businesses in their respective Districts. Further details on the Beige Book, including the latest report, are available online.\n2 See Walstrum (2018).\n3 The bottom of the range is reported by the International Monetary Fund (2018), in its latest World Economic Outlook Update. The top of the range comes from analysis conducted by Page et al. (2017) for the Tax Policy Center.\n4 The natural rate of unemployment is the unemployment rate that would prevail in an economy making full use of its productive resources. Consequently, it is the rate of unemployment that would predominate over the longer run in the absence of shocks to the economy.\n5 Two percent inflation—measured by the annual change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE)—is the explicit inflation target consistent with the Federal Reserve’s price stability mandate. This inflation target was officially set by the FOMC in January 2012 and reaffirmed annually; see Federal Open Market Committee (2012).\n6 Evans (2017).\n7 Details on the University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers, including its Index of Consumer Sentiment, are available online.\n8 The neutral, or equilibrium, federal funds rate is the funds rate associated with a neutral monetary policy (policy that is neither expansionary nor contractionary).\n9 A yield curve is the line plotting the yields or interest rates of assets of the same credit quality but with differing maturity dates at a certain point in time. These assets, such as U.S. Treasury securities, typically yield incrementally more at longer maturities.\n10 Laubach and Williams (2003).\n11 For the updated estimates, see Laubach and Williams (2017).\n12 Four times a year the FOMC releases its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which presents FOMC participants’ forecasts of key economic variables over the next three years and for the longer run. Participants also provide their assessments of the appropriate monetary policy that supports those forecasts.

            "content": "Someone once told me that, back in the 1980s, when you walked by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, there was an air of mystery about the place. People wondered what went on behind the imposing pillars. And very few people really knew.\nIn 1994 when Michael Moskow became the eighth president and chief executive officer, he resolved that the Chicago Fed would become a much more open and transparent institution, clearly focused on serving the public interest.1\nWithin his first two weeks on the job, Michael held a press conference at the Fed. This would have been an unnerving undertaking for most, but not for Michael. John Berry of the Washington Post, the dean of Fed-watching journalists back then, lauded his performance. That certainly was high praise.\nJohn also pointed out that “unlike all but one of the other 11 presidents of the Fed’s regional banks, Moskow has no previous experience working for the Federal Reserve System or a financial institution before being chosen.\"2\nSome would have considered that a shortcoming. But through hard work and perseverance, Michael rose to the task. Calling on his government and corporate business experience, Michael addressed the challenges of his new role by spending the time and making the effort, working harder than most, and quickly establishing himself as an influential voice inside the Fed.\nWhen it came to monetary policy issues and debates, Michael was methodical. He studied all of the angles, assessed the situation carefully, worked to understand the best approaches, and then, with a clear understanding, contributed to the policy debate.\nMichael extended his vision of a more open Fed beyond the confines of Chicago and the Seventh Federal Reserve District.3 He contributed to improving the transparency of the Federal Reserve System through his work on Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) communications committees with Don Kohn, Roger Ferguson, Ben Bernanke, and others. These efforts were transformative. They helped foster the evolution of the now-essential FOMC statements from 1994 onward;4 transformed the semi-annual Humphrey–Hawkins economic submissions into the quarterly Summary of Economic Projections;5 and eventually led, after his tenure, to the FOMC’s formalization of a long-run strategy for monetary policy that quantified our price stability goal as a symmetric 2 percent inflation target—an important milestone.6\nWithin the Chicago Fed, Michael “opened up” the internal workings of the Bank by creating a flatter organization and a corporate culture with more open communication and better collaboration across departments. Small informal touches helped, as he insisted on being identified as “Michael” (rather than “Dr. Moskow”) and job titles were left at the door.\nBig changes—especially cultural ones—take time and plenty of effort. Michael firmly believed in keeping senior leaders accountable for everything they did. That’s the mark of top organizations. His strong and persistent efforts established a corporate culture at the Bank that bears his signature to this day. As his successor, I’ve found that maintaining the best corporate culture possible is a continuing challenge. But Michael instilled in me the value of meeting this challenge, and so it’s something that I strive to do as Chicago Fed president.\nMichael also believed in experimenting with different operational approaches in some areas that were historically stodgy, such as public speaking and communications. Some of those experiments worked, and others were not as successful. I certainly learned from the successes as well as the miscues; and both helped model our communications strategies today—including how I present my sometimes outspoken views on monetary policy questions.\nLet me close with one last thought.\nDuring Michael’s 13-year tenure on the FOMC, the economy grew a robust 3.2 percent a year and the unemployment rate averaged 5.0 percent. There was one brief recession lasting just eight months. So pretty darn good. The federal funds rate went up. It went down. And it remained unchanged for lengths of time. Inflation continued its long steady decline. Indeed, the Committee reached a landmark in the spring of 2003 when the FOMC statement acknowledged that it was possible that inflation could become uncomfortably low. This was an eye-opening development for those of us who lived through the battle against high inflation in the 1970s and 1980s.\nI succeeded Michael in September 2007. Almost overnight, the economy experienced a financial crisis and slid into the deepest recession since the Great Depression. During my tenure as president of the Chicago Fed, economic growth has been just 1.4 percent a year and the unemployment rate has averaged 7 percent. The federal funds rate went down; it remained unchanged for an extraordinarily long length of time; and only recently has it risen. Inflation has averaged under 1-1/2 percent. And, thanks to the openness that Michael championed, we have a way to measure by just how much this means we have missed our inflation goal.\nSo, as you can see, Michael’s timing was impeccable. And this too taught me an important lesson—the art of the timely exit. So let me now turn to introducing the expert panel we have joining Michael here tonight. They will take a look at how monetary policy has changed in the years since the financial crisis and where we go from here.

            "content": "Introduction\nI am delighted to be included in the third annual Fintech Conference, and grateful to our host, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, and conference partners—the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, the Bank Policy Institute, the Brookings Institution, and the University of Cambridge. We think of fintech as a new thing, but I’d like to begin my talk by considering a historical example of financial technology and innovation from the time of the Fed’s founding. Countless innovations have been made in finance throughout history. And policymakers, including central bankers, have long grappled with how to foster financial innovation while at the same time ensuring the smooth operation of the financial system, as well as the stability of the broader macroeconomy. Before I go on, let me remind you that my comments reflect my own views and not necessarily the views of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nIn the early 1900s, many contemporaries saw the American payment system as slow and costly. This may ring a bell for those of you who have studied our payment system today. The debate in the early 1900s was different, of course, focusing on the processing of checks. Advocates for reform liked to cite an example involving an actual check that was written out of a bank in Sag Harbor, Long Island, New York, and deposited in a bank in Hoboken, New Jersey, only 100 miles away. To receive the payment, the bank in Hoboken sent the check to its correspondent bank in New York City. But its correspondent did not deal directly with the bank in Sag Harbor, so it sent the check along to another bank it partnered with. This continued, and in defiance of all sensibility, the check traveled to eight more banks—in Boston, Tonawanda, Albany, Port Jefferson, Far Rockaway, back to New York City, Riverhead, and Brooklyn—before finally reaching its destination in Sag Harbor. The point of that 1,500-mile journey was to avoid fees imposed on check processing by working through existing banking relationships, but this caused a considerable delay. This is the problem of “circuitous check routing,” as it was known.1\nI am sure that fintech innovators could have thought of many ways to improve on that system, which sounds inefficient and a little absurd. And as a monetary policymaker, I can think of several things that might have concerned me. Ultimately, monetary policy is intended to create financial conditions that promote the ability of businesses and households to make good use of the economy’s productive resources. Long gaps in the ability to access payments could impair liquidity, for both households and businesses, as well as for the banks themselves. Circuitous check routing seemed like a sign of inefficiency in financial technology that could get in the way of the macroeconomy functioning at full potential. Finally, a payment system with so many points of failure raised questions about how resilient it would be in times of stress.\nNow, scholars have debated whether examples like that 1,500-mile journey were cherry-picked by advocates for payment system reform. That may well have been the case. Nevertheless, scholars have also viewed the creation of the Fed as having substantially sped up check clearing and reduced the costs associated with it. One of the Fed’s early key accomplishments was the creation of a national check-clearing system. The national scope of this system largely eliminated the need to route checks around the country, at least for banks that were members of the Federal Reserve System, as they could simply use the nearest Federal Reserve branch. In addition, the Fed used a telegraph network to increase the speed of check clearing, particularly on the back-end. Once the check was in the Fed’s possession, it would credit the appropriate account and telegraph out that information. Lastly, the Fed insisted on clearing of checks at par—something many banks had resisted as their business models depended on fees from check processing. Overall, in a short time, from 1912 to 1918, check clearing sped up from an average of 5.3 days to 2.4 days, and was largely at par. This was a major change.2\nClearly, the Fed has had a long-standing interest in improving the speed and resilience of the U.S. payments infrastructure. That interest continues, and the Fed is currently embarking on a major new initiative to deliver real-time payments. I will discuss this initiative, known as FedNowSM, a little bit later. Notably, the Fed has not sought to displace existing payments infrastructure. At the time of its founding, for example, the Fed’s check-processing system continued to operate alongside private-sector systems run by correspondent banks and clearinghouses. Today, the Federal Reserve continues to serve a prominent role in the payment system as a provider alongside private operators of financial services. Moreover, the Chicago Fed has had a long-standing role in leading Federal Reserve System initiatives in payment services. Staff in Chicago manage the System’s Customer Relations and Support Office and oversee FedLine®—the network through which U.S. financial institutions connect to the Fed for services such as wire transfers, automated clearinghouse (ACH) transactions, and cash processing. Chicago Fed staff also manage relationships with these banks and oversee the System’s Industry Relations function, which facilitates industry engagement and collaboration on payments.\nOne key lesson I take from payments innovation at the time of the Fed’s founding is that the pace of change can be unpredictable. Rarely does a single invention result in sweeping reform. Instead, major productivity improvements in economic history have been driven by the accumulation of incremental changes, with their adoption shaped by compatibility with existing practices.3 The telegraph, for example, certainly existed before the Fed. However, its use in payments was limited by the high fixed cost of operating a nationwide telegraph network, as well as the inability of private banks to impose consistent operating standards. The Fed played an important role in shaping the adoption of payments technology—in this case the telegraph—in part by creating an appropriate institutional setting for it to be adopted.\nThe payment system has evolved considerably since the age of the telegraph, alongside improvements in communications and computing. Today, payments are an active area of innovation—one part of the broad umbrella known as fintech. I would like to turn my attention now to a few recent developments in fintech. I will focus in particular on cryptocurrencies and then come back to the subject of payments and discuss the FedNow initiative.\nCryptocurrencies\nCryptocurrencies have blossomed over the past decade. Since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008, investors have purchased thousands of such currencies. Today, the market capitalization of all digital currencies is estimated to be over $200 billion.4 It is clear there is an appetite for cryptocurrency. For some, cryptocurrencies represent a potential break from established banking and payments infrastructure. Other users value anonymity and, therefore, the ability to conceal their identities in cryptocurrency transactions. Merchants may be attracted by opportunities to avoid costs incurred with existing payment options—such as interchange fees in debit and credit card transactions. Many others are simply speculating on the values of these cryptocurrencies.\nThe policy implications of cryptocurrencies are fascinating and evolving. As an asset in the global financial system, cryptocurrencies seem to be still a fairly small development. As a means of payment, the potential use of cryptocurrencies could have important implications for the financial system and for monetary policy, if a significant share of payments activity shifted into cryptocurrencies. In such a scenario, the business models of commercial banks could come under significant pressure. In addition, it is an open question whether significant use of private digital currencies could alter the ability of the Federal Reserve to implement monetary policy through its existing toolkit.\nThus far, however, cryptocurrencies have largely been used as vehicles for speculation rather than as a means of payment. For these digital currencies to have more wide-reaching effects on the macroeconomy, they would likely have to overcome some barriers to adoption. One such barrier is the instability of their values. For example, the price of Bitcoin was roughly $3,500 at the beginning of 2019, over $13,000 in June, and as of last week, back down to around $9,000. In addition, transaction speeds have been slow—a Bitcoin transaction could take anywhere from minutes to over an hour. The line at Starbucks would move even more slowly if we had to wait for that. Some scholars doubt that a privately issued currency can ever serve as a reliable means of exchange given these factors, together with the inherent default risk associated with the absence of any government or institutional backing. These barriers illustrate a theme I touched on a few minutes ago—that innovation often occurs through incremental changes that are shaped by the compatibility of new ideas with existing ones. Blockchain and digital currencies constitute a major single invention, but one with some barriers to adoption that subsequent innovators have been attempting to address in a myriad of ways. Some of these attempts probably don’t have much future: Among the thousands of cryptocurrencies, the Bananacoin, for example, doesn’t seem ripe for a breakthrough.5 But others that are geared toward addressing some of the key barriers to wider adoption that I just mentioned may have more promise.\nStablecoins\nThis brings me to a second development, the emergence of stablecoins—that is, cryptocurrencies that peg their value to target the price of a real-world asset. These currencies are designed to address the price stability shortcomings that have inhibited the wider adoption of digital currencies for use cases that require a stable medium of exchange, such as payments.\nStill, no stablecoin offers the network breadth that would be necessary to function as a medium of exchange. This, in part, has been why Facebook’s announcement of plans to create the cryptocurrency Libra has gathered widespread attention. With a network of almost two and a half billion active monthly users and growing, Facebook would potentially provide Libra with a huge user base.6 But legislators, regulators, and central bankers have been quick to highlight the risks, along with the need for more details about how Libra will function. It is critical to assess Libra’s potential impact on users and the financial system, as well as how it can be effectively regulated on a global scale. Facebook’s past missteps on user privacy and security raise serious questions around user protection. Central banks have called for more clarity over how the underlying Libra Reserve will function and what the makeup of currencies backing the value of Libra will be. In his July 2019 testimony to the House Financial Services Committee, Fed Chair Powell highlighted our concerns about Libra, particularly around consumer privacy and protection, the risks of money laundering, and the need to assess its impact on broader financial stability.7 With this increase in unfavorable regulatory and congressional attention, the Libra Association—the group founded to fund Libra and provide oversight over it—has seen an exodus of original founding partners, including PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard.\nCentral bank digital currencies\nThus far, digital currency innovation has largely been the product of private-sector efforts. A central bank digital currency could conceivably address some of the barriers to widespread use that I noted earlier. A central bank’s nationwide reach could spur widespread adoption, and government backing could ensure the currency would be default free.\nA small number of central banks around the world have experimented with issuing digital currencies, particularly for the purpose of cross-border payments. Despite these experiments, few central banks have immediate plans for broad implementation.8 Likewise, the Federal Reserve is not actively considering issuing a digital currency, but continues to monitor other central banks and engage with them to remain current on issues and plans.\nSome scholars have suggested that a central bank digital currency could provide additional tools for central bankers’ toolkit. In particular, new tools could be useful in situations where conventional monetary policy has been exhausted and short-term interest rates have reached the effective lower bound. For example, a central bank could conceivably impose a negative interest rate on the digital currency or carry out a metaphorical helicopter drop of new money supply to all existing holders. Such tools raise some immediate questions, such as how a central bank would manage outflows from the digital currency in the presence of negative rates. These questions are in addition to the profound operational and technical challenges that any central bank would need to address in launching a digital currency, as well as other concerns such as how existing financial institutions would be affected by such a currency.9\nBlockchain technology\nOutside of digital currencies, blockchain technology has other potential uses. For example, blockchain is gaining traction as a means of tracking inventory or provenance. For example, blockchain has enabled suppliers and retailers to track products like milk and meat from origin to consumers—in other words, “from farm to fork.” In addition, global banks and groups of private firms are testing the technology and its capacity to allow for group monitoring and public tracking of contractual agreements, also known as “smart contracts.” Thus far, however, the use of blockchain to trade financial information and assets has been largely limited to pilot experiments where participation is strictly limited, such as Chase’s network in which a small number of corporate clients can transfer funds between each other using the JPM Coin. Large, decentralized, or “permissionless” public blockchains face implementation and regulatory barriers, as well as challenges in scaling up. They also require a high bar for data privacy and protection.\nOther technologies on the fintech spectrum\nOf course, cryptocurrencies are not the only fintech development shaping payments, banking, regulation, and the financial ecosystem.\nArtificial intelligence (AI), with its capabilities for pattern recognition and prediction, is being used for a host of processes and tasks in finance and banking. Banks and technology firms deploy AI for monitoring fraud, identifying breach points, and automating customer support tools. Additionally, AI has the potential to automate regulatory and compliance activities while incorporating more data for both regulators and regulated institutions. At the Chicago Fed, we are exploring AI projects to support core work in economic research, bank supervision, and internal business processes—similar to the ways banks and their technology vendors are exploring the use of AI to gain efficiencies and new insights.\nWhile artificial intelligence and machine learning can introduce efficiencies, this is an area where caution and a clear understanding of the risks are critical. Given that tasks such as underwriting and credit scoring rely on broader sets of data and algorithms to support lending decisions, financial institutions will need to frequently examine the impact of this approach. Responsible AI fundamentals are necessary to ensure that unintended bias that could have an adverse effect on borrowers and access to credit is addressed.\nReal-time payments and FedNow\nI would like to shift gears now and turn to current plans for innovation in the U.S. payment system. Here I see the Federal Reserve as a leader in promoting innovation both to speed up payments and to ensure resilience of the U.S. payment system.\nEven with the all of the advances in computing and communications technologies over the past few decades, the U.S. payment system still relies heavily on decades-old infrastructure. Indeed, real-time payments are generally unavailable in the U.S. As a result, a bill payment made by a consumer online can still take multiple days to post and settle. Contract workers who are not part of a regular payroll could face delays in collecting their wages. Real-time payments offer the potential for people to gain access to money they earned immediately. For liquidity-constrained households, access to real-time payments could mean avoiding late fees, as well as potentially faster access to ad hoc payments like insurance payouts. For small businesses, immediate access to funds from a sale would provide the ability to invest in inventory more quickly, avoiding costly short-term financing. For contract workers, having immediate access and certainty of funds provides predictability and reduces risk.\nThe demand for faster payments and the possibility of increasing efficiency with such payments have inspired innovation by private actors. However, these innovations still rely on legacy infrastructure that involves delays—whether those delays are visible to end-users or not. For example, popular person-to-person payment services, such as Venmo and Zelle, actually mask back-end processes. As a result, even as funds may be available immediately, interbank settlement can take days. Many cryptocurrency trades also often rely on existing settlement infrastructure. Moreover, current innovations have had only limited reach. Checks often remain a desirable method of choice because they carry some enduring advantages for businesses and households that want to track their spending or include identifying information along with a payment, such as a purchase order number.\nIn August, the Federal Reserve announced plans to develop the FedNow service—a new, round-the-clock real-time payment and settlement service. FedNow will be accessible to all financial institutions and will leverage the Federal Reserve System’s connections with over 10,000 financial institutions across the U.S. This is a reach no single private-sector provider would be able to achieve on its own.\nThe goal of FedNow is to ensure efficiency and resiliency and broaden reach while operating in healthy competition with private-sector providers of real-time payments. The Fed’s participation in real-time payments will ensure redundancy and reduce the risk of a single point of failure, and will also allow us to continue to serve the important role of providing liquidity and operational continuity in times of stress in real-time payments.\nThe move to faster payments has been a global goal. Other central banks and jurisdictions are in varying stages of development and market adoption of faster payment services. The U.S. has avoided mandates, primarily because of the size of our economy, our banking infrastructure, and our market-driven system for financial services. Instead, the U.S. has largely relied upon market-driven innovation and joint public–private collaboration to deliver advancements in payment services.\nThe decision to build FedNow has been several years in the making, and is the culmination of extensive industry engagement, market assessment, and dialogue with a diverse range of stakeholders. In 2015, the Federal Reserve released a paper titled “Strategies for improving the U.S. payment system.” This paper outlined the Fed’s broad commitment to modernizing the U.S. payment system. It also described the industry’s desire to achieve positive outcomes involving faster payment speed, system security, improvement of international payments, industry collaboration, and payment system efficiency.10 The Federal Reserve then led an effort to bring stakeholders in the payment system together to establish a vision for a faster payment system in the United States. The Faster Payments Task Force included a wide range of payment system stakeholders including providers, banks, consumer groups, corporations, and others.11 The Task Force finalized their work in 2017. It issued ten recommended actions intended to deliver a safe, ubiquitous, faster payment ecosystem facilitated through industry-driven governance and collaboration. Two of these recommendations focused on the Fed’s role in faster payments. The first called for the Federal Reserve to expand settlement windows to 24-7; and the second called on the Fed to assess other operational roles it may need to take to support the ubiquity of faster payments, competition in delivering them, and equitable access to them.12\nAs a result of these recommendations, the Federal Reserve conducted extensive outreach and sought public feedback on the potential to expand the Fed’s role as an operator of real-time payments. A Federal Register notice requesting comments on the potential introduction of a faster payment settlement service generated over 400 responses representing 800 entities. Over 90 percent of those responses indicated support for the Fed offering a settlement service for faster payments. Responses highlighted the importance of safety and security in faster payments, noting the Fed’s record of resiliency, especially during periods of stress. Another theme from the comments was that the Fed would ensure nationwide, equitable access to banks of all sizes by operating a real-time service for faster payments alongside a private-sector system. And finally, comments noted that a Federal Reserve real-time retail payment service would increase competition, decrease market concentration, and provide a neutral platform for innovation. The announcement of the FedNow service followed a close review of these supportive comments. In addition, the Fed gave careful consideration to the broad public benefit of faster payments; the Fed’s ability to fully recover costs; and whether the private sector on its own could achieve faster payments with adequate scope, equity, and effectiveness.\nResiliency of the payment system\nReal-time payments aren’t about speed alone. The payment system must also be resilient in the face of financial stress. Central banks are a classic source of such resiliency. For example, as a lender of last resort, the Fed has the unique capacity to expand total liquidity in the financial system. This is crucial in times of stress when the overall demand for liquidity increases. The history of payments is filled with examples of private-sector innovation, but also with examples of the fragility of privately run payment systems. For example, scholars have found that one source of fragility during the Great Depression was the privately run correspondent banking system, that is, the system used mostly by non-Fed-member banks to clear payments. The failure of a correspondent bank during the Great Depression resulted in a cascade of additional failures among its partner banks, known as respondents.13 Another example comes from the aftermath of the September 11th terrorist attacks. Communications interruptions in lower Manhattan led to disruption in payment flows.14 Sometimes fragility is more idiosyncratic. One well-known example is a computer failure in 1985 at a large New York bank, which has a central role in clearing transactions among financial institutions. The computer failure resulted in the inability of Bank of New York Mellon to receive any payments, leading to knock-on disruptions in the securities markets in which it had a large role.15 In the face of potential disruptions such as these to private real-time payment systems, the FedNow platform will provide an important source of redundancy and resiliency. By ensuring the system is secure and resilient, FedNow will engender confidence in the use of real-time payments.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, financial technology has come a long way since checks journeyed hundreds of miles around the country. Central banks have had an important role in promoting this innovation, and indeed the Fed continues to innovate alongside private-sector actors. These are exciting times, and I look forward to seeing what the future will bring.\nNotes\n1 Spahr (1926, pp. 105–106).\n2 Quinn and Roberds (2008), James and Weiman (2010), Chang et al.

            "content": "Introduction and disclaimer\nWelcome to Chicago. I’m Charlie Evans, president and CEO of the Chicago Fed. We’re very happy to be hosting this important discussion of Monetary Policy’s Impact on Workers and Their Communities. Before I begin my remarks, let me remind you that my comments reflect my own views and not necessarily the views of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nThe Federal Reserve’s monetary policy framework review\nThis year, the Federal Reserve has been engaged in a broad review of the strategies, tools, and communication practices it uses to pursue its monetary policy goals as mandated by Congress—namely, maximum employment and price stability.1\nOur current framework dates back to 2012 when we formally stated our intention to pursue a balanced approach to achieving our dual mandate objectives. That’s also when our inflation objective was explicitly defined to be 2 percent annual inflation, as measured by the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE).2 We also noted then that defining maximum employment was more difficult because it can change over time due to influences beyond our control as monetary policymakers. But we did note the range of our assessments of the level of the national unemployment rate in the long run—which can be taken as a rough benchmark for full employment.\nEvery January, we reaffirm this framework. Sometimes we’ve made some changes to improve it—most importantly in 2016, when we clarified that our inflation objective is symmetric around 2 percent.3 This strategy document then guides our detailed policy decisions, which we describe in a separate policy statement after every FOMC meeting.\nI think our 2012 strategy statement and its updates were strong efforts. Still, it is appropriate that we periodically reexamine our strategy thoroughly to determine whether it still serves us well in light of changes that may have occurred in the economic environment. Clear communications to the public about our goals and strategies bring transparency and accountability to monetary policy, which is very important for a central bank in a democracy.\nSo, late last year, Chair Jay Powell announced that we would be conducting a broad review of our policy framework. And this time, we are getting more input from people outside the Federal Reserve System. In June, the Chicago Fed hosted a meeting that featured many prominent academics applying highly mathematical analyses that help us understand how different monetary policy strategies might work.\nBut it also very important for us to get input from beyond traditional economic analysts and the financial sector. I always think it is important to check theoretical ideas with real-world experiences. Talking with people engaged in important, real-world work, such as those on today’s panels, to find out how they are affected by monetary policy is an important source of insights into how we should do our work at the Fed.\nToday’s panels\nToday, we will have the opportunity to hear from a very impressive group of panelists and delve into some of the key issues in more depth.\nThe members of the first panel are committed to improving the labor market prospects of current and future workers. Their efforts, much of which are aimed at those who face substantial labor market disadvantages, help people build their workforce skills and employability and ultimately earn higher incomes.\nThe participants in the second panel are working to promote wealth building, especially in low- and moderate-income communities. Their work adds to the vibrancy and sustainability of small businesses and increases access to affordable housing.\nThe efforts of our panelists to build human capital and create wealth where it is in short supply are extremely important to making us a more productive nation over the long haul. They also serve to promote a more inclusive economy by providing greater support to those who face significant challenges in finding good jobs or achieving financial stability in today’s complex world.\nWhat we hope to learn\nThe work that our panelists do, like that of everyone in the economy, is importantly affected by the Fed’s monetary policy. Our belief is that the objectives of our panelists are more achievable in an environment of price stability and maximum employment. However, if they are not succeeding, we have to ask ourselves if there’s something about macroeconomic conditions that is inhibiting their progress.\nFor instance, one of the key questions facing us today is whether the economy is currently operating at its maximum sustainable level of employment. Certainly, the national unemployment rate is very low by historical standards. And at 3-1/2 percent, it is below most estimates of the so-called natural rate of unemployment—the unemployment rate at which the economy can operate on a sustained basis without the buildup of unwelcome inflationary forces. Estimates of the natural rate tend to be 4 percent or a bit higher.\nHowever, even though economists put a lot of effort into estimating the natural rate, we’re very conscious of how uncertain those estimates remain. That is, while something a little greater than 4 percent might be the best assessment given our limited data, we know the actual number might be somewhat higher or somewhat lower. Certainly, wage growth has remained quite moderate, even though we’ve been below conventional estimates of the natural rate for some time. This suggests that, at a minimum, unemployment is not so far below its natural rate that overly high inflation is an urgent threat. Indeed, inflation has been persistently below our 2 percent target over just about the whole time that we’ve had that formal target.\nThis leads me to think that the Fed should continue to cautiously probe for the true level of maximum employment. That is, we shouldn’t treat a statistical estimate of the natural rate as a hard barrier that automatically signals an impending problem. Of course, we should also be mindful of the possibility that unwelcome inflationary imbalances could yet emerge. We need to keep both possibilities in mind.\nAs part of our probing for the level of maximum employment, our panelists can provide us with very useful evidence from the frontlines. Can people with skills find good jobs? Is today’s environment one in which people can add to their skills and support greater future productivity? Do small business owners and housing developers with good business plans have adequate access to capital in order to expand their operations?\nIn addition to knowing current economic conditions very well, our panelists all have a wealth of experience with varying economic conditions over the years. They’ve seen periods in which the economy has boomed, as well as times when it has gone through recession. They know the impact these cycles have on the people they serve. I hope they’ll be able to tell us whether major ups and downs in the economy make it more difficult for them to achieve their objectives. Such insights may have important implications for our choice of monetary policy strategy.\nSo I’d like to thank all of our panelists for taking the time to come here today to share their experiences and insights. I know we are going to have a very interesting afternoon.\nNow I would like to introduce Governor Michelle Bowman. Governor Bowman is one of the champions of this series of Fed Listens events. She has been traveling all over the country to listen to community leaders such as yourselves. Before I turn over the podium, I want to take the opportunity to tell you a bit about her.\nMiki Bowman took office as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on November 26, 2018. Prior to her appointment, she served as the state bank commissioner of Kansas from January 2017 to November 2018. She also served as vice president of Farmers & Drovers Bank in Kansas from 2010 to 2017.\nIn addition to her community banking experience, Miki has previous experience in Washington, DC. During the late ’90s, she worked for Senator Bob Dole of Kansas and served as a counsel to the U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight. In 2002, she became director of congressional and intergovernmental affairs at the Federal Emergency Management Agency and later served as deputy assistant secretary and policy advisor to Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge.\nFollowing her time in Washington, DC, Governor Bowman led a government and public affairs consultancy based in London before returning to Kansas in 2010. Miki received a BS in advertising and journalism from the University of Kansas and a JD from the Washburn University School of Law. Please join me in welcoming Governor Michelle Bowman.\nNotes\n1 For more on the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate, see our dual mandate webpage.\n2 Federal Open Market Committee (2012).\n3 Federal Open Market Committee (2016).\nReferences\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2016, “Statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy,” Washington, DC, as amended effective January 26, available online.\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2012, “Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement of longer-run goals and policy strategy,” press release, Washington, DC, January 25, available online.\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you for the invitation to speak to you this morning. It’s good to get out of Chicago and into the heartland. Yesterday, I met with business people from the area and heard their insights into the economy. Later this morning, I will be touring the Jump Simulation facilities to learn about their efforts to transform health care. This promises to be very interesting.\nToday, I want to discuss my outlook for the economy and the appropriate stance for monetary policy. In doing so, I will touch on some constraints on what monetary policy can achieve and the importance of risk-management considerations in formulating policy. After my formal remarks, I’m looking forward to answering your questions and, importantly, to hearing your perspectives on the economy. However, before continuing, let me remind you that my comments reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nThe Fed’s dual mandate\nTo set the stage, Congress has charged the Fed with adjusting financial conditions in order to promote 1) maximum sustainable employment and 2) stable prices for the goods and services we all purchase. These two goals are known collectively as our “dual mandate.” They are coequal, and if a conflict arises between the two, policy takes a balanced approach to achieving them both over time.\nTo judge how well we are performing on our mission, we need to be more specific about these objectives.1 First, consider employment. The maximum sustainable level of employment is largely determined by demographics, worker skills, and other such factors that are independent of monetary policy. These factors may change over time and may not be directly measurable. As a result, the FOMC cannot specify a specific goal for maximum employment. Instead, we rely on a range of indicators to gauge the overall health of the labor market. One important indicator is the unemployment rate. And one way of measuring performance on our employment mandate is to compare the unemployment rate to the rate that we would expect to see over the longer run in the absence of economic disruptions. Currently, FOMC participants’ estimates of that long-run rate are in the neighborhood of 4.2 percent.2\nIn contrast to full employment, over the long run, the inflation rate is primarily determined by monetary policy. Therefore, the Committee has the ability to specify a numerical goal for the inflation element of our dual mandate. We’ve declared it’s 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE). Furthermore, the Committee views this target as being “symmetric,” meaning it would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below 2 percent. So this is the yardstick to use when gauging our performance in meeting our inflation objective.\nThe outlook\nWith these policy goals in mind, let me now turn to the economic outlook.\nOver the past year and a half, the U.S. economy has expanded at a solid 2-1/2 percent annual rate on average. One feature over this time has been generally strong consumer expenditures. This performance should carry forward in the near term given the support of good fundamentals—namely, healthy household balance sheets; elevated consumer confidence; and, most notably, a vibrant labor market.\nAt 3-1/2 percent, the unemployment rate is at a 50-year low and obviously below the 4.2 percent benchmark I mentioned earlier. As labor markets have tightened, wage growth—which had been anemic for many years—finally picked up last year and has generally maintained a solid pace so far in 2019.\nImportantly, in the past, prosperity has often eluded those at the bottom of the income distribution. In today’s vibrant labor markets, many who had been left behind are gaining a welcome foothold into the job market—some for the first time. Some are benefiting from increased on-the-job training or other programs employers have instituted to meet their workforce needs in a tight market. Recent research provides evidence that the strong economy has improved the labor market outcomes for disadvantaged groups during this expansion, including boosting real wage growth for less educated workers to rates near those of their college-educated peers.3\nIn contrast to the consumer sector and the labor market, the business sector has seen some unfavorable changes. After posting robust gains in 2017 and much of 2018, business fixed investment has lost considerable momentum. Manufacturing output has declined, and business sentiment has faltered.\nSome of this softness is a consequence of weaker foreign demand for U.S. products, as growth in a number of advanced and emerging economies has slowed over the past year and a half.4 Furthermore, higher tariffs, the ebb and flow of trade tensions, heightened geopolitical risks, and concerns over an even more pronounced and prolonged slowdown abroad have introduced a good deal of uncertainty into business decision-making.5\nA natural reaction to this uncertainty is to pull back on expansion plans. An increasing number of my business contacts—particularly those in manufacturing or ones with a large international footprint—are telling me about delayed or canceled investment projects, and a few have mentioned downsizing workforce plans. And, of course, tariffs and other possible trade disruptions pose a threat to supply chains and business relationships, prompting some firms to reevaluate these elements of their business models.\nPutting together all of these developments, I expect the U.S. economy to grow a touch above 2 percent this year, as continued strength in consumer spending offsets weakness in business outlays and net exports. Growth is clearly slowing: In 2018, economic activity expanded 2-1/2 percent, and the year before it rose 2-3/4 percent. But 2 percent is not far from my staff’s estimate of the economy’s long-run potential growth rate, which is between 1-3/4 and 2 percent. So my outlook has the economy chugging along at or a bit above its long-run trend. Looking beyond this year, I expect growth to continue to run roughly in line with potential. In this environment, I anticipate the unemployment rate to remain close to its current low level for some time—and thus below that long-run benchmark of 4.2 percent.\nWhat about inflation—the other half of our dual mandate? Well, inflation had been running below our symmetric 2 percent objective throughout most of the recovery. Then, in 2018, inflation rose back to 2 percent. But this improvement proved to be relatively short-lived, as core PCE inflation subsequently slipped to 1-1/2 percent in early 2019, and only recently has recovered to 1.8 percent.6 In another unwelcome development, by some measures inflation expectations—which are a key determinant of actual inflation—have slipped further this year and today are at uncomfortably low levels.\nMy forecast looks for inflation to move up slowly and then modestly overshoot our 2 percent target a couple years down the road. Now, I have been forecasting this inflation path for some time. The same is true of the outlook for growth I just mentioned. However, I now think that achieving these outcomes will require more accommodative monetary policy than I did in the past—indeed, more accommodation than I thought necessary just this last December. This change reflects what I like to refer to as an outcome-based approach to monetary policy. This approach entails adjusting the stance of policy not according to some simple static rule, but in whatever way is necessary to achieve our mandated goals on a timely basis while effectively managing the various risks to the outlook.\nSo what has happened since last December? Well, as I just discussed, some data on economic activity came in weaker, downside risks multiplied, and inflation and inflation expectations retreated. Consequently, I now think a more accommodative stance is needed to support a roughly similar growth outlook and, importantly, to support moving inflation and inflation expectations up with greater assurance to achieve our symmetric 2 percent goal sustainably and within a reasonable time. So, I think the two 25-basis-point cuts the Fed made this year in the target range for the federal funds rate—which is our primary policy tool—were quite appropriate.\nI think policy probably is in a good place right now. All told, the growth outlook is good, and we have policy accommodation in place to support rising inflation. That said, there is some risk that the economy will have more difficulty navigating all the uncertainties out there or that unexpected downside shocks might hit. So there is an argument for more accommodation now to provide some further risk-management buffer against these potential events. I am keeping an open mind to these arguments, which I’m sure we will discuss fully at our meeting later this month. Of course, we obviously would act aggressively if actually faced with an imminent downturn.\nTurning to the expected policy path further ahead, I’d note that in September the median FOMC participant saw no additional change in the target range for the federal funds rate through the end of 2020 and one 25-basis-point increase in each of 2021 and 2022. My own assessment is pretty much in line with this median outlook.7\nLimits to what monetary policy can accomplish\nAs I’ve just described, over the course of this year I have adjusted my policy path in a way I see as most likely to yield economic outcomes consistent with our dual mandate objectives. However, beyond such adjustments, we need to acknowledge that there is a limit to what monetary policy alone can accomplish.\nMy outlook recognizes that the economy faces a number of important challenges today—difficult trade negotiations over important long-term disagreements, slowing foreign growth, and uncertainty weighing on domestic demand. These are the types of problems that monetary policy is able to address to some degree, as more accommodative financial conditions can provide an offsetting boost to weakening aggregate demand. Furthermore, inflation is below target; and as theory tells us so forcefully, in the end, it’s the monetary actions of central banks that determine the inflation rate.\nThat said, there are limits to what monetary policy can accomplish. An important reason is constraints on our capacity to cut policy rates in the event of a serious downturn. Notably, these constraints arise largely because we also face longer-term structural issues that monetary policy has little impact on, but nonetheless have important implications for central banks. Altogether, these factors point to an environment of lower trend growth and lower interest rates that is likely to persist for years. My colleagues and I have spoken in depth about these issues, so I will be brief in explaining them today.\nAn economy’s long-run growth rate is constrained by its productive capacity—it’s a speed limit of sorts; you can exceed it for brief periods, but not forever. That capacity depends on the economy’s available labor resources and on the productivity of that labor. Unfortunately, shifting demographics in the U.S. and most other advanced economies are lowering the growth in labor input: Populations are aging, and the U.S. labor force participation rate has been on a downtrend for nearly 20 years.\nAlong with slower labor force growth, we have also experienced slower growth in labor productivity. Improvements in labor quality—that is, gains in education and worker experience—are no longer adding much to productivity. Business investment has been relatively soft during this expansion, so that capital used by the workforce has increased only modestly. Likewise, despite widespread gains in technology, we’ve seen only modest growth in something economists call total factor productivity, which reflects how well we put various inputs together to produce output.\nOf course, this doesn’t mean that important innovations aren’t happening. I’m sure my tour here later today will reveal some promising advances in health care that are being developed locally.\nYet today, when my research staff does the arithmetic, they put the underlying annual trend pace of growth in labor hours at one-half percent and that for labor productivity at 1-1/4 percent. This puts the long-run sustainable growth rate for the economy as a whole at about 1-3/4 percent. By comparison, potential growth averaged roughly around 3 percent in the 20 years before the global financial crisis.\nToday’s uncertain and hostile trade climate may weigh further on this number. This is because trade fosters cross-border competition among businesses, which in turn leads to productivity enhancement and innovation. Conversely, insulation from international market forces typically reduces a business enterprise’s motivation to innovate, as it faces less competition. So trend growth could be even lower than the estimate I just cited.8\nThese long-term trends have enormous implications for standards of living. But there is little monetary policy can do about them; it can’t affect demographics and at best has a second- or third-order impact on productivity trends. Other kinds of policies can address some of these factors, such as by ensuring a well-educated workforce, but these are the responsibility of other branches of government.\nThat said, these trends influence the monetary policymaking environment a great deal. Economic theory tells us that as the potential growth rate of the economy declines, so does the equilibrium level of real interest rates; this is the rate consistent with full employment of the economy’s productive resources and is often referred to as real r*. To get to the federal funds rate that is neither contractionary nor expansionary—the so-called equilibrium federal funds rate—you need to add our 2 percent inflation target to real r*. Today, the median estimate of my colleagues on the FOMC for that rate is 2-1/2 percent. That is significantly below the median participant’s evaluation of over 4 percent just a few years ago.9 It is also below the 5 percent or so rate in the early 2000s, as estimated by some models.10\nSimply put, a lower equilibrium rate means a smaller capacity for monetary policy to counteract negative shocks to the economy. In the past, policymakers were able to provide 500 basis points of accommodation on average during an easing cycle. Today, if circumstances demand it, there is far less room to cut the federal funds rate before it reaches the neighborhood of zero—what we refer to as the effective lower bound on rates, or ELB. The FOMC would then be forced to turn to less effective tools to provide the necessary accommodation, making it more difficult to achieve our mandated policy goals. The calculus is even more challenging if we fail to meet our 2 percent inflation objective, as nominal interest rates would settle out at an even lower level. That’s why meeting our inflation objective is especially important.\nRisk management in a low-growth environment\nEarlier, I mentioned risk management as one rationale for rate cuts in the current environment.11 History has many other examples of the FOMC preemptively adjusting rates to mitigate risks.12\nWhat does risk management actually mean? It entails thinking about what could go wrong with the forecast and then judging if policy should be adjusted from the baseline one way or the other in light of the alternative scenarios. This evaluation considers whether the costs from missing our dual mandate objectives are balanced across these alternatives. If not, we may want to adjust policy as insurance against bad outcomes.\nToday, the low r* environment makes risk management a very important consideration in charting the course for monetary policy. The practical limits it imposes on the capacity to cut the federal funds rate means that downside shocks that weaken growth or inflation could be more costly than upside surprises we could more easily react to by raising rates. To avoid becoming stranded at the effective lower bound, risk management calls for proactively cutting rates in response to increased downside risks. The extra accommodation provides a buffer for the economy to absorb the bad shocks should they occur. It also is useful in communicating to the public that we are aware of the risks and are unlikely to be caught off guard should they materialize.\nBeyond the near-term risk factors I discussed earlier, the broader inflation outlook also poses an important risk-management consideration.\nThink about setting policy to return inflation to our symmetric 2 percent goal on a sustainable basis. The risks here are not symmetric. With today’s low inflation, if we apply too much accommodation, inflation will simply reach our target sooner. But if we fail to act strongly enough, we risk underlying inflation trends and inflation expectations becoming mired at low levels, making it all the more difficult to achieve our goal. This could occur, for example, if the public perceives that our 2 percent inflation goal is a ceiling, rather than the symmetric target that it is.\nIn my view, these differences mean we need to err on the side of providing aggressive enough accommodation to get inflation moving up with some momentum. After all, no one ever made a free throw without enough muscle behind it to first get the ball to the hoop. This kind of force could well result in inflation modestly overrunning 2 percent for some time. But in the current situation, this would not be a policy error. Engineering a modest overshoot of our inflation objective better guarantees that we would actually meet our inflation target in the future. Any excessive overshooting could be controlled with modest rate hikes. Moreover, tolerating inflation as high as 2-1/2 percent does not entail much of a welfare loss—especially given the lengthy undershoot we’ve permitted. This is because for me, more generally, symmetry means paying attention to both past and prospective misses from our target to ensure that inflation averages 2 percent over the long haul.\nConclusion\nIn sum, although our policy goals remain constant, our policy tactics must evolve to keep pace with economic developments. As I have for some time, I advocate following an outcome-based approach to monetary policy that aims to achieve our dual mandate goals on a timely basis while effectively managing various risks to the outlook. Over the past ten months—as the forces affecting the U.S. economy changed from tailwinds to headwinds and as we lost the inflation momentum we had seemed to build—this outcome-based approach has dictated a shift in my appropriate policy path. I see that the economy today is generally in good shape and that policy is close to the right place, but there are risks that require our diligent attention. Looking ahead, I will continue to advocate for using our best tools to achieve our dual mandate goals in a timely manner. That is the best way to achieve the job Congress has given the Federal Reserve.\nThank you.\nNotes\n1 For more on the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate, see our dual mandate webpage, available online.\n2 See Federal Open Market Committee (2019).\n3 See Petrosky-Nadeau and Valletta (2019), Aaronson et al.

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you for the invitation to speak to you this morning. Before I begin my remarks, let me remind you that my comments reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nToday, I’d like to share with you my perspective on the evolution of U.S. monetary policy over the past ten months—from a time when some further gradual rate increases seemed to be in store to one in which cuts have been made and rates are likely to remain low for some time. I also will talk about some longer-run strategic monetary policy framework issues.\nBefore I go into detail about policy, for context, let me first provide a brief summary of current macroeconomic conditions and my outlook for growth and inflation.\nOver the past year and a half, the U.S. economy has expanded at a solid 2-1/2 percent annual rate on average. One constant over this time has been strong consumer expenditures. The incoming data suggest this vitality should carry forward in the near term, reflecting healthy household balance sheets; elevated consumer confidence; and, most notably, a vibrant labor market. At 3.7 percent, the unemployment rate is near a 50-year low. Importantly, many who had been left behind are gaining a welcome foothold into the job market—some for the first time. As labor markets have tightened, wage growth—which had been anemic for many years—finally picked up last year and has maintained a solid pace so far in 2019.\nHowever, in contrast to the consumer sector, the business sector has seen some unfavorable changes. After posting robust gains last year, business fixed investment has lost considerable momentum over the past ten months. Manufacturing output has declined, and business sentiment has deteriorated.\nSome of this softness is a consequence of weaker foreign growth reducing the demand for U.S. products. Growth in a number of advanced and emerging economies has slowed over the past two years, and most analysts have revised down their forecasts for future growth.1 Furthermore, higher tariffs, the ebb and flow of trade tensions, heightened geopolitical risks, and concerns over an even more pronounced and prolonged slowdown abroad have introduced a good deal of uncertainty into business decision-making.2 A natural reaction to this uncertainty is to pull back on expansion plans. An increasing number of my business contacts—particularly those in the manufacturing sector or ones with a large international footprint—are telling me about delayed or canceled investment projects. In addition, I have heard reports of some firms downsizing workforce plans.\nPutting together all of these developments, I expect the U.S. economy to grow about 2-1/4 percent this year, as continued strength in consumer spending offsets weakness in business outlays and net exports. This is a solid number, as it exceeds my view of the economy’s long-run potential growth rate, which is slightly below 2 percent. Looking beyond this year, I expect growth to run roughly in line with potential. In this environment, I anticipate the unemployment rate to remain close to its current level for some time.\nWhat about inflation? Well, inflation in the U.S. had been running below our symmetric 2 percent objective throughout most of the recovery. Then, in 2018, inflation rose back to 2 percent. This was quite a welcome but relatively short-lived development, as inflation subsequently faltered over the first half of 2019, falling to as low as 1-1/2 percent. Currently, core PCE inflation is 1.8 percent on a 12-month basis.3 In 2018, I had been reluctant to declare victory and say that our below-target inflation worries were behind us. But undeniably, the environment at the time did seem much more favorable given the inflation improvements we had seen and an expectation that they would continue amid a solid outlook for growth. However, the disappointing inflation developments this year suggest that more work is necessary. I do project that inflation will move up and then modestly overshoot our 2 percent target over the next few years; but this requires aid from a more accommodative monetary policy path now than I thought appropriate in December.\nMy rationale for mid-cycle adjustments\nThe forecasts for economic activity and inflation in my September submission to the Fed’s quarterly Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) actually are very close to those I made at the end of 2018.4 Given all the developments in the U.S. and abroad over the past ten months, you might wonder why my projections have not changed much; indeed, you might question whether I have been paying any attention to the news!\nWell, yes, I’ve been reading the news and crunching the data. (Well, at least I’ve had my staff crunching the data.) The number one reason for this stability in my outlook is that, overall, the economic fundamentals remain solid. Most of the concerns over growth are about potential risks that could be costly, but also may never occur. That said, those risks appear somewhat more pronounced today. Furthermore, as I just noted, progress on inflation has been disappointing. Given this assessment, I have altered my view for the appropriate path for policy rates in order to support an outlook for continued solid growth and to boost inflation. In other words, the adjustments were made in order to keep my baseline forecast on a track to meet our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and symmetric 2 percent inflation. This is a policy strategy I refer to as outcome-based monetary policy.\nAs you know, my colleagues on the FOMC have made similar adjustments to their projections for the economy and the appropriate path for policy. The Committee has moved from 1) most participants in December 2018 expecting continued gradual increases in the policy rates through 2019–20 to 2) holding rates constant from January through June of this year in order to assess developments and then, ultimately, to 3) the Committee cutting rates by 50 basis points at the July and September meetings. Over this time the median path of the federal funds rate projected forward by FOMC participants went from one of gradual increases to an essentially flat funds rate through the end of next year.\nChair Powell characterized the July rate cut as a “mid-cycle adjustment” to policy—similar to the adjustments the FOMC had made in 1995 and 1998—and laid out three reasons for the policy move: to mitigate the depressing effects of international developments on U.S. growth; to manage downside risks to the economy; and to support the return of inflation to our 2 percent symmetric target.5\nTo appreciate the changes in views about appropriate policy, I need to first take you back to the end of 2018.\nAfter a series of very gradual rate increases in the previous three years, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate to the range of 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent in December 2018. I, along with most of my colleagues on the FOMC, thought at the time that it would likely be appropriate to raise policy rates another two or three times in 2019.6\nI thought this path was consistent with the sustained achievement of our dual mandate objectives of maximum employment and symmetric 2 percent inflation. Indeed, I projected that inflation would eventually overshoot 2 percent by a quarter of a percentage point or so, even with the federal funds rate target range heading to 3 to 3-1/4 percent.\nAs I weighed the incoming data at that time, two themes came into focus. First, we had the wind in our sails. The outlook for growth was good, aided in part by fiscal stimulus that some were touting as quite strong. And, as I said, I expected the inflation improvements of 2018 to continue. Recall these forecasts were made in the context of a continued, long expansion, dating back to 2009. Labor markets were vibrant, with the unemployment rate somewhat below our estimate of its long-run neutral rate.7 Consumer spending was strong. Firms had invested at healthy rates in 2018, and their optimism was high, in part because of changes in the tax code and business deregulation. Foreign growth still looked relatively good. True, financial market conditions had tightened some in the final few months of the year as investors became more concerned about the slowdown in growth abroad, trade tensions, and a prolonged government shutdown in the U.S. But the effects on the U.S. economy weren’t seen to be that large. Forecasts were for a modest deceleration in U.S. activity, with growth in 2019 to be around to 2-1/4 percent—still above the economy’s underlying trend.\nI’ve already mentioned the second theme—that the inflation outlook had improved. This development requires emphasis. After underrunning our target for what was then a nine-year recovery, core PCE inflation had risen and been close to 2 percent since February 2018. With the outlook for solid growth, a continued strong labor market, and low unemployment, there was even some potential for inflation to rise persistently above 2 percent. But this modest possibility of inflation above 2 percent needed to be balanced against the fact that inflation expectations were still too low relative to target and past experiences in which expected increases in inflation had failed to materialize. The likelihood that the inflation gains would be sustained had definitely increased, but I was still quite wary of the possibility the improvements would instead prove to be ephemeral.\nTogether, these two plotlines argued for a removal of policy accommodation, but at a pace that was unusually gradual and would eventually leave rates only in a modestly restrictive policy stance—about 50 basis points above a neutral setting. In my view, this would have been sufficient to engineer a soft landing for the economic cycle. Again, I note that this would have been a very modest tightening by historical standards, as I felt moving too aggressively would have prevented inflation expectations from firming symmetrically around 2 percent.\nWith this in mind, at the December 2018 meeting, I thought it made sense to tighten a bit further. And the FOMC did increase the range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent.\nAs we moved into the new year, some domestic and international data came in a bit softer. In addition, there were some sharp moves in equity and bond markets and an appreciation of the dollar. Apparently, financial market participants thought the risks were larger than most macroeconomic forecasters and the FOMC were thinking in December. They also may have been disappointed in Fed communications about balance sheet plans, often referred to as quantitative tightening (QT) by Fed critics. Regardless of the reasons, financial conditions tightened some in the U.S.\nWith the emergence of less uniformly strong economic data and rising risks, I agreed that it made sense from a risk-management perspective for the Committee to pause from the expected December 2018 (SEP) rate path and take more time to see how the risks would evolve before making our next policy move. Subsequently, as we went through 2019, the outlook for foreign growth weakened substantially. As I noted earlier, investment spending in the U.S. softened. And in a repeat of what has become a seemingly perennial source of frustration, inflation fell back below 2 percent. Some of the softness was due to what we thought were idiosyncratic transitory factors, which have since reversed. But, more importantly, inflation expectations appeared to slip even further below levels consistent with our goal.\nBy midyear, my assessments had changed. This takes me to my mid-cycle adjustment. I concluded that the situation called for us to cut policy rates 50 to 75 basis points below the long-run neutral rate and then leave policy on hold for a time. This was a notable change in what I judged to be appropriate policy: Within six months, I went from thinking it appropriate to eventually take policy rates 50 basis points above neutral to one where 50 basis points below neutral was in order. I think this more accommodative stance is needed to support a roughly similar growth outlook to what I had anticipated before and, importantly, to support moving inflation up with greater assurance to achieve our symmetric 2 percent goal within a reasonable time.\nLimits to what monetary policy can accomplish\nI have adjusted my policy path in a way I see as most likely to yield economic outcomes consistent with our dual mandate objectives. As I have since last fall, I see economic fundamentals as being good. But the intermediate-term path for monetary policy simply needed some modest repositioning in order to better align against possible risks. But, beyond such adjustments, we also need to acknowledge that there is a limit to what monetary policy alone can accomplish.\nMy outlook recognizes that the economy faces a number of important challenges today—difficult trade negotiations over important long-term disagreements, slowing foreign growth, and uncertainty weighing on domestic demand. These are the types of problems that monetary policy is able to address to some degree, as more accommodative financial conditions can provide an offsetting boost to weakening aggregate demand. Furthermore, inflation is below target; and as theory tells us so forcefully, in the end, it’s the monetary actions of central banks that determine the inflation rate.\nThat said, there are limits to what monetary policy can do. An important reason is constraints on our capacity to cut policy rates in the event of a serious downturn. These constraints arise because we also face longer-term structural issues that monetary policy has little impact on, but nonetheless have important implications for central banks. Altogether, these longer-term factors point to an environment of lower trend growth and lower interest rates that is likely to persist for years. My colleagues and I have spoken frequently and in depth about these issues, so I will be brief in explaining their causes.\nAn economy’s long-run growth rate is constrained by its productive capacity—it’s a speed limit of sorts; you can exceed it for brief periods, but not forever. That capacity depends on the economy’s available labor resources and on the productivity of that labor. Unfortunately, demographics in the U.S. and in most advanced economies are working to lower the growth in labor input: Populations are aging; and in the U.S., the labor force participation rate has been on a downtrend for nearly 20 years.\nAlong with slower labor force growth, the U.S. also has experienced slower growth in labor productivity. Improvements in labor quality—that is, gains in education and worker experience—are no longer adding much to productivity in the U.S. Business investment has been relatively soft during this expansion, so that capital used by the workforce has increased only modestly. Likewise, despite widespread gains in technology, we’ve seen only modest growth in total factor productivity, which reflects how well we put various inputs together to produce output.\nWhen my research staff does the growth accounting arithmetic, they expect labor hours to grow by one-half percent and labor productivity to grow by 1-1/4 percent on an annual basis. This puts the sustainable growth rate of the U.S. currently at about 1-3/4 percent.\nToday’s uncertain and hostile trade climate may weigh further on potential growth. This is because trade fosters cross-border competition among businesses, which in turn leads to productivity enhancement and innovation. Conversely, insulation from international market forces typically reduces a business enterprise’s motivation to innovate, as it faces less competition. So trend growth could be even lower than the estimate I just cited.8\nThese adverse long-term trends have enormous implications for standards of living. But there is little monetary policy can do about them; it can’t affect demographics and at best has a second- or third-order impact on productivity trends. Other kinds of policies can address some of these factors, such as by ensuring a well-educated workforce, but these are the responsibility of other branches of government.\nThat said, these trends influence the monetary policymaking environment a great deal. Economic theory tells us that as the potential growth rate of the economy declines, so does the equilibrium level of real interest rates; this is the rate consistent with full employment of the economy’s productive resources and is often referred to as real r*. To get to the federal funds rate that is neither contractionary nor expansionary—the so-called equilibrium federal funds rate—you need to add our 2 percent inflation target to real r*. Today, the median estimate of my colleagues on the FOMC for that rate is 2-1/2 percent. That is significantly below the median participant’s evaluation of over 4 percent just a few years ago.9 It is also below the 5 percent or so rate in the early 2000s, as estimated by some models.10\nSimply put, a lower equilibrium rate means a smaller capacity for monetary policy to counteract negative shocks to the economy. In the past, policymakers were able to provide 500 basis points of accommodation on average during an easing cycle. Today, if circumstances demand it, there is far less room to cut the federal funds rate before it reaches the neighborhood of zero—what we refer to as the effective lower bound on rates, or ELB. The FOMC would then be forced to turn to less effective tools to provide the necessary accommodation, making it more difficult to achieve our mandated policy goals. The calculus is even more challenging if we fail to meet our 2 percent inflation objective, as nominal interest rates would settle out at an even lower level. That’s why meeting our inflation objective is especially important.\nOpportunity to make better use of the current framework\nBecause a low r* environment presents practical limits on the capacity of traditional tools, the FOMC is in the process of evaluating alternative monetary policy frameworks that might be helpful in addressing the ELB constraint.\nI don’t want to prejudge the results of our discussions. But regardless of the outcome of the review, I think there is an opportunity to make better use of our current framework. Here I am thinking specifically about the adjective “symmetric” that describes our 2 percent inflation target. The FOMC has stated and reaffirmed annually that “the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below this objective.”11 I think there is room for us to better describe what symmetry means for the proactive operation of monetary policy.\nLet me illustrate this point with the current situation in which we have persistently underrun our inflation objective. As I noted, this may have resulted in businesses, households, and financial markets expecting inflation will underrun 2 percent for some time to come. In order to boost these expectations, we need to provide aggressive enough accommodation to get inflation moving up with some momentum. After all, no one ever made a free throw without enough muscle behind it to first get the ball to the hoop. This kind of force could well result in inflation modestly overrunning 2 percent for some time. But in the current situation, this would not be a policy error. Engineering a modest overshoot of our inflation objective better guarantees that we would actually meet our inflation target in the future. Moreover, tolerating inflation as high as 2-1/2 percent does not entail much of a welfare loss—especially given the lengthy undershoot we’ve permitted. This is because for me, more generally, symmetry means paying attention to both past and prospective misses from our target to ensure that inflation averages 2 percent over the long haul.\nIn terms of a broad monetary policy strategy, I favor a powerful, full-throated commitment to follow outcome-based monetary policies aimed at achieving maximum employment and symmetric 2 percent inflation within a reasonable time. The best tactics to achieve these outcomes may change over time. For example, at times this approach could prescribe forward guidance with thresholds that need to be met before changing rates. At other times, it could prescribe overshooting our 2 percent inflation objective with momentum. The point is to focus on our objectives—and not on the specific operational tools used to obtain them.\nImportantly, in a world where monetary policy is challenged by low equilibrium rates and elevated odds of hitting the ELB, outcome-based policy calls for a relentless focus on our symmetric 2 percent inflation objective throughout the cycle. We have to have a “do-whatever-it-takes” attitude toward policy all the time—in a downturn, when we are constrained by the effective lower bound, as well as in an expansion, if inflation remains stubbornly below our objective.\nI recognize and accept that monetary policy will never be a panacea to all the negative shocks hitting the economy. But when it comes to price stability, the monetary authority has the sole responsibility for achieving an inflation objective. For us, that is symmetric 2 percent inflation.\nConclusion\nTo summarize, as I have for some time, I advocate for an outcome-based approach to monetary policy that would achieve our dual mandate goals on a timely basis while effectively managing various risks. Over the past ten months—as the forces affecting the U.S. economy changed from tailwinds to headwinds and as we lost the inflation momentum we had seemed to build—this outcome-based approach has dictated a shift in my appropriate policy path. Looking ahead, no matter which framework the FOMC adopts, I will continue to advocate for using all the available and best tools to achieve our dual mandate goals.\nNotes\n1 For instance, since late 2018, the International Monetary Fund has reduced its forecast of world growth over the next three years by as much as 0.5 percentage points. See International Monetary Fund (2018, 2019).\n2 Indeed, uncertainty indexes based on keyword searches of news accounts—such as the economic policy uncertainty (EPU) index by Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016) and the trade policy uncertainty (TPU) index by Caldara et al. (2019)—at times reached historically high levels over the past year.\n3 While our inflation objective is stated in terms of overall inflation according to the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), core inflation—which strips out the volatile food and energy sectors—is a better gauge of sustained inflationary pressures and where inflation is headed in the future.\n4 See, for instance, Evans (2019).\n5 See Powell (2019).\n6 Federal Open Market Committee (2018).\n7 The long-run neutral rate of unemployment (or the “natural” rate of unemployment) is the unemployment rate that would prevail in an economy making full use of its productive resources without generating inflationary pressures. Consequently, it is the rate of unemployment that would predominate over the longer run in the absence of shocks to the economy.\n8 Furthermore, if there were an increase in restrictions on legal immigration and related actions on undocumented immigration, then the growth in trend labor hours would be weaker.\n9 Federal Open Market Committee (2012).\n10 See, for example, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest, report, available online.\n11 See Federal Open Market Committee (2019).\nReferences\nBaker, Scott R., Nicholas Bloom, and Steven J.

            "content": "Introduction\nGood afternoon. I’m Charlie Evans, president and CEO of the Chicago Fed. It’s my pleasure to welcome you to the Chicago Fed’s only branch. Our Detroit Branch was established in the Motor City 92 years ago. As you can tell, we are not in the original building. That is located downtown on Fort Street and still standing. I hear it is now home to a popular restaurant.\nWe are here today to discuss how North American trade affects the auto sector. It is fitting that this conference is held here as Detroit occupies a unique role in the history of this industry. For example, we’re about a five-minute drive away from the Ford Piquette Avenue Plant. Built in 1904, that plant was the original Model T factory. Detroit also occupies a special place in North American trade relations. Along our lengthy border with Canada it represents one of the key border crossings. Connecting Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, the Ambassador Bridge alone facilitates about a quarter of all trade between the U.S. and Canada.1 By the way, in this building we’re close enough to the border that on a clear day you can see Canada from here. All you have to do is look south.\nMacroeconomy and trade\nIt’s worth reminding ourselves of the role that trade plays in the overall economy and how economists think about it. Going back to Ricardo and Samuelson,2 macroeconomic analysis teaches us that the value of international trade lies in its ability to expand economic opportunities. We often talk about the benefits of trade. What do we mean by that? International trade allows countries to more fully exploit their comparative advantages. Trade fosters cross-border competition among businesses, which in turn leads to productivity enhancement and innovation. Conversely, insulation from international market forces typically reduces a business enterprise’s motivation to innovate, as it faces less competition.\nAt the Chicago Fed, we estimate that the U.S. economy’s trend growth potential currently stands at around 1-3/4 percent. Many have hoped this trend could be 3 percent or higher, but the realities of labor markets and business strategies are limiting the economy’s long-run growth potential. Our low trend growth estimate is based on demographic and productivity arithmetic: Roughly speaking, we expect labor hours to grow by one-half percent and labor productivity to grow by 1-1/4 percent on an annual basis. But if we were to see a reduced competitive environment with less productive innovation, productivity growth would be even lower. And if there were an increase in restrictions on legal immigration and related actions on undocumented immigration, then the growth in trend labor hours would be weaker as well.3 Putting all this together, trend growth in the U.S. could end up being closer to 1-1/2 percent or even lower. (And that doesn’t address how this trend growth would be shared by different income and skill groups.)\nIn addition, there’s increased uncertainty among the business community as a result of the new trade policy. When businesses are weighing whether or not to make substantial investments, uncertainty tends to slow down such decisions.4 The auto industry has been especially challenged by the uncertainty posed by actual and proposed changes in trade policy, as its production operations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico are closely linked across the three countries.\nWith so much at stake for America, these are crucial issues for all of us to be aware of.\nSpecific impacts on the auto industry\nThe North American auto industry wasn’t always as integrated as it is today. Back in 1965 the U.S. and Canada reached an industry-specific agreement that eliminated all tariffs on vehicles and parts passing between the two countries. This Auto Pact of 1965 was followed in 1989 by the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement (CUSFTA), which further liberalized trade between the two nations. Mexico began to liberalize its trade policy during the 1980s. That process culminated with Mexico entering into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the U.S. and Canada. This region-wide trade pact came into effect in 1994 and removed most of the remaining trade barriers between the three nations.\nTomorrow morning’s keynote speech will address the lessons we have learned from NAFTA—the regional trade agreement that has been in place for more than 25 years. During that time, producers of vehicles and parts have integrated their operations across North America. Last year 16.9 million light vehicles were produced in North America. And most of them were sold within the region. The integration of economic activity in the auto sector also extends to the industry’s supply chain. Parts and subassemblies typically cross international borders multiple times before they reach the vehicle assembly line. According to recent work by Alonso de Gortari, 38 percent of the value added in cars produced in Mexico (and sold in the U.S.) originates from the U.S.5\nToday 14 companies produce vehicles in North America—nearly all of them are headquartered overseas. Five of these companies started producing vehicles in the U.S. after NAFTA came into effect. Over half of them operate production plants in more than one NAFTA country, taking advantage of the fact that North America is one integrated economic region. It is fair to say that today North America is among the world’s most competitive regions for vehicle production.\nConcluding thoughts\nImportantly, the context and tenor of trade policy discussions have been changing of late. While much of the attention has been focused on our trading relationship with China, there have also been major developments in trade relationships with other nations, including Mexico and Canada. For example, a new free trade agreement was negotiated for North America last year. It currently awaits ratification by the U.S. and Canada. Mexico ratified it in June. What are some of the implications of this new agreement? According to the United States International Trade Commission, the agreement’s tighter rules of origin for auto parts and vehicles are likely to have a significant impact. But overall, the commission anticipates the agreement will have a moderately positive effect on the U.S. economy.6\nWhile competition and innovation enhance the overall welfare of trading partners, the changes they engender can create both winners and losers. This presents a challenge for economic policy. For example, while we are meeting here, negotiations for new labor contracts between the Detroit Three automakers and the UAW (United Automobile Workers) are under way. I would think that trade and its effects feature prominently in those negotiations.\nDuring the conference we will discuss how public policy can mitigate the adverse effects of trade while enhancing its benefits. The role of labor will certainly be a focus in those discussions. We’ll also get regional perspectives—for instance, we’ll hear from Congresswoman Debbie Dingell from the 12th District of Michigan and from our friends and partners in Canada.\nFinally, I would like to mention that the Dallas Fed will be hosting a complementary conference on North American trade in three weeks. That event will look more closely at U.S.–Mexico relations and address trade and immigration issues from a broad perspective.\nTo close, let me say that I am delighted so many of you are here today. I look forward to the stimulating discussions we’ll have during this conference.\nThank you.\nNotes\n1 Data from the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, “Ambassador Bridge crossing summary,” available online.\n2 David Ricardo (1772–1823) was a British economist, and Paul Samuelson (1915–2009) was an American economist. Both made major contributions in developing tools to illustrate the benefits of trade.\n3 According to a policy brief from the Committee for Economic Development of the Conference Board, “the population of native-born 18- to 64-year-old workers in the US will expand by just 0.1 percent on average from 2017 to 2027.

            "content": "Welcome to Chicago. I’m Charlie Evans, president and CEO of the Chicago Fed. We’re very happy to be hosting this important Conference on Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communication Practices and glad that you could all join us here today.\nVice Chair Clarida and his team have organized an exciting program for us. Our academic colleagues have written a great collection of papers, and I am sure the panel discussions will generate a very interesting dialogue between academics, community leaders, and policymakers. I am really looking forward to our discussions over the next two days.\nI want to acknowledge the outstanding work of everyone who has contributed to putting this conference together; this really has been an outstanding team effort. I only have time this morning to mention a few folks. I particularly want to recognize Ellen Meade at the Board of Governors for all of her hard work spearheading the conference. And here in Chicago I would like to give a special thanks to Tiffany Butler and Sarah Day for their outstanding job in handling what has been a tremendous set of logistical challenges, especially to bring the live stream to viewers everywhere.\nLike many in the audience, something that attracted me to the economics profession early on was the way economics uses critical analytical thinking to address important public policy questions.\nCentral banks around the world use economic research and analysis to inform and discipline our policymaking options. If we are smart and humble, we know we can’t produce all of the right answers; still, economists, public policy analysts, and policymakers recognize the importance of bringing our best thinking to bear in the decision-making process.\nThis conference certainly exemplifies these kinds of efforts.\nNow, it is one thing to assess the data, pour over many analyses, and make sensible decisions. But a central bank’s work is never done without explaining its actions to the public that we serve.\nClear and transparent communication of our policy goals and our decision-making rationale is important for establishing and maintaining the credibility of monetary policy.\nAs we will discuss a good deal over the next couple of days, credible commitment is a crucial ingredient for the success of any monetary policy strategy and, indeed, the linchpin for some of the alternative strategies under consideration today.\nTransparent communications also reinforce the legitimacy of an independent central bank in a democratic society. We have the obligation to inform democratically elected officials, their staffs, and the public about how we expect to achieve our policy mandates. This reinforces that the Federal Reserve is accountable for how its efforts work out. So it is quite fitting that this conference includes panels about what our employment mandate looks like in the communities that we serve. And it is appropriate that our discussions go beyond the usual headline macroeconomic analysis to also consider how monetary policy actions are transmitted through individual households and businesses to the broader economy.\nI have been at the Federal Reserve for 28 years, and I can attest to the fact that our FOMC communications have not always been crystal clear. As Chairman Alan Greenspan famously joked in 1987, “If I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said.”1\nBut the jokes aside, during his long tenure as Chairman, Alan Greenspan acknowledged the importance of explaining Federal Reserve actions, and he spoke a good deal about them in many public forums.\nSeveral important communications innovations occurred under Greenspan’s leadership. And further substantial improvements were made under the leadership of Ben Bernanke, Janet Yellen, and now Chair Jay Powell.\nA very important landmark was in January 2012, when the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) published a long-run policy strategy statement: This document formally stated our intention to pursue a balanced approach to achieving our dual mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability, where our inflation objective was explicitly defined to be 2 percent annual inflation as measured by the price index for total personal consumption expenditures.2\nOne of my most gratifying experiences as Chicago Fed president was serving with Charlie Plosser, Sarah Raskin, and Janet Yellen on the FOMC communications subcommittee that developed this strategy statement and other innovations—notably adding interest rate projections to the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).\nAnd of course, communications subcommittees after ours worked on many important improvements, such as clarifying that our inflation objective is symmetric around 2 percent.\nAs important as the strategy document and enhanced SEP are, there is more work to do. The experiences of the Fed and other central banks with the constraints on conventional monetary policy posed by the zero lower bound (ZLB)—and the reality that we now live in the world where the odds of revisiting the ZLB are all too high—require a fundamental review and reassessment of our monetary policy framework and strategy.\nThis is a challenging and exciting endeavor.\nThe papers prepared for this conference, the panel discussions, and our Fed Listens sessions throughout the United States promise to be critical and foundational elements for our FOMC discussions.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce Chair Jay Powell.\nAs you all know, following a distinguished career that spanned the private, public, and nonprofit sectors, Jay joined the Federal Reserve as a Governor in May 2012 and then became Chair in February 2018.\nInterestingly, Jay has spent one-half of his Fed career with policy rates at the effective lower bound (ELB). So he is well attuned to challenges the ELB raises for reaching our policy objectives and the paramount importance of facing this issue head on. Indeed, Jay was the driving force behind this reassessment of our monetary strategy, tools, and communications.\nOf course, Jay has not waited for the outcome of this review to take actions.

            "content": "Thank you for the introduction, and good afternoon to you all. As co-hosts with the Board of Governors for this event, I along with my colleagues at the Chicago Fed would like to extend a slightly belated welcome to everyone. As always, I must preface my remarks by saying that I am expressing my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nMy talk today will focus on the complexities of choosing to go to college. Going to college is one of the most important pathways to upward mobility—a key theme of this conference. Both extensive academic research and conventional wisdom point to the evidence that the investment in college pays off, on average.1 But I want to focus on how risks faced by students obscure important nuances in this conclusion and how these risks do not equally apply to all. I will also discuss some interventions and policies that focus on helping students better recognize and manage their risks.\nTo help diagnose the challenges for young adults as they make choices about college, let me describe four kinds of risks that they face. The first one is institution risk, or the risk of choosing the wrong school; the second, the uncertainty of being able to complete a degree; the third, uncertain earnings prospects during one’s working life following graduation; and the fourth—as if the first three were not enough—financing risk, in particular, the risk of not being able to pay back student loan debt.\nLet’s start with the first risk, that of choosing the wrong school. To make the best choices for themselves, young people considering college need accurate information about the opportunities available to them. They also need to have a good guess as to how they will pay for school. But how does one go about acquiring this information? For some, the expertise of school counselors and the experiences of friends and family provide useful guidance. For others, acquiring good information is harder. For example, research suggests that high-achieving, low-income students often do not apply to selective colleges because of a lack of information.2 Many of these students do not have information about financial aid and the costs of attending college—which research suggests acts as a deterrent to even applying to select schools.3 As another example, some students may unintentionally enroll at schools with predatory practices, high tuitions, and low-value-added degree programs that underprepare graduates for job opportunities. Students from disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to attend these schools, and I will say more about that later on.4\nThe second risk—graduation risk—refers to whether a student actually completes the degree program. Finishing college and acquiring skills are key to unlocking a degree’s earnings potential. Today, around 60 percent of students at four-year schools graduate within six years.5 A staggering 40 percent do not. There are many reasons why students may not complete their degrees. They or their family members may get sick. They may need to get a full-time job to pay for an unexpected expense. Or they may misjudge the challenges of the curriculum and decide it’s not for them after they’ve enrolled. Without graduating, students are unable to fully benefit from their investment, but still incur the cost of having gone to college.\nNext, earnings risk relates to fluctuations in labor markets that affect how much you earn once your schooling is complete. On the whole, college graduates have fared relatively well amid all the labor market changes over the past 50 years. Our economy is dynamic and will continue to be so in unpredictable ways. Most of us have heard the refrain that children entering grade school today may have a job—early in their working years—that doesn’t yet exist, possibly in an industry that doesn’t yet exist. So, should you go to college? And what should you study to prepare for this uncertain future? If today’s labor markets are a guide, then the expected average earnings gain from going to college is large, and it is even higher than for past generations.6\nThat said, there is earnings risk because post-college earnings depend on what you study, your occupation, where you work, and luck.7 And it is difficult to predict the skills and majors that employers will demand in the future. Over the course of a working life, there is the risk of switching careers and needing new training as old industries phase out and new ones emerge. And, apart from choosing the right field of study, there is the risk of graduating into a recession, which research has shown to have lasting effects on long-term earnings.8\nUnlike earnings, graduation, or institution risks, the fourth risk—financing risk—applies only to students who borrow to pay for their education. Among today’s college graduates, around half borrowed to pay for their schooling.9 Compared with other loans, student loans can be unforgiving by demanding preset payments over a fairly short repayment period. There are at least two reasons why. First, many borrowers report challenges with their loan servicers who are responsible for processing payments and for enrolling them in alternative payment plans. There have been reports that servicers may not be taking sufficient steps to help borrowers avoid default, even when there are reasonable alternatives that would allow them to repay their debt.10 Second, borrowers run greater risk of missing payments when they find themselves earning low incomes, dropping out of college, or enrolling in low-value-added degree programs. Because student loan debt is not dischargeable in bankruptcy, it becomes a drag when borrowers encounter financial distress.\nOf course, these risks interact with each other. Going to college makes it easier to pick up skills and stay employed as industries evolve and employers demand new skills. If a student does not graduate, they face the risk of worse labor market outcomes. Repaying student debt—even modest amounts—is also more burdensome.11 In fact, among borrowers who default, most owe less than $10,000.12 Borrowers attending schools with predatory practices and low-value-added programs are more likely to default relative to students at private nonprofit and public schools.13 When contemplating how these risks can compound, prospective students may question whether going to college will be worth it—that is, whether the upside potential of a college degree will outweigh the downside risks.\nI am concerned that the four risks may compound more and lead to greater downside risks for certain students. I am particularly concerned about how these risks may affect “nontraditional students.” Though I did not coin this term, let me explain that nontraditional students include first-generation college students, older students who live independently from their parents, part-time students, those from low-income and minority families, and students attending nonselective institutions, including for-profit colleges.14 They are called nontraditional students because, historically, they have not made up a large share of those going to college and taking on student debt. However, since the mid-1990s, they have become a growing share of college students and borrowers, as well as a large share of student loan defaulters.15\nNontraditional students appear to face greater downside risks than their traditional counterparts. Among the four risks I discussed, nontraditional students face high institution risk as they make up a large share of students enrolled in for-profit schools with low-value-added degree programs and predatory practices. Some of these schools aggressively advertise themselves as being a “good fit” for nontraditional students.16 Nontraditional students face more impediments to finishing college and are less likely to graduate than traditional students enrolled at four-year institutions.17 Because of their less advantaged backgrounds, nontraditional students face more limited job opportunities and greater downside earnings risks. Lastly, they face greater financing risk—they are more likely to borrow, take on larger amounts of debt, default at a higher rate, and take longer to repay their student loans.18\nAmong traditional students, managing these four risks appears to be a reasonable endeavor. These students tend to be those who graduate from four-year private nonprofit and public schools. Compared with nontraditional students, they face better odds of graduating, and once they do, they face low unemployment rates and land jobs with strong earnings, on average.19 They also have lower student loan default rates than nontraditional students despite having larger loan balances.20\nTo be effective and limit unintended consequences, interventions will need to target specific risks and take into consideration their interaction. It’s instructive in some ways to look to the past to see how students managed these risks in different times. In addition to the G.I. Bill, larger taxpayer subsidies to public universities and community colleges, lower tuition, and more on-the-job training opportunities compared with today’s levels were policies that mitigated the four risks. A common assumption is that things were better in the good old days. But there are many reasons why past policies may not be well suited to the present. Importantly, the profile of the typical college student has changed: Higher education was generally not an opportunity available to many people we today characterize as nontraditional students—or to women, for that matter.\nIn my remaining time, I’d like to look to the future and highlight some interventions occurring in our Federal Reserve District that are showing some promise. Even though my focus is on the Seventh District,21 which the Chicago Fed serves, I should recognize that similar and other interventions are occurring across the country.\nLet me start with the state of Michigan. Since 2015, the University of Michigan’s HAIL22 Scholarship has been targeting low-income, high-achieving high school students. Through personalized mailings, the university encourages such students to apply to U of M and promises them that if they’re accepted, they will receive financial aid covering four years of tuition and fees. Rigorous research based on randomized control trials finds that information about the HAIL Scholarship has helped mitigate institution risk, by steering low-income students away from less-selective four-year colleges.23 The scholarship has also largely eliminated financing risk. After additional years of follow-up, researchers will have more to say about the HAIL Scholarship’s effects on mitigating graduation and earnings risks for low-income, high-achieving students.\nCloser to home, One Million Degrees—or OMD—is a Chicago-based nonprofit supporting low-income community college students through a package of interventions. OMD works closely with the City Colleges of Chicago and offers “last-dollar” scholarships to fill the gap between financial aid and the all-in costs of college. The nonprofit also provides skill-building workshops, advising, and coaching. Early results from randomized controlled trials suggest “high-touch” interventions may nearly double the rate of degree completion.24 Future research will evaluate OMD’s effects on mitigating graduation and other risks.\nAcross the five states in our District, nonprofit and private-sector organizations are partnering with universities to provide new student loan programs. Through these pilot programs, the organizations finance a portion of a student’s college education. In some cases, the financing is obtained before a student matriculates. In other cases, organizations take on existing student loan debt once a student graduates.\nThese programs vary in how repayment is structured. Some programs are designed to allow for more flexible forbearance, loan forgiveness, and restructuring once a borrower encounters financial hardship. Others are structured as income-sharing arrangements, whereby the borrower’s post-college earnings determine the size of the borrower’s loan repayments. So a student landing a well-paying job immediately after college will repay more than a student with a less favorable job outcome. Some of these income-sharing arrangements allow for lower amounts of principal repayment for graduates with lower earnings.\nThese types of private-sector repayment programs are very new, so it will take some time before we fully understand whether they mitigate financing and other risks for students. One benefit seems to be that these programs feature innovative ways to flexibly restructure debt repayment. In contrast, the federal student loan program has been criticized by some for being bureaucratically rigid with regard to forbearance, income-driven repayment, and loan forgiveness.25 For example, critics have highlighted the complex paperwork required to apply for an income-driven repayment plan from the federal government, the lengthy and bumpy process, and the inconsistent implementation of the plan across loan servicers.26 In addition, some have criticized the income-driven repayment program for disproportionately benefiting high-balance borrowers, who tend to have high earnings, as the program forgives remaining loan balances after 25 years of capped payments.27\nHowever, I offer the following cautions about the additional risks these new repayment programs may introduce. First, unless the programs offer subsidies, students may have to pay for greater flexibility, perhaps by way of higher interest rates or financing charges. Second, these new programs may lead borrowers to prioritize loan repayment over other uses of their earnings, which may have unintended consequences for how borrowers save or use other forms of credit. Third, access to these programs may be limited to select students, such as those majoring in subjects with high earnings potential. In contrast, under the federal student loan program, a borrower’s access does not depend on the major chosen. If these new pilot programs were to grow and attract students studying subjects with high earnings potential, the federal student loan market may have destabilizing features, including challenges for nontraditional students to access credit. Lastly, as with all new loan products, limiting the scope for unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices will be important.\nI’d like to finish my remarks with some thoughts on how far these and other small-scale interventions can go to mitigate risks for students. Some of you may know that my usual day job is monitoring the performance of our nation’s economy. With over $1.5 trillion in outstanding student debt,28 knowing how to help young adults better recognize and manage their risks related to higher education is an important input into my assessment of our economy.\nMy interpretation of the research is that disadvantaged students in particular experience significant risks associated with their choice of institution, likelihood of graduating, earnings potential after college, and ability to repay student loans. So, for these students, it is not always obvious that college is an investment that pays off. And while there are some promising interventions under way to help mitigate some of these risks, further research is needed to help policymakers and practitioners determine what types of interventions may be most effective. Among the many important research questions we need to ask, the one I am particularly interested in is this: How can we make acquiring and financing higher education less risky for nontraditional students?\nI hope you enjoy the conference.

            "content": "Chicago Fed President Charles L. Evans discussed the implications of long-run economic trends for monetary policy frameworks and strategies. He was speaking to a group of central bankers and academics at the Bank of Italy. His comments reflected his own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nThe slides President Evans used during his presentation are available online.\nSynopsis of President Evans’s remarks1\nThere are two important long-term trends that are shaping the U.S. economy, as well as many other advanced economies.\nThe neutral level of real interest rates and the growth potential of many advanced economies have declined significantly in recent years. In the absence of structural changes, these trends are expected to continue well into the future.\nAt the same time, inflation in advanced countries has been underrunning the central banks’ targets.\nThese trends imply that the likelihood of nominal policy interest rates hitting the zero lower bound (ZLB) has increased significantly, potentially limiting the ability of central banks to use conventional monetary policy tools to counteract downturns in the future.\nA number of alternative monetary policy frameworks have been proposed to address this potential challenge, including nominal gross domestic product (GDP) targeting, price-level targeting, state-contingent or temporary price-level targeting, and average inflation targets. As part of the wide-ranging review of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy strategies, tools, and communications, the System will hold a conference in June at the Chicago Fed, at which some of these alternatives likely will be discussed.2\nWithout prejudging the outcome of this important review, President Evans pointed out some features common to several of the proposed alternative frameworks:\nThe alternative frameworks can require policymakers to commit to provide extraordinary accommodation not only during ZLB episodes, but also afterward. Policy prescriptions from simple rules are inadequate.\nThe policies can require a successful commitment to produce temporary—though potentially protracted—periods of above-target inflation following episodes when inflation has persistently run below target.\nA related set of issues could arise following a protracted period of overshooting a simple level or average inflation target: Policymakers would commit to pursuing tighter-than-usual policies to bring inflation down, potentially generating significant increases in unemployment.\nPresident Evans elaborated on the potential implications for inflation using an illustrative example from one alternative framework. He considered the hypothetical case of adopting a state-contingent price-level target today as proposed by Evans (2010) and Bernanke (2017).\nHe noted that, given the inflation misses since the financial crisis, the price level today is more than 4.5 percent below a 2 percent trend line starting from the cyclical peak in 2007.\nThe average inflation rate required to close the gap depends on the time horizon to close the gap—ranging from about 3.5 percent with a two-year horizon to 2.7 percent with a six-year horizon—both noticeably above the 2 percent goal most central banks have.\nPresident Evans also discussed some important questions raised by these features, such as the following:\nCan policymakers credibly commit to following through on such policies?\nHow will the central banks communicate such strategies effectively?\nWhat would the public’s reaction be to extended periods of inflation exceeding the central bank’s inflation goal? What would be the impact on inflation expectations?\nWhat are the financial stability implications associated with the alternative frameworks? Are financial markets and the regulatory environment resilient enough to limit financial stability risks that might arise?\nPresident Evans concluded with his views on general principles that should guide monetary policy strategies, irrespective of the framework.\nPolicymakers should focus on outcome-based strategies; in the U.S., that means undertaking policies that best achieve the dual mandate goals of the FOMC over the medium term.\nBecause long-run economic trends have increased the chances of returning to the ZLB, policymakers must be prepared to rely on unconventional tools, including quantitative easing and forward guidance, to provide adequate policy accommodation during some future ZLB-constrained downturns.\nGiven the necessary focus of monetary policy on the dual mandate goals, financial stability risks are best addressed using macro- and microprudential supervisory and regulatory tools that increase the resiliency of financial markets.\nCredibility is key to achieving the dual mandate goals, irrespective of the framework chosen.\nIn the current policy framework, it is important to enhance the credibility of the symmetric nature of the 2 percent inflation goal. This means a willingness to embrace inflation modestly above 2 percent 50 percent of the time and following through with policy actions and communications aimed at achieving this outcome. President Evans stated he could accept core inflation rates of 2-1/2 percent as long as there was no obvious upward momentum and the path back toward 2 percent could be well managed.\nNotes\n1 Some of President Evans’s remarks at the Bank of Italy were similar to his OMFIF City Lecture given in London last fall and his speech delivered in Stockholm, Sweden, last week (Evans, 2018, 2019).\n2 Further information about this event is available online.\nReferences\nBernanke, Ben S., 2017, “Temporary price-level targeting: An alternative framework for monetary policy,” Ben Bernanke’s Blog, Brookings Institution, October 12, available online.\nEvans, Charles L., 2019, “On risk and credibility in monetary policy,” speech at the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) and Sveriges Riksbank conference, Global Economies at the Crossroads: Growing Together While Growing Apart?, Stockholm, Sweden, May 3, available online.\nEvans, Charles L., 2018, “Monetary policy 2.0?,” speech for the OMFIF (Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum) City Lecture, London, October 3, available online.\nEvans, Charles L., 2010, “Monetary policy in a low-inflation environment: Developing a state-contingent price-level target,” speech at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s 55th Economic Conference, Revisiting Monetary Policy in a Low Inflation Environment, Boston, October 16, available online.\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

            "content": "Introduction and synopsis\nToday, I’d like to discuss my outlook for the U.S. economy and my views on risk management and credibility in monetary policy. Of course, my comments reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nLet me begin by laying out my main points.\nWe made good progress toward our dual mandate goals in 2018. Growth was strong, the unemployment rate declined further, and inflation picked up. Looking ahead, the fundamentals for growth in the U.S. remain good. If the economy performs as I expect, in 2019 we should see growth close to trend and continued healthy labor markets. However, core inflation has retreated to relatively low levels over the past three months, elevating my concerns over the outlook for inflation.\nThe outlook for the U.S. economy also faces many uncertainties and risks. Financial market developments of late last year and continued uncertainties regarding growth abroad and trade policy have cumulated to increase the downside risks to growth. Indeed, consumption and business fixed investment were quite soft in the first quarter, despite the healthy 3.2 percent growth in overall activity. Moreover, there is the distinct risk that inflation expectations are too low and will be slow to recover to levels that are consistent with our symmetric 2 percent goal.\nOf course, there could be upside surprises. One would be the absence of any additional drag on activity from the shocks I just noted. This is certainly a weak positive. Another would be a resurgence of strong momentum in consumer and business spending. On the price front, pressures on productive resources could boost inflation more than I currently expect. Any of these various crosscurrents could pull the economy in a different direction than my baseline expectations. And while the risks from the downside scenarios do not seem as pronounced as they did a couple of months ago, I still feel they loom larger than those from the upside ones.\nIn situations like today, when there is heightened uncertainty, best practices in risk management dictate taking a prudent approach to policy. As recent FOMC statements have noted, the Committee will be patient in assessing the implications of these crosscurrents for the economic outlook and will determine future adjustments to policy accordingly.1 This type of wait-and-see approach to policy when faced with heightened uncertainty is not new. As I have discussed before, the FOMC has adopted it many times in the past, and it has served the U.S. economy well.\nRisk management also is an important consideration in setting longer-term monetary policy frameworks and strategies. The FOMC currently is reviewing a number of such structural questions, ranging from the maturity structure of our balance sheet to ways for better achieving our inflation target. I will discuss how I see risk management and policy credibility factoring into these important decisions—particularly the symmetry of our inflation target.\nOutlook\nNow I will provide a few more details. Let me start with the economic outlook. Twenty eighteen was a very strong year for the U.S. economy, with growth in gross domestic product (GDP) coming in at 3.0 percent. This is significantly above the economy’s long-run potential growth rate, which my staff estimates to be a little below 2 percent. It is also significantly above both what growth had averaged over the previous eight years and what most forecasters—including me and members of this audience—were expecting at the beginning of last year.\nAlong with this growth, labor markets continued to strengthen last year, adding more than 2.6 million jobs. This vibrancy has continued, with job gains averaging 205,000 per month so far in 2019. This is significantly above trend payroll growth. And, at 3.6 percent, the unemployment rate in April was well below the 4.3 percent rate that is the median FOMC participant’s current assessment of full employment.\nWhat about inflation? After running under our 2 percent objective for almost a decade, core PCE inflation picked up to 2 percent in March 2018 and essentially remained there for the rest of the year.2 This was a very welcome change. However, since December, core consumer inflation has fallen and is now just a bit above 1-1/2 percent. Although some of this drop may be due to temporary special factors, we don’t want to be too dismissive of this development. Underlying inflation trends may be mired below 2 percent; indeed, several measures of inflation expectations remain lower than they were during times when inflation was more consistently in line with our objective. We cannot declare victory yet on our inflation mandate. I will elaborate on the long-run implications of this later.\nLooking ahead, supportive fundamentals lead me—and most other forecasters—to expect growth in 2019 to be in the neighborhood of potential. Importantly, unemployment is low and wage growth is healthy. The associated income growth and backing for consumer sentiment should generate healthy gains in household spending. Business spending should follow suit to satisfy household demand.\nThere were numerous concerns about this outlook last winter. The main reason is that a number of downside risks emerged late last year. On the international front, foreign growth in 2018 slowed from a stronger pace in 2017. And recent forecasts are for a further slowdown this year.3 There also is a concern that events such as a disorderly Brexit could have important spillovers to U.S. financial markets. U.S. trade negotiations with China and other trading partners add another layer of uncertainty.\nThese issues generated quite a bit of volatility in financial markets beginning last October. However, investors appear to be calmer today, and most financial indicators have improved noticeably. Consumer spending, housing, and business investment all were soft in the first quarter, as much of the outsized growth in GDP was due to inventories and net exports. But monthly indicators picked up as we moved through the quarter, suggesting firmer consumption and capital expenditures going forward. So, overall, the risks to growth appear less pronounced than they did in the winter.\nFor some time now, most forecasters and I have been predicting slower growth for 2019 as a whole, reflecting the combined effects of waning fiscal stimulus and removal of monetary policy accommodation. Factoring in the latest news, my current forecast is for growth to be around 2 to 2-1/4 percent this year. Now, this is actually a bit above my view of the economy’s long-run growth potential, which is 1.8 percent. So we’re not looking at bad numbers; still, the economy won’t feel like it is doing very well compared with last year’s very strong performance. In addition, with appropriate monetary policy, I expect core inflation to recover to levels consistent with our 2 percent objective over the medium term. But, as I just noted, I am uneasy about the inflation outlook.\nAll told, my forecast of the economy is generally consistent with the median projections made by my colleagues on the FOMC, which were released following our March meeting.4\nWhat about monetary policy?\nThe FOMC must always weigh crosscurrents and uncertainties. And today there are many.\nAre the developments I just described consistent with growth simply moderating from a strong 2018 to a rate closer to the economy’s sustainable potential—as in my baseline forecast? Or are they signaling a more substantial slowdown?\nWhat about inflation? What is keeping it so low despite low unemployment? And will these factors continue to influence pricing dynamics?\nAs for policy, is the federal funds rate close enough to neutral to support our goals? Or is policy exerting a different impetus to activity than we currently think?\nGiven the uncertainty over the answers to these questions, the FOMC has decided to pause and take time to assess the economic environment to see how these various issues play out. If growth runs close to or somewhat above its potential and inflation turns around with strong upward momentum, then some further rate increases may be appropriate over time to ensure that the economy settles in on its long-run sustainable growth path and that inflation runs symmetrically about our 2 percent target. In this scenario, the path for rates will depend crucially on any signals of an acceleration in core inflation. Frankly, though, given how muted inflationary pressures appear today, core PCE inflation rising to 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent is not a big concern to me at the moment. It seems unlikely, especially on a sustained basis. In contrast, if activity softens more than expected or if inflation and inflation expectations continue to run too low, then policy may have to be left on hold—or perhaps even loosened—to provide the appropriate accommodation to obtain our objectives. As we often say, policy will be data dependent.\nManaging near-term risks\nIn explaining the pause in policy at his January press conference, Chair Powell noted that given the uncertainties we face today, commonsense risk management suggests a patient, wait-and-see approach regarding future policy changes.5 FOMC communications since January have reinforced this sentiment.\nSuch a risk-management approach has served policymakers well in the past. But what do we mean by risk management? How does the current situation compare with what we have done in the past?\nThe Fed sets monetary policy seeking to achieve the dual mandate of maximum employment and symmetric 2 percent inflation, with both goals being equally important. A key baseline for thinking about policy is the path for the federal funds rate that is most likely to align future output and inflation with these policy goals.\nBut the world is an uncertain place. Unforeseen events will cause even the most carefully constructed forecast to go astray. Risk management entails thinking about what could go wrong with the forecast and then judging if policy should be adjusted from the baseline one way or the other in light of alternative scenarios. In other words, at times, we may want to adjust policy as insurance against bad outcomes.\nEconomic theory provides guidance for when risk management makes sense. One example is when policy losses are asymmetric. That is, when we find ourselves in a situation where the costs of output or inflation falling on one side of its expected path outweigh the costs of falling on the other side. Another example is when the range of possible shocks that could move the economy from its modal path is skewed. Uncertainties or asymmetries in how policy tools affect the economy can also enter the picture.\nMonetary theory tells us that the appropriate policy response to these situations depends on the details. In some cases, heightened uncertainty dictates moving cautiously—a result known as the Brainard principle.6 In other cases, policy should move away from the baseline path to reduce the odds of a miss in the more costly direction. At other times, decision theory points to situations where the best policy response is to move aggressively to preempt the potential damage that could come from a particularly adverse event.\nOf course, the prescriptions from economic theory don’t always translate cleanly into real-world policymaking. But it’s safe to say that in some form or other, risk management has often influenced the FOMC’s decisions.\nBack in 2015, I worked on a research project with three of my Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago colleagues in which we studied the minutes of FOMC meetings for clear references to risk management.7 We looked for instances when the minutes commented explicitly about adjustments to the policy path due to uncertainty over the outlook or as insurance against particular risks. We found such references in about one-third of the 128 FOMC meetings between 1993 and 2008. I would note, too, that not all of these resulted in policy being more accommodative than it otherwise would have been; about one-quarter of the occurrences seemed to be associated with tighter policy.\nLet me give you a couple of examples.\nOne is the 1997–98 period. Through much of 1997, the FOMC’s policy directive maintained a bias indicating that it was more likely to raise rates to battle inflationary pressures than it was to lower them. However, that fall, with the Asian financial crisis still unfolding, the Committee changed to a symmetric directive. While many members thought the next move was likely a tightening, to quote the December 1997 minutes, “most members agreed that the need for such a policy adjustment did not appear to be imminent, and that prevailing near-term uncertainties warranted a cautious wait-and-see policy posture.”8 Sound familiar?\nLater, in the autumn of 1998, the fallout on domestic financial conditions from the Russian default led to a downgrading of the economic outlook and an aggressive 75 basis point easing in the funds rate over a two-month period. When making the first of those cuts, the FOMC noted that easing would “provide added insurance against the risk of a further worsening in financial conditions and a related curtailment in the availability of credit to many borrowers.”9\nHow did this risk-management strategy turn out? In the end, the economy weathered the situation well. Then, productivity accelerated sharply, and by early 1999 growth was on a firm footing. Subsequently, the FOMC raised rates by a cumulative 175 basis points by May of 2000.\nThe second example is more recent. In December 2015, after nearly seven years with the federal funds rate at its effective lower bound, the economic recovery had progressed enough for the Fed to make its first rate hike. At that time, the median forecast in our Summary of Economic Projections envisioned four 25 basis point rate increases in 2016—with expectations generally for one hike each quarter.10\nHowever, early in 2016 concerns about global growth and a related tightening in financial conditions posed downside risks to the forecast. Furthermore, as noted in the March 2016 minutes, the FOMC was well aware of an important policy asymmetry.11 Namely, with rates close to their effective lower bound, there was little that conventional policy could do to offset a material weakening in the outlook. But the Fed could easily raise rates if the economy unexpectedly overheated. In many participants’ views, this policy asymmetry made it prudent to wait for additional confirmation that the recovery was on track before reducing accommodation further. Note that this is exactly how economic theory tells us policymakers should respond when faced with this asymmetric policy uncertainty.\nIn the end, in response to these shocks plus others later in the year, 2016 growth did come in weaker than FOMC participants had expected in late 2015. Policy remained on hold until December 2016, when growth and inflation appeared to have regained momentum. And you know the rest of the story from there.\nThe risk-management posture the FOMC is taking today is not unusual. It has served us well in similar situations in the past. Whether this leads to further rate hikes later this year or not will depend on how the current uncertainties are resolved. But even then, in some form or another, risk management will be a key element of our decision-making. To quote former Chair Greenspan, “The conduct of monetary policy in the United States has come to involve, at its core, crucial elements of risk management.”12\nLonger-term risks and the composition of the balance sheet\nDealing with uncertainty and managing risk can come in many forms. But it always entails studying the problem from many angles and thinking about what could go wrong. This is true not just for immediate policy questions, but also when we consider longer-term strategic issues.\nOne such strategic issue the FOMC faces today concerns the size and composition of our balance sheet in the long run. As we announced in March, the FOMC intends to end the normalization of the balance in September.13 We also agreed that in the long run we should go back to holding primarily Treasury securities in our portfolio.\nBut the FOMC still has to decide on the maturity structure of that portfolio. Today, the Fed holds more longer-term assets than it did prior to the crisis. During the crisis, when faced with the zero lower bound (ZLB) on the federal funds rate, the FOMC worked to lower long-term interest rates by purchasing long-term assets and by swapping short-term Treasuries for longer-term ones.14 The legacy of these actions is that the average duration of assets on the Fed’s balance sheet is currently about five and a half years.15 Before the crisis, it was two and a half to three years.16\nThere are many issues to ponder when selecting the final maturity structure of our portfolio. The Fed could return to the pre-crisis framework and hold securities roughly aligned with the maturity composition of Treasuries outstanding. This is sometimes referred to as holding a neutral balance sheet. Or, as some have suggested, we could move to holding an even shorter-duration portfolio than before the crisis. So we must ask what additional benefits or costs may come with the latter alternative.\nWell, if bad economic circumstances caused us to return the fed funds rate to the ZLB, a shorter duration of assets would have the benefit of allowing us to conduct a large maturity extension program (MEP) to provide additional accommodation without increasing the size of our balance sheet. So if you were concerned about expanding the size of the balance sheet through asset purchases, you might find this configuration attractive.\nBut is this a choice free of so-called unintended consequences? Here is one issue to consider. Think about the neutral federal funds rate, at which policy is neither accommodative nor restrictive. This is one definition of the famous r*. One factor determining r* is the level of long-term interest rates. All else being equal, the Fed holding shorter-maturity assets would mean more long-duration Treasury bonds in the hands of the public, higher duration risk for market participants, and higher long-term Treasury rates. In other words, on its own, a shorter-maturity Fed portfolio would generate somewhat more restrictive financial conditions and headwinds for the economy. This means the equilibrium fed funds rate associated with a shorter-maturity portfolio would have to be lower to offset the higher long-term interest rates. In turn, a lower r* means higher odds of hitting the zero lower bound; that is, we would have less scope to cut rates before reaching the ZLB.\nNow we have to ask about the magnitudes of these effects. Quantitatively, would this effect on r* be negligible? Or would adding the future capacity to swap short-term assets for longer-term ones to fight the ZLB actually lower r* sufficiently to induce meaningfully higher odds of hitting the ZLB in the first place? And if it did, would it matter? Would the extra MEP ammunition be enough to offset the reduced capacity to lower rates?\nMoreover, in this world with higher odds of hitting the ZLB, we could, paradoxically, end up using active balance sheet policies—the MEP—more frequently because we chose a balance sheet composition aimed at limiting the use of quantitative easing! Would this paradox pose any problems for the Fed?\nClearly, much work is needed to decide on the portfolio duration that will best help the Fed meet our dual mandate objectives. I am open-minded on this question. But managing the risks in this decision is of paramount importance in today’s world, where r* is significantly lower than before to start with and the ZLB is too close for comfort.\nThe risk of failing to meet our symmetric inflation target\nLet me finish by discussing the need to manage another longer-run strategic risk related to the zero lower bound. This is the risk generated by failing to meet the symmetry feature of our 2 percent inflation target.\nIt is always important for a central bank to achieve its inflation target. We are all aware of the costs of major misses on the upside. But there are important costs to downside misses as well. I am concerned about this today because over the past ten years actual inflation has consistently underrun our target. And these misses appear to have caused inflation expectations to fall below levels consistent with our 2 percent goal. A low neutral real interest rate combined with low inflation expectations means nominal interest rates are low. This increases the odds of a negative shock driving policy rates to the ZLB, where we can no longer use traditional monetary policy tools to battle low growth and disinflationary pressures.\nNext month the Chicago Fed is hosting a conference on monetary policy strategy, communications, and potential alternative frameworks.17 One objective motivating this review is to examine alternative monetary policy strategies that could generate better macroeconomic outcomes in a world in which the zero lower bound remains a more obstinate risk. This review promises to be very interesting and important. We are going to learn a lot.\nBut we already know that, theoretically, several of the alternative monetary policies under consideration—particularly price-level targeting and inflation averaging—can deliver very good macroeconomic outcomes in the presence of the zero lower bound. We also know that these theoretical results rely crucially on the public believing the monetary authority can deliver periods of above-target inflation following episodes at the ZLB—and that it will follow through on doing so.\nNow suppose during periods away from the ZLB, inflation often underruns 2 percent, and policymakers react with brutal force to any forces looking to push it above target. Inflation then would never be viewed as a symmetric goal. Instead, it would look like a ceiling the central bank never wants to breach. This presents a serious problem. Suppose the public views our objective as a ceiling. Then it also won’t believe our commitment to any policy aimed at producing above-target inflation to extricate the economy from the ZLB. Actions speak louder than words; without credibility these alternative policies are likely to fail.\nAnd what is true in theory has important counterparts in practice. Think of the most effective tools used in the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis. These were the pledges and follow-throughs by central banks to purchase assets and maintain low or even negative nominal interest rates indefinitely until the outlooks for employment and inflation improved consistently toward their goals. Staying with these tools through long and difficult periods—even when there was plenty of criticism by outside commentators—helped deliver better economic outcomes. In turn, the credibility of these tools was enhanced by their success, making them more likely to work again if they are needed in the future.\nTo succeed, perseverance is crucial. Indeed, the experience of the Bank of Japan (BOJ) presents a counterexample. In the early 2000s, the BOJ initiated aggressive expansionary monetary policies. But they pulled back on them before growth and inflation recovered. This may have damaged the credibility of their commitment to follow through on policies undertaken a decade later to fight similar problems, substantially inhibiting the effectiveness of those policies.\nGoal-oriented monetary policy is the key. Establishing a credible commitment to achieving goals is crucial for success.\nSo what about today in the U.S.? While policy has been successful in achieving our maximum employment mandate, it has been less successful with regard to our inflation objective. As I just noted, for most of the recovery, inflation has run stubbornly below our target, and inflation expectations today appear much lower than during earlier periods when inflation was running more symmetrically around 2 percent.\nTo fix this problem, I think the Fed must be willing to embrace inflation modestly above 2 percent as often as 50 percent of the time. Indeed, I would communicate mild comfort with core inflation rates of 2-1/2 percent, as long as there is no obvious upward momentum and the path back toward 2 percent can be well managed. Importantly, we should follow these words with actions and implement policies consistent with these communications.\nEstablishing this credibility today during benign times will not only achieve our current inflation goal, but also help us in the future. With trend output growth less than 2 percent, low neutral real interest rates, and a low inflation objective, the day will come when the Fed’s Chair will need to do something nonstandard to provide adequate monetary accommodation. This is true regardless of the strategic policy framework. The Chair will need to marshal all the credibility that Mario Draghi attempted in 2012 when he pledged the European Central Bank would do “whatever it takes to preserve the euro. And believe me, it will be enough.”18 If we have not established the credibility of symmetry in our inflation target today, how can we expect any new approach to be credible?\nThe review of our policy framework will involve many complicated strategic issues. It is incumbent upon us to study these carefully, considering the possible pitfalls as well as the clear benefits. Only then should we decide on the best framework that will help us achieve our congressionally mandated goals.\nNotes\n1 See, for example, Federal Open Market Committee (2019a).\n2 The FOMC’s symmetric target is measured by the annual change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE).

            "content": "Introduction and synopsis\nToday, I’d like to discuss my outlook for the U.S. economy and my views on risk management and credibility in monetary policy. Of course, my comments reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nLet me begin by laying out my main points:\nWe made good progress toward our dual mandate goals in 2018. Growth was strong, the unemployment rate declined further, and inflation picked up and is now near our 2 percent objective. Looking ahead, the fundamentals for growth in the U.S. remain good. If the economy performs as I expect, in 2019 we should see growth falling, but still being close to trend; continued healthy labor markets; and inflation consistent with our 2 percent target.\nHowever, the U.S. economy faces many uncertainties and risks. In particular, financial market developments of late last year and continued uncertainties regarding growth abroad and trade policy have cumulated to increase the downside risks. Indeed, much of the recent data on U.S. economic activity have been on the soft side.\nOf course, there also could be upside surprises. One would be the absence of any additional drag on activity from the shocks I just noted. Another would be a resurgence of momentum in consumer and business spending. On the price front, pressures on productive resources could boost inflation more than I currently expect. Any of these various crosscurrents could pull the economy in a different direction than my baseline expectations. However, at the moment, the risks from the downside scenarios loom larger than those from the upside ones.\nIn situations like today, when there is heightened uncertainty, best practices in risk management dictate taking a prudent approach to policy. As the January and March FOMC statements noted, the Committee will be patient in assessing the implications of these crosscurrents for the economic outlook and will determine future adjustments to policy accordingly.1 This type of wait-and-see approach to policy when faced with heightened uncertainty is not new. As I’ll discuss later, the FOMC has adopted it many times in the past, and it has served the U.S. economy well.\nRisk management also is an important consideration in setting longer-term monetary policy frameworks and strategies. The FOMC currently is reviewing a number of such structural questions, ranging from the maturity structure of our balance sheet to ways for better achieving our inflation target. I will also discuss how I see risk management and policy credibility—particularly the symmetry of our inflation target—factoring into these important decisions facing the Fed.\nOutlook\nLet me start with the economic outlook. Twenty eighteen was a very strong year for the U.S. economy, with growth in gross domestic product (GDP) coming in at 3.0 percent. This is significantly above the economy’s long-run potential growth rate, which my staff estimates to be a little below 2 percent. It is also significantly above both what growth had averaged over the previous eight years and what most forecasters—including me and members of this audience—were expecting at the beginning of last year.\nAlong with this growth, labor markets continued to strengthen last year, adding more than 2.6 million jobs. This vibrancy has continued, with job gains averaging 180,000 per month so far in 2019, significantly above trend payroll growth. And, at 3.8 percent, the unemployment rate in March was well below the 4.3 percent rate that most FOMC participants currently associate with full employment.\nWhat about the inflation side? After running under our 2 percent objective for almost a decade, core PCE inflation picked up to 2 percent last March and essentially remained there for the rest of the year.2 This is a very welcome change. The latest readings on core consumer inflation have been a bit softer, however. Moreover, several measures of inflation expectations remain lower than they were during times when inflation was more consistently in line with our objective. So we cannot declare victory here just yet. I will elaborate on the long-run implications of this later.\nAll in all, the economy’s performance in 2018 was about as close to bliss as a central banker can imagine. We were pretty much living our goals.\nAs I look ahead, supportive fundamentals lead me—and most other forecasters—to expect growth in 2019 to come in close to potential. Importantly, unemployment is low and wage growth is healthy. The associated income growth and backing for consumer sentiment should generate healthy gains in household spending. Business spending should follow suit to satisfy household demand.\nThat said, my outlook for growth today is somewhat less sanguine than it was last autumn. The main reason is that a number of downside risks emerged late last year. On the international front, foreign growth in 2018 slowed from a stronger pace in 2017. And recent forecasts are for a further slowdown this year.3 There also is a concern that events such as a disorderly Brexit could have important spillovers to U.S. financial markets. U.S. trade negotiations with China and other trading partners add another layer of uncertainty.\nThese issues generated quite a bit of volatility in financial markets beginning last October. Investors appear to be calmer today, and some financial indicators have improved noticeably. Still, on net, the market spasms have left us with effectively tighter overall financial conditions than we had last autumn, providing less support to real economic activity. Indeed, the latest data point to appreciably slower momentum so far this year in consumer spending, housing, and business investment.\nMoreover, since the beginning of the year, our picture of the economy has been clouded by the fact that the prolonged government shutdown has delayed many key data releases. Even today, it still is difficult to discern if the recent weak readings are a temporary pothole or a more sustained soft patch.\nFor some time now, most forecasters and I have been predicting slower growth in 2019, reflecting the combined effects of waning fiscal stimulus and removal of monetary policy accommodation. Factoring in the additional news, my current forecast is for growth to be around 1-3/4 to 2 percent this year. Last fall, I was projecting it would be about 2-1/4 percent. Now, the lower end of this range is actually in line with my view of the economy’s long-run growth potential. So we’re not looking at bad numbers; still, the economy won’t feel like it is doing very well compared with last year’s very strong performance. In addition, with appropriate monetary policy, I expect core inflation to remain consistent with our 2 percent objective in the near to medium term.\nAll told, my forecast of the economy is generally consistent with the median projections made by my colleagues on the FOMC, which were released last month.4\nWhat about monetary policy?\nThe FOMC must always weigh crosscurrents and uncertainties. And today there are many:\nAre the developments I just described consistent with growth simply moderating from a strong 2018 to a rate closer to the economy’s sustainable potential—as in my baseline forecast? Or are they signaling a more substantial slowdown?\nWhat about inflation? What is keeping it so low despite 3.8 percent unemployment? And will these factors continue to influence pricing dynamics?\nAs for policy, is the federal funds rate close enough to neutral to support our goals? Or is policy exerting a different impetus to activity than we currently think?\nGiven the uncertainty over the answers to these questions, the FOMC has decided to pause and take time to assess the economic environment to see how these various issues play out. If growth runs close to or somewhat above its potential and inflation builds momentum, then some further rate increases may be appropriate over time to ensure that the economy settles in on its long-run sustainable growth path and that inflation runs symmetrically about our 2 percent target. In this scenario, the path for rates will depend crucially on any signals of an acceleration in core inflation. Frankly, though, given how muted inflationary pressures appear today, a rise to 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent is not a big concern to me at the moment. In contrast, if activity softens more than expected or if inflation and inflation expectations run too low, then policy may have to be left on hold—or perhaps even loosened—to provide the appropriate accommodation to obtain our objectives. As we often say, policy will be data dependent.\nManaging near-term risks\nIn explaining the pause in policy at his January press conference, Chair Powell noted that given the uncertainties we face today, commonsense risk management suggests a patient, wait-and-see approach regarding future policy changes.5 FOMC communications since January have reinforced this sentiment.\nSuch a risk-management approach has served policymakers well in the past. But what do we mean by risk management? How does the current situation compare with what we have done in the past?\nThe Fed sets monetary policy seeking to achieve the dual mandate of maximum employment and symmetric 2 percent inflation, with both goals being equally important. A key baseline for thinking about policy is the path for the federal funds rate that is most likely to align future output and inflation with these policy goals.\nBut the world is an uncertain place. Unforeseen events will cause even the most carefully constructed forecast to go astray. Risk management entails thinking about what could go wrong with the forecast and then judging if policy should be adjusted from the baseline one way or the other in light of alternative scenarios. In other words, at times, we may want to adjust policy as insurance against bad outcomes.\nEconomic theory gives us insight into when risk management makes sense. One example is when policy losses are asymmetric. That is, when we find ourselves in a situation where the costs of output or inflation falling on one side of its expected path outweigh the costs of falling on the other side. Another example is when the range of possible shocks that could move the economy from its modal path is skewed. Uncertainties or asymmetries in how policy tools affect the economy can also enter the picture.\nTheory tells us that the appropriate policy response to these situations depends on the details. In some cases, heightened uncertainty dictates moving cautiously—a result known as the Brainard principle.6 In other cases, policy should tilt away from the baseline path to reduce the odds of a miss in the more costly direction. Theory also points to situations where the best policy response is to move aggressively to preempt the potential damage that could come from a particularly adverse event.\nOf course, the prescriptions from economic theory don’t always translate cleanly into real-world policymaking. But it’s safe to say that in some form or other, risk management has often influenced the FOMC’s decisions.\nBack in 2015, I worked on a research project with three of my Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago colleagues in which we studied the minutes of FOMC meetings for clear references to risk management.7 We looked for instances when the minutes commented explicitly about adjustments to the policy path due to uncertainty over the outlook or as insurance against particular risks. We found such references in about one-third of the 128 FOMC meetings between 1993 and 2008. I would note, too, that not all of these resulted in policy being more accommodative than it otherwise would have been; about one-quarter of the occurrences seemed to be associated with tighter policy.\nLet me give you a couple of examples.\nOne is the 1997–98 period. Through much of 1997, the FOMC’s policy directive maintained a bias indicating that it was more likely to raise rates to battle inflationary pressures than it was to lower them. However, that fall, with the Asian financial crisis still unfolding, the Committee changed to a symmetric directive. While many members thought the next move was likely a tightening, to quote the December 1997 minutes, “most members agreed that the need for such a policy adjustment did not appear to be imminent, and that prevailing near-term uncertainties warranted a cautious wait-and-see policy posture.”8 Sound familiar?\nLater, in the autumn of 1998, the fallout on domestic financial conditions from the Russian default led to a downgrading of the economic outlook and an aggressive 75 basis point easing in the funds rate over a two-month period. When making the first of those cuts, the FOMC noted that easing would “provide added insurance against the risk of a further worsening in financial conditions and a related curtailment in the availability of credit to many borrowers.”9\nHow did this risk-management strategy turn out? In the end, the economy weathered the situation well. Productivity accelerated sharply, and by early 1999 growth was on a firm footing. Subsequently, the FOMC raised rates by a cumulative 175 basis points by May of 2000.\nThe second example is more recent. In December 2015, after nearly seven years with the federal funds rate at its effective lower bound, the economic recovery had progressed enough for the Fed to make its first rate hike. At that time, the median forecast in our Summary of Economic Projections envisioned four 25 basis point rate increases in 2016—with expectations generally for one hike each quarter.10\nHowever, early in 2016 concerns about global growth and a related tightening in financial conditions posed downside risks to the forecast. Furthermore, as noted in the March 2016 minutes, the FOMC was well aware of an important policy asymmetry.11 Namely, with rates close to their effective lower bound, there was little conventional policy could do to offset a material weakening in the outlook. But the Fed could easily raise rates if the economy unexpectedly overheated. In many participants’ views, this policy asymmetry made it prudent to wait for additional confirmation that the recovery was on track before reducing accommodation further. Note that this is exactly how economic theory tells us policymakers should respond when faced with this asymmetric policy uncertainty.\nIn the end, in response to these shocks plus others later in the year, 2016 growth did come in weaker than FOMC participants had expected in late 2015. Policy remained on hold until December 2016, when growth and inflation appeared to have regained momentum. And you know the rest of the story from there.\nSo the risk-management posture the FOMC is taking today is not unusual. It has served us well in similar situations in the past. Whether this leads to further rate hikes later this year or not will depend on how the current uncertainties are resolved. But even then, in some form or another, risk management will be a key element of our decision-making. To quote former Chair Greenspan, “The conduct of monetary policy in the United States has come to involve, at its core, crucial elements of risk management.”12\nLonger-term risks and the composition of the balance sheet\nDealing with uncertainty and managing risk can come in many forms. But it always entails studying the problem from many angles and thinking about what could go wrong. This is true not just for immediate policy questions, but also when we consider longer-term strategic issues.\nOne such strategic issue the FOMC faces today concerns the size and composition of our balance sheet in the long run. As we announced in March, the FOMC intends to end the normalization of the balance sheet later this year.13 We also agreed that in the long run we should go back to holding primarily Treasury securities in our portfolio.\nBut the FOMC still has to decide on the maturity structure of that portfolio. Today, the Fed holds more longer-term assets than it did prior to the crisis. During the crisis, when faced with the zero lower bound on the federal funds rate (ZLB), the FOMC worked to lower long-term interest rates by purchasing long-term assets and by swapping short-term Treasuries for longer-term ones.14 The legacy of these actions is that the average duration of assets on the Fed’s balance sheet is currently about five and a half years.15 Before the crisis, it was two and a half to three years.16\nThere are many issues to ponder when selecting the final maturity structure of our portfolio. The Fed could return to the pre-crisis framework and hold securities roughly aligned with the maturity composition of Treasuries outstanding. This is sometimes referred to as holding a neutral balance sheet. Or, as some have suggested, we could move to holding an even shorter-duration portfolio than before the crisis. So we must ask what additional benefits or costs may come with the latter alternative.\nWell, if bad economic circumstances caused us to return the fed funds rate to the ZLB, a shorter duration of assets would allow us to conduct a large maturity extension program (MEP) that would provide additional accommodation without increasing the size of our balance sheet. So if you were concerned about expanding the size of the balance sheet through asset purchases, you might find this configuration attractive.\nBut is this a choice free of so-called unintended consequences? Here is one issue to consider. Think about the neutral federal funds rate at which policy is neither accommodative nor restrictive. This is one definition of the famous r*. One factor determining r* is the level of long-term interest rates. All else being equal, the Fed holding shorter-maturity assets would mean more long-duration Treasury bonds in the hands of the public, higher duration risk for market participants, and higher long-term Treasury rates. In other words, on its own, a shorter-maturity Fed portfolio would generate somewhat more restrictive financial conditions and headwinds for the economy. This means the equilibrium fed funds rate associated with a shorter-maturity portfolio would have to be lower to offset the higher long-term interest rates. In turn, a lower r* means higher odds of hitting the zero lower bound; that is, we would have less scope to cut rates before reaching the ZLB.\nNow we have to ask about the magnitudes. Quantitatively, would this effect on r* be negligible? Or would adding the future capacity to swap short-term assets for longer-term ones to fight the ZLB actually lower r* sufficiently to induce meaningfully higher odds of hitting the ZLB in the first place? And if it did, would it matter? Would the extra MEP ammunition be enough to offset the reduced capacity to lower rates?\nMoreover, in this world with higher odds of hitting the ZLB, we could, paradoxically, end up using active balance sheet policies—the MEP—more frequently because we chose a balance sheet composition aimed at limiting the use of quantitative easing! Would this paradox pose any problems for the Fed?\nClearly, much work is needed to decide on the portfolio duration that will best help the Fed meet our dual mandate objectives. I am open-minded on this question. But managing the risks in this decision is of paramount importance in today’s world, where r* is significantly lower than before to start with and the ZLB is too close for comfort.\nThe risk of failing to meet our symmetric inflation target\nLet me finish by discussing the need to manage another longer-run strategic risk related to the zero lower bound. This is the risk generated by failing to meet the symmetry feature of our 2 percent inflation target.\nIt is always important for a central bank to achieve its inflation target. We all are aware of the costs of major misses on the upside. But there are important costs to downside misses as well. I am concerned about this today because over the past ten years actual inflation has consistently underrun our target, and these misses appear to have caused inflation expectations to fall below levels consistent with our 2 percent goal. A low neutral real interest rate combined with low inflation expectations means nominal interest rates are low. This increases the odds of a negative shock driving policy rates to the ZLB, where we can no longer use traditional monetary policy tools to battle low growth and disinflationary pressures.\nThe Chicago Fed is hosting a conference in June on monetary policy strategy, communications, and potential alternative frameworks.17 One objective motivating this review is to examine alternative monetary policy strategies that could generate better macroeconomic outcomes in a world in which the zero lower bound remains a more obstinate risk. This review promises to be very interesting and important. We are going to learn a lot.\nBut we already know that, theoretically, several of the alternative monetary policies under consideration—particularly price level targeting and inflation averaging—can deliver very good macroeconomic outcomes in the presence of the zero lower bound. We also know that these theoretical results rely crucially on the public believing the monetary authority can deliver periods of above-target inflation following episodes at the ZLB—and that it will follow through on doing so.\nNow suppose during periods away from the ZLB, inflation often underruns 2 percent, and policymakers react with brutal force to any forces looking to push it above target. Inflation then would never be viewed as a symmetric goal. Instead, it would look like a ceiling the central bank never wants to breach. This presents a serious problem. If the public views our objective as a ceiling, then it also won’t believe our commitment to any policy aimed at producing above-target inflation to extricate the economy from the ZLB. Actions speak louder than words; without credibility these alternative policies will fail.\nWhat is true in theory has important counterparts in practice. Think of the most effective tools used in the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis. These were the pledges and follow-throughs by central banks to purchase assets and maintain low or even negative nominal interest rates indefinitely until the outlooks for employment and inflation improved consistently toward their goals. Staying with these tools through long and difficult periods—when there was plenty of criticism by outside commentators—helped deliver better economic outcomes. In turn, the credibility of these tools was enhanced by their success, making them more likely to work again if they are needed in the future.\nTo succeed, perseverance is crucial. Indeed, the experience of the Bank of Japan (BOJ) presents a counterexample. In the early 2000s, the BOJ initiated aggressive expansionary monetary policies, but pulled back on them before growth and inflation recovered. This may have damaged the credibility of their commitment to follow through on policies undertaken a decade later to fight similar problems, substantially inhibiting the effectiveness of those policies.\nGoal-oriented monetary policy is the key. Establishing a credible commitment to achieving goals is crucial for success.\nWhat about today in the U.S.? While policy has been successful in achieving our maximum employment mandate, it has been less successful with regard to our inflation objective. As I just noted, for most of the recovery, inflation has run stubbornly below our target, and inflation expectations today appear much lower than during earlier periods when inflation was running more symmetrically around 2 percent.\nTo fix this problem, I think the Fed must be willing to embrace inflation modestly above 2 percent 50 percent of the time. Indeed, I would communicate comfort with core inflation rates of 2-1/2 percent, as long as there is no obvious upward momentum and the path back toward 2 percent can be well managed. Importantly, we should follow these words with actions and implement policies consistent with these communications.\nEstablishing this credibility today during benign times will not only achieve our current inflation goal, but also help us in the future. With trend output growth less than 2 percent, low neutral real interest rates, and a low inflation objective, the day will come when the Fed’s Chair will need to do something nonstandard to provide adequate monetary accommodation. This is true regardless of the strategic policy framework. The Chair will need to marshal all the credibility that Mario Draghi attempted in 2012 when he pledged the European Central Bank would do “whatever it takes to preserve the euro. And believe me, it will be enough.”18 If we have not established the credibility of symmetry in our inflation target today, how can we expect any new approach to be credible?\nThe review of our policy framework will involve many complicated strategic issues. It is incumbent upon us to study these carefully, considering the possible pitfalls as well as the clear benefits. Only then should we decide on the best framework that will help us achieve our congressionally mandated goals.\nNotes\n1 See Federal Open Market Committee (2019c, 2019d).\n2 The FOMC’s symmetric target is measured by the annual change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE).

            "content": "Introduction and synopsis\nToday, I’d like to discuss my outlook for the U.S. economy and my views on risk management in monetary policy—both from a current perspective and from a longer-run one. Of course, my comments reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nLet me begin by laying out my main points.\nWe made good progress toward our dual mandate goals in 2018. Growth was strong, the unemployment rate declined further, and inflation picked up and is now near our 2 percent objective. Looking ahead, I note that the fundamentals for growth in the U.S. remain good. If the economy performs as I expect, in 2019 we should see growth falling, but still being close to trend; continued healthy labor markets; and inflation consistent with our 2 percent target.\nHowever, the U.S. economy faces many uncertainties and risks. In particular, financial market developments of late last year and continued uncertainties regarding growth abroad and trade policy have cumulated to increase the downside risks. Indeed, the recent data on U.S. economic activity generally have been softer than anticipated.\nOf course, there could be upside surprises. One would be the absence of any additional drag on activity from the shocks I just noted. Another would be a resurgence of momentum in consumer and business spending. On the price front, pressures on productive resources could boost inflation more than I currently expect. Any of these various crosscurrents could pull the economy in a different direction than my baseline expectations. However, at the moment, the risks from the downside scenarios loom larger than those from the upside ones.\nIn situations like today, when there is heightened uncertainty, best practices in risk management dictate taking a prudent approach to policy. As the January and March FOMC statements noted, the Committee will be patient in assessing the implications of these crosscurrents for the economic outlook and will determine future adjustments to policy accordingly.1\nThis type of wait-and-see approach to policy when faced with heightened uncertainty is not new. As I’ll discuss later, the FOMC has adopted it many times in the past, and it has served the U.S. economy well. Risk management also is important in setting longer-term monetary policy frameworks and strategies. The FOMC currently is reviewing such structural questions. I will also give an example of how I see risk management factoring into these important decisions facing the Fed.\nOutlook\nLet me start with the economic outlook. Twenty eighteen was a very strong year for the U.S. economy, with growth in gross domestic product (GDP) coming in at 3.1 percent. This is significantly above the economy’s long-run potential growth rate, which my staff estimates to be a little below 2 percent. It is also significantly above both what growth had averaged over the previous eight years and what most forecasters—including me—were expecting at the beginning of last year.\nAlong with this growth, labor markets continued to strengthen. Last year more than 2.6 million jobs were created. The unemployment rate declined further and was 3.8 percent in February, well below the 4.3 percent rate that most FOMC participants currently associate with full employment. The most recent jobs report was soft, but it comes on the heels of some very strong readings the previous few months.\nAnd after running under our 2 percent objective for almost a decade, inflation picked up and has been 2 percent since last March.2 This is a very welcome change. I would note, however, that several measures of inflation expectations remain lower than they were during times when inflation was more consistently in line with our objective. So we cannot declare victory here just yet.\nLooking back on 2018, I think the economy’s performance was about as close to bliss as a central banker can imagine. We were pretty much living our goals.\nAs I look ahead, supportive fundamentals lead me—and most other forecasters—to expect growth in 2019 to come in close to potential. Importantly, unemployment is low and wage growth is healthy. The associated income growth and backing for consumer sentiment should generate healthy gains in household spending. Business spending should follow suit to satisfy household demand.\nThat said, my outlook for growth today is somewhat less sanguine than it was last autumn. The main reason is that a number of downside risks emerged late last year. On the international front, foreign growth in 2018 slowed from a stronger pace in 2017. And recent forecasts are for a further slowdown this year and next.3 There also is a concern that events such as a disorderly Brexit could have important spillovers to U.S. financial markets. U.S. trade negotiations with China and other trading partners add another layer of uncertainty.\nThese issues generated quite a bit of volatility in financial markets beginning last October. Investors appear to be calmer today, and some financial indicators have improved noticeably. Still, on net, the market spasms have left us with effectively tighter overall financial conditions than we had last autumn, providing less support to real economic activity. Indeed, the latest data point to appreciably slower momentum so far this year in consumer spending, housing, and business investment.\nAnother complication is that our picture of the economy is clouded by the fact that the prolonged government shutdown has delayed many key data releases. It is difficult to discern if these weak readings are a temporary pothole or a more sustained soft patch.\nFor some time now, most forecasters and I have been predicting slower growth in 2019, reflecting the combined effects of waning fiscal stimulus and removal of monetary policy accommodation. Factoring in the additional news, my current forecast is for growth be around 1-3/4 to 2 percent this year. Last fall, I was projecting it would be about 2-1/4 percent. Now, the lower end of this range is actually in line with my view of the economy’s long-run growth potential. So we’re not looking at a bad number; still, the economy won’t feel like it is doing very well compared with last year’s very strong performance. In addition, I expect core inflation to remain consistent with our 2 percent objective in the near to medium term.\nAll told, the broad contours of my forecast of the economy are consistent with the median projections made by my colleagues on the FOMC, although I am looking for a bit softer activity this year.4\nWhat about monetary policy?\nThe FOMC must always weigh crosscurrents and uncertainties. And today there are many:\nAre the developments I just described consistent with growth simply moderating from a strong 2018 to a rate closer to the economy’s sustainable potential—as in my baseline forecast? Or are they signaling a more substantial slowdown?\nWhat about inflation? What is keeping it so low despite 3.8 percent unemployment? And will these factors continue to influence pricing dynamics?\nAs for policy, is the federal funds rate close enough to neutral to support our goals? Or is policy exerting a different impetus to activity than we currently think?\nGiven the uncertainty over the answers to these questions, the FOMC has decided to pause and take time to assess the economic environment to see how these various issues play out. If growth runs close to its potential and inflation builds momentum, then some further rate increases may be appropriate over time to ensure that the economy settles in on its long-run sustainable growth path and that inflation runs symmetrically about our 2 percent target. In this scenario, the path for rates will depend crucially on any signals of an acceleration in core inflation. Frankly, though, given how muted inflationary pressures appear today, a rise to 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent is not a big concern to me at the moment. In contrast, if activity softens more than expected or if inflation and inflation expectations run too low, then policy may have to be left on hold—or perhaps even loosened—to provide the appropriate accommodation to obtain our objectives. As we often say, policy will be data dependent.\nManaging near-term risks\nIn explaining the pause in policy at his January press conference, Chair Powell noted that given the uncertainties we face today, commonsense risk management suggests a patient, wait-and-see approach regarding future policy changes.5 FOMC communications since January have reinforced this sentiment.\nThe Chair also noted that such a risk-management approach has served policymakers well in the past. But what do we mean by risk management? How does the current situation compare with what we have done in the past?\nThe Fed sets monetary policy seeking to achieve our dual mandate of maximum employment and symmetric 2 percent inflation, with both goals being equally important. A key baseline for thinking about policy is the path for the federal funds rate that is most likely to align future output and inflation with these policy goals.\nBut the world is an uncertain place. Unforeseen events will cause even the most carefully constructed forecast to go astray. Risk management entails thinking about what could go wrong with the forecast and then judging if policy should be adjusted from the baseline one way or the other in light of alternative scenarios. In other words, at times, we may want to adjust policy as insurance against bad outcomes.\nEconomic theory gives us insight into when risk management makes sense. One example is when policy losses are asymmetric. That is, when we find ourselves in a situation where the costs of output or inflation falling on one side of its expected path outweigh the costs of falling on the other side. Another example is when the range of possible shocks that could move the economy from its modal path is skewed. Uncertainties or asymmetries in how policy tools affect the economy can also enter the picture.\nTheory tells us that the appropriate policy response to these situations depends on the details. In some cases, heightened uncertainty dictates moving cautiously—a result known as the Brainard principle.6 In other cases, policy should tilt away from the baseline path to reduce the odds of a miss in the more costly direction. Theory also points to situations where the best policy response is to move aggressively to preempt the potential damage that could come from a particularly adverse event.\nOf course, the prescriptions from economic theory don’t always translate cleanly into real-world policymaking. But it’s safe to say that in some form or other, risk management has often influenced the FOMC’s decisions.\nBack in 2015, I worked on a research project with three of my Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago colleagues in which we studied the minutes of FOMC meetings for clear references to risk management.7 We looked for instances when the minutes commented explicitly about adjustments to the policy path due to uncertainty over the outlook or as insurance against particular risks. We found such references in about one-third of the 128 FOMC meetings between 1993 and 2008. I would note, too, that not all of these resulted in policy being more accommodative than it otherwise would have been; about one-quarter of the occurrences seemed to be associated with tighter policy.\nLet me give you a couple of examples.\nOne is the 1997–98 period. Through much of 1997, the FOMC’s policy directive maintained a bias indicating that it was more likely to raise rates to battle inflationary pressures than it was to lower them. However, that fall, with the Asian financial crisis still unfolding, the Committee changed to a symmetric directive. While many members thought the next move was likely a tightening, to quote the December 1997 minutes, “most members agreed that the need for such a policy adjustment did not appear to be imminent, and that prevailing near-term uncertainties warranted a cautious wait-and-see policy posture.”8 Sound familiar?\nLater, in the autumn of 1998, the fallout on domestic financial conditions from the Russian default led to a downgrading of the economic outlook and an aggressive 75 basis point easing in the funds rate over a two-month period. When making the first of those cuts, the FOMC noted that easing would “provide added insurance against the risk of a further worsening in financial conditions and a related curtailment in the availability of credit to many borrowers.”9\nHow did this risk-management strategy turn out? In the end, the economy weathered the situation well. Productivity accelerated sharply, and by early 1999 growth was on a firm footing. Subsequently, the FOMC raised rates by a cumulative 175 basis points by May of 2000.\nThe second example is more recent. In December 2015, after nearly seven years with the federal funds rate at its effective lower bound, the economic recovery had progressed enough for the Fed to make its first rate hike. At that time, the median forecast in our Summary of Economic Projections envisioned four 25 basis point rate increases in 2016—with expectations generally for one hike each quarter.10\nHowever, early in 2016 concerns about global growth and a related tightening in financial conditions posed downside risks to the forecast. Furthermore, as noted in the March 2016 minutes, the FOMC was well aware of an important policy asymmetry.11 Namely, with rates close to their effective lower bound, there was little conventional policy could do to offset a material weakening in the outlook. But the Fed could easily raise rates if the economy unexpectedly overheated. In many participants’ views, this policy asymmetry made it prudent to wait for additional confirmation that the recovery was on track before reducing accommodation further. Note that this is exactly how economic theory tells us policymakers should respond when faced with this asymmetric policy uncertainty.\nIn the end, in response to these shocks plus others later in the year, 2016 growth did come in weaker than FOMC participants had expected in late 2015. Policy remained on hold until December 2016, when growth and inflation appeared to have regained momentum. And you know the rest of the story from there.\nSo the risk-management posture the FOMC is taking today is not unusual. It has served us well in similar situations in the past. Whether this leads to further rate hikes later this year or not will depend on how the current uncertainties are resolved. But even then, in some form or another, risk management will be a key element of our decision-making. To quote former Chair Greenspan, “The conduct of monetary policy in the United States has come to involve, at its core, crucial elements of risk management.”12\nLonger-term risks and the composition of the balance sheet\nDealing with uncertainty and managing risk can come in many forms. But it always entails studying the problem from many angles and thinking about what could go wrong. This is true not just for immediate policy questions, but also when we consider longer-term strategic issues.\nOne such strategic issue the FOMC faces today concerns the size and composition of our balance sheet in the long run. As we announced last week, the FOMC intends to end the normalization of the balance sheet later this year.13 We also agreed that in the long run we should go back to holding primarily Treasury securities in our portfolio.\nBut the FOMC still has to decide on the maturity structure of that portfolio. During the crisis, when faced with the zero lower bound on the federal funds rate (ZLB), the FOMC worked to lower long-term interest rates by purchasing long-term assets (known as quantitative easing, or QE) and through a maturity extension program (known as the MEP or “Operation Twist”). The MEP swapped short-term Treasuries for longer-term ones. The legacy of these programs is that the average duration of assets on the Fed’s balance sheet is currently about five and a half years.14 Before the crisis, it was two and a half to three years.15\nThere are many issues to ponder when selecting the final structure of the balance sheet. The Fed could return to the pre-crisis framework and hold securities roughly aligned with the maturity composition of Treasuries outstanding. This is sometimes referred to as holding a neutral balance sheet. Or, as some have suggested, we could move to holding an even shorter-duration portfolio than before the crisis. So we must ask what additional benefits or costs may come with the latter alternative.\nWell, if bad economic circumstances caused us to return the fed funds rate to the ZLB, a shorter duration of assets would allow us to conduct a large maturity extension program that would provide additional accommodation without increasing the size of our balance sheet. So if you were concerned about expanding the size of the balance sheet through QE, you might find this configuration attractive.\nBut is this a choice free of so-called unintended consequences? Here is one issue to consider: Think about the neutral federal funds rate at which policy is neither accommodative nor restrictive. This is one definition of the famous r*. One factor determining r* is the level of long-term interest rates. All else being equal, the Fed holding shorter-maturity assets would mean more long-duration Treasury bonds in the hands of the public, higher duration risk for market participants, and higher long-term Treasury rates. In other words, on its own, a shorter-maturity Fed portfolio would generate somewhat more restrictive financial conditions and headwinds for the economy. This means the equilibrium fed funds rate associated with a shorter-maturity portfolio would have to be lower to offset the higher long-term interest rates. In turn, a lower r* means higher odds of hitting the zero lower bound; that is, we would have less scope to cut rates before reaching the ZLB.\nNow we have to ask about the magnitudes. Quantitatively, would this effect on r* be negligible? Or would adding the capacity to do a big maturity extension program to fight the ZLB actually lower r* sufficiently to induce meaningfully higher odds of hitting the ZLB in the first place? And if it did, would it matter? Would the extra MEP ammunition be enough to offset the reduced capacity to lower rates?\nMoreover, in this world with higher odds of hitting the ZLB, we could, paradoxically, end up using active balance sheet policies—the MEP—more frequently because we chose a balance sheet composition aimed at limiting the use of quantitative easing! Would this paradox pose any problems for the Fed?\nClearly, much work is needed to decide on the portfolio duration that will best help the Fed meet our dual mandate objectives. I am open-minded on this question. But managing the risks in this decision is of paramount importance in today’s world, where r* is significantly lower than before to start with and the ZLB is too close for comfort.\nThis example illustrates how thinking through the implications of a seemingly simple policy question can reveal many important and complicated issues. This is true of a number of other balance sheet questions and other strategic monetary policy issues facing the Fed. It is incumbent on us to study these carefully, considering the possible pitfalls as well as the clear benefits. Only then should we make our policy decisions.\nCommentators often bemoan the unintended consequences of a particular policy decision. Risk management tells us we should do all we can to think ahead of time about what those consequences might be. If the costs are large enough relative to the benefits, we should adjust policy accordingly. This does not mean we can render policy riskless. But it does mean we should manage the important risks as best as we can. This goes for both our near-term policymaking and our longer-term policy frameworks and strategies.\nNotes\n1 See Federal Open Market Committee (2019c, 2019d).\n2 The FOMC’s symmetric target is measured by the annual change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE).\n3 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2019).\n4 Four times a year the FOMC releases its Summary of Economic Projections, which presents FOMC participants’ forecasts of key economic variables over the next three years and for the longer run.

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you, Steve, for that kind introduction. It is a pleasure to be here. I really value the opportunity to speak to groups such as yours. Obviously, it provides me with a forum to communicate my views about monetary policy. Clear communication is essential for the accountability and effectiveness of our policy decisions. But the occasion offers an additional opportunity. Your experiences and perspectives help me formulate my thinking about the economy and monetary policy. Our timely assessment of developments is critically informed by the observations of people directly involved in business, labor, and community development. Such insights are particularly important at times like today when there appear to be a number of tough-to-read crosscurrents in the economy. Therefore, I look forward with great interest to your questions and observations at the end of my remarks.\nToday, I’d like to discuss my outlook for the economy, the risks around my forecast, and how these assessments shape my thinking on monetary policy. Of course, my comments reflect my own views and not necessarily the views of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nSynopsis\nJanuary is a time when I get plenty of speaking invitations to talk about my economic outlook for the new year. Of course, just like my annual forecast that I won’t overdo it on holiday desserts, my economic predictions for 2019 come with a healthy slice of humility. With all of the developments over the past few months, this is a particularly treacherous forecasting period. One could easily end up with egg on one’s face before too long.\nWhy is that? It’s because even though the fundamentals for growth here in the U.S. are solid, there are many uncertainties and risks currently staring us in the face. There are a lot of crosscurrents to work through when making a forecast today.\nLet me begin by laying out my main points.\nTwenty eighteen was a very strong year, with gross domestic product (GDP) growth currently expected to come in at around 3 percent. This is about a percentage point above the long-run norm—or what economists call the economy’s potential rate of growth.\nSolid fundamentals lead me—and most other forecasters—to expect another good year in 2019, with growth coming in somewhat above potential. That said, this forecast has output decelerating, with growth closer to 2 percent. So, compared with 2018, this economy might not feel like it is doing very well. Nonetheless, such growth in 2019 would come with healthy gains in household and business spending, keep the unemployment rate low, and have wages rising at a decent clip.\nBeyond 2019, I see output slowing further toward its longer-run potential, which I currently see as around 1-3/4 percent. By the way, this is a quite modest pace for trend growth relative to historical standards.\nIn some other good news, the concerns we’ve had about inflation being too low have dissipated. I expect inflation to be near 2 percent this year. If fundamentals stay strong, I expect inflation to rise a little higher in 2020 and 2021, though certainly not by enough to be inconsistent with our symmetric 2 percent inflation target.\nBut clearly, there are risks surrounding my forecast. In particular, recent financial market developments and uncertainties regarding growth abroad, trade policy, and possible fiscal headwinds have cumulated to increase the downside risks. Now, there are upside risks as well. Further momentum in consumer and business spending could cause stronger growth, or pressure on productive resources could boost inflation faster than I currently expect.\nAny of these various crosscurrents could pull the economy in a different direction than my baseline expectations. So, as we move forward in this fluid environment, I will be particularly attentive to factoring the incoming information into my assessment of the economy and the balance of risks to the outlook. And it is this outlook and risk assessment that will determine my views about the appropriate monetary policy we need to follow to achieve our dual mandate objectives of price stability and maximum employment.\nGood progress toward our dual mandate goals\nLet’s now look back a bit at last year. Twenty eighteen was a strong year for the U.S. economy. With impetus from still-accommodative monetary policy and expansionary fiscal policies, the pace of economic activity picked up noticeably.\nWe’ll get the first read for the year as a whole at the end of the month; most forecasters are expecting it to come in around 3 percent. This is significantly above both what growth had averaged over the previous eight years and the economy’s long-run potential growth rate, which I estimate to be a little below 2 percent. It’s also better than what most forecasters were expecting at the beginning of last year. For example, back then I projected growth to be around 2.5 percent. So 2018 turned out to be a nice change for me, because over the past ten years, I—along with most forecasters—had often been too optimistic about how the economy would perform. It is good, for once, to miss on the upside.\nWith this growth, labor markets continued to strengthen. Last year more than 2.6 million jobs were created, and the unemployment rate declined further to an average of 3.8 percent in the fourth quarter. This is noticeably below the 4.4 percent rate that most FOMC participants currently associate with full employment. And a wide array of other labor market indicators, such as the number of discouraged workers or those working part time for economic reasons, also point to a healthy labor market.\nThe vibrant labor market and corresponding increases in household income were key factors behind strong consumer spending; the 2017 personal income tax cuts also contributed. In addition, business investment was strong last year, boosted in part by a variety of changes to the tax code.\nIn another nice change from previous years, the news on inflation also has been good. After underrunning our 2 percent target for almost a decade, underlying inflation—as measured by the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures excluding food and energy—has finally picked up and has been near our target since last March.\nSo, as I look back to the economy’s performance in 2018, I am encouraged with the progress toward our dual mandate goals.\nRecent economic crosscurrents\nAs we enter 2019, the incoming data on economic activity generally continue to be strong—witness the December jobs report. Moreover, the most recent reports from my business contacts support these data. If these were all you were looking at, you would have popped another bottle of champagne on New Year’s Eve. But, as we all know, a lot else has been going on over the past few months.\nFirst, there are a number of uncertainties on the international front. Foreign growth in 2018 slowed from a strong pace in 2017, and markets are wary of a further step-down. There also is concern that events such as a disorderly Brexit could have important spillovers to U.S. financial markets. And there is a good deal of uncertainty over U.S. trade negotiations with China and other trading partners and the prospects for larger tariffs that could impose significant costs on U.S. firms and consumers.\nSecond, the U.S. fiscal policy picture is unclear. In addition to the near-term risk of a prolonged government shutdown, there are questions about the feasibility of shaping an appropriate fiscal policy response to any future downside shocks.\nThird, financial markets have been, well, shall we say, busy. Investors seem to be concerned about these international and fiscal risks, the sustainability of corporate earnings growth in an environment with such risks, and the possibility of the Fed removing policy accommodation too aggressively. Since the beginning of October, stock prices have declined noticeably, equity market volatility has increased, corporate bond spreads—particularly for riskier firms—have widened, and the exchange value of the dollar has risen. Taken together, these amount to a tightening in financial conditions.\nThe question is this: How much will these factors impinge on U.S. growth and employment prospects, and what then should be the proper response of monetary policy?\nMy view is these are important risks to monitor carefully, and that it will be prudent to exercise cautious data dependence when setting policy. That said, a case can be made that the economy could continue to perform smartly in 2019 if appropriate economic policies are pursued. Let me explain.\nFirst of all, when looked at from a broader perspective, the current tightening in the overall level of financial market conditions may reflect a recalibration by investors as they recognize the economy is now likely decelerating toward a modest longer-run trend rate of growth. For example, the drop in equity prices comes after almost two years of fairly steady increases. Indeed, some analysts had argued that stock market valuations had gotten ahead of a reasonable outlook for earnings, and the recent declines in equity prices have brought the S&P 500 price-to-forward earnings ratio back down to around its long-run historical average.\nSimilarly, the recent increases in corporate bond spreads come from very low levels, and spreads currently are just a bit above their average over the past five years. And like equities, this change in risk pricing may be a recalibration reflecting market recognition that growth is decelerating toward a 1-3/4 percent trend. In addition, while capital markets have turned less hospitable, banks are still reporting easier terms on business loans and commercial and industrial bank lending has been rising notably.1 So, it is likely that most firms still have access to reasonably priced funding.\nOn the household side, the recent declines in stock prices have reduced household wealth some, and home price gains have moderated. But overall, household balance sheets are still in good shape. Furthermore, consumer borrowing rates have not risen to the degree that corporate rates have.\nWith regard to international issues, forecasters had become optimistic about rising foreign growth prospects last spring, and the recent growth downgrades may be more of a retracing of this prior optimism. Furthermore, even with the latest markdowns, projections are still for growth in the neighborhood of potential.\nLike I said, a case can be made for a reasonably good 2019 economic outcome.\nBut I do not want to downplay the risks too much. This is where the “egg on my face” risk may better be referenced as a high “gooey, cream-filled pie in the face” risk. Volatility could continue, and financial conditions could tighten further. Another question is how well will more fundamental valuation judgments anchor asset prices in the face of shorter-term momentum trading strategies. On the international front, some currently unforeseen shock could materialize and send foreign growth lower. Geopolitical uncertainty is relatively high, and other difficult international challenges could emerge. Or we could find that U.S. growth in 2018 was driven more by stimulative fiscal actions and monetary accommodation and less by underlying private-sector strength than we previously thought. And we have to be attentive for heightened uncertainty and caution weighing on consumers’ and businesses’ spending and investment decisions.\nTherefore, as the FOMC noted in its December policy statement, as we go forward we will be in a data-dependent mode—which means we will continually monitor global and financial developments to assess their implications for the economic outlook and the stance for policy.2\nEconomic outlook\nHaving gone over the caveats, I will now give you the specifics for my baseline projection. I expect real GDP growth to be a bit above 2 percent in 2019. With waning impetus from monetary and fiscal policies, growth should moderate a bit more and come in at about its longer-run potential in 2020.\nNow, at this point in a quite mature business cycle, growth at potential is a pretty good outcome. But, as I noted before, it might seem a little disappointing when compared with 2018’s performance. It also seems disappointing when compared with the 3.5 percent trend we experienced from the 1960s through the early 2000s. But as I, along with my FOMC colleagues, have spoken about on previous occasions, the long-run structural trends in population growth, labor market participation, and productivity all point to a lower longer-run growth potential for the U.S. economy—to something more like 2 percent or a bit below. Changing this arithmetic by much would require some significant turnarounds in demographic or technological trends, all of which are beyond the scope of monetary policy.\nGiven my outlook for growth, I expect the unemployment rate will decline toward 3-1/2 percent by the end of this year before edging up to 3-3/4 percent by the end of 2021. This is about half a percentage point below my staff’s estimate of what economists call its natural rate. This is the unemployment rate consistent with the normal churning of people in and out of jobs at a time when the workforce is fully employed.\nI haven’t mentioned inflation much, but of course, inflation developments play an important role in my data-dependence monitoring and assessment of policy risks. Those of you who have heard me in the past know that I had been concerned about the prolonged undershooting of our inflation target over the past ten years. However, with firmer inflation readings in the past year, the inflation outlook has improved.\nLooking ahead, I expect inflation to rise a bit further over the next few years. With unemployment below its long-run normal rate, we should see continuing pressure developing on productive resources in the economy, generating higher costs and higher prices.\nIndeed, we have already seen such pressures building over the past year. My business contacts almost uniformly report rising input costs and higher wages. In recent months, annualized wage gains have stepped up to about 3 percent. This is noticeably higher than the wage increases we experienced earlier in the expansion. Moreover, with strong demand for their products, more firms say they have been successful in passing higher costs on to their customers. So today the pricing environment seems much different than it did over the past few years.\nMy modal forecast is for inflation to edge up further and average a touch above 2 percent over the next three years. Now, you might ask if inflation above 2 percent is consistent with our 2 percent target. The short answer is yes. As the FOMC has stated, our target is symmetric. So, inflation running slightly above 2 percent is consistent with the symmetry of the FOMC’s goal, particularly given the prolonged undershooting we had over the previous ten years.\nThe forecast that I just outlined is what I see as the most likely path for the economy in the next three years. Of course, there are risks to this modal outlook. I’ve already discussed the downside risks to the outlook for growth. But there are some upside ones as well. Importantly, many fundamentals for consumer and business spending remain quite solid and might support faster growth than my forecast—just like they did in 2018.\nThere also are two-sided risks to my inflation forecast. On the downside, I am mindful of how my optimism in previous years for inflation rising to our 2 percent target did not bear fruit. One thing that I’m wary of now is that with the improvements in inflation in 2018 and reports about rising resource and cost pressures, I would have expected to see various proxies for inflation expectations move up more than they have. I have worried before that inflation expectations are anchored somewhat below our 2 percent objective. Recent developments in inflation expectations continue to give me pause.\nOn the upside, we are running with historically tight labor markets that in some periods in the past have been associated with greater inflationary pressures than we see today. If these old relationships from the 1970s and 1980s reassert themselves, then inflation could exceed our goal by more than I currently anticipate. Yet, the long-running undershooting of our 2 percent inflation target, along with still-low inflation expectations, tell me that a modest period of inflation running nearer to 2-1/2 percent would not be a big policy concern.\nImplications for monetary policy\nLet me conclude with my outlook for policy.\nIf the downside risks dissipate and the fundamentals continue to be strong, I expect that eventually the fed funds rate will rise a touch above its neutral level—say, up to a range between 3 and 3-1/4 percent. This range is higher than the 2-3/4 percent long-run neutral level in the median forecast of the FOMC’s December Summary of Economic Projections.3\nThat’s eventually. What about the timing? Because inflation is not showing any meaningful sign of heading above 2 percent in a way that would be inconsistent with our symmetric inflation objective, I feel we have good capacity to wait and carefully take stock of the incoming data and other developments. If they warrant meaningful adjustments to my modal outlook or the balance of risks to the economy, then I would change my views of the appropriate path of policy accordingly.\nI think developments in the first half of 2019 will be very important for making this assessment of our future monetary policy actions. Hopefully, the economic data will be more like the strong December employment report and financial market volatility will settle down. But whatever transpires, we will need to be mindful of carefully weighing the various crosscurrents and discerning the more fundamental changes in the economic and financial environment—in either direction.\nTo finish where I started, as we go forward, informal, qualitative economic intelligence and conversations with groups such as yours will be an important input to my evaluation of economic and financial developments. Real-world perspectives and experiences will help us develop the appropriate context in which to interpret the data and forecasts from our statistical models.\nI see the other direction in our communications as being just as important. As my colleagues and I reassess the outlook, the balance of risks, and the appropriate path of policy, it is incumbent on us to effectively communicate how our assessments and policy views bring us closer to achieving our dual mandate goals. The answers may not be as definitive as many would prefer, but that reflects the difficult nature of policymaking in an environment full of various economic crosscurrents like the ones we face today.\nNotes\n1 According to the results of the most recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, conducted in early October 2018, nearly 27 percent of respondents, on net, reported easing spreads of commercial and industrial loan rates over their cost of funds for large and medium-sized firms and 20 percent, on net, reported similar easing on loans to small firms.

Indeed, some analysts had argued that stock market valuations had gotten ahead of a reasonable outlook for earnings, and the recent declines in equity prices have brought the S&P 500 price-to-forward earnings ratio back down to around its long-run historical average.\nSimilarly, the recent increases in corporate bond spreads come from very low levels, and spreads currently are just a bit above their average over the past five years. And like equities, this change in risk pricing may be a recalibration reflecting market recognition that growth is decelerating toward a 1-3/4 percent trend. In addition, while capital markets have turned less hospitable, banks are still reporting easier terms on business loans and commercial and industrial bank lending has been rising notably.1 So, it is likely that most firms still have access to reasonably priced funding.\nOn the household side, the recent declines in stock prices have reduced household wealth some, and home price gains have moderated. But overall, household balance sheets are still in good shape. Furthermore, consumer borrowing rates have not risen to the degree that corporate rates have.\nWith regard to international issues, forecasters had become optimistic about rising foreign growth prospects last spring, and the recent growth downgrades may be more of a retracing of this prior optimism. Furthermore, even with the latest markdowns, projections are still for growth in the neighborhood of potential.\nLike I said, a case can be made for a reasonably good 2019 economic outcome.\nBut I do not want to downplay the risks too much. This is where the “egg on my face” risk may better be referenced as a high “gooey, cream-filled pie in the face” risk. Volatility could continue, and financial conditions could tighten further. Another question is how well will more fundamental valuation judgments anchor asset prices in the face of shorter-term momentum trading strategies. On the international front, some currently unforeseen shock could materialize and send foreign growth lower. Geopolitical uncertainty is relatively high, and other difficult international challenges could emerge. Or we could find that U.S. growth in 2018 was driven more by stimulative fiscal actions and monetary accommodation and less by underlying private-sector strength than we previously thought. And we have to be attentive for heightened uncertainty and caution weighing on consumers’ and businesses’ spending and investment decisions.\nTherefore, as the FOMC noted in its December policy statement, as we go forward we will be in a data-dependent mode—which means we will continually monitor global and financial developments to assess their implications for the economic outlook and the stance for policy.2\nEconomic outlook\nHaving gone over the caveats, I will now give you the specifics for my baseline projection. I expect real GDP growth to be a bit above 2 percent in 2019. With waning impetus from monetary and fiscal policies, growth should moderate a bit more and come in at about its longer-run potential in 2020.\nNow, at this point in a quite mature business cycle, growth at potential is a pretty good outcome. But, as I noted before, it might seem a little disappointing when compared with 2018’s performance. It also seems disappointing when compared with the 3.5 percent trend we experienced from the 1960s through the early 2000s. But as I, along with my FOMC colleagues, have spoken about on previous occasions, the long-run structural trends in population growth, labor market participation, and productivity all point to a lower longer-run growth potential for the U.S. economy—to something more like 2 percent or a bit below. Changing this arithmetic by much would require some significant turnarounds in demographic or technological trends, all of which are beyond the scope of monetary policy.\nGiven my outlook for growth, I expect the unemployment rate will decline toward 3-1/2 percent by the end of this year before edging up to 3-3/4 percent by the end of 2021. This is about half a percentage point below my staff’s estimate of what economists call its natural rate. This is the unemployment rate consistent with the normal churning of people in and out of jobs at a time when the workforce is fully employed.\nI haven’t mentioned inflation much, but of course, inflation developments play an important role in my data-dependence monitoring and assessment of policy risks. Those of you who have heard me in the past know that I had been concerned about the prolonged undershooting of our inflation target over the past ten years. However, with firmer inflation readings in the past year, the inflation outlook has improved.\nLooking ahead, I expect inflation to rise a bit further over the next few years. With unemployment below its long-run normal rate, we should see continuing pressure developing on productive resources in the economy, generating higher costs and higher prices.\nIndeed, we have already seen such pressures building over the past year. My business contacts almost uniformly report rising input costs and higher wages. In recent months, annualized wage gains have stepped up to about 3 percent. This is noticeably higher than the wage increases we experienced earlier in the expansion. Moreover, with strong demand for their products, more firms say they have been successful in passing higher costs on to their customers. So today the pricing environment seems much different than it did over the past few years.\nMy modal forecast is for inflation to edge up further and average a touch above 2 percent over the next three years. Now, you might ask if inflation above 2 percent is consistent with our 2 percent target. The short answer is yes. As the FOMC has stated, our target is symmetric. So, inflation running slightly above 2 percent is consistent with the symmetry of the FOMC’s goal, particularly given the prolonged undershooting we had over the previous ten years.\nThe forecast that I just outlined is what I see as the most likely path for the economy in the next three years. Of course, there are risks to this modal outlook. I’ve already discussed the downside risks to the outlook for growth. But there are some upside ones as well. Importantly, many fundamentals for consumer and business spending remain quite solid and might support faster growth than my forecast—just like they did in 2018.\nThere also are two-sided risks to my inflation forecast. On the downside, I am mindful of how my optimism in previous years for inflation rising to our 2 percent target did not bear fruit. One thing that I’m wary of now is that with the improvements in inflation in 2018 and reports about rising resource and cost pressures, I would have expected to see various proxies for inflation expectations move up more than they have. I have worried before that inflation expectations are anchored somewhat below our 2 percent objective. Recent developments in inflation expectations continue to give me pause.\nOn the upside, we are running with historically tight labor markets that in some periods in the past have been associated with greater inflationary pressures than we see today. If these old relationships from the 1970s and 1980s reassert themselves, then inflation could exceed our goal by more than I currently anticipate. Yet, the long-running undershooting of our 2 percent inflation target, along with still-low inflation expectations, tell me that a modest period of inflation running nearer to 2-1/2 percent would not be a big policy concern.\nImplications for monetary policy\nLet me conclude with my outlook for policy.\nIf the downside risks dissipate and the fundamentals continue to be strong, I expect that eventually the fed funds rate will rise a touch above its neutral level—say, up to a range between 3 and 3-1/4 percent. This range is higher than the 2-3/4 percent long-run neutral level in the median forecast of the FOMC’s December Summary of Economic Projections.3\nThat’s eventually. What about the timing? Because inflation is not showing any meaningful sign of heading above 2 percent in a way that would be inconsistent with our symmetric inflation objective, I feel we have good capacity to wait and carefully take stock of the incoming data and other developments. If they warrant meaningful adjustments to my modal outlook or the balance of risks to the economy, then I would change my views of the appropriate path of policy accordingly.\nI think developments in the first half of 2019 will be very important for making this assessment of our future monetary policy actions. Hopefully, the economic data will be more like the strong December employment report and financial market volatility will settle down. But whatever transpires, we will need to be mindful of carefully weighing the various crosscurrents and discerning the more fundamental changes in the economic and financial environment—in either direction.\nTo finish where I started, as we go forward, informal, qualitative economic intelligence and conversations with groups such as yours will be an important input to my evaluation of economic and financial developments. Real-world perspectives and experiences will help us develop the appropriate context in which to interpret the data and forecasts from our statistical models.\nI see the other direction in our communications as being just as important. As my colleagues and I reassess the outlook, the balance of risks, and the appropriate path of policy, it is incumbent on us to effectively communicate how our assessments and policy views bring us closer to achieving our dual mandate goals. The answers may not be as definitive as many would prefer, but that reflects the difficult nature of policymaking in an environment full of various economic crosscurrents like the ones we face today.\nNotes\n1 According to the results of the most recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, conducted in early October 2018, nearly 27 percent of respondents, on net, reported easing spreads of commercial and industrial loan rates over their cost of funds for large and medium-sized firms and 20 percent, on net, reported similar easing on loans to small firms.

            "content": "Introduction\nI want to thank the Metals Service Center Institute for inviting me to discuss my outlook for the U.S. economy at this pivotal time. My remarks today will focus on a few points.\nI'll begin with where the economy stands today. The pandemic and efforts taken to contain its spread have taken a heavy toll on the lives and livelihoods of many of our neighbors, friends, and coworkers. Though growth has resumed in recent months, we are still far from the robust economy we had prior to the pandemic. And inflation is far below our 2 percent objective, as it has been for quite some time.\nThe economic fallout across households and businesses also has been uneven. Some sectors of the economy have found ways to adjust to the pandemic, while others continue to suffer significant disruptions. Furthermore, these disparate effects are worsening some of the long-standing inequalities in our country.\nLooking ahead, a full recovery likely will take some time. The median forecast from the Federal Reserve Bank presidents and governors doesn’t see the unemployment rate returning to near pre-pandemic levels or inflation returning to 2 percent on a sustainable basis until 2023. And there certainly are many risks and uncertainties surrounding this outlook.\nFor its part, the Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time. I will conclude my remarks today by discussing recent changes the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has made to its long-run monetary policy strategy and my views on what they imply for monetary policy and the economy in the months and years ahead.\nBefore continuing, I should note that these views are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the FOMC or others in the Federal Reserve System.\nThough improving, activity and inflation remain weak, and the recovery has been uneven\nAs 2020 opened, the fundamentals for the U.S. economy were solid with unemployment at 3-1/2 percent and strong consumer spending.1 Then the Covid-19 virus hit and activity plummeted, as we and much of the rest of the world locked down in order to fight the pandemic. In April, unemployment soared to 14.7 percent, and might have actually been closer to 20 percent after certain measurement issues are taken into account. Inflation fell owing to the effects of weak demand for a range of goods and services far outstripping price increases for food and a few other products.\nToday, the economy is forging its way back, in spite of virus flare-ups and a horrific death toll of over 200,000 in the U.S. Indeed, the performance of the economy has been surprisingly more resilient than I and many other analysts would have expected under these health circumstances. Large portions of the business sector have successfully adapted to operating safely in the current environment, and individuals have taken to wearing masks and embraced social distancing in response to the outbreaks. These changes have helped us recover a modest measure of normalcy as we go about our daily lives. Still, the U.S. economy has a long way to go. The unemployment rate is just under 8 percent; about 12-1/2 million people are unemployed; and inflation is far from reaching our 2 percent goal on a sustained basis.\nSome households and firms have the benefit of working arrangements and business models that can be adapted to allow for remote work, social distancing, and safe production. Others, however, are not able—or cannot afford—to take the actions required to operate safely and successfully in the current health situation. These businesses and individuals face real disadvantages, and as a result, we see the pandemic intensifying some of the long-standing disparities in our society.\nLet me highlight some of the sectors that are doing somewhat better.\nI regularly talk with a range of business and community leaders to help get underneath the numbers and better gauge the state of the economy. A number of manufacturers have reported that they’ve successfully adapted production processes and operations to function safely. As one example, a major manufacturer told me how they now require the use of masks, provide extensive screening and testing, and follow strict medical protocols. When workers test positive and safety has been compromised, they shut down facilities for sanitization and then only allow non-exposed employees with negative tests to return once the facility is reopened. Employees view these quick responses favorably, and the practices have been important for building confidence and morale in the workforce. But the measures they’ve taken are expensive to implement.\nI’ve heard a variety of reports about other unplanned costs that the pandemic has imposed. There is increased absenteeism, due in large part to virus exposures and the difficulty workers have in finding reliable and safe childcare. And with so many schools providing remote and hybrid learning models, childcare needs are even greater. Some firms are overstaffing daily in order to keep full shifts running, often using temporary workers. And when the business case allows, many are implementing more flexible work schedules or giving additional paid leave to help employees manage their family responsibilities to children and elderly relatives.\nWhether these expenses are worthwhile ultimately depends on the strength of customer demand. Here, too, we see disparate effects of the pandemic.\nUnder the current circumstances, the auto industry has fared relatively well: Higher-income households have continued to purchase new cars, and the demand for used vehicles has been boosted by fiscal stimulus payments and the desire to avoid public transportation. In addition, the industry has successfully turned to e-commerce, socially distanced dealer operations, and used-car auction platforms.\nA pivot to e-commerce has boosted sales for many retailers—especially those who already had or were working toward an online presence. Other retailers have adapted by offering curbside pickup, limiting the number of shoppers inside establishments, and implementing enhanced cleaning protocols and social distancing rules.\nSome businesses have benefited from pandemic-induced changes in consumer spending patterns. For example, recreational vehicle sales have risen as more families avoid air travel and turn to alternative modes of transportation for vacation travel. Households are also spending more on home improvements, furniture, and electronics as time spent at home has increased. And by many measures, the housing market has surpassed recent pre-pandemic levels, bolstered by low interest rates.\nOther businesses and households have been more severely disrupted by the virus, and their climb back is much steeper. These include many service sectors, such as travel, leisure, hospitality, and those that provide close, in-person services, like hair salons. Airlines have been particularly hard hit, as passenger travel is down almost 80 percent from last June and there is no indication that lucrative business travel is returning any time soon.\nMany brick-and-mortar retailers are struggling, particularly smaller ones. Their business models may not be amenable to e-commerce and social distancing; these enterprises may not have the financial resources and scale to make the necessary operational changes; or demand for their products may have dwindled.\nEducation clearly is a sector where significant disruptions have caused hardships for students, their families, and their teachers. For children, the lost learning and socialization costs are potentially enormous. When weighing the competing needs of family health, income, schooling, and child supervision, many parents may be forced to reduce work hours or quit work altogether. Teachers also face many challenging issues.\nEducational institutions have taken costly measures to adapt. One contact at a large university explained that both in-person and remote-only education models are costly alternatives that require substantial investments and training to be successful. Providing a mix of both options—the hybrid model that many universities, as well as primary and secondary schools, are using—is the most expensive alternative of them all.\nAn additional worrisome aspect is that many of the industries hardest hit by the pandemic employ a disproportionate share of females, minorities, and younger workers. Moreover, many minority-, female-, or immigrant-owned businesses operate in these sectors. As a result, we are seeing disparate impacts on health and economic outcomes across income, racial, and ethnic groups and between small and large firms, which magnify the long-standing inequalities among these segments of our society.\nThese are grave challenges, and poor progress in reducing these inequalities will not be in the social or economic interest of the nation. I fear that the gulf is widening and not easily reversed. One poignant example came from that same higher education contact I just mentioned. Although the university’s enrollment for the fall session was better than expected, the diversity of their incoming students declined significantly. If such developments are widespread and persist, it would represent a troubling step back in the educational progress minorities have made.\nMy baseline outlook2\nI expect a full recovery will take some time, though I do have a less pessimistic forecast than I did around midyear.3 I anticipate gross domestic product (GDP) at the end of 2020 will be about 3-1/2 percent below its year-ago level, rather than the roughly 7 percent drop I projected in June. I think growth will be about 4 percent next year and trail down to around 2-1/2 percent by 2023. I see the unemployment rate ending this year at about 7-1/2 percent and falling steadily to 4 percent by the end of 2023, when it will be slightly below my estimate of longer-run unemployment. Readings on inflation are likely to be volatile for a while given the large price swings associated with the pandemic;4 cutting through those, I expect underlying inflation to pick up steadily and to reach 2 percent by the end of 2023. This forecast assumes that intermittent outbreaks of the virus will hold back a full recovery until health solutions are widely in place; my placeholder for that is the second half of 2021. It also assumes additional fiscal support is forthcoming.\nThese assumptions highlight some of the many uncertainties and risks to the outlook. The path of the virus is clearly a big unknown, especially as colder weather and the flu season arrive. So, too, is the speed with which a vaccine will become widely available and used. The public’s willingness to reengage more fully in the retail, leisure, and hospitality sectors is still unclear. There also is much to learn about the effect of schools reopening on workforce participation and productivity, as well as the long-term effectiveness of remote work in often cramped spaces not designed for it.\nA number of business cycle dynamics also are in play, such as the degree to which the destruction of business and human capital and bankruptcies might impede the recovery and how the uncertain economic environment will affect business investment and household precautionary savings. These factors also depend on the degree to which additional fiscal support may be forthcoming to help households, firms, and, importantly, state and local governments navigate through these difficult times.5\nAs I mentioned, I expect inflation to sustainably reach 2 percent by 2023. I’m thinking a little further ahead than that, though, and projecting inflation to run moderately above 2 percent for a time beyond 2023, which is the end of our official SEP forecast period. Indeed, the monetary policy assumptions underlying my forecast are designed to achieve this outcome, as I see this overshooting as necessary for inflation to average 2 percent over time and for longer-run inflation expectations to be anchored at 2 percent. So now is a good time to turn to the monetary policy outlook.\nThe outlook for monetary policy\nEarly in the crisis, as the pandemic took hold and economic activity plunged, the FOMC took swift action and reduced the federal funds rate—our main policy rate—to a range of 0 to 1/4 percent, which is as far as we can effectively reduce it when trying to stimulate the economy. Indeed, we call this the effective lower bound on the funds rate, or ELB. We also purchased large quantities of U.S. Treasury and mortgage-backed securities and, with the approval and backing of the Treasury Department, activated a number of special lending facilities to support the flow of credit to businesses, households, nonprofits, and state and local governments.\nSo what is in store for monetary policy?\nCongress has instructed the Federal Reserve to foster economic conditions that achieve both stable prices and maximum sustainable employment. These two objectives are known collectively as our dual mandate. In 2012, the FOMC first issued a statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy, which articulates how it defines and expects to achieve those objectives.6 This past August, we issued a major revision to this strategy statement.7\nTo me, the biggest reason to update our monetary policy strategy was the undeniable realization that the effective lower bound on the federal funds rate would be a persistent threat to the achievement of our dual mandate goals. As I’ve been saying for quite a while, for many reasons the long-run equilibrium funds rate is much lower now than it was in the 1980s and ’90s.8 This means even average business cycle shocks will drive policymakers to set the federal funds rate range at its lower bound.9 Once at the ELB, further reductions in the federal funds rate are not feasible, and we have to turn to other possibly less effective tools to influence the economy.\nThe research on the topic was clear and persuasive: Some new thinking about monetary policy was necessary to prevent the ELB from imparting a downward bias to inflation and impeding the achievement of our maximum employment mandate as well. Our revised statement laid out a new strategy for addressing these issues.\nOn price stability, the FOMC kept our previous inflation target of 2 percent, but we clarified its meaning and adjusted our strategy for achieving it. This was done by stating that the FOMC will seek to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time and that following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.\nOn maximum employment, the new statement emphasized that maximum employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal. It also stated that the FOMC will seek to eliminate shortfalls from maximum employment; in contrast, the old strategy sought to minimize both positive and negative deviations from maximum employment, not just shortfalls. This is an important change.\nMaximum employment means bringing as many people as possible into the labor force and creating conditions where they can find productive jobs. By using our policy tools to achieve that objective, we can help combat the growing economic divide I just discussed. Importantly, we should not be concerned with what might look like very tight labor markets as long as accommodative monetary policy is not generating unwanted inflation risks.\nOf course, this is just a strategy statement. Now that strategy must be put into action. The policy statement we issued after our September FOMC meeting did just that.10 The September statement specifies that we will maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate until we have reached our employment mandate and inflation has reached 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. This overshooting after a period of sub-2 percent inflation is straight out of the new long-run strategy. The statement also recognizes that our work on inflation is unlikely to be complete when we first begin to raise rates, and so it also indicates that we will maintain accommodative monetary conditions until our inflation averaging goal is met.\nAs for timing, the SEP includes the FOMC’s well-known dot plot, which shows FOMC participants’ individual judgments of the appropriate federal funds rate over the next three years that support their forecasts. In September, the median participant did not foresee a change in the federal funds rate through at least the end of 2023.11 At that time the SEP’s median forecast has the unemployment rate just beginning to dip below its longer-run level and inflation just reaching 2 percent. So, in order for inflation to average 2 percent over time, a period of inflation above 2 percent will be necessary after 2023. This explains my earlier comment about my forecast for inflation overshooting 2 percent beyond 2023.\nFor the sake of argument, here are a couple of simple calculations that illustrate how long it might take to achieve our 2 percent average inflation target. Forget the many years since 2008 of underrunning our 2 percent inflation target, and let’s just calculate the average beginning with the price level in the first quarter of 2020. Core PCE inflation in the SEP is projected to be 1-1/2 percent this year and then gradually rise to 2 percent in 2023.12 Suppose it hits 2-1/4 percent in 2024 and then remains there. In this scenario, average core inflation does not reach 2 percent until mid-2026. That is a long time. If inflation were a bit higher—say, 2-1/2 percent in 2024 and beyond—you can get there about a year quicker. Some, though, might view 2-1/2 percent inflation as an excessive overshoot.\nNow, we are not going to follow a strict numerical formula to determine the time of liftoff and how long to keep policy accommodative after liftoff. Still, these calculations illustrate that we likely have a lot of work ahead of us. And it’s crucial that we acknowledge the magnitude of the job up front to help lessen the temptation to back off the overshoot too early in the process. It is important for us to be “in it to win it” if we are going to achieve our mandates.\nConclusion\nTo sum up, the U.S. economy still faces significant challenges in dealing with the Covid-19 virus and the economic fallout from our actions to contain it. With significant effort, many households and businesses are having success working their way back to higher levels of activity. But many others have been less fortunate, and face a tougher road back. For its part, the Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. Our new long-run strategic policy statement lays out an important roadmap for achieving those objectives, and it’s up to us to follow through on its principles with actions in the months and years ahead.\nThank you.\nNotes\n1 Monetary policy had been repositioned, moving from a tightening cycle to being on hold because of 18 months of rising uncertainties related to difficult and erratic foreign trade negotiations and their effect on business sentiment and spending.\n2 My outlook is very similar to the projections made by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee. Four times a year the FOMC releases its Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, which presents forecasts of key economic variables over the next three years and for the longer run made by the Federal Reserve’s District bank presidents and governors—or, in shorthand, the FOMC participants. The SEP includes assessments of the appropriate monetary policy that supports these forecasts. The most recent projections were made in September and released following our scheduled FOMC meeting. See Federal Open Market Committee (2020a) for the most recent SEP.\n3 See Federal Open Market Committee (2020d) for the June 2020 SEP.\n4 In particular, year-over-year inflation readings could temporarily be above 2 percent next spring as the large drops in prices this year fall out of the annual calculations.\n5 I’ve spoken extensively about the need for additional fiscal policy support elsewhere. See Evans (2020a, 2020b).\n6 Federal Open Market Committee (2012).\n7 Federal Open Market Committee (2020c).\n8 See, for example, Evans (2016a, 2016b, 2016c, 2017, 2018, 2019). The equilibrium federal funds rate is the funds rate associated with a neutral monetary policy (policy that is neither expansionary nor contractionary).\n9 The enormous shock we received in March 2020 prompted a swift return to the ELB.\n10 Federal Open Market Committee (2020b).\n11 See Federal Open Market Committee (2020a).\n12 While our objective is stated in terms of overall inflation measured by the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), core inflation—which strips out the volatile food and energy sectors—is a better gauge of sustained inflationary pressures and where inflation is headed in the future.\nReferences\nEvans, Charles L., 2020a, “Covid-19 and the future of the U.S. economy,” speech presented virtually to the Lakeshore Chamber of Commerce, Hammond, IN, September 3, available online.\nEvans, Charles L., 2020b, “Some thoughts on the future of the U.S. economy,” speech presented virtually at the Corridor Business Journal Mid-Year Economic Review, June 24, available online.\nEvans, Charles L., 2019, “Monetary policy: Assessing crosscurrents,” speech at the Discover Financial Services Company Meeting, Riverwoods, IL, January 9, available online.\nEvans, Charles L., 2018, “Monetary policy 2.0?,” speech, Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) City Lecture, London, UK, October 3, available online.\nEvans, Charles L., 2017, “Outcome-based monetary policy,” speech prepared for the Ninth Annual Rocky Mountain Economic Summit, hosted by the Global Interdependence Center, Victor, ID, July 13, available online.\nEvans, Charles L., 2016a, “Conducting monetary policy in an evolving economy,” speech at the Australian Business Economists Luncheon, Sydney, Australia, October 11, available online.\nEvans, Charles L., 2016b, “Are low monetary policy rates the new normal?,” speech at the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance, Beijing, China, August 31, available online.\nEvans, Charles L., 2016c, “Connecting the dots on monetary policy,” speech the Wisconsin Economic Forecast Luncheon, presented by the Wisconsin Bankers Association, Madison, WI, January 7, available online.\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2020a, Summary of Economic Projections, Washington, DC, September 16, available online.\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2020b, “Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement,” press release, Washington, DC, September 16, available online.\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2020c, “Statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy,” Washington, DC, as amended effective August 27, available online.\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2020d, Summary of Economic Projections, Washington, DC, June 10, available online.\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2012, “Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement of longer-run goals and policy strategy,” press release, Washington, DC, January 25, available online.\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you very much for inviting me to offer my views on the economy and monetary policy. It’s a real honor to be the kickoff speaker at this year’s NABE (National Association for Business Economics) Annual Meeting. It’s not every day you get to be the opening act for all of the rock stars you have later in the program. I’ve got my amp all set to go up to 11. And before I get started, there is the usual disclaimer that these are my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nAs 2020 opened, the fundamentals for the U.S. economy were solid, with unemployment at 3.5 percent and strong consumer spending. Monetary policy had been repositioned, moving from a tightening cycle to being on hold because of 18 months of rising uncertainties related to difficult and erratic foreign trade negotiations and their effect on business sentiment and spending. Then the Covid-19 virus hit and activity plummeted, as we and much of the rest of the world locked down in order to fight the pandemic. Unemployment soared, and inflation fell.\nToday, the economy is forging its way back, in spite of virus flare-ups and a horrific death toll of over 200,000 in the U.S. The performance of the economy has been surprisingly more resilient than I would have expected under these health circumstances. Much can be attributed to the fact that large portions of the business sector have successfully adapted to operating safely in the current environment and that individuals have taken to wearing masks and social distancing in response to the outbreaks. Still, the U.S. economy has a long way to go. The unemployment rate is just under 8 percent; about 12-1/2 million people are unemployed; and inflation continues to be well below our 2 percent goal.\nMy forecast is very much in line with the latest Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) median.1 Now that the reopening surge is behind us and given the extent of the lost ground we need to make up, I don’t expect activity will return to its pre-pandemic level until late in 2021. My outlook has the unemployment rate moving down steadily, but it is still 2023 before it reaches 4 percent. I expect inflation to slowly improve, reaching 2 percent on a persistent basis in 2023 and then moderately overshooting 2 percent over the following few years.\nMy forecast assumes that additional federal fiscal policy actions are coming. I expect such support will play an enormously powerful role for providing adequate emergency relief until the Covid-19 health crisis is better contained. Still-struggling households and businesses need more aid, and help for state and local governments is especially important. Without adequate fiscal support before too long, I am concerned that recessionary dynamics will gain more traction and lead to a slower trajectory back to maximum employment.\nOf course, monetary policy also has an important role to play in these unusual and uncertain times. The Federal Reserve is prepared to use its full range of tools in order to support the U.S. economy’s attainment of maximum employment and inflation that averages 2 percent over time. A key element of this support will be the effective execution of the FOMC’s new long-run monetary policy framework that Chair Powell announced in August and that is articulated in the Committee’s revised “Consensus statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy.”2 The recent September FOMC statement followed through on the new strategic principles, in part by providing strong, outcome-based forward guidance about the future path for interest rates.3 These commitments reaffirm the Federal Reserve’s resolve to provide the monetary accommodation needed to achieve our policy goals in as timely a fashion as possible.\nToday I would like to discuss some of my views on the messages in our new long-run framework and the September policy statement. I also will explore how the new consensus statement might have affected what some commentators have described as the Fed’s mistaken decisions to raise rates as soon and as high as we did over the 2015–18 rate cycle. I hope to be more informative on alternative policy considerations than simply defensive, but I’ll let the listener be the judge.\nThe revised long-run strategy statement\nLet me start with a few comments about the new long-run strategy statement. This group of experts is familiar with the revised statement, so I’ll just emphasize a couple of points. To me, the biggest impetus for updating our monetary policy strategy was the undeniable realization that the effective lower bound (ELB) on the federal funds rate was not just an anomaly we stumbled into during the Great Financial Crisis, but a persistent threat to the achievement of our dual mandate goals.\nThe research here is clear. For all the well-known structural reasons, the long-run equilibrium real fed funds rate is much lower now than it was in the 1980s and ’90s. This means even average business cycle shocks will drive the funds rate to its lower bound (let alone the kind of shock we received in March).\nResearch also shows that under traditional monetary policy strategies, the proximity of the ELB will impart a downward bias to inflation and inflation expectations relative to our 2 percent target. And this bias is always present; it’s not just an occasional risk associated with a large negative shock. The ELB will also impede the achievement of our maximum employment mandate.\nThese facts imply a couple of things. First, a systematic adjustment to monetary policy strategy is needed to offset the bias. Second, at times this bias-adjustment will require generating inflation above 2 percent in order to center inflation and inflation expectations at target. I am happy to say that the new monetary policy strategy delivers on these two fundamental principles with its flexible inflation averaging goal and explicit recognition for the need, at times, for policy to purposely aim for inflation rates higher than 2 percent.\nThe new framework also emphasizes that our maximum employment mandate is a broad-based and inclusive goal and that monetary policy will seek to eliminate shortfalls from maximum employment. Recall that the old strategy sought to minimize deviations—both positive and negative—from maximum employment, not just shortfalls.\nThis was an important refinement. Our Fed Listens events were full of discussions with community leaders and others who emphasized the benefits of a strong job market.4 The most telling one for me was a dialogue with Maurice Jones, head of LISC (Local Initiatives Support Corporation). He was asked if he was concerned about the risk that a period of exceptionally strong labor markets could lead to macroeconomic imbalances and a subsequent recession. Jones was dismissive of this hypothetical danger, noting that in the communities where his organization works, it always feels like a recession. Maximum employment means bringing as many people as possible into the labor force and finding them productive jobs.\nFurthermore, we are all aware of the great uncertainty surrounding linkages between unemployment and inflation pressures. Recently, inflation was running below target despite a historically low 3-1/2 percent unemployment rate. This highlights the challenge for interpreting the influence of lower-for-longer rates on inflation through a simple Phillips curve mechanism. Importantly, even when labor markets appear to be tight, we can’t definitely say that a lower-for-longer interest rate policy is accommodative if inflation is underrunning our 2 percent on average objective. Now, let’s be clear. You don’t have to abandon the expectations- and supply-shock-augmented Phillips curve; but we must recognize that the relationship is multidimensional and large uncertainties surround its predictions.\nThe new strategy statement does not include specific operational details for how to achieve those goals. I think that is a feature, not a bug. I have long thought that no specific formulaic monetary policy rule will be robust to all of the changes in the economic environment that inevitably will occur. That is, for example, one reason I support the statement’s flexible approach to average inflation targeting. The strategy statement is, instead, a commitment to a goals-based policy approach—a philosophy that I have supported throughout my tenure on the FOMC. The precise policy tools and their settings may vary with economic conditions, but the ultimate policy goals remain the same.\nThe long-run framework and forward guidance\nThe new long-run framework envisions that forward guidance will be an important part of the FOMC toolkit. Whenever the FOMC employs forward guidance during a long period of low or zero rates, a natural first question is: What does this mean for when the Fed will first raise rates? This was true in August 2003 and throughout the 2012–15 ELB period, for example. Our new long-run strategy statement highlights a number of important features for consideration when deciding on liftoff, and our September FOMC statement then tackled the question head-on.\nThe September statement indicates we will maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range until we have reached our employment mandate and inflation has reached 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. This overshooting after a period of sub-2 percent inflation is straight out of the new long-run strategy. I want to emphasize “for some time,” as year-over-year inflation readings could temporarily be above 2 percent next spring as the large drops in prices this year fall out of the annual calculations.\nThe statement also recognizes that our work on inflation might not be complete at the time of liftoff, and so it also indicates that we will maintain accommodative monetary conditions until our inflation averaging goal has been met. This latter criterion is more nuanced, since it relies on comparing the actual funds rate to some concept of a neutral fed funds rate.5 Historically, communicating to the public that an upward march in policy rates is still accommodative has often been met with substantial skepticism and disbelief.\nThese challenges will be compounded by the fact that short-run r* today likely is depressed below its long-run value, but should move up to long-run r* as the economy recovers.6 Describing the stance of policy against a moving and unobservable benchmark is another complicated communications challenge. So, all in all, I envision substantial communications work ahead. But it can be done.\nPutting this all together, I view the September 2020 forward guidance as a coherent, multipronged policy reaction function—one that should help us deliver on our policy goals.\nA review of monetary policy from 2015 through 2018\nWhen it comes to implementing a new strategy, like buying a new car, it makes sense to take it for a test drive. I’d now like to turn to thinking about our new framework and forward guidance through the lens of a recent U.S. experience, specifically, the 2015–18 liftoff and policy rate increases following the post-financial-crisis stay at the effective lower bound. The ultimate success of monetary policy during this period is subject to debate: While we did ultimately experience strong labor markets, we achieved 2 percent inflation for only a brief period in 2018—and in the end that success proved fleeting.\nOf course, back then our monetary policy framework was focused on deviations of employment from its maximum level, not shortfalls. It also had a symmetric 2 percent inflation objective, with no sense of inflation averaging. Indeed, when former Chair Janet Yellen was asked at a recent Brookings conference if the December 2015 funds rate liftoff was a mistake because inflation never overshot 2 percent, she replied that it wasn’t and that overshooting 2 percent wasn’t the FOMC’s objective back then.7\nStill, the inflation experience over this period did not deliver on the old symmetric inflation objective. Furthermore, our struggles over this period influenced my thinking about the new framework a good deal, as I am sure it did others’. So it is worthwhile to reconsider this rate cycle and how it may have evolved differently under our new long-run strategy.\nLet’s first review the history. In December 2015 the Fed increased the fed funds rate for the first time after eight years at the ELB. At the time, the unemployment rate was about 5 percent and the median FOMC participant’s projection was for it to be 4-3/4 percent over the next three years—a couple of tenths below what was generally thought at the time to be its long-run normal rate. Core PCE inflation was only 1-1/4 percent, but was projected to move up steadily and reach 2 percent by 2018.8 Underlying this forecast, the SEP median had a 25 basis point rate hike just about every other FOMC meeting for the next three years, reaching close to the then-assumed 3-1/2 percent neutral rate by the end of 2018. So we were looking at a forecast and policy path pretty much fine-tuned to the old framework—don’t push unemployment too low, and gradually asymptote in to 2 percent inflation.\nOf course, the year 2016 had numerous twists and turns. Heightened uncertainty over growth in China, Brexit, and U.S. politics weighed on the economy, and the FOMC held off on early-year policy moves. Still, by the end of the year the economy had regained its footing. Business sentiment was boosted by expectations of deregulation; tax cuts were on the table and were eventually enacted in late 2017; and equity markets surged. Inflation moved up to 1-3/4 percent. Against this backdrop, the FOMC began to raise rates steadily, increasing the fed funds rate in December 2016 and three more times in 2017.\nThe tightening continued through 2018 as labor markets improved, with the unemployment rate falling below 4 percent; fiscal policy was massively accommodative; and core PCE ran near 2 percent during much of the year. Any standard monetary policy reaction function had rates returning to neutral and then beyond to avoid further inflation. At the December 2018 FOMC meeting, the target range was raised to 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent—close to the 2-3/4 percent rate that was the new, downwardly revised neutral fed funds rate setting in the SEP median.9 Furthermore, the post-meeting policy statement indicated that the Committee judged that further gradual increases in the funds rate would be consistent with its policy goals.10\nBut no one knew then that U.S.–China trade negotiations and tariff wars would weigh on business sentiment and the economy as much as they did. As we moved into 2019, it became apparent that the outlook for growth had become fragile. Furthermore, core inflation dropped sharply to 1-1/2 percent early in the year and only partially recovered, before plunging with the pandemic. Monetary policy had to reset—first by changing forward guidance to communicate patience on future rate adjustments and then by cutting rates three times in the second half of the year.\nLessons learned\nSo what are some of the lessons that I take from this experience?\nLesson number 1: Following a prolonged period of underrunning 2 percent inflation, tightening on an inflation forecast comes with asymmetric risks; namely, the costs are larger when uncertainties are resolved adversely.\nDuring this tightening cycle, the consequences of trade war mischief were not apparent until late in the game. In my opinion, in 2017 or early 2018, the administration pursuing a trade policy that negated much of the tax stimulus was just not in the cards. Still, after years of underrunning 2 percent inflation, the costs of a downside surprise with weaker growth and yet another failure to attain sustained 2 percent inflation were significantly larger than if the economy had unexpectedly gained momentum. In such situations, having policy give stronger weight to downside risks ex ante seems crucial. The proximity of the ELB comes into play here as well—in our workhorse models, it is optimal to run looser policy the closer you are to the ELB because of the limits that the ELB imposes on monetary responses to downside shocks.\nLesson number 2: Again, in the context of having underrun 2 percent for several years, something more dramatic than what was in the 2015–18 dot plots and forward guidance was likely needed to boost inflation sustainably. Those didn’t do the trick.\nPerhaps, as we have just indicated with the September 2020 forward guidance, the FOMC back in 2016 could have waited until inflation actually got to 2 percent before beginning to remove accommodation rather than tightening on a forecast. This would have made an inflation overshoot more likely; and indeed, ex post, an overshoot probably would have been a desirable outcome. To be sure, some FOMC participants eventually began to advocate for overshooting, but this was not until later in the cycle.11\nOf course, actually pulling this off—whether back then or now—depends on the risk appetite of the Committee to overrun 2 percent. Can tightening wait until we see the whites of inflation’s eyes, or will the Committee want to raise rates earlier based on just a strong inflation forecast? The new long-run strategy statement provides the latitude to wait, and our September forward guidance says that we expect to do so. But as inflation approaches 2 percent, if our policy-risk appetite is low, we may have to fight the temptation to raise rates early. I’ll have more on this in a minute.\nLesson number 3: To end with an old message of mine, in the presence of a low r* and looming ELB, the successful achievement of our inflation goal requires that the FOMC be “in it to win it” and follow through on averaging 2 percent inflation over some period of time. Our new long-run strategy definitely gives the FOMC plenty of runway to pursue such a policy effort.\nA hypothetical\nSo what would have been different in 2015–18 under the new framework?\nWell, from the start, policy would not have been designed to just asymptote in to 2 percent inflation. From the beginning of the Great Recession in December 2007 to the December 2015 FOMC meeting—that’s an eight-year period—core PCE inflation averaged about 1-1/2 percent. Under the new framework, there would have been a strategic emphasis on producing inflation above 2 percent for a time in order to offset this shortfall. It’s highly likely that this strategy would have forestalled raising rates in 2015 and 2016; whether inflation would have persistently reached 2 percent and justified a rate increase sometime in 2017 under this counterfactual is open to debate.\nNext, there would have been no concern with the unemployment rate falling below the Committee’s view of its long-run normal level if it wasn’t producing undesired inflationary pressure. The Committee would have not felt any employment-related constraint on pursuing inflation overshooting.\nAnd finally, a looser policy would have made the real economy more resilient to the headwinds that hit in 2018 and 2019. It is likely that under the alternative policy, those just-at-2-percent-inflation numbers in 2018 would have been turned into a meaningful overshoot, providing a buffer to keep inflation from falling as much below target as it did with the disinflationary shock in 2019.\nThe new framework in the current environment\nLet’s return to today. Under the new framework, we are explicitly trying to average 2 percent inflation. Some additional perspective likely is useful here. For example, think about how long and how much inflation will need to run above 2 percent for us to achieve this average. For the sake of argument, here are a couple of simple calculations.\nForget the many years of underrunning 2 percent since 2008, and let’s just start averaging beginning with the price level in the first quarter of 2020. Core PCE inflation in the SEP is projected to be 1-1/12 percent this year and then gradually rise to 2 percent in 2023.12 Suppose it hits 2-1/4 percent in 2024 and then stays there. In this scenario, cumulative average core inflation starting from the first quarter of 2020 does not reach 2 percent until mid-2026. That is a long time. If you can produce 2-1/2 percent inflation in 2024, you can get there about a year quicker. Some, though, might view 2-1/2 percent inflation as an excessive overshoot. And don’t forget, that is under a positive economic outlook such as in the SEP, which in my submission depends on strong fiscal and public health support.\nNow, we are not going to follow a strict numerical formula to determine liftoff or how long to keep policy accommodative after liftoff. Still, these simple calculations illustrate that we likely have a lot of work ahead of us. And it’s crucial that we acknowledge the magnitude of the job up front to help lessen the temptation to back off the overshoot too early in the process.\nSome final thoughts\nLet me conclude with two observations on how I view the policy situation today given our new framework and these lessons from history.\nFirst, now is not the time to employ a plan to tighten preemptively on the basis of a forecast. And our current forward guidance regarding liftoff rejects this tactic. The guidance is pretty straightforward: Inflation should be at 2 percent and confidently on track for overshooting before we liftoff from the ELB.\nNow, to some extent this decision—and certainly the contours of the path after liftoff—may still revolve around the risk appetite of the Committee to wait until its goals are clearly in the data as opposed to being on track for achievement according to a well-thought-out, but still uncertain forecast. Of course, forecasts always are in play—that is the nature of the game, given the fact that monetary policy works with a lag. But forecasts come with obvious risks, and moving policy on them should be done with careful risk-management calculus in mind. Also, we can’t allow ELB fatigue to influence our decisions—simply saying the federal funds rate has been at zero for a long time is not a good argument for increasing rates.\nSecond, only in Lake Wobegone is everyone above average. In the real world, successful achievement of inflation expectations that are truly reflective of our 2 percent objective means the FOMC needs to follow through on averaging 2 percent inflation. This will require actual overshooting, and we can’t be timid about doing so. To reduce employment shortfalls and average 2 percent inflation over time, the FOMC needs to have an “in it to win it” attitude toward our inflation objective.\nNotes\n1 Federal Open Market Committee (2020a).\n2 See Federal Open Market Committee (2020d) for the revised statement.

            "content": "Introduction and disclaimer\nGood afternoon, everyone. Thank you for the kind introduction. I appreciate the opportunity to speak with the members of the Illinois Chamber of Commerce. The views I share today are mine and don’t necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\nI was very glad to see that the Illinois Chamber was focusing its annual meeting on economic development in distressed communities. And I was also heartened to hear that Wintrust would be announcing that a new bank branch would soon be opening in Chicago’s Lawndale neighborhood.\nA thin silver lining of our current virtual environment is that it allows those from outside the city and across the state to join us without a long trip. So I also want to acknowledge those from near and far as we celebrate the important addition of financial services to one of Chicago’s distressed communities.\nWhile every neighborhood is unique, limited access to quality education, living-wage jobs, transportation, decent affordable housing, and other resources is common in many distressed communities, which are now also among the most severely affected by Covid-19. Many such communities have long suffered from disinvestment, economic exclusion, and systemic racism. My remarks will highlight five main points about the challenges and opportunities today in Chicago’s distressed and hardest-hit neighborhoods.\nFirst, the pandemic and recession have challenged us all at an unprecedented scale, but residents and businesses in predominantly minority neighborhoods have borne an unfair and outsized burden. Since the first recorded case of Covid-19 in Chicago eight months ago, cases and deaths in minority neighborhoods have been especially high. So have job losses and business closures.\nSecond, while many hoped the pandemic and economic fallout would quickly pass, we find ourselves still struggling to contain the virus and mitigate the economic damage. Until we make sufficient progress in controlling the spread of the virus, an inclusive economic recovery will be difficult.\nThird, the expirations of enhanced unemployment insurance benefits, Payroll Protection Program (PPP) lending, and restrictions on some layoffs for firms receiving special industrial relief aid loom large. These reductions will test the true resiliency of the U.S. economy. The potential hole in aggregate demand may be large, and in my view more fiscal relief is needed in order to limit further damage to households and businesses, especially those in vulnerable communities.\nFourth, the longer the dual challenges of the pandemic and recession continue, the greater is the risk of deepening the already stark inequities in our economy. At the Chicago Fed, we recently launched an initiative called Project Hometown to examine how our communities can recover from the pandemic and overcome racism and other inequities. In Project Hometown’s public forums, many business and community leaders have insightfully emphasized that the long-term disinvestment that Lawndale shares with other West Side and South Side neighborhoods worsens job opportunities during the pandemic; further limits access to food, education, and shelter; and magnifies the many barriers to economic opportunity.\nFinally, I will conclude my remarks by highlighting the importance of collaboration among diverse actors—including policymakers, regulators, financial institutions, residents, and mission-driven organizations, as well as business leaders—to support Lawndale and other disinvested neighborhoods and to bring about a more inclusive and equitable recovery.\nGreater adverse impact in distressed communities\nLong before the pandemic, neighborhoods like Lawndale suffered from chronic disinvestment, which left them vulnerable in economic downturns. But the pandemic has had a greater adverse impact for several reasons.\nFor one, there have been large numbers of job losses among workers in the retail, leisure, and hospitality sectors since March. Public health concerns about in-person contact and stay-at-home orders have hit these sectors particularly hard.1\nA serious concern is that workers in retail, leisure, and hospitality often are relatively low paid and have little savings, leaving them especially vulnerable to hardship when they lose their jobs. These sectors also employ more women and minorities, who have both lost jobs and been hit hard in other ways, such as by having to shoulder a disproportionate share of the extra childcare responsibilities or contracting the virus at a higher rate.2\nNotably, many job losses resulted from closures of small businesses located in the city’s more affluent areas. But Chicago’s long-standing racial and income segregation means that workers losing these jobs tend to live in lower-income and minority communities.\nDuring the pandemic, minority- and women-owned businesses in these communities are more likely to have closed, both because of the industries in which they operate and because they have fewer resources to draw on in difficult times.3 Moreover, many of these businesses likely lacked the resources to pivot quickly to online sales.\nDuring one of our Project Hometown events over the summer, Nedra Sims Fears, executive director of the Greater Chatham Initiative, noted that in Chicago, we are seeing a digital divide among businesses—particularly in the inability of some businesses to pivot to online ordering and delivery. Moreover, she observed, it has been a patchwork effort to get families access to broadband and other technological resources—to give them the hardware, the software, and the training they need—so that they can successfully work from home.4\nBusiness owners’ relationships with accountants, lawyers, and financial institutions were important factors in whether their financial records were in order ahead of applying for PPP loans. Early assessments of the Paycheck Protection Program suggest that women- and minority-owned businesses were less likely to have received these U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) loans—which may have been the result of their limited access to technical and legal guidance.5 Although these businesses account for smaller numbers of lost jobs, their ability to recover and prosper will be a key test for whether our economic recovery is inclusive.\nWorkers living in predominantly minority neighborhoods are more likely to be in high-social contact jobs at essential businesses, which amplify the public health risks.6 Moreover, these workers tend to earn below-average wages and are unlikely to receive hazard pay for the health risks they bear.\nAnd for children in low-income and minority neighborhoods, the abrupt and continued closures of schools have exacerbated inequities in accessing education. It is also more difficult for schools to meet the nonacademic needs of students—including providing food, dental care, mental health services, and safety—in the current environment.\nAs Chicago Public Schools’ chief equity officer, Maurice Swinney, recently said in a Project Hometown discussion, “It's a part of our job and our social responsibility to … come up with the right solutions that close opportunity gaps, that start to heal and do the right transformative work that we have to have in order to advance equity in Chicago public schools.”7\nComplex longer-term risks\nThe longer the pandemic and recession go on, the more difficult it will be to achieve an equitable and inclusive recovery.\nAs temporary layoffs turn into long-term unemployment, families will be stressed to make ends meet. The fiscal policy supports implemented early in the crisis helped mitigate the worst of the immediate fallout for many families. Unfortunately, many of those fiscal supports have now run out. Unless they are extended soon, financial stresses may greatly intensify. Many low-income households have limited savings to tap into and face the risk of running out of resources. Some indicators already suggest a large drop in spending among low-income consumers after the July 31 expiration of expanded unemployment insurance.\nI don’t think I’m alone in my opinion that we are taking a very serious and unnecessary risk if we do not extend federal assistance to out-of-work households. Even after the worst of the crisis passes, the scarring of families’ balance sheets may weigh on spending and leave them further behind over the longer term.\nAlso, workers experiencing long-term unemployment risk losing skills and perhaps dropping out of the labor force or even going on disability insurance. Many may need retraining to be productive in the future—not only to refresh skills, but to meet the demand in emerging or reconfigured industries, such as telehealth or renewable energy.\nDuring another Project Hometown conversation, the City Colleges chancellor, Juan Salgado, said: “Skills that were in demand before are going to continue to be in demand as we move forward—communications, teamwork, flexibility, familiarity with technology. These sorts of higher-level, meta skills are the kinds of things that really need to be built into what we're doing because the worker that is going to see success … in a recovery is going to be the worker that is really able to provide that added value to the workplace.”8\nThe longer children are out of school, the harder it may be for educators to connect with them and for students to catch up or feel engaged with their teachers. For example, Project Hometown panelist Shantá Robinson, an assistant professor at the University of Chicago, emphasized the following: “If I'm a student, I'm vulnerable, I'm in a space where I don't have access to technology, then how is the school going to reach out to me, get me back, and then maintain that connection … in the midst of a pandemic, when they're also trying to figure out that for an entire district of young people? So getting those students back is not going to be an easy task.”9\nAnd nonprofits and mission-driven organizations working in disinvested neighborhoods will find it more challenging to secure the resources they need to serve their communities. Greater fiscal support for such institutions would likely have major long-term payoffs.\nCoordinated efforts are necessary for an inclusive, equitable recovery\nIncluding our most vulnerable communities in economic recovery and prosperity will likely require much effort and coordination among many different actors.\nThat’s why I’m so glad to be speaking with you as we celebrate an example of this coordination with today’s addition to the North Lawndale Employment Network’s community hub. Nonprofits and state and local governments are at the frontline of providing services to many severely impacted households. They provide food, health care, virus testing, help with accessing unemployment insurance, housing, and other assistance. The ballooning need for these services comes at a time when tax revenues are falling and leaving a large and important gap.\nCommunity Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) can help fill in this gap by providing credit and financial services to smaller nonprofits and even small businesses. One lesson from the Great Recession is that during bad economic times, scaling up the activities of CDFIs with greater support from the CDFI Fund10 is vitally important for helping our most distressed communities.\nAlong these lines, in a Project Hometown discussion, we heard from Alex Bartik, an assistant professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign (UIUC), that improving social contacts through nonprofits, churches, and social institutions can help improve labor market outcomes in distressed neighborhoods.11 His observations echo what my staff have heard, namely, that the coalitions of public, private, and nonprofit organizations that came together during the Great Recession have also been providing critical early responses to the pandemic in many communities.\nIn Chicago, we are fortunate to have a significant network of CDFIs, business development groups, foundations, and nonprofits that support lending and investment in the communities hardest hit by the pandemic. One CDFI—IFF, the former Illinois Facilities Fund, which now has a 15-state footprint—was instrumental in acquiring and renovating the facility where the new bank branch will be located.\nA little farther north, in Garfield Park, Chicago Fed staff recently visited The Hatchery, a newly constructed business incubator built by an extensive network of mission-driven organizations. We have visited many other developments in disinvested neighborhoods that have required complex, collaborative, and coordinated efforts, such as the Lawndale Christian Health Center and the Farm on Ogden.\nBut not all places have the same robust network of CDFIs and other organizations that Chicago has. So we’ve also been actively engaged in efforts across the Midwest to start and grow CDFI-type organizations. These organizations can come together to support their local communities and help bring about an equitable and inclusive recovery.\nConclusion\nWe have much work ahead in our economic recovery if we are to confront the inequities exacerbated by the pandemic.\nThe Fed’s actions touch communities, families, and businesses across the country. We are committed to using our full range of tools until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.\nThrough Project Hometown, the Chicago Fed will continue to bring together leaders and experts with diverse perspectives to examine how our communities can recover from the pandemic, overcome long-standing inequities, and grow stronger.\nWe welcome you to join us in those efforts.\nNotes\n1 See Chetty et al.

            "content": "Introduction and disclaimer\nThank you for inviting me to offer my views on the economy and the path ahead. I should state at the outset that these views are my own and do not necessarily represent the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\nAll of us have a role to play in recovering from the pandemic, which has taken a tremendous human toll and continues to pose many challenges. I am especially grateful for the services that health care and other essential workers have been providing throughout this ordeal. Their dedication has been indispensable and inspiring.\nWe obviously have lots of work ahead of us. As the economy heals, leadership by organizations such as yours will be critical in supporting local communities and businesses and in promoting development opportunities to help us achieve more vibrant economic outcomes for everyone in society.\nMy remarks today will focus on a few points that are fundamental for the economic outlook.\nI'll start with where the economy stands today. Even though growth has resumed in recent months, we are still far from the robust economy we had prior to the pandemic. Importantly, the unemployment rate is about 10 percent now, as compared with 3-1/2 percent last February. We have a long way to go to get back to normal.\nThe second point is that the future of the recovery is inextricably linked to the virus. Until we’ve made sufficient progress in controlling its spread, activity is likely to remain suppressed—indeed, sporadic outbreaks could even result in further setbacks.\nThird, monetary policy and, particularly, fiscal policy have key roles to play. To date, Fed actions, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, and other programs have provided important support to households, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and state and local governments. The expirations of expanded unemployment insurance provisions, Payroll Protection Program (PPP) lending, and restrictions on some layoffs for firms receiving special industrial relief aid loom large for the economy. These reductions will test the true resiliency of the U.S. economy. The potential hole in aggregate demand may be large, and in my view more fiscal relief will be needed in order to limit further damage to the economy.\nMy baseline outlook assumes that there will be progress on controlling the virus and that additional fiscal support is forthcoming. Still, I expect it could be late 2022 before economic activity returns to pre-pandemic levels. It also will be some time before inflation picks up to reach the FOMC’s 2 percent objective.\nOf course, there are many unknowns in the outlook, and I will spend some time today talking about an important one: the potential implications of the disruptions to our educational system for the development of children’s skills and for the labor force decisions of their parents. Even a one-year disruption to education or work can have lasting effects on children and parents, and thus poses an important risk to the outlook.\nI'll conclude with a discussion of monetary policy. The Federal Reserve has taken strong action to help the economy weather the crisis and is committed to supporting the recovery. Given my outlook, I expect this means highly accommodative monetary policy will be appropriate for some time to come. The revised “Statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy” should also help clarify and support our policy goals.\nActivity is picking up, but the hole is deep\nLet me start with where the economy is today. The virus and actions to stem its spread have upended everyday life and left a huge mark on the economy. After state and local governments issued stay-at-home orders for all but essential businesses, all indicators of economic activity logged record declines in the second quarter. Gross domestic product (GDP) plunged at an annual rate of almost 32 percent—the worst quarterly decline in the history of the national income and product accounts (NIPAs) data going back to 1947.\nActivity began to recover through the spring as state and city officials relaxed restrictions to varying degrees. Starting from such a low base, we can expect to see a huge positive number for GDP growth in the third quarter: The projections from outside forecasters are centered at around a 21 percent annual rate. On its own, a number that large would be remarkable and cause for celebration. However, even with this anticipated eye-catching rebound, the level of GDP would still be about 5 percent below its pre-pandemic level. Furthermore, rising virus counts in some locations have delayed or reversed many reopening plans, and we are undoubtedly looking at much, much more modest growth in the fourth quarter.\nThe unemployment rate sums up the current situation well: It was a horrific 10.2 percent in July, and this was an improvement from the shocking 14.7 percent high in April—and this might have been closer to 20 percent when you consider some measurement issues! Today, nearly 18 million people are still unemployed.1\nThough the labor market remains poor for many, some sectors of the economy have largely recovered. Retail sales are now above their pre-pandemic level, with a notable bounce-back in many goods and services that had seen the largest declines during the shutdowns. Other sectors still have a way to go. For example, manufacturing output has picked up 15 percent between April and July. That’s a good start, but is still only a bit more than halfway out of the hole dug during shutdown.\nThrough this time, many companies have made significant efforts to operate safely. I regularly hear from contacts about their operational changes. Some describe accelerated adoption of technology, which has enabled many employees to work remotely. Others talk about creative solutions to help keep their workers safe, including monitoring employee and visitor health, adopting more stringent cleaning protocols, and modifying the work environment to implement social distancing.\nStill, challenges remain. For example, some firms face high rates of absenteeism as workers get sick, are exposed to the virus and need to quarantine, or are reluctant to come to work because of health concerns. A few of my contacts have even hired extra workers to cover the high number of absences. Clearly, these efforts are costly, but they are necessary if businesses are to continue operating through the public health crisis.\nThe path of the virus and mitigation efforts will shape the recovery\nUltimately, the course of the recovery depends on the path of the virus and efforts to contain it. Certainly, solutions to our health issues are necessary for businesses, workers, and consumers to safely return to their usual ways. Importantly, to get the economy moving, these solutions must be effective enough to restore public confidence. Households need to feel comfortable reengaging in normal activities, such as going to work or school, riding public transit, going out to eat, and visiting a doctor’s office. And businesses need to have confidence in sustainable improvements in demand in order to justify long-lasting commitments, such as major capital spending initiatives and workforce expansion.\nOf course, a safe and effective vaccine is the ultimate goal. Until one is available, things we already know how to do—such as social distancing and wearing masks—are very important, as are increasing testing and quarantine. Reintroducing restrictions on social and recreational gatherings, shutting down potential super-spreader events, and enhancing protections for the elderly would also help substantially.2\nIn the meantime, we are likely to see periodic regional outbreaks of infections, which may require reimposing certain restrictions on activity and may also undermine consumer confidence and spending. As we’ve experienced over the past couple of months, this isn’t merely hypothetical. For example, a number of indicators of economic activity and consumer confidence stalled out in late June and early July as states that reopened early and saw rising virus counts had to clamp down on activities.\nAnd while outbreaks may be localized to start, it’s hard to keep them so. Our nation is highly interconnected. Just think about how difficult it would be to prevent a surge in the Chicago area from finding its way into Northwest Indiana. So doing everything we can to keep the virus under control everywhere is crucial to the recovery.\nFiscal policy is essential\nThe course of the recovery will also critically depend on receiving substantial additional support from fiscal policy. The initial policy response in March was swift, with the Federal Reserve, Congress, and the executive branch working to provide support to the millions of households and the many thousands of businesses affected by the shutdowns. The CARES Act included direct aid to households in the form of stimulus checks and expanded unemployment insurance, helping put food on the table and pay for rent and other essential expenses. Loans and grants to businesses enabled them to stay in business, keeping workers on payrolls, meeting day-to-day expenses, and avoiding costly bankruptcies.3\nThis support was essential. But the needs remain great, and some important provisions of the CARES Act have now expired, threatening to put more vulnerable households and businesses in jeopardy. An inadequate fiscal response would significantly reduce household spending, further damage household balance sheets, and put many businesses at risk of failing.\nFederal assistance has also been vital for state and local governments. They are on the front lines of fighting the virus; there is a heightened need today for the social services they normally provide; and they face the additional costs of addressing social unrest. These demands come at a time when tax revenues are down significantly because of the weak economy. Unlike the federal government, state and local governments cannot run deficits. So unless more federal funding is provided, state and local governments may be forced to take some difficult actions. They could cut back on the provision of health resources or other social services, which would make battling the virus and the recession even more difficult. And they might end up furloughing workers, which could have large effects, as state and local governments account for about 13 percent of total employment. I would note nonprofit organizations face similar challenges trying to maintain funding to provide food, educational, and other assistance to the most disadvantaged people. Partisan politics threatens to endanger additional fiscal relief. A lack of action or an inadequate one presents a very significant downside risk to the economy today.\nMy baseline outlook\nAs you can tell from this discussion, two things I see as critical for a sustainable recovery are 1) the effective control of the virus and 2) adequate additional fiscal support. My baseline forecast assumes we will achieve both, though the health solutions, in particular, are not going to happen overnight.\nAs I noted before, I expect the third-quarter growth number to be big simply because of the restart of the economy from the most severe shutdowns of last spring. After this, I expect more moderate growth in the fourth quarter, with the level of GDP still about 5 percent below its pre-pandemic level at the end of this year.\nImprovements in our control of the virus should allow growth to proceed at a moderate pace, though I don’t expect activity returning to its pre-crisis level until later in 2022. Of course, this does not take into account the fact that the economy would have been growing in the absence of the crisis—it will take much longer to catch up to that counterfactual. With economic activity remaining well below its normal level, my baseline forecast has the unemployment rate in the neighborhood of 9 percent by the end of the year—still extremely high—and declining gradually to somewhere around 5 or 5-1/2 percent by the end of 2022. Of course, the uncertainty surrounding these forecasts is extremely high—there are just so many unknowns about how the virus and the economy will evolve over the next couple of years.\nLet me say a few words about inflation. Overall consumer inflation stepped down significantly this spring, as the effects of weak demand for a range of goods and services far outstripped price increases in food and a few other products. Even with the recovery of some prices in tandem with the recent improvements in activity, for the 12 months ending in July, inflation as measured by the index for core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) was only 1.3 percent—far below our 2 percent inflation target.4 Given the prolonged period of subpar economic activity and high unemployment, I expect inflation will run under our 2 percent target for some time.\nTo sum up, even with steady progress in controlling the virus and additional fiscal support, I expect it will be some time before the economy recovers from the hit it took. Along the way, we face many challenges, uncertainties, and downside risks. I would like to discuss one of those now.\nThe virus presents challenges for schooling and childcare\nSchooling and childcare bring together many people of different ages with a variety of health risks in the same space for prolonged periods of time. This poses enormous public health challenges. The lack of national guidance has led to a dizzying array of educational arrangements due to differential Covid-19 risks around the country. Some schools and childcare facilities have fully reopened to in-person instruction, with a wide variety of social distancing schemes. Some school districts are opting for a hybrid model rotating online learning with classroom instruction, while others are pivoting to a fully remote learning experience. Continuing challenges for the foreseeable future will be that the health risks vary substantially around the nation and that different risk tolerances have been selected by the various state and local authorities. Furthermore, given the enormous uncertainty at this point over the course of the virus, all arrangements are subject to revision, making it even more difficult for parents to plan.\nFor children, the lost learning and socialization costs are potentially enormous. For some children, even a year of subpar instruction can have lasting effects on their lifetime educational achievement. Furthermore, the dependence of remote learning on internet access raises the possibility of students in many rural areas and disadvantaged households being left further behind their peers. And with social activity limited by large and uncertain Covid-19 risks, I also worry that some children will miss important developmental milestones that come through interactions with other children and adults in a safe environment outside the home.\nEducating students at home also presents enormous challenges for parents. Can parents who work outside of the home still go to work? Who will be at home to supervise the children? If parents are able to work remotely, will they be able to do so effectively? How much flexibility do parents have to adapt to changing school demands? And what is the toll on employee and family mental well-being? These Covid-19 channels risk widespread and truly devastating costs.\nThe added stress on families is enormous. Weighing the competing needs of family health, income, schooling, and child supervision, many parents may be forced to cut back on hours or quit work altogether. The predicament is even more striking for single parents and poorer households. And in our American society today, women are particularly vulnerable because they generally shoulder a disproportionate share of the childcare and household responsibilities.\nFor the economy, unless offset by other comparably skilled hires, a reduction in the hours worked by these parents represents a loss of current production. Furthermore, a decision to withdraw from the labor market for even a year can have long-term adverse effects on these workers’ human capital and earnings. This represents not just a loss to them, but the loss of that productivity to the economy as a whole. The human toll is very large.\nMonetary policy and revisions to the framework\nThough I spent a good deal of time discussing the necessity of fiscal policy, monetary policy is also playing an important role in supporting the economy during this unprecedented and challenging time.\nThe pandemic demands an all-hands-on-deck response. Our response has been both rapid and strong in order to limit any long-lasting damage to the economy from the challenges the pandemic poses. In March, the FOMC quickly cut policy rates to their effective lower bound, putting the federal funds rate target range at 0 to 1/4 percent. As the Committee has repeatedly stated, the federal funds rate is likely to remain in that range until we are confident the economy is on the path to recovery. In addition, in order to address distress in crucial financial markets, the Fed conducted repurchase agreements and purchased large quantities of U.S. Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. We also activated special lending facilities to support the flow of credit to businesses, households, nonprofits, and state and local governments. These programs, which are deployed only in very unusual circumstances, rely on emergency lending powers that require the approval and financial backing of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. To broaden their scope, we have adjusted the terms on a number of facilities as appropriate.\nThese actions have clearly provided important support to the economy by easing financial conditions across the economy. The Fed will continue to provide such support as long as needed. As always, we remain focused on the achievement of our dual mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability as expeditiously as possible.\nTo help us achieve these goals, in early 2019 the Federal Reserve embarked on a comprehensive effort to review the way we conduct monetary policy. In large part, the impetus for the review came from the realization that we live in a world where interest rates are much lower than they were in the past, which limits how much room the Fed has for using our usual tool—cutting the federal funds rate—to support the economy during economic downturns. An important part of this process was a series of Fed Listens events, in which we heard from a wide range of workforce development, small business, and community leaders on how monetary policy affects their lives.5\nLast week Chair Powell introduced a revised “Statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy,” the document that lays out the FOMC’s goals and articulates our framework for conducting monetary policy.6\nAmong the noteworthy changes, the new statement emphasizes that maximum employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal and that the Committee would not be concerned with what might look like very tight labor markets as long as they were not generating unwanted inflation or other risks. The new statement also indicates that following a period when inflation has persistently run below our 2 percent target, policy will likely aim to generate a period of above 2 percent inflation. We’re not tied to a strict formula, but roughly speaking, we’re looking for inflation to average 2 percent over time.\nThese principles are consistent with the type of outcome-based forward guidance that I advocated and that the Committee used to speed the recovery after the Great Financial Crisis, when we were far away from both our inflation and our employment goals. We are in a similar position today. And I expect that articulating outcome-based forward guidance for the rate path and asset purchases could be beneficial in the not-too-distant future.\nOne of the lessons that monetary policymakers have learned is that policy is most effective when it is clearly understood by the public. I think our new consensus strategy is another important step in providing this kind of transparency and, hence, in helping us to more effectively achieve our policy goals. Of course, strategies need to be implemented with actions, and it is important that our future monetary policy actions are true to the principles laid out in the new consensus statement.\nThank you. And I’d now be happy to take your questions.\nNotes\n1 Most of the job losses still appear to be temporary layoffs, but the number of permanent job losers continues to rise and is now up 2.9 million. This represents about 1.8 percent of the labor force, up from 0.9 percent just before the pandemic, but still well below the 4.4 percent ratio experienced during the financial crisis.\n2 For a recent analysis of the effects of economic restrictions and noneconomic, nonpharmaceutical interventions on mitigating a second wave of Covid-19 infections, see Baqaee et al. (2020).\n3 When firms go out of business, their relationships with workers, customers, suppliers, and lenders are destroyed. Rebuilding those connections—many of which have been built up over years and decades—is extremely costly.\n4 While our objective is stated in terms of overall PCE inflation, core inflation—which strips out the volatile food and energy components—is a better gauge of sustained inflationary pressures and of where inflation is headed in the future.\n5 For a summary of Fed Listens events, see Federal Reserve System (2020).\n6 See Federal Open Market Committee (2020a) for the revised statement.

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. The views I’ll express are mine and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\nBefore I begin my remarks, I want to take a moment to reflect on the police incident in Minneapolis that led to the death of George Floyd and the protests that have spread across the country. Like you, I am outraged and horrified by injustices toward the black community. Racism has no place in our society, and each of us has a responsibility to combat it. At the Chicago Fed we have made diversity and inclusion a priority in our own corporate culture. It is a responsibility we all share.\nWe are also together in grappling with the worst pandemic in more than 100 years. Almost overnight, the health care crisis has developed into the sharpest economic downturn we’ve ever experienced. My hope is that states can safely reopen their economies and that, in due course, life will return to much as it was before. But the path ahead remains unclear.\nIn my remarks today, I will focus on three central messages.\nFirst, while I hope for a quick rebound in the economy, I expect broad recovery will take some time. Furthermore, the future is more uncertain now than at any other time in my professional career. The outlook depends on so many factors of a virtually unprecedented nature—we really are in uncharted territory.\nSecond, the situation demands strong fiscal and monetary policy actions to help support households and businesses through these challenging times. Policy has already done a lot, but more may be necessary. For its part, the Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy through these difficult times.\nThird, while the economic impact has been catastrophic for an extraordinarily large number of people and businesses, sadly, the cost has fallen most heavily on some of our most vulnerable populations. No one could have adequately prepared for an event of this magnitude, but some, notably low-wage workers in exposed industries, have felt disproportionate pain.\nBroad recovery will take time and the outlook is highly uncertain\nGiven the rapid onset and unprecedented scale of the current crisis, it is easy to forget the economy was doing well before the pandemic. Labor markets were strong. At just 3-1/2 percent, the unemployment rate was at a 50-year low. The improvements in labor markets were finally benefitting a broad group of workers. Consumer sentiment was high, and importantly, household spending was solid. Before the pandemic hit, I—like most analysts—expected the U.S. to experience continued solid growth, supported primarily by strong consumer spending.\nI don’t need to spend time reviewing the specifics of the virus’s threat or the actions taken to stem its spread. We all know and have experienced the heavy human and economic toll the health care threat has taken. Alarmingly, since February, employers have shed nearly 20 million jobs from their payrolls, and the unemployment rate reached an extraordinarily high 13.3 percent in May. The most severe job losses have been sustained by those with lower earnings and by the socioeconomic groups that are disproportionately represented among low-wage jobs in industries deeply impacted by the pandemic, such as leisure and hospitality and retail. Regarding the broader economy, most forecasters are looking for a massive decline in gross domestic product (GDP) in the second quarter—something on the order of –30 to –40 percent at an annual rate.\nAs states ease restrictions, economic activity is picking up. And there are some indications that it may be rising faster than most forecasters had anticipated. A number of daily and weekly indicators of individuals’ mobility and spending appeared to reach bottom in late April or early May and then began to improve. Sales of motor vehicles also picked up a good deal last month. And though still at a very elevated level, new claims for unemployment insurance have moved down. Consumer spending, which is an important driver of economic activity, showed signs of recovery in May, with retail sales rising sharply for all major categories. As factories began to reopen, manufacturing production, which has been anemic, also picked up last month, although the increase was relatively modest. Then there was the surprising May labor market report. Although analysts almost uniformly had expected large job losses last month, nonfarm payroll employment instead rose by 2-1/2 million and the unemployment rate declined some.\nAt this point it is too early to tell how much of the improvement is simply timing, with firms bringing back workers and consumers returning to stores sooner than most analysts had expected, and how much represents stronger underlying demand.1 It is probably a little of both. Most forecasters are looking for positive growth in the third quarter—with recent projections in the 10 to 30 percent range.\nTurning to inflation, the Fed’s explicit goal is for annual inflation to be symmetric about 2 percent, as measured by the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE).2 Even with the long recovery and expansion before the pandemic, we never reached this target. And now, with the pandemic’s impact on aggregate demand, inflation has moved down significantly. In February, on the eve of the pandemic, core PCE inflation—which strips out the volatile food and energy components—was 1.8 percent.3 By April, it had declined to just 1 percent. Large price decreases in some categories most directly affected by social distancing contributed heavily to the decline in consumer inflation in March and April.4\nWhat should we expect for growth and inflation over the next couple of years? As part of our normal policy discussions, FOMC participants periodically provide forecasts for key economic variables and views of appropriate policy that support those forecasts. These forecasts are released in our quarterly Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).5 The most recent one was released two weeks ago after our June meeting.6\nFOMC participants generally expect the economic recovery to begin in the second half of this year. Even so, GDP is expected to show a sharp decline for the year as a whole, with the median forecast for a fall of 6-1/2 percent. The median outlook then has GDP rising by 5 percent next year and 3-1/2 percent in 2022. The unemployment rate is expected to be somewhat above 9 percent at the end of this year and to decline to 5-1/2 percent by the end of 2022. That is still nearly 1-1/2 percentage points above the median participant’s estimate of its long-run normal level. And I would note that the range of growth and unemployment rate forecasts made by the FOMC participants was quite wide, attesting to the unprecedented level of uncertainty we face. My own forecast is in broad alignment with the FOMC median.\nI can’t speak to others’ assumptions, but crucially, my forecast assumes growth is held back by the response to intermittent localized outbreaks—which might be made worse by the faster-than-expected reopenings. In this environment, many resources will be devoted to health and safety. I assume health solutions become widely available as we move through 2022, and I allow for a return to more normal operations by late in the year.\nMy forecast has real GDP returning to its pre-pandemic 2019:Q4 level sometime later in 2022. Of course, without the virus the economy would have been growing. So even after three years, my projected recovery places us below where the economy would have been had the virus not occurred. Unfortunately, I think some previously expected trend growth has been permanently lost.\nThis is my baseline outlook for growth. But as I noted, the uncertainties surrounding it are enormous. The forecast will undoubtedly be wrong. Still, it’s a useful exercise for anchoring our thinking. One of my advisors kicked off our regular forecasting exercise at the Chicago Fed by quoting Dwight D. Eisenhower, who said, “In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable.”7 I find this sentiment especially apt under the current circumstances.\nUsually, we are able to look to the past for guidance on what is in store for the future. But in this situation, there is simply no relevant benchmark. It is unlike anything we have dealt with before. First and foremost, there is the massive uncertainty over the future path of the virus and the success or failure of therapeutics and vaccines. Until the virus is treatable or controlled through other measures, the return of economic activity hinges on the ability of businesses to provide safe workplaces and consumer environments. How much these efforts will allow activity to recover is an open question.\nEven once these modifications are in place, there is the question of the willingness of workers to return to their jobs and the eagerness of consumers to reengage in regular day-to-day activities. And somewhat paradoxically, there’s also the risk that too hasty a comeback could create added health burdens that end up forestalling a more complete recovery. In this highly uncertain environment, business investment, which is critical for growth, may be delayed or canceled. And add to this the impact of social unrest on confidence, investment, and the spread of the virus.\nThere is also uncertainty over scarring from the downturn itself. Without the devotion of adequate resources, we risk a wave of bankruptcies that destroy businesses, supply chains, and human capital—all of which may have taken years to develop. Such risks could be particularly acute for the retail and leisure and hospitality sectors.\nNow, there could be some positive surprises as well. We are devoting many resources to the health effort, and progress there could be faster than in my baseline. Our ability to run safe operations at scale may be better than expected. And workers whose old firms have folded may be able to move to new jobs more seamlessly. Still, for me, there seem to be both more and larger downside risks than upside ones—so I think the balance of risks to growth is skewed to the downside.\nRegarding inflation, I think some of the extreme price declines in March and April are likely behind us. But the effects of soft aggregate demand could take some time to recede and show through to stickier prices. In the June SEP, the median forecast had core PCE inflation for 2020 at just 1.0 percent.\nLooking ahead, I anticipate the downward pressure on prices from resource slack to diminish in 2021 and 2022. If inflation expectations do not fall, this should support some modest increase in inflation in those years.8 The median FOMC participant’s forecast has core PCE inflation rising, but to only 1.7 percent by the end of 2022.\nRisks to the growth outlook I just mentioned, fragility in inflation expectations, the fiscal situation, and a number of other factors impart a great deal of uncertainty to this forecast. On balance, even with substantial monetary policy effort, I also see the risks to the inflation outlook as tilted to the downside.\nThese are my best assessments of what is in store. But the uncertainties are enormous, and as I said, I see the risks weighted to the downside. Indeed, other forecasts with more severe effects on economic activity are almost equally as plausible in my view.\nPolicy actions\nBoth monetary and fiscal policymakers responded aggressively when the crisis hit. Together, our policies have worked to support households and businesses through the shutdown phase to set the stage for as strong a recovery as possible. There will be losses, but the goal is to limit them as much as we can and to avoid the costly destruction of worker, employer, and business-to-business relationships. An important objective here is to keep temporary liquidity difficulties from evolving into more damaging solvency problems. Avoiding unnecessary bankruptcies will help preserve these relationships and help support the return of furloughed workers to their jobs.\nOn the fiscal policy front, Congress responded with the fastest and largest support in any postwar economic downturn.9 The policies have many elements and include direct aid to households in the form of stimulus checks and expanded unemployment insurance; loans or grants to small businesses—in particular from the Paycheck Protection Program—with incentives for firms to maintain payrolls; and a host of other efforts providing aid to businesses, health care providers, and state and local governments.\nThe Congressional Budget Office puts the price tag of these efforts at almost $2.2 trillion, or about 11 percent of GDP, this fiscal year; this is huge.10 And there is evidence that they have been effective. In research at the Chicago Fed, Karger and Rajan (2020) estimate that a recipient’s spending increased sharply in the two days following the receipt of a stimulus payment, before slowly returning to baseline levels after two weeks.11 The initial batch of payments was issued in mid-April, and the timing roughly coincides with the improvement we saw in some of the economic indicators.12\nWith regard to monetary policy, the FOMC acted quickly in March and cut the target range for the federal funds rate to zero to 25 basis points—what we refer to as the effective lower bound (ELB). The Committee also indicated rates would remain low until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.13 Given the forecasts I just discussed, this is likely to be the situation for a long time. Indeed, in the June projections, all FOMC participants anticipated that it would be appropriate to maintain the federal funds target at its current range through the end of next year, and only 2 out of 17 penciled in a rate increase in 2022.\nIn addition to easing the stance of monetary policy, the Fed has deployed various other tools to promote the smooth functioning of financial markets and support the flow of credit to households and businesses.14 Some of these tools were used successfully during the Great Recession, and others are new.\nFirst, in order to address distress in the crucial markets for U.S. Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, we conducted repurchase agreements and purchased large quantities of these securities. These interventions were successful, and we were able to scale back purchases. In June we announced that over the coming months we would purchase these securities at least at the current pace to help foster the effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.15\nOther programs have been designed to more directly support the flow of credit in the economy—for households, for businesses of all sizes, and for state and local governments.16 These include the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MMLF), the Paycheck Protection Program Lending Facility (PPPLF), the Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF), and the Main Street lending programs. Some of these programs provide backstops to key financial markets, which can increase the willingness of private lenders to extend credit. Others deliver more direct participation in loans to small and medium businesses, nonprofits, and state and local governments. Many of these programs rely on emergency lending powers that require the approval of the Treasury and are available only in very unusual circumstances, such as those we find ourselves in today. We are deploying these lending powers to an unprecedented extent with the financial backing and support from Congress and from the Treasury.\nDespite all these efforts, more may be needed. Further fiscal policy actions are under consideration. On the Fed’s part, as Chair Powell has emphasized repeatedly, we will continue to use our lending powers “forcefully, proactively, and aggressively until we are confident that we are solidly on the road to recovery.”17 And even after the recovery is well in train, we will use all of our tools to meet our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and symmetric 2 percent inflation.\nAn unequal burden\nAs I noted earlier, before the pandemic hit, even those who are sometimes last to experience the benefits of a rising tide were beginning to share in economic prosperity. For example, after hitting double-digits in the Great Recession, unemployment rates for black and Latinx workers had fallen to historic lows of 5.9 and 4.2 percent, respectively, by the end of 2019. Wage growth also had started to pick up for low-skill, minority workers. But things certainly have deteriorated—those black and Latinx unemployment rates are now 16.8 and 17.6 percent, respectively.\nThis recession is unique in its rapid onset, scope, and scale. And unfortunately, the burden falls most heavily on many who are least able to bear it. As I mentioned earlier, the impact on workers in the retail, leisure and hospitality, and other service sectors is especially severe. Because these industries tend to employ disproportionately more females, minorities, and younger workers, enormous job losses in these sectors have pushed already relatively high unemployment rates even higher for these groups. In addition, many of these workers have dropped out of the labor force since the start of the pandemic.\nAlso, stay-at-home orders have led to record high rates of business closures. These are hard on everyone, but become a much more serious problem if a temporary closure turns into an outright business failure. Although closures cut across nearly all industries, minority-owned businesses and those owned by women and immigrants are disproportionately at risk of failing—both because of the industries in which they operate and because they have fewer resources to survive the downturn.18 Should these businesses permanently shutter their doors, their failures could have longer-term implications for their owners, their employees, and the communities in which they operate.\nFrontline workers in essential industries have been working to meet our needs, and in the process, they risk their own health and the health of those in their households. This is a heavy burden to bear, and they bear it for all of us. Many of these workers are less educated and earn below-average wages; and many are minorities. And they are unlikely to receive hazard pay for this exposure to greater health risk.\nAfter the Great Recession, it took many years for the economic recovery to translate into employment and wage gains for disadvantaged workers. Even then, there were concerns that these gains were not sufficiently widespread or that they would not persist. Distressingly, the grim situation we currently face risks jeopardizing those gains: The longer the current recession lasts or the weaker the recovery is, the greater the risk of lasting damage for female, minority, younger, and less-skilled workers.\nProlonged periods of unemployment may downgrade their human capital and can have lasting effects on productivity and income. Another concern is that minority, female-headed, disadvantaged, and younger households have fewer savings to tap in an emergency and may face a greater risk of bankruptcy. Even after the worst of the crisis is past, the scarring of their balance sheets may leave them further behind.\nNonprofits and state and local governments are at the front line of providing services to many severely impacted households. They provide food, health care, virus testing, unemployment insurance, and other assistance. The ballooning need for these services and the additional costs of social unrest come at a time when tax revenues and funding for some nonprofits are falling. The budgetary stress on these institutions could have serious consequences for their ability to provide crucial services in the future.\nThe various fiscal and monetary policy programs I discussed earlier are designed to offer an unprecedented degree of support to households and businesses so as to mitigate the damage. Even so, given the enormous challenges that lie ahead, more may be needed.\nConclusion\nState and local governments are in the first stages of reopening their economies. It is too early to know how quickly the economy will return to normal or what the longer-term impact of the pandemic will be. We’re going to learn a lot over the coming months.\nThe Fed’s actions touch communities, families, and businesses across the country. Whatever is in store, we are committed to using our full range of tools until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.\nNotes\n1 The labor market report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics covers activity for the reference period that includes May 12. At that point, most of the nation had begun to ease restrictions related to the pandemic, but many states were still quite early in the process.\n2 As mandated by Congress, the monetary policy goals of the Federal Reserve are to foster economic conditions that achieve both stable prices and maximum sustainable employment. Our two goals of price stability and maximum sustainable employment are known collectively as the dual mandate.\n3 While our objective is stated in terms of overall PCE inflation, core inflation is a better gauge of sustained inflationary pressures and of where inflation is headed in the future.\n4 Overall inflation also has been held down by substantially lower energy prices, which more than offset the effects of surging prices for food. As a result, total PCE inflation has declined more dramatically from 1.8 percent in February to a mere 0.5 percent in April.\n5 In March, with states beginning to implement shutdown orders and the spread of Covid-19 driving events, there was too much uncertainty to provide a meaningful forecast. So we skipped the March exercise and returned to a normal schedule for the SEP in June.\n6 See Federal Open Market Committee (2020a).\n7 This quotation appears in Andrews (1993, p. 688).\n8 Inflation expectations are a key determinant of actual inflation.\n9 To date, Congress has passed four bills addressing the pandemic and its economic consequences. These are the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2020; the Families First Coronavirus Response Act; the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act; and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act.\n10 The fiscal year ends September 30, 2020.

            "content": "Introduction and overview\nLet me start by expressing my deepest sympathies for all of those who have been touched by the coronavirus. We are all well aware of the situation in Michigan and the hardships you face. And our sincere gratitude goes to the health care providers, workers in essential services, and all of the others who are doing so much to get us through this difficult time.\nI’m glad to be able to share my views on the U.S. economy, discuss the Fed’s initial responses to the crisis, and talk about some of the challenges that lie ahead. Of course, as usual, the views I’ll express today are mine and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\nI don’t need to describe the stay-at-home restrictions and shutdowns in nonessential activities that have been implemented around the world in efforts to reduce—and hopefully stop—the spread of the Covid-19 virus. We are all living with them and seeing their enormous effects on the economy.\nOne could ask many questions about where the U.S. economy is headed. I want to preview three themes that I keep coming back to when thinking about this.\nFirst, when nonessential businesses call workers back, will they feel safe returning to their workplaces? What will make them feel secure? And what will safe operations look like?\nSecond, how fast will consumer confidence return as households venture back toward on-site retail shopping and begin to return to other activities? When will leisure travel resume and destinations such as Disney World reopen? What will that entail, and what will be the public’s reaction?\nThird, which economic sectors will be the source of strength as the U.S. and global economies recover? Just a few months ago, the primary source of strength in the U.S. was the consumer, with activity fueled by an exceptionally strong labor market and record low unemployment rates near 3-1/2 percent. Who will perform this role next?\nAs you can see, there are many more questions than answers, but I’ll make an effort at addressing a few. Let me start with the status of the U.S. economy.\nCurrent conditions\nThe national data show that a sharp deterioration in economic activity began in March. According to the initial report, gross domestic product (GDP) contracted at an annual rate of 4.8 percent in the first quarter. This illustrates that there was a quick and large decline in U.S. economic activity that followed the stay-at-home policies implemented in mid-March.1\nOver the quarter as a whole, real personal consumption expenditures fell at a massive 7.6 percent annual rate. The quarterly decline entirely reflects a huge drop in spending in March, which was by far the largest monthly decline on record going back to 1959. Business investment also fell sharply in the first quarter, and the data on housing starts and sales for March indicate a sharp contraction is occurring in this sector as well. Measures of consumer confidence plunged in April following steep declines in March. The drops in April were the largest monthly declines ever recorded.\nIn labor markets, weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance surged to levels that were many times higher than any previously recorded. Between March 15—around the time that the first social distancing measures were taken—and May 2, over 33 million workers initiated unemployment insurance claims—far exceeding the flows seen at the height of the Great Recession.2 By April, the unemployment rate had shot up to 14.7 percent from only 3.5 percent two months ago, before the onset of the crisis.3\nAnd, as you know all too well, there has been a lot of hardship here in Michigan. The health care situation has been very difficult. And economic activity has been hit hard as the automobile industry shut down production and many other businesses closed their doors.\nBut, on a slightly more positive note, auto production lines will begin to reopen on May 18. And, at the national level, though still very low, daily and weekly indicators of consumer sentiment and spending have risen a bit recently. Some of the gains appear to reflect support to households from payments made through the CARES Act.\nNear-term outlook\nNow let me turn to the near-term outlook. Clearly, the second quarter will show a huge decline in GDP.\nThe range of recent projections made by a number of highly reputable private sector forecasters was for GDP to contract at an annual rate of between 25 and 40 percent. The policy objective of stay-at-home orders is to decrease the spread of the virus. The shutdowns have large repercussions on the economy. But once the public health threat has been reduced, the declines in business activity and employment should be short-lived.\nFor a baseline outlook, it’s reasonable to assume a legitimate return to growth in the second half of 2020 and into 2021. With sufficient progress on testing and tracing, we should see a slow but steady decline in social distancing that will allow more businesses to reopen and consumers to go about their daily lives with a greater semblance of normalcy. The pickup in activity will likely be slow at first because of continued social distancing and other safety precautions. Many forecasters have this as a baseline—the median of the group I just mentioned still had the level of GDP at the end of 2020 about 5 percent below where we were before the crisis, with the unemployment rate at around 9 percent.\nBut other, more pessimistic scenarios are also much discussed. For example, a second wave of Covid-19 could necessitate reshuttering activity, like in March. Or bankruptcies could be larger and more widespread, leading to further destruction of employment and business relationships. Or some combination of these scenarios and other difficulties could occur. With uncertainty so high and with so many potential difficulties at this still early stage, the likelihood of the baseline scenario may only be a bit higher than that of the more pessimistic possibilities.\nAdjustments are necessary\nThat said, let me describe some business reports that support the baseline outlook.\nBefore each FOMC meeting, I speak with my directors, a number of CEOs with a large business reach, and several advisory groups. Everyone is challenged. Even so, a number of manufacturers described their substantial and largely successful efforts to operate safely in today’s demanding environment.\nOne perspective came from a large manufacturer of capital equipment. This manufacturer’s product lines qualify it as an essential business, and it has been in continuous operation in the U.S. throughout the Covid-19 crisis. The executive described how the firm’s workers wear face masks and safety glasses and are separated by plexiglass if they must work close to one another. Areas where close personal contact is unavoidable undergo intense disinfection. The firm also has a health center, where workers can be screened and tested and where contact tracing and quarantining are coordinated. I heard of similar efforts from other manufacturers, including Michigan’s automakers.\nThese responses to the public health challenge on the factory floor give me hope that when the time comes, others will be able to scale up production as well. Their success—including their success in making employees feel safe in the workplace—is an important marker on the roadmap to recovery once stay-at-home orders are relaxed.\nSuch investments in worker safety are clearly necessary. But, of course, they also are costly and reduce productivity, so they add to the financial pressures firms are experiencing. Therefore, another key factor to recovery will be the availability of financial resources to sustain and expand these efforts.\nUnfortunately, such work arrangements with social distancing may be needed for quite some time, depending on the success of testing and tracing. For some, it may even be necessary to keep these arrangements in place until a vaccine is available. In this environment, policymakers, business leaders, and households will need to adjust their thinking about what sustainable economic activity looks like on a quarter-by-quarter basis over this period. For example, some businesses will be able to operate safely at a reasonably high level of activity, similar to the factories I described. Other business sectors—for example, travel and leisure and hospitality—probably won’t be operating at anything close to pre-crisis levels.\nMore than half the states have begun to partially reopen their economies.4 Relaxing a stay-at-home policy is a bold decision with pretty high risks, in my opinion. In any event, we should learn something from these decisions—for example, the kinds of activities households and businesses feel comfortable in pursuing and how their confidence and willingness to spend evolves throughout this process.\nWidespread economic policy support\nLet me finish with a word about economic policy. Congress, the President, and the Federal Reserve swung into action quickly in order to provide relief to households, unemployed workers, businesses of all sizes, and financial markets.\nFiscal policy has provided unemployment benefits, paycheck support via the Small Business Administration (SBA), direct payments to most households, and targeted support to some industries hit hardest by the Covid-19 crisis.\nThe Federal Reserve quickly rolled out some programs from our 2008 financial crisis playbook in order to improve financial market functioning and thus support the flow of credit to households and businesses. Then, with the support of the Treasury’s fiscal backing, the Fed designed and implemented several new so-called 13(3) programs. These are programs that under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act can only be implemented during emergency circumstances, like now, and only with the approval of Treasury. The Fed is providing additional help—including money market lending support, corporate credits, and Main Street lending—within the restrictions placed by the Federal Reserve Act. Accordingly, we can only provide lending and must be careful to avoid losses.\nThere is some indication that these policy actions are beginning to cushion the blow from the pandemic on households and businesses. Still, we face significant challenges ahead—first on the health front and then on the economic front. We must do all we can so that economic activity can resume once it is safe to do so and focus our efforts on returning to prosperity as quickly as possible. Households, businesses, state and local governments, and federal policymakers all have a lot of work to do to get the nation back on its feet. And we will get it done.\nNotes\n1 Incoming data for January and February were consistent with economic growth near potential in the first quarter, which many analysts see as around 1-3/4 to 2 percent.\n2 The recently enacted Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act expanded states’ ability to provide unemployment insurance for many workers impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, including for workers who are not ordinarily eligible for unemployment benefits. The expansion of benefits to those who were not previously covered complicates the comparison with earlier periods. Nonetheless, the insured unemployment rate calculated as a percentage of covered unemployment rose to 15.5 percent for the week ending April 25, 2020. In comparison, at the height of the Great Recession, the covered unemployment rate was only 5.0 percent.\n3 The official unemployment rate may not accurately reflect adverse labor market conditions. To be counted as unemployed, a person must be out of work and either on temporary layoff or actively looking and available for new work. This leaves out many individuals who want to work, but did not look for work, as well as those who may remain employed, but at substantially reduced hours.

            "content": "President Charles L. Evans discussed the implications of long-run economic trends for monetary policy frameworks and strategies. His comments reflected his own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nThe slides President Evans used during his presentation are available online.\nKey highlights of President Evans’s remarks\nPresident Evans focused on how the effective lower bound (ELB) on policy rates in a low neutral rate environment can result in both inflation and inflation expectations running persistently below target, thus posing a risk to the attainment of the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandates.\nHe discussed some alternative monetary policy approaches that could alleviate this downward inflation bias. He stressed that to be effective, such approaches\nneed to be outcome-based and clearly communicated;\nmust contain a credible commitment to counter the effects of the ELB and bring inflation and inflation expectations up to target; and\nlikely would involve extended periods with inflation above target to counter the downward inflation bias.\nSynopsis of President Evans’s remarks\nPresident Evans noted that the U.S. economy is in a historically atypical situation, with inflation persistently underrunning the Federal Reserve’s inflation target and the unemployment rate below most estimates of its long-run normal level.\nTwo important long-term trends are shaping the U.S. and many other advanced economies:\nTrend growth and the neutral level of real interest rates (r*) have declined significantly since the early 2000s. Low growth and low r* are expected to persist well into the future.\nAt the same time, inflation has been underrunning central banks’ targets.\nConsequently, nominal policy interest rates are likely to be constrained by the ELB much more frequently than in the past. This could limit the ability of central banks to use conventional monetary policy tools to counteract downturns and, under traditional approaches to policy, would result in a tendency for inflation and inflation expectations to underrun target.\nPresident Evans stressed that the overarching aim of U.S. monetary policy is to achieve the dual mandate goals of full employment and symmetric 2 percent inflation over the medium term.\nWhen confronted with the ELB, policymakers must commit to provide extraordinary accommodation in order to meet their mandate. And there likely will be a need to raise inflation and inflation expectations to be consistent with the Fed’s symmetric inflation objective.\nCountering the ELB inflation bias may require more periods of above-target inflation than experienced in the past. Policymakers must recognize this and convey to the public that periods with above-target inflation are essential to achieving the dual mandate goals over the long run.\nPresident Evans discussed several alternative monetary policy approaches that would offset the downward inflation bias.\nHe first considered the adoption of a state-contingent price-level target as presented in Evans (2010a, 2012, 2017) and Bernanke (2017).1\nTo illustrate the approach, he noted that as a result of the inflation misses since the financial crisis, the price level today in the U.S. is 5.3 percent below a 2 percent trend line starting from the cyclical peak in 2007.\nThe average inflation rate required to return to the trend line depends on the time horizon to close the gap, ranging from about 4.7 percent with a two-year horizon to 2.9 percent with a six-year horizon—both noticeably above the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target.\nPresident Evans next discussed an approach from Bianchi, Melosi, and Rottner (2020), in which policymakers follow an asymmetric version of the Taylor (1999) rule that responds more aggressively when inflation is below target than when it is above target.\nHe noted that inflation objectives that have a point target, such as 2 percent, are easier to communicate than objectives defined by an inflation range.\nHe also considered two approaches that consider ranges around the inflation target.\nOne version has been proposed by Harris (2016) and Mertens and Williams (2019). It says that in recognition that inflation will be driven down to the lower end of the range when policy is constrained by the ELB, policymakers should aim for inflation at the top of the range when the economy is away from the ELB.\nA second version is discussed in Bianchi, Melosi, and Rottner (2020). It sets an asymmetric inflation range with a wider band above target inflation than below it—for instance, from 1.75 percent to 2.5 percent—and has policy act less aggressively when inflation is within the range than outside of it.\nPresident Evans pointed out how in these alternatives, policy parameters can be calibrated so that inflation averages its target over long periods of time, thus solving the ELB inflation bias problem.\nIn addition, unlike state-contingent price-level targeting, the asymmetric policy response and the two inflation-range approaches do not require a mechanical makeup for past deviations of inflation from target.\nHe also noted that a symmetric inflation range that is a zone of policy indifference cannot be structured to overcome the downward inflation bias.\nPresident Evans raised some important questions about policy approaches that require delivering above-target inflation for extended periods of time:\nCan policymakers credibly commit to pursuing the policies prescribed by some of these alternatives?\nHow will central banks communicate such strategies effectively?\nHow will the public react to extended periods of inflation exceeding the central bank’s inflation goal? What would be the impact on inflation expectations?\nWhat are the financial stability implications associated with the alternative frameworks? Are financial markets and the regulatory environment resilient enough to limit financial instability risks that might arise?\nPresident Evans concluded with his views on general principles that should guide monetary policy strategies, irrespective of the framework.\nPolicymakers should focus on outcome-based strategies; in the U.S., that means undertaking policies that best achieve the dual mandate goals of the FOMC.\nBecause long-run economic trends have increased the chances of returning to the ELB, policymakers must be prepared to rely on unconventional tools, such as quantitative easing and forward guidance, to provide adequate policy accommodation when appropriate.\nGiven the necessary focus of monetary policy on the dual mandate goals, financial stability risks are best addressed using macro- and microprudential supervisory and regulatory tools that increase the resiliency of financial markets.\nCredibility is key to achieving the dual mandate goals, irrespective of the operational framework chosen.\nNotes\n1 See also Federal Open Market Committee (2010a, 2010b) for transcripts of FOMC meetings where President Evans discussed this approach.

I am not going to take a lot of time away from the important conversation we are about to have. But I do want to take a minute or two to talk about why this subject is important to me personally and why it is important to the field and the profession that someone like myself is included on this stage. I am not here because they couldn’t find a gifted female central banker to facilitate this panel, but rather because I am one of 12 regional Fed presidents that lead dynamic and large staffs in the important day-to-day work of the American central bank. Of the 12 regional Fed presidents, nine of them are men, and eight of those are white men. As presidents and CEOs of regional Feds, we are tasked with charting the course for the institution both to meet our current economic policy challenges and to put the organization on a better footing for the future challenges it may face. As I see it, we have two significant long-term challenges. First is how can we make central bankers more responsive and more effective given all the new realities of this fast-changing world economy? And second, how can we make ourselves more representative of the people we serve? You might think that today’s panel is about the latter challenge, ensuring more representation, but for me and my colleagues here on the stage, these two challenges are inextricably linked. It is clear we need to diversify the leadership because it would better represent our citizenry, but perhaps just as important is that the research and policy responses we would come up with together would invariably be better solutions in the long run. I believe that deeply, and that is why I am here. These issues are not easy to resolve; they are steeped in racial and academic discrimination, male-centric work cultures, and lack of opportunities. We have a lot to talk about this morning, and I look forward to our conversation.\nLet me now do what you are all waiting for and that is to briefly introduce my esteemed colleagues.\nCarolyn Wilkins was appointed the Bank of Canada’s Senior Deputy Governor in 2014, for a seven-year term. As Senior Deputy Governor, Ms. Wilkins oversees strategic planning and the economic and financial research of the Bank. She shares responsibility for decisions with respect to monetary policy and financial stability and oversees the Bank’s analysis of international economic developments. Ms. Wilkins serves as the Bank’s G7 and G20 Deputy.\nSarah Breeden is the Executive Director of the Bank of England’s UK Deposit Takers Supervision, responsible for the supervision of the UK’s banks, building societies, and credit unions. She has oversight of the Bank of England’s work enhancing the financial system’s resilience to climate change. Before moving into supervision, Ms. Breeden was a Director in the PRA’s Financial Stability Strategy and Risk Directorate, where she focused on developing the UK’s macroprudential policy-making framework and supporting the Financial Policy Committee.\nMary C. Daly is the President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and my colleague on the Federal Open Market Committee. She began her career with the San Francisco Fed in 1996 as an economist specializing in labor market dynamics and economic inequality. She went on to become the Bank’s Executive Vice President and Director of Research.\nLael Brainard took office as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on June 16, 2014. Ms. Brainard serves as Chair of the Committee on Financial Stability; Committee on Federal Reserve Bank Affairs; Committee on Federal Reserve Board Affairs; and Committee on Payments, Clearing, and Settlement. She also Chairs Working Party 3 of the OECD Economic Committee.\nNellie Liang is the Miriam K. Carliner Senior Fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution.

            "content": "\n\nIntroduction\nIt’s a pleasure to address the Automotive Supplier Conference. The auto sector plays a central role in the Midwest and national economies. This year’s event, with its focus on the future of the industry, provides an excellent opportunity to discuss my views on the future of the economy and monetary policy. After my formal remarks, I look forward to answering your questions and, very importantly, to hearing about some of the issues you are facing. Your thoughtful comments contribute to better monetary policymaking. So thank you.\nAnd, speaking of policy, this is the point in the speech where I have to remind you that the views I will express today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\nSetting the stage\nAs you know, the Federal Reserve has a congressional mandate to use its policy tools to help promote maximum employment and price stability. The FOMC considers maximum employment to be a broad-based and inclusive goal. For price stability, the Committee seeks inflation that averages 2 percent over time, as measured by the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE).1\nSo how are we doing? With the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020, the U.S. experienced an extremely deep recession as large swaths of the economy shut down to combat the virus. Although the virus has taken a horrible toll on the health and livelihoods of so many people, economic activity in the U.S. did begin to rebound quickly; and by the second quarter of this year, gross domestic product (GDP) had surpassed its pre-pandemic level and has risen further since. The labor market has improved as well. After peaking near 15 percent in April 2020—which for a variety of reasons was an understatement of the true extent of joblessness—the unemployment rate now stands at 4.6 percent.\nGiven how dire an event the pandemic has been, this economic progress is remarkable. Households and businesses showed amazing ingenuity in finding ways to operate safely. The health care sector was able to develop and deploy vaccines extremely rapidly. And the government provided crucial support through fiscal and monetary policy actions.\nEven so, about 4-3/4 million fewer people are working today than were before the pandemic. Furthermore, the recession fell harder on minorities and women, as higher percentages of them work in industries most affected by the pandemic. Some of these workers are still feeling the extra pinch of the pandemic. So, while good progress has been made, we still have a way to go before we meet the FOMC’s inclusive employment mandate.\nOf course, inflation is the other part of the Federal Reserve’s policy mandate. Here, the picture is complex. Sharp declines in demand in sectors heavily hit by the pandemic, such as travel and leisure and hospitality, led to some very weak inflation readings last year. However, this year inflation has picked up sharply. Some of this reflects the normalization of prices in these heavily pandemic-hit sectors. But more generally, the sharp recovery in demand has led to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. A big question for policymakers today is how much of a mark will these pressures leave on underlying inflation.\nBefore I get into specifics, I want to emphasize that Covid continues to play a critical role in the economic outlook. The spread of the Delta variant slowed momentum recently. After surging 6.5 percent in the first half of the year, growth in the third quarter decelerated sharply to 2.0 percent. The increases in Covid cases in some countries important to global supply chains also put further pressure on prices.\nAll of this is a stark reminder that progress on the economy is still very much tied to progress on the virus, and the path forward remains highly uncertain. However, with case counts coming down in the U.S. and further improvements in public health, there’s room for optimism. A couple of early readings on business activity in October were strong, and some daily and weekly indicators of consumer spending have ticked up over the past few weeks. Most forecasters are looking for strong growth in the fourth quarter.\nThe growth outlook remains healthy, though there are risks\nSo what lies ahead for growth? Four times a year the FOMC releases its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which presents FOMC participants’ forecasts of key economic variables over the next three years and for the longer run. Participants also provide their assessments of the appropriate monetary policy that supports those forecasts. The most recent SEP projections were made in mid-September.2 The median FOMC participant expects growth of 5.9 percent this year and 3.8 percent next year and then growth of 2.5 percent in 2023 and 2.0 percent in 2024. Those are healthy numbers. My own outlook is largely in line with the median SEP projection.\nHowever, this is an evolving situation with a great deal of uncertainty. For example, since these forecasts were made, the impact of the Delta variant and supply constraints have become more evident. I’ve already mentioned the third-quarter GDP number. In addition, manufacturing output fell 3/4 percent in September after a smaller decline in August. The drop was largely accounted for by lower motor vehicle output as a result of the microchip shortage and disruptions to refining and chemical production due to Hurricane Ida. Still, the flatness in factory output excluding these factors is a sign that supply constraints have taken a broader toll on the manufacturing sector. Now these factors probably represent more of a shift in the timing of growth between 2021 and 2022 than a more lasting softening in activity. But that remains to be seen.\nIn the labor market, the median SEP forecast has the unemployment rate falling to 3.8 percent by the end of next year and settling in around 3.5 percent in 2023. For comparison, the median projected longer-run unemployment rate is 4 percent. So, by this measure, our full employment goal would be well within sight. Of course, we will be looking at a broader list of labor market indicators when making this assessment. In particular, as I’ll discuss in a minute, labor force participation remains depressed, meaning the unemployment rate doesn’t tell the whole story about how the labor market is performing.\nSupply bottlenecks and labor shortages complicate the inflation situation\nBut what about our price stability mandate? Is it close at hand? This is a more complicated question to answer. We’ve all seen higher prices lately—ranging from a variety of materials input costs to what you are paying at the grocery checkout or at the gas pump. For the 12 months ending in September, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index rose an eye-popping 4.4 percent. As I noted earlier, some of these high readings reflect the normalization of prices in sectors where prices had been depressed during the pandemic. And some reflect short-term supply chain disruptions, shortages of many kinds of workers, and other supply pressures that have accompanied the sharp recovery in demand in many sectors. Those associated cost increases are being passed through to higher consumer prices.\nSo, a $64,000 question for monetary policymakers is, how persistent will these price increases be?3 I think much of the current surge in inflation is temporary, but that assessment certainly needs explaining. First, the effects on inflation of increases in prices for those goods and services where demand had been depressed during the pandemic will end as those prices return to more normal levels. That story is pretty simple.\nThe supply side story is much more complicated. But let me give you one example. The pandemic set in motion many changes. With people forced to spend more time at home, households shifted their spending from services, such as travel or dining out, toward goods, such as appliances for home improvement projects or consumer electronics. And many of these items contain a large number of sophisticated microprocessors. At the same time, expecting a severe and prolonged recession, automakers substantially scaled back their production plans. This included ordering fewer microprocessors used in motor vehicles.\nWell, we all know how this story turned out. The demand for vehicles recovered much more robustly than most expected. Meanwhile, chip producers had allocated more product to firms manufacturing consumer electronics and other such items. To this add in a fire in Japan at a major chip producer and some other supply disruptions, such as a drought in Taiwan, and then car and light truck production becomes severely curtailed. Auto and truck production had recovered to a 10-3/4 million unit annual rate around the turn of the year; last summer it had fallen to just about an 8-1/2 million unit rate. The supply disruptions also have spurred an associated surge in vehicle prices.\nThis is just one story, but in many areas we are seeing producers struggling with such supply bottlenecks. In some cases, lean just-in-time production processes have come under pressure from multiple directions simultaneously as the flood of demand has put logistics systems under immense strain. For example, one contact at a conglomerate that manufactures machinery for a global clientele described how difficulties sourcing a simple $2 part could delay shipment of a $10,000 machine. He and others observed that issues such as these are now routine and require careful planning to manage successfully. With many components being sourced from different suppliers often spread around the globe, the potential for delays is compounded. Difficulties in getting shipping containers to the right locations, backups at ports, a trucking fleet impaired by deferred maintenance, and a shortage of drivers have added to the supply pressures.\nOn top of this, many businesses are reporting difficulties hiring workers. Now, I can’t recall a time when managers weren’t complaining about hiring difficulties, but in the past that comment has usually been accompanied by the qualification: “And I’m not increasing wages to get them.” That’s certainly not the case today. We are seeing marked increases in wages, signing bonuses, and benefits as firms try to hire the workers they want.\nHow is this going to turn out? As introductory economics courses always teach, an increase in demand and reduced supply in a market will cause the price for that good or service to rise. And that increase in price will dampen demand, bring forth more supply, and eventually eliminate the shortage. We have already seen that happen for a few products. For example, the price of lumber more than doubled between February 2020 and this past May as home construction surged late last year. New construction has since softened, and lumber prices have come down about 40 percent since their peak.\nEventually, these adjustments will be behind us and supply and demand conditions will normalize, bringing inflation lower. But how long that process will take is highly uncertain. The issues seem more persistent than many thought they would be a few months ago. And even when the adjustments are done, the prices of some goods and services may be permanently higher. For those whose incomes have not kept pace with inflation, paying higher prices is a hardship.\nLet me go into some more detail on supply conditions in the labor market. While there are ample job openings, as I noted, about 4-3/4 million fewer people are employed today than prior to the pandemic. Much of this shortfall reflects people who are on the sidelines right now, not looking for a job.\nIn economic statistics, the labor force counts how many people are either employed or actively looking for work—so it’s a measure of the supply of available workers. Today, about 3 million fewer people are in the labor force than before the pandemic. Given population trends, if the labor force participation rate had held constant, we would have seen an increase of about 1.4 million participants over this time.\nWhat is going on? First, health concerns may still be keeping some people from looking for work. And some workers in leisure and hospitality and other outward-facing industries may be waiting to see that reopening is back for good before committing to a new job. Second, expanded unemployment insurance benefits as well as other fiscal support may have reduced the incentive for some workers to return to the workforce. Third, retirements have surged; my staff estimates that since the pandemic began there have been 1 million or more retirements that cannot be explained by typical demographic trends. Fourth, school closures and childcare concerns have kept some parents of young children out of the labor force.\nI do not expect these factors to persist. As public health conditions improve, jobs will become more predictable, as will childcare and school schedules. Expanded unemployment insurance programs have ended, and any savings from other payments will be depleted. Stronger labor market conditions will draw some early retirees—as well as many who now describe themselves as retired—back to work.\nSo taken altogether, I expect that the currently elevated inflation readings from supply side pressures will eventually fade. That said, I had expected to see more progress by now. And there are some indications that inflationary pressures may be building more broadly. Rents and homeownership costs have accelerated in recent months.4 And measures such as the Dallas Fed’s Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate that are designed to filter out erratic changes in prices also have picked up recently.5 These developments deserve careful monitoring and present a greater upside risk to my inflation outlook than I had thought last summer.\nImplications for inflation and monetary policy\nThe big question for the medium- and longer-term inflation outlooks is whether the increases in prices and wages we are seeing today will find their way into the underlying wage and price setting mentality of households and businesses. In other words, are businesses and workers going to expect continually larger increases in wages and prices, so that we will have transitioned to permanently higher inflation? Or do they interpret the current situation as a reaction to temporary supply side factors, so that once those ease, we will return to an environment more like what we saw prior to the pandemic?\nThese are difficult questions to answer. But if you look at surveys of households or measures derived from financial markets, longer-run inflation expectations appear either roughly in line with or even a bit below the FOMC’s 2 percent average inflation goal. So, with the caveat that none of these indicators are very precise, they signal today’s outsized inflation as being temporary.\nThe median FOMC participant also expects the recent surge in inflation to be temporary. The median SEP projection made in mid-September is for inflation to end the year at 4.2 percent before quickly dropping to 2.2 percent in 2022 and 2023 and moving slightly lower in 2024 to 2.1 percent. And I would note that the stance of monetary policy underlying this forecast is highly accommodative. The median projection for the federal funds rate has one 25 basis point increase occurring next year and then three rate hikes in each of 2023 and 2024.\nThis path reflects the forward guidance the Federal Open Market Committee has given about interest rates for more than a year and reaffirmed at our meeting last week.6 That is, rates will remain at their current zero to 1/4 percent range “until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.”7 And even after that, the Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance until that inflation outcome is in fact achieved.\nOf course, since early in the pandemic, the Fed also has been purchasing Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities—first to assist key financial markets to function effectively and then to help the recovery by further easing financial conditions. Last December the FOMC stated its intention to continue asset purchases at a pace of at least $120 billion per month until substantial further progress was made toward our maximum employment and price stability goals.8 At last week’s meeting, the Committee judged that the economy had met this test.9 So later this month, we will begin to gradually reduce the monthly pace of purchases. At the moment, the expected pace of tapering could result in our net purchases ceasing entirely by the middle of next year. However, we are prepared to adjust the pace if warranted by changes in the economic outlook.\nFurthermore, this tapering decision does not imply any direct signal regarding our interest rate policy. We continue to articulate a different and more stringent test for the economic conditions that would need to be met before raising the federal funds rate. So, the exact timing of that rate path will depend on economic outcomes. As you can see, there are many uncertainties to the outlook and changing circumstances could lead the FOMC to move up or delay rate increases. But judging from where the economy stands today, it looks like we are in for a low rate environment for some time to come.\nThank you. And now, I look forward to your questions.\nNotes\n1 Federal Open Market Committee (2021c).\n2 Federal Open Market Committee (2021b).\n3 The first episode of The $64,000 Question aired on CBS on June 5, 1955.

Before I begin my comments, I should note that these views are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\nI’ve had the privilege of regularly attending FOMC meetings for nearly 20 years—first as director of research and for the past 14 years as president of the Chicago Fed. During that long span, the economy has faced significant challenges—the dot-com bubble, the uncertainties of 9/11, the Great Financial Crisis, and now the Covid pandemic. Each situation presented unique difficulties that we monetary policymakers grappled with in pursuit of our dual mandate objectives.\nThe challenge I want to discuss today is one I never would have suspected dealing with when I first started going to FOMC meetings—that we have not been able hit our inflation target on a sustained basis and that for the past 15 years those misses have been because inflation has been too low, not because it has been too high. This comment may seem a bit odd to you, given the surge in prices we are seeing currently. But it is precisely because the policy response to today’s events is so important that I want to talk about this topic today.\nBefore we turn to that discussion, I’d remind you that the primary reason for these inflation shortfalls is the fact that—for a variety of well-known reasons—the equilibrium real rate of interest, or r*, has fallen to historically low levels. In a low r* world, the effective lower bound (ELB) on nominal policy rates presents asymmetric risks to inflation that, under our old policy framework, led to a downward bias in inflation, as well as downside risks to attaining our full employment mandate.\nLast year the FOMC adjusted its long-run strategy to emphasize that monetary policy should seek inflation outcomes that average 2 percent over time and acknowledged the desirability of allowing for periods of overshooting 2 percent inflation.1 The European Central Bank (ECB) also recently adjusted its longstanding goal of seeking inflation below but close to 2 percent. It now aims for symmetric 2 percent inflation and will allow for periods of overshooting. Both central banks noted that the challenges that low r* presents were key factors in moving to their new monetary policy strategies.\nAn obvious question to ask about the Fed’s new framework is: How much overshooting is really being contemplated? Today’s combination of accommodative policies and sharp price increases due to supply bottlenecks heightens the importance of this question. Does the strong imprint these factors are leaving on inflation today satisfy the overshooting criteria contemplated by the FOMC? Many have said yes, but I’m not so sure. To answer that, we need to consider what the overshooting is trying to achieve. The new long-run framework is pretty specific here—overshooting is aimed at anchoring long-run inflation expectations at 2 percent in order to enhance the Committee’s ability to hit both our price stability and maximum inclusive employment targets.\nTo be sure, inflation expectations are somewhat of a black box. But it seems to me that they are more likely to become realigned with our inflation objective by an intentional policy-generated overshooting of target as opposed to an accidental supply-side-generated spike in inflation followed by a quick deliberate retreat to 2 percent. I would think this latter tactic risks falling short of cementing inflation expectations at 2 percent. So in my remarks today, I am going to argue that the inflation we’ve seen to date does not yet satisfy the FOMC’s overshooting criterion. Instead, we should be focused on producing sustainable inflation that aligns longer-run inflation expectations with our 2 percent goal.\nFurthermore, because ELB risk imposes such a substantial inflation-undershoot bias, I wonder if it is possible to average 2 percent inflation over time without a constant long-run aim for inflation above but close to 2 percent. Would explicitly following this approach do a better job of achieving 2 percent average inflation and, hence, more strongly anchor inflation expectations at 2 percent even during episodes at the ELB, as well as during mature expansions? I think such an approach might strongly reinforce expectations at 2 percent.\nIs inflation sustainable?\nThe keyword when discussing today’s inflation outlook is “sustainable.” Many of us at this conference forecast the economy for a living. After a shocking burst of relative price increases and attention-grabbing year-over-year headline PCE inflation above 4 percent,2 how many of you see that unacceptably high inflation being sustained into 2023 and beyond? The Survey of Professional Forecasters tells me that most of you aren’t writing down those kinds of numbers.3 And it’s because most don’t expect sustained momentum in inflation.\nWell, according to the latest Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), neither do my colleagues on the FOMC. In September, the median SEP projection for PCE inflation in 2023 was 2.2 percent and for 2024 was 2.1 percent.4 Though one can’t be sure from the report what drives the individual forecasts, this anticipated reduction from 4.2 percent inflation in 2021 to 2.1 percent in three years cannot be due to restrictive settings of the funds rate. Looking at the dot plot—that most important and valuable piece of Fed transparency—one can see that even the most aggressive path only has two 25 basis point rate increases next year and the funds rate just returning to near its long-run neutral level by 2024. Because monetary policy acts with a lag, this removal of accommodation likely has only a modest effect on inflation. And the rate path described by the median dots is clearly too low to have much of a restrictive impact. So something else is dragging down the inflation forecast.\nCould anticipated high unemployment be weighing on projections of inflation? This seems unlikely. The median SEP forecast sees the unemployment rate falling below its longer-run level of 4.0 percent by the end of next year and then to 3.5 percent in 2023 and 2024. With the current unemployment rate at 5.2 percent, this would be a highly welcome development with regard to our maximum employment objective and would support more inclusive labor market outcomes. But it also means that there wouldn’t be any downward pressure on inflation coming from labor market slack. Indeed, to the contrary, one would think that such low levels of unemployment would be associated with higher, not lower, inflation rates. How much higher inflation we’d expect is an open question. Most of us used to take as dogma that such low unemployment rates would generate higher or possibly accelerating inflation. However, for more than 20 years, unemployment falling below estimates of the NAIRU has not been a reliable signal of higher inflation.5 Simply put, the Phillips curve appears pretty flat, so this 1/2 percentage point unemployment undershoot isn’t going to produce a lot of inflation.6\nStrong fiscal policy actions gave important support to the economy during the early phase of the crisis and over the course of the recovery, but on net are unlikely to provide an outsized impetus to growth as we move forward. This is because many of the current payments and programs are behind us, and the future actions currently contemplated by Congress will be spread over a number of years. So, unless you subscribe to an independent role for deficits on inflation, fiscal policy should not be an important factor in the inflation outlook.\nQuite importantly, the lower long-term inflation outlook reflects the consensus view that current supply-side disruptions are unlikely to leave much of a lasting imprint on underlying inflation. Markets work, and higher prices will eventually bring forth increases in supply. To be sure, risks remain. As many have noted, the pandemic continues to drive economic developments both here and abroad. Notably, the resurgence in the pandemic could mean sidelined workers do not quickly return to the labor force. And even though the U.S. economy has found ways to power through shockingly high levels of public health distress and deaths, emerging market countries with low vaccination rates and protections may continue to struggle with the pandemic, which could fuel the spread of other variants. This could add to supply-side headwinds. Eventually, though, these disruptions should pass as Covid becomes more manageable both domestically and abroad. The supply chain disruptions we’ve seen will resolve. It’s hard to know the timing of this, but I expect most of the supply problems will be largely resolved as we move through next year.\nThis brings me to a very important factor in the inflation outlook, especially for 2023 and 2024. The lesson of the inflation of the ’70s and ’80s—and articulated so well earlier by Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps—is that to generate higher inflation in the long run, you have to generate higher long-run inflation expectations. We are not seeing that today. Importantly, in my view, the current surge in relative prices due to supply factors is not leaving a worrisome imprint on long-run inflation expectations.\nNow, as the minutes to the July FOMC meeting indicated, there is some disagreement on the Committee as to whether long-run inflation expectations currently are in ranges that are consistent with our goals.7 And several of my colleagues indicated they saw survey-based measures as signaling a risk that expectations could be moving above 2 percent. But I don’t subscribe to that view. I think long-run inflation expectations are still likely somewhat below target. Important for me in this judgment is the fact that inflation break-even rates in financial markets over the five- to ten-year horizon are still below the levels we saw in 2012 and 2013—a period when they were arguably better aligned with 2 percent PCE inflation. Let’s face it: A ten-year nominal Treasury rate in the range we’ve seen recently simply can’t have a whole lot of expectations of long-run inflation built into it.\nI think the FOMC’s own actions and communications are playing an important role in restraining long-run inflation expectations. After the Volcker era during which the Fed established its credibility as an inflation fighter, people reasonably expected that the Fed would not allow inflation to exceed 2 percent for very long. This interpretation seems consistent with many policymakers’ public expressions over the years of great discomfort at the prospect of inflation above 2 percent, but a more relaxed attitude whenever inflation was below 2 percent. Correcting too-low inflation often invoked talk that modest policy monitoring will eventually solidify inflation closer to 2 percent. But there was no sense of urgency in those communications and little sense of alarm at undershooting the inflation objective.\nIt’s almost like policymakers were following the ECB’s old policy goal—that is, to aim for inflation somewhat below, but close to 2 percent. This could create a downward bias to inflation, which has now been intensified by the heightened ELB inflation-undershoot risks. So, today, a policy mantra such as “above but close to 2 percent inflation” seems appropriate. Such an approach would naturally mitigate the downward bias by producing inflation above 2 percent during normal times in order to offset the periods of below-target inflation that occur when the economy is at the ELB for extended periods of time.\nIn any event, our new framework requires some kind of a different operational model than we have used in the past. And today is the first test of our commitment to this new view. It’s not surprising that the public may be thinking we have not really changed our ways and will rein in accommodation with the aim of a quick return in inflation back to 2 percent. If so, we have more work to do to convince them this is not the case and that we will tolerate a more sustained inflation overshoot.\nHere I have to ask if the median projected SEP inflation path is sufficient to solidify inflation expectations and inflation at our longer-run target. Though the modest overshooting projected from 2022 through 2024 is an improvement, I don’t think it is a strong signal of sustainable inflation above 2 percent. I feel we need to go beyond trying to thread the needle by a couple of tenths in order to be assured of a sustainable moderate overshoot.\nTaken altogether, I am more uneasy about us not generating enough inflation in 2023 and 2024 than the possibility that we will be living with too much. My concern is that when the Covid distress ultimately recedes broadly around the world, we will not have been freed from the downward bias on inflation imparted by the ELB.\nOf course, the ELB risk would be smaller if r* eventually rises. Is this in the cards? I think not. The factors we saw underpinning low r* prior to the pandemic still remain, with the possible exception of the larger fiscal debt and borrowing that are clearly ahead of us. But if the rising debt load is boosting r*, why is the ten-year Treasury rate so low? Markets see that debt coming, but pricing remains calm. So I don’t see fiscal deficits as providing monetary policy with more space.\nMonetary policy should aim to produce sustainable 2 percent inflation\nWhat does all of this mean for my views about the more-immediate questions surrounding balance sheet policy and potential upcoming interest rate moves?\nFor the balance sheet, I see the economy as being close to meeting the “substantial further progress” standard we laid out last December as the bar for beginning to taper our asset purchases.8 If the flow of employment improvements continues, it seems likely that those conditions will be met soon and tapering can commence.\nFuture decisions regarding the path of short-term policy rates seem much less clear to me at the moment. Recall that the criteria we laid out for funds rate liftoff are that 1) labor market conditions need to reach levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and 2) inflation needs to rise to 2 percent and be on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.9\nIf unemployment decreases in line with the SEP projections, I would view that as excellent progress and a very good outcome. However, by itself, a low unemployment rate would not dictate a change in policy rates. If not associated with an undesirable rate of inflation, I would be hard-pressed to be convinced that some kind of labor market dysfunctionality, such as widespread unproductive churning, would offset the benefits that low unemployment brings to American households.\nFor me, I still expect the key dual mandate issue governing liftoff will be inflation—and whether we are on the way to a sustainable level of inflation high enough to offset the downward bias created by the ELB. Now, I know the new long-run framework says our goal is for inflation to average 2 percent over time. And given the surge in inflation we are seeing today, it’s easy to pick a reasonably sized time frame over which inflation averages 2 percent.\nSome might see this arithmetic as justifying liftoff under our new framework sometime soon. But I do not subscribe to such an approach. Our new long-run framework was deliberately vague on the operational specifics of the period of time over which we were looking for inflation to average 2 percent, as well as the size and persistence of the overshooting we were seeking to generate. But the reason given for these operational tactics was clear: to anchor expectations for inflation over the long run at 2 percent. This anchoring should be the determinative criterion for the path of policy rates going forward—not whether inflation has mechanically averaged 2 percent over some particular time frame. Furthermore, even once we see a welcome rise in long-run expected inflation measures, we still have to follow through on policies that would validate those expectations. Otherwise, we could see expectations falling back, as occurred in 2010, 2011, and 2018. So this will be an important consideration for my policy views going forward.\nConclusion\nTo conclude, let me circle back to my original question: How much overshooting should we be contemplating? The answer is this: enough to appropriately align long-run inflation expectations with our average 2 percent inflation target, taking into account the likelihood of future visits to the effective lower bound.\nI do not think the supply-side-induced transitory surge in inflation we are seeing today will be enough to do the trick. I expect that we will need a period of sustained, monetary-policy-induced overshooting of 2 percent inflation to boost long-run inflation expectations enough to deliver on our mandated goals. Of course, I could be wrong about that, and I will be attuned to alternative data developments. The risks, however, are not symmetric. After all, one can handle an undesirably large overshoot with somewhat higher policy rates, but the ELB constrains what can be done to address undesirably low inflation.\nIn my view, to anchor long-run inflation expectations at 2 percent, we must be willing to accept inflation reasonably above 2 percent during the expansionary phase of a cycle to offset the underruns that would almost inevitably occur when the economy is at the ELB for extended periods of time.10 This would make any conservative central banker uncomfortable, but it is the lesson that has emerged from my 14 years of experience on the FOMC.\nPerhaps this is why I am drawn to operationalize our long-run framework using a tactic something like aiming for inflation that is above but close to 2 percent. Would this be sufficient? I don’t know, but some such change in the mentality of central bankers along such lines would probably go a long way toward more effectively achieving our policy goals in an economic environment permeated by the risks of the ELB.\nThank you.\nNotes\n1 Federal Open Market Committee (2020c).\n2 The FOMC’s inflation goal is measured by the annual change in the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index.\n3 Details on the Survey of Professional Forecasters, conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, are available online.\n4 Federal Open Market Committee (2021a). Four times a year the FOMC releases its Summary of Economic Projections, which presents FOMC participants’ forecasts of key economic variables over the next three years and for the longer run. Participants also provide their assessments of the appropriate monetary policy that supports those forecasts.\n5 NAIRU stands for non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment.\n6 The Phillips curve is a statistical relationship that describes a negative correlation between inflation and unemployment—that is, lower unemployment is associated with higher price and wage inflation. It is often drawn as a negatively sloped curve that has a measure of labor market tightness, such as the unemployment rate, on the horizontal axis and a measure of wage or price inflation on the vertical axis.

By intentionally raising the risk of inflation on the upside, it offsets the downside risk generated by the proximity of the ELB.

            "content": "PAUL TRAUB: Well, I guess I want to start by welcoming everybody to the-- I think we're live now, is what I've been told. So we're first going to open up with a special guest, Bill Strauss. I want to immediately kind of turn the microphone over to Bill Strauss. He's going to say a few remarks. Bill?\nWILLIAM STRAUSS: Good morning. Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everybody, from not so sunny Florida today.\nAs Paul mentioned, my name is Bill Strauss. I'm a recently retired from the Research Department at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago after more than 38 years working at the bank. This year has certainly been one for the books. In fact, January 13, 2020 seems much longer ago than just one year. We witnessed large parts of economies all around the world close their doors with devastating impacts.\nOne of the challenges of the COVID-19 is the issues surrounding having large gatherings. The Fed certainly has not been immune from this. However, like many dark clouds, this one has a silver lining. Because of remote technology, we were able to get together without needing to worry about physical group constraints.\nAnd as of this morning, we have over 500 attendees that have been registered from all around the globe. So that certainly is an advantage. So it's my pleasure to welcome everybody to the Automotive Insights Symposium.\nThis symposium came about by combining two separate events that were hosted at the Detroit branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. Last June should have been the 27th Annual Automotive Outlook Symposium. That was a symposium that was traditionally held on the Friday following Memorial Day. That conference was largely focused on the near-term outlook for light vehicle and medium and heavy duty truck side of the industry. We would, on occasion, offer an additional program on Thursday that would include either a tour of a facility or a special program focused on different aspects of the industry.\nThe other event being combined in today's symposium is the Chicago Fed's Automotive Insight Conference, which for the past four years was held in the middle of January in Detroit. This conference focused on more medium and longer term issues for the automotive industry as well as more technical issues. So this newly reorganized symposium will combine aspects of both the Automotive Outlook Symposium and the Automotive Insights Conference. After hosting the Automotive Outlook Symposium for the past 26 years, I was honored to be asked to welcome the group to this event, and I am pleased to see that the numbering has carried on, recognizing this as the 27th Annual Automotive Insights Symposium.\nSo today's program is exceedingly interesting with fantastic speakers, and I, like you, are looking forward to hearing them speak. We're going to start off the morning with the US economic outlook that Paul Traub will cover, followed by a session that will put the North America economy more in a global context. We're then going to shift to analyzing the North American sales and production outlook, and then, of course, over the past year, given the massive government spending to help support the economy, part of that impacts the automotive sector. So we're going to have a session that will look at the prospects for infrastructure industry incentives under the federal recovery policy.\nAnother topic that has become a bit more important with the incoming administration will be US fuel economy standards, and both federal policy as well as the California's directive will be analyzed. Our final topic of the day is one that is also deeply related to the changing of the administration, and that is looking at the industry perspectives on trade dynamics. So as you can see, we have an exceedingly exciting program that is going to be very timely for what the automotive industry is facing, both in the near term as well as medium and longer term aspects.\nAs a technical thing, one of the challenges of being remote is that you can't recognize people raising their hands as easily and having questions asked directly by attendees. So the process to ask questions will be to select on the Q&A box on the right side of your screen and to type in your question, and our moderators will be then asking many of the questions that are submitted. So it is now my pleasure to hand the baton off to my dear friend, Paul Traub, Senior Business Economist with the Chicago Fed, who will be hosting today's program and will be our opening speaker.\nPAUL TRAUB: All right. Thank you so much, Bill. It's great to see you back in the saddle again after all the years of running the AOS, and I'm sure there's a lot of people in the audience right now that remember you from there, so I wanted to thank you for taking that time to open up.\nI've been at the Fed now for 10 years. I've never seen anything like this. When I started in the auto industry way back, and I don't want to date myself, but back in the 1980s, things were so much different than they are now. And things are constantly changing.\nSo throughout this program, I think we're going to start seeing those changes as they're discussed. I'm going to take and share my screen so that we can work from here, and I'll move quickly. Now, I'm going to make some comments. I tend to say some things that are my personal opinions. They may not necessarily represent all the opinions of the Federal Reserve or the Open Market Committee or Charlie Evans, the President of our bank. That's one of the great pleasures of being at the Fed is that we share opinions, and I think the Fed, it's not recognized for the amount of power that it has in that regard.\nMy first slide is basically to kind of show you where we started with the overall economy. You can see that it fell pretty radically, dramatically, at the start of the pandemic. When things were kind of chunking along and doing quite well, normal growth rate somewhere around 2%, 2% to a half percent.\nThe pandemic hit. Things bottomed, and it cratered, and it came back quite quickly. And everybody was talking about this V-shaped recovery and how quickly it would recover.\nI'm using the blue chip analysis. This is from the earlier blue chip, which indicates that, given their forecast, we would not get back to full recovery, our previous peak, until sometime in the third quarter of this year. We'll discuss that as we move through. I think that that decision may be up to discussion as we go forward, as we see how things work out with the pandemic.\nWhen you break it down into C plus I plus G, which I always like to talk about, Consumption, Investment, net exports, Government spending, you can see the contributions in the last quarter was mostly personal consumption. We have consumed ourselves through this. So this V-shaped recovery, you hear the talk a lot of times about a more of a K-shaped recovery. It's doing better for some than it is for others. And we'll touch on that a bit. But consumption seems to be going unabated for those that have jobs and are continuing to earn income. Private investment picked up by almost 12% or contributed 12% to the growth rate of overall GDP. And as you can see, we had net exports, negative in government, negative in that number.\nOn the personal consumption side, 25.4% contribution. What's important to this is the fact that durable goods, nondurable goods did quite well. Services fell drastically at the start of the pandemic, and you can see that they were down considerably at the start. Nondurable goods held up that first quarter of the pandemic, and then durable goods now and nondurable goods have come back pretty strong. We are consuming our way out of this pandemic in a lot of ways, although services did jump its way back in this last quarter and is starting to return to where it was prior to the pandemic.\nReal disposable income growth was struggling around 3 and 1/2%, 3%, leading into the pandemic, and of course it started to fall, but then we came up with our first major package, and that's why you see that big jump in real disposable income. That's part of it, but also part of that jump is, who is left working? A lot of the jobs that were lost were low-paying jobs so that you take that mix split, and you add in the incentive monies that were put out there. You can see that helped. Because it wasn't ranges in salary disbursements, as they continued to fall and still are not back to where they were in growth rates prior to the pandemic.\nWhen you look at the amount of money that was thrown from the government into the economy, it's almost chilling in some ways. You can see personal income. So what this slide does is it compares all of these components, income compensation, proprietor's income, rental income, transfer payments, and compares them to where we were when the economy stepped off. And you can see that personal income was up $1.5 trillion, and most all of that is transfer payments. So those are transfer payments, including pandemic relief, other kinds of money that was given for payroll protection, paycheck protection, relief funds, Medicare reimbursements, those types of things.\nAnd in the following quarter, it's up another $1 trillion. So those are seasonally adjusted annualized rates, but in those terms, you're looking at over $3.5 trillion in stimulus. That helped the auto industry tremendously.\nConsumer sentiment fell. It's bouncing back, but it seems to be coming back slowly. It's up and down.\n80's not that bad, I think, when you look at where it was in 2012, 2013. That's kind of where we are when we were digging out of the Great Recession. You can see that 80's not that bad, but we like something closer to 100, but that's not that bad.\nRetail sales bounced back quickly. It had a big trough. As I said, we kind of consumed ourselves out of this. Retail sales bounced back, but most recent numbers were down on a month over month basis, as the economy seems to be starting to lose a little of the steam from the stimulus package. Now, there's another package coming out, and that'll probably help.\nNon-residential investment on the investment side, you can see, fell pretty strongly and is nowhere near where it was where we left off, and this could take a while before it gets back. You break that down into non-residential-type investment. A great way to look at it is what the purchasing managers are thinking.\nWhenever this index is above 50, they're looking at positiveness growth in manufacturing and the overall composite. The manufacturing index at 60 is quite strong as manufacturing is coming back online and people are starting to go back to work in that arena. This, again, remains to be seen how that holds up.\nIndustrial production, as you can tell, is still well below where it was when we came into the pandemic. So while manufacturing looks like it's doing quite well, we aren't outputting in industrial production what we were, although new orders are up. But this is great.\nI broke this into all manufacturing as transportation, and then I look at what is brought about in these vehicles. So what's the auto industry doing? And I guess this bodes again to how well the auto industry bounced back. When you look at overall manufacturing less transportation, it's still slightly below where we were coming in to the pandemic.\nWhen you look at gross private domestic investment, this is nonresidential structures. They were starting to slow even in the fourth quarter of last year. Then the pandemic hit, and they're starting to come back. I think this is one of the concerns is what's going on in the commercial market.\nThis parameter shows people entering buildings. So Kastle Systems, this is a brand new index. I must say that it hasn't been around long enough to do any seasonalizing of it, so you take it with a grain of salt. But it shows how much activity in office buildings has declined.\nThe Kastle Index is for top 10 cities. It uses a Wednesday of the last week each time to give a number. You can see that it's fallen tremendously.\nAnd this is a concern is, what's going to happen when the pandemic ends with office space and commercial property? Are we going to be able to see that return? And what's going to happen with that kind of real estate?\nOn the residential side, it's the complete opposite. It bounced back very strongly and is doing quite well. And you can see that when you look at overall housing starts and permits, way up, $1.5 million on both. You look at sales of existing homes. They're near levels we haven't seen since the 2005 pre-pandemic when during the housing bubble, that was a concern. Look at home prices. They've jumped way up.\nSo the housing market on this side, if you've got a home on the market and it's in good shape, it usually sells at or above asking price quite quickly. The problem with the availability is stock because there's not a lot of stock in that mid-range or lower range. It seems like the upper-range homes seem to be moving quite quickly.\nAnd that's being helped by what the Fed did to lower interest rates. So if you haven't refinanced your mortgage yet-- I've already did mine. You can see that it's being helped greatly by the interest rates.\nOne of the big concerns, though, and was kind of alleviated a little bit in the last fiscal package is the moratorium on delinquencies. So you can see delinquencies have shot way up. However, foreclosures are down, and a lot of that has to do with the fact that banks are holding off on foreclosures. So there's a big concern what happens if that moratorium is taken off with the housing market.\nOn the trade side, you can see that overall trade fell precipitously, and the deficit expanded pretty strongly. Over $1 trillion in deficit. I want to point to the way that the trade deficit is starting to expand. It starting, in say, in 2018. The deficit is starting to grow.\nAnd I'll point to the customs and duties receipts. This was the tariffs that were put on a lot of goods that the rise in the tariffs follows the rise in the trade deficit quite closely. A lot of research will be done on what impact these tariffs actually had on trade overall in the US economy.\nReal government consumption was quite strong, the strongest in the second quarter that it had been, contribution to overall GDP since the third quarter of 1986 and fell off pretty strongly. And the problem that continues is what's happening with the deficit. So now we're starting to hear a lot of talk about the deficit being bad. It wasn't so bad when the tax cuts were first put into place, and you can see the deficit was continuing to grow.\nThere were concerns and some of the Congressional Budget Office forecast that we would see the overall, by 2050, deficit be over 200% of GDP. And we're adding to that pretty strongly. I did hear Biden say the other day on TV about the fiscal stimulus plus infrastructure spending that while interest rates are so low, these might be the time to do it. And he's the first time I've heard that said by a politician. I've heard it by a lot of economists, but so we might see some infrastructure packages out of this going on.\nIt's not my job to talk a lot about the auto industry. You have a lot of other experts here. But I just want to talk about how quickly it bounced back. You can see how it cratered in April, and by December, we're selling over 16 million units again on a SAAR basis.\nThe reason why, in my mind, is that the buyer is not hurt. A lot of the people that buy automobiles are older. Almost a third of them are over 65 years old.\nThe average salaries-- or this is a 2015 study by NADA. I've actually heard Christian Zajac use a number of over $100,000 now. So you can see that these are not the people that need to be left out of the economy. So they came back strong.\nAnd at the same time, prices grew, not only on new, but used. You can see the December year over year up 15%. When you look at overall CPI in November, it was just 1.2%. So we're seeing a big jump in prices as incentives were taken down.\nAnd this is debt by category, and I kind of wanted to show this because it shows how, if you look at the auto line, in 2000 and 2005, it's declining down. So as a percentage of overall debt, auto loans were starting to decline. But starting in 2010, 2012 as more and more vehicles turned to being trucks and SUVs, you can start to see that, as a percentage of overall debt, it started to rise.\nBut the big non-surprise is what's happened, though, to student loans. Now they account for 10.8% of overall debt. Now, mortgages are still around 70% of that debt.\nBut so these are all debt categories less mortgages. But you can see that now this is one of the things that is very concerning as younger people come into the marketplace. Are they going to be able to buy automobiles, or are they going to be paying down debt?\nIncentive spend has fallen in the recent months, and that's one of the things that's pushing that transaction price. But you look at overall annual rate of spending. It's 11.8% in 2020, very close to 2018, 2019. So overall for the year, they spent pretty close as a percentage of transaction price.\nUS light vehicle production cratered tremendously, and you can see that in this chart. I don't have December numbers yet, and I know Haig Stoddard will go into this in a lot more detail. I don't want to talk about it, but we're still about 3.3 million down vehicles in March to June compared to the same three months last year. We don't look like we've made that up, if you look at the inventory to sales ratio. So in some segments of the economy, it is very tight.\nWe also, when we look at what's going on with the overall trend, I'm a big trend believer that sales will always revert to trend. What is trend? I've spent decades studying trend, and you can look at in the '70s, '80s, and '90s, on an average from peak to peak, growth was about 135,000 a year. Since 2000, from peak to peak, it grew 6,250 per year. And this falldown to 14.5 million is about a 15% drop from that 17 million trend, and that's consistent with the way we've always analyzed the industry when I was in the industry.\nI think we could go a long time with peaks in the 17 millions. If my forecast from the 1990s were still being shown, we'd be in the 18 millions by now, and that doesn't seem to be happening. And a lot of that, I think, has to do with price, our companies giving up volume for margin.\nHousehold formation, another thing that's driving it down where I think that the trend is going to stay below that 18 million level for quite some time as percent change in households is declining. And even the number of persons in each household is going down. So the population growth is quite slow.\nLicensed driver growth has declined pretty strongly, and from 1951 to 1984, we added 93.2 million drivers. For that same period, '85 to 2019, we added just 72 million, so over 20 million fewer drivers added.\nAnd people aren't driving as far. I highlighted in red the six years, seven months that it took to get back to vehicle miles traveled that we lost in the Great Recession. You could see it started to decline in 2007. It took quite a while, and with this decline, it's going to be remaining to see how long it takes us to get back to vehicle miles traveled that are consistent with where we were when we left, and this too will add to, I think, vehicles lasting longer.\nThis chart here is a sales weighted age index that I created, and if we follow this pattern, even if we do, say, 16 million next year, I think it's going to be, could be three to five years before we get back to the peak again and sales start to get back to that 17 million range, but that's my perception. On the labor side, or the monetary policy side, you can see markets, how high the unemployment rate shot. It fell back down. Right now, it's two months in a row 6.7%.\nBut the participation rate is way down, and that's helping to keep the unemployment rate down. If you leave your job and leave the labor force, you're not considered unemployed. So you can see the labor force down considerably. From its peak, it fell 8.1 million from peak to April and has clawed some of that back but has been moving sideways for the last number of months as people are not coming back into the labor force.\nSo the unemployment rate, when you break it down by race and gender, this is what I was talking about, the K. You look at African-Americans, Hispanics, they're not doing as well as whites, and women aren't doing as well as men. But when you look at the reason why, it's because more women left the labor force than men.\nThere's still this bias that maybe women need to stay home and take care of the children. I'm not sure. But you can start to see that even though the unemployment rate for women is the same as men, a lot more of them have left the labor force.\nOn the job losers, temporary job losers were starting to trend down in the last month. It actually went up. So people that are unemployed persons expecting to return to work, that jumped up by 277,000, while permanent job losses fell by 348,000, so unemployed persons who employed was ended involuntarily that lost their job. So these numbers seem to be kind of flattening out. Some switch between temporary and permanent job loss.\nUnemployment claims continue to stay around 700,000. That should be 778,000. It's a typo there. I apologize.\nAnd you can see that last month, 778,000. But it's really right there. It's kind of stuck there at that near 800,000 number. And so when you look at the non-farm payroll jobs, you can actually lost 140,000 jobs in the most recent report, down from the previous month.\nAverage hourly earnings jumped way up. Again, I talked about earlier, this is the split, the mix of jobs, who's got jobs and who doesn't. That's part of it. But you can see that we hear a lot about-- this month over month. We hear a lot about wage growth.\nIt's starting to come back. You can see that, on a month over month basis, we're doing better now than we did prior to the recession as it's getting harder and harder. We hear from all employers, it's more and more and more difficult to find qualified people to take on the jobs that are open.\nBut you can see, when I talk about that wage, the people that have lost the jobs, 23% of all jobs lost-- or down 23% are leisure and hospitality. They're over a third of all jobs lost, and they only made $17 an hour. So this is one of the reasons why wages may be looking to be growing faster than they are. It's that mix again.\nOn inflation, you can see there is none from the perspective of the Fed. We're shooting for a target of 2% in the long run, but you can see that it's well below 2%. However, there has been an increase in food at home, prices rising, and it's causing food insecurity, and now we're starting to hear more concerns about housing insecurity. As we were coming closer to the end of the fiscal stimulus, a lot of people are behind in their home payments, and so this is now a rising concern.\nThe stock market volatility has leveled off from the work of the Fed. You can see that volatility during the prior to, during, and now following is pretty close to where we were as you look at the volatility in the stock market. However, this is interesting that the TIPS inflation expectation has risen to close to 2% in the most recent data. You can start to see that the market's starting to see areas of possible inflation.\nTravel could be one. Service areas when things start to open, there's going to be a lot of constraint in getting workers back as the economy starts to open. So there are some concerns that inflation will come back.\nThe yield curve at over 100 is very good, so the work that the Fed has done to create liquidity in their lending system seems to be working with a yield curve, the 10 minus 1 and the 10 minus 3, well over 100 now, which is quite strong. Economic projections for the Federal Reserve. You can see we are looking this year will be down about 2.4% on a fourth quarter over fourth quarter basis, and you start to look at what's going to happen. It would be strong growth for '21, '22, but the long-run potential, still about 1.8%.\nUnemployment rate could get back to, say, 4.2%, which would be considered close to NAIRU and lower than that, but not until 2022 or 2023. And inflation expectations remain below 2% throughout the long run. Core inflation below that. So right now, the stance of the Fed is to keep interest rates very accommodative, and right now, the position is they will stay very accommodative all the way through 2023.\nAll of this is going to depend on what happens to COVID. These are January 11 numbers. Daily death average, seven-day average, over 3,200 daily cases, over 244,000. So it's all going to depend on what happens with the virus, I think, going forward.\nSo I won't go into all of this. It's a high chart, but the economy's been very resilient. The labor markets are rebounding, but not for everybody, only for certain sectors with unemployment claims hovering around 800,000. Production declined sharply at the start of the rebound but has rebounded close to pandemic levels, but with sale levels near that, it's going to be hard for a while to make up some of those inventory shortfalls.\nFederal Reserve, we took extreme actions. Stimulus package seem to have worked. However, we don't know how much more we're going to need. So what's going to be necessary in magnitude, timing, and duration?\nAnd economic forecasts say we don't get back to the previous peak until sometime in 2021, depending on how well the vaccines get out. Right now, there's been a real delay in getting vaccines out. I'm eligible but can't get it, and so we'll see how that plays out.\nSo that's kind of what I wanted to open up with, kind of set the stage for the discussions that will be coming shortly. And at this point, I think we may have a couple minutes for questions, but we want to stay on task as much as possible. Do we have any questions, or do we want to take our short break as we get ready for Emily to come on stage?\nThank you for the time. I'm not seeing any Q&A at this point. If you have questions, you can send them in through the chat box. That's where we're taking questions.\nAnd I'll be around all day. You can find me in the list of attendees, and you can send me a chat if you have a question. So at this point, we're going to take a short break and come back as we get ready to bring Emily on. Thank you very much.\n\n",

And our deep thanks to Olusayo and her colleagues at the Sadie Collective for pioneering this event and partnering with us to create the fantastic program that we have put together for you. This is the second Career Pathways event, and we hope there will be many more! It has become the cornerstone of our partnership with the Sadie Collective, and we look forward to building on this foundation in the years to come.\nJust like a year ago, this two-day event is again being conducted virtually. If anything, this reminds us of how long this pandemic has disrupted our lives—and its long-lasting devastating impacts on our families and our communities. After the deep and sharp downturn in economic activity last year, we have seen strong economic growth. However, challenges abound, as evidenced by widespread bottlenecks in supply chains and labor markets. A common element in all this continues to be high uncertainty—as new variants of the Covid-19 virus are impacting health and safety across the country. At the same time, the rapid development of vaccines offers great promise. We are not out of the woods yet. But we’re in a much better place than a year ago.\nWhat is the Fed’s role in times like these? I’ve been president and CEO of the Chicago Fed for the past 14 years. We at the Chicago Fed—together with our colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee and across the entire Federal Reserve System—have tried to match the severity of the Covid-19 crisis with the size of our response, using all of the powers we’ve been granted by Congress. But as big and powerful as our tools are, they are limited by our role as a central bank.\nOur policy tools are unable to address many of the systemic inequities that we have seen laid bare by this crisis. For too long, even when the economy was stronger, racism and other barriers limited opportunities for Black women. So, as much as the unfolding economic recovery and an improving employment picture are helping many people, just getting back to where we were before the pandemic is not enough. Progress on systemic health inequality and issues of economic inequality will require broader changes in society and policy.\nWhile our policy toolkit has its limitations, we do have to be proactive about implementing the changes we can to bring about greater diversity and inclusion. At the Chicago Fed, we continually work to move these critical conversations and policy changes forward. We do this in a number of ways—by creating a diverse work environment purposefully and by supporting efforts to do likewise throughout the Federal Reserve System; by investing in our own research and thought leadership on economic inclusion; by working closely with financial service institutions to further improve inclusion efforts in the industry as a whole; and by engaging in discussions about racism and other barriers to economic opportunities—for instance, in our Project Hometown conference series and the Federal Reserve System’s Racism and the Economy conference series. Tomorrow, you’ll hear more about our internal efforts and some of the new resources that our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion team has created for our employees.\nWe are proud to cosponsor this two-day event. It represents a truly collaborative effort intended to provide Black students with opportunities to explore career pathways in economics and related professions. The intent of the event is to welcome you into these professions, support you, and show you how you can thrive in these fields. We have hired Sadie Collective Fellows into our internship program and plan to hire more each summer.\nIn closing, let me point out a specific example of how we are opening doors to the economics profession through our collaboration with the Sadie Collective: Ryan Perry, currently a senior at the University of Michigan, attended last year’s inaugural Career Pathways event. She participated in the career fair, and subsequently applied for a summer internship with the Chicago Fed. Ryan accepted our offer of a position and spent 12 weeks this summer working on our Community Development and Policy Studies team. During that time, she helped develop the material for this year’s data workshop, which she will present tomorrow!\nToday and tomorrow, you’ll hear from panels of economists and research assistants, learn more about the tools of economics research, and have the opportunity to participate in a career fair. We’re especially excited to hear from Cecilia Rouse—the first Black individual to chair the Council of Economic Advisers. Let me now turn it over to Ramzee Nwokolo, a first-year research assistant with the Chicago Fed, who will be the MC for today’s program.\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n",

            "content": "Introduction and disclaimer\nThank you for that introduction and the opportunity to participate alongside these distinguished panelists in today’s important discussion on the monetary policy challenges ahead. Before I begin, let me note that these views are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\nMany commentators have warned that the U.S. economy is on a path to high inflation and that monetary policy should be repositioning to counter that. Yet this commentary often is pretty loose on the exact mechanisms generating the inflation. Analysts cite the risk of a seriously overheating U.S. economy and then invoke the specter of high inflation. But just how high and how persistent might these feared increases be? These obviously are crucial things for policymakers to understand and assess. So I want to talk about them today—in particular the roles that resource pressures and inflation expectations might play in the path for inflation over the next few years.\nInflation and developing resource gaps\nTo set the stage, the FOMC has an average inflation target of 2 percent as measured by the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), which is shown in the left-hand panel of this chart.\nAs you well know, following the Great Financial Crisis, PCE inflation had only briefly reached 2 percent a couple of times prior to the pandemic. Inflation then plummeted as the pandemic depressed demand for many goods and services. Recently, in March, core inflation popped up to 1.8 percent,1 and given the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading, we’re likely to see a big move up in April’s PCE inflation report.\nThe factors behind these increases are well known: the base effects of last year’s price declines dropping out of the 12-month calculation; the normalizing rebound of prices in sectors hard hit by the pandemic; and supply-side cost pressures associated with a fast-growing economy. And we certainly are hearing a lot about these cost pressures today. However, as challenging as they are for certain households and businesses, these developments largely reflect relative price changes to new equilibrium levels—and relative price changes by themselves have only transitory effects on inflation.\nHow should we assess the risks of a serious, longer-lasting inflation problem? Many commentators who argue that this higher inflation danger is right around the corner are doing so in reference to the recently enacted American Rescue Plan Act, or ARP. For example, Larry Summers (2021a, 2021b) has said the fiscal support is too big and will overheat the economy. But the precise inflation mechanisms and magnitudes are often left unstated.\nTwo economists on my staff, Jonas Fisher and Leo Melosi, along with Francesco Bianchi at Duke, went through an exercise to flesh out some representative mechanisms.2 They first considered the potential impact of the American Rescue Plan Act on the unemployment rate under a few scenarios regarding how much and how quickly appropriations from the plan might be spent.3\nTheir results are shown in the right-hand panel of the slide, along with the February 2021 baseline CBO forecast, which did not include the fiscal package. In each scenario, the unemployment rate falls quickly and significantly below baseline. The largest and most persistent impact is in what they call the smoothing scenario—in which the unemployment rate falls somewhat below its pre-pandemic level of 3.5 percent for three consecutive quarters, starting in the fourth quarter of 2021.4\nResource pressures and inflation\nWhat are the consequences for inflation? Well, here you need a model that relates resource pressures to inflation. So Francesco, Jonas, and Leo ran each scenario through different versions of the workhorse inflation-expectations-augmented Phillips curve.\nThe first version is the New Keynesian Phillips Curve, which in addition to slack includes short-run inflation expectations, but has no lagged inflation in it. The second is a model from 2015 that Janet Yellen liked to use in her public discourse when she was Fed Chair. Its key differences from the New Keynesian model is its dependence on long-run inflation expectations and inclusion of lagged values of inflation. Francesco, Jonas, and Leo consider a linear version and a simple nonlinear specification in which resource pressures have larger effects on inflation at very low levels of unemployment.5 Their last specification is a behavioral model in which inflation expectations are adaptive—so higher actual inflation will boost expectations. The model also incorporates “speed effects,” in which not only the level of, but the change in, the unemployment gap influences inflation. This arguably proxies for things like supply-side bottlenecks that arise as an economy recovers quickly.\nSo, what did they find? Because the smoothing scenario generates a larger and more persistent output gap than the others, I’m going to concentrate on that case. If we had started off with inflation at our 2 percent average objective in the first quarter of 2021 rather than below it, in both the New Keynesian and Yellen models, PCE inflation tops out somewhere around 2-1/2 percent. And this modestly higher level doesn’t last that long, largely reverting to target in two or three years.\nOnly the behavioral model yielded some larger and persistently higher numbers. Here, PCE inflation increases to about 3 percent, and a feedback loop between higher actual inflation and inflation expectations meant the higher rate was largely maintained several years out.\nInflation expectations are key\nThe lessons from this exercise are well known. The coefficient on resource utilization in the Phillips curve is small, so that resource pressures on their own will have a limited impact on inflation.6 Furthermore, even these modest effects will go away as those pressures dissipate. To generate larger and persistently higher inflation, you need higher inflation expectations. Households and businesses must incorporate a higher underlying rate of inflation into their plans for the future; and as these plans take hold, they become embedded in actual inflation itself.\nNow it turns out that the behavioral model’s feedback between actual inflation and inflation expectations was estimated using data that include the 1970s and ’80s. We “seasoned veterans” remember we usually estimated accelerationist Phillips curves for these periods. In these models the change—not the level—of inflation is driven by the output gap, so even if resource pressures were eliminated, inflation would remain at its new higher level. If resource pressures were maintained, inflation would continue to spiral upward. And theory gave us a very credible underpinning for this result: It could be explained by a strong and long-lasting sensitivity of inflation expectations to recent inflation experience.\nIt seems to me that such an accelerationist view is on the minds of many of those warning about an outbreak of inflation today. Once the burst of post-pandemic relative price level adjustments is behind us and with the impetus from fiscal support receding, the path to unacceptably high and persistent inflation in 2022 and beyond likely relies on an accelerationist story line.\nI think this risk is low. Prior to the pandemic, when the unemployment rate was at a historically low 3.5 percent, inflation certainly wasn’t spiraling upward. Furthermore, given the low rates of inflation experienced over the past 15 years, inflation expectations likely drifted noticeably below 2 percent. However, even with their increases in recent weeks, survey measures and inflation compensation priced into Treasury rates over the five- to ten-year horizon are just back to where they were in 2013, which certainly are not levels suggesting inflation is spiraling out of control. And I’d emphasize that the market assessments are occurring in an environment where fiscal support and deficit financing are well known to investors. Indeed, I have to say that these increases have been welcome—if they persist, then they will help us make some real progress toward reaching our average inflation target.\nOf course, measures of inflation expectations are imperfect. We need to watch all of the data very closely. The challenge will be to cut through the effects of temporary supply pressures and post-pandemic price renormalization to get a clearer picture of underlying inflation dynamics. This won’t be an easy task. But it is important to emphasize that the recent increase in inflation does not appear to be the precursor of a persistent movement to undesirably high levels of inflation. I have not seen anything yet to persuade me to change my full support of our accommodative stance for monetary policy or our forward guidance about the path for policy.\nThank you.\nNotes\n1 While the FOMC’s inflation objective is stated in terms of overall inflation measured by the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures, core inflation—which strips out the volatile food and energy sectors—is a better gauge of sustained inflationary pressures and where inflation is headed in the future.\n2 See Bianchi, Fisher, and Melosi (2021).\n3 These scenarios, as summarized in Bianchi, Fisher, and Melosi (2021), are as follows.\nNo smoothing: This path uses estimates of the impact on gross domestic product (GDP) from the various provisions of ARP from Edelberg and Sheiner (2021), along with assumptions about when the provisions will be spent. This path takes on board Karger and Rajan’s (2021) finding that the CARES Act checks sent to households were spent quickly.\nSmoothing: This path also uses the impact estimates from Edelberg and Sheiner (2021), but allocates the spending more gradually over time.\nConservative: This path assumes a time pattern of spending similar to the no-smoothing case, but assumes smaller impact estimates.\nFor each scenario, the authors calculate the ARP-adjusted output gap expressed as the percentage point deviation of projected GDP from the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) estimate of potential. They then use Okun’s law to get an unemployment rate gap, and apply it to the baseline projection to generate an unemployment rate. They assume that the ARP has no impact on potential output.\n4 The median FOMC participant’s most recent estimate of the longer-run unemployment rate is 4.0 percent; see Federal Open Market Committee (2021).\n5 Yellen (2015).\n6 As an example of recent work documenting this, I would point you to a paper by Hazell et al. (2021) that controls for simultaneity bias by analyzing state variation in prices for tradable goods and still finds that the Phillips curve is quite flat.\nReferences\nBianchi, Francesco, Jonas D.

            "content": "\n\nIntroduction\nThank you for the opportunity to speak with you today; it’s a great pleasure to share some of my thoughts with you on the course of the economy. But before I begin, I should note that these views are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\nNeedless to say, it has been a very challenging year in so many respects. With regard to the Fed, we, as the monetary policy authority, still have some ways to go before we reach our dual mandate goals of maximum and inclusive employment and inflation that averages 2 percent. We also face many uncertainties and risks on the road ahead. But I am very optimistic about our economy’s growth prospects, and am hopeful that our employment goal will be in sight before too long. Yet, despite some recent price increases, achieving our inflation goal may prove more difficult.\nThe large and uneven impact of the pandemic\nThe pandemic has had a devastating impact on our nation. It has taken a horrible number of lives and caused immeasurable hardship in so many different ways. It is difficult to overstate the human costs of this tragedy. Economic developments over the past year have been largely dictated by the pandemic and our efforts to contain it. After huge declines in output with the onset of the pandemic, the economy rebounded sharply in the second half of last year, and it is moving forward with a good deal of momentum so far in 2021. Indeed, I—like most forecasters—have been surprised by its resiliency.\nA key reason for this resiliency has been the ability of so many households, businesses, and nonprofit organizations to successfully adapt and operate safely in the midst of the pandemic. Consequently, activity in many sectors of the economy, such as manufacturing, has returned near—or even surpassed—its pre-pandemic level. The efforts have been truly impressive. Part of this resiliency also is due to the support provided by fiscal and monetary policies.1 Throughout the crisis and recovery, federal funds flowing to the private sector and state and local governments, along with low borrowing rates, have helped support the economy.2\nOne not-surprising feature of the recovery is that sectors of the economy where in-person contact is not necessary are doing much better than those for which social distancing is more difficult. For example, consumer spending on housing, autos, and other goods has increased at a solid pace.3 In contrast, despite recent improvements, the leisure and hospitality sector is still suffering immensely. Indeed, before the pandemic, employment in leisure and hospitality accounted for only about a tenth of total payrolls in the economy. Yet the job losses in this sector accounted for nearly 40 percent of the 8.5 million shortfall in total employment that we saw in March 2021 relative to its pre-pandemic level in February 2020.4\nThe impact of the pandemic has been uneven across a number of other dimensions as well. For example, because a disproportionate number of women, minorities, and lower-wage workers are employed in leisure and hospitality or other vulnerable sectors, these demographic groups have been particularly hard hit. Worryingly, these shifts are magnifying the longstanding inequalities among these segments of our society. And depending on the path of the recovery, some of the recent changes may leave unfortunate longer-lasting marks as well. Our economy cannot fully recover if a substantial portion of the population is left behind.\nAll told, even though the economy is recovering, we still have a long way to go before economic activity returns to its pre-pandemic vibrancy. Even after the very strong March employment report, at 6.0 percent, the unemployment rate is well above the 3.5 percent we saw on the eve of the pandemic. And many other workers have stopped looking for a job and exited the labor force.\nOptimistic outlook for growth\nDespite these numerous hardships, I am optimistic that the economy is poised for strong growth later this year, which will bring with it further significant improvements in the labor market. One important reason for my optimism is that we have made good progress on the health front. Though caseloads are still worrisome, the numbers are much lower than they were at the turn of the year. Moreover, each day more and more people are getting vaccinated, and hopefully, before too long, much of the population will be able and willing to resume activities such as traveling, attending events, and dining out.5\nFiscal policy will also provide a big boost to the economy. Over the past five months, we have seen two large stimulus packages enacted: the $900 billion in relief from the Consolidated Appropriations Act in late December and the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act, or ARP, in early March. This legislation provides further direct stimulus payments to individuals; extends unemployment insurance and lending to small businesses; provides substantial funding to state and local governments; and authorizes spending on programs such as those for vaccines and testing, childcare, housing assistance, and education.6\nWith these developments, my outlook for growth and unemployment is much more positive today than it was just a few months ago. Since my forecast is similar to those made by my colleagues on the FOMC, let me discuss mine in the context of theirs. Four times a year each FOMC participant provides projections of key economic variables. These are released in our Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP—the most recent of which came out in mid-March.7 The median forecast in the SEP for gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2021 was 6.5 percent. This quite strong figure reflects the return to more normal operations in sectors still impacted by the virus today, as well as the big boost from fiscal policy. As these factors run their course, growth is then expected to moderate to 3.3 percent next year and 2.2 percent in 2023.8 The median FOMC participant sees the unemployment rate declining steadily from 6.0 percent today to 4.5 percent by the end of this year and then to 3.5 percent by the end of 2023—finally bringing us back to the mark we saw prior to the pandemic.\nOf course, there is a lot of uncertainty underlying these projections. A very important one surrounds the path for the virus. My base case is that the virus will become much less of a public health concern by the second half of this year. But that is not assured; and there are downside risks if people become less vigilant or if vaccine hesitancy or vaccine-resistant variants of the virus impede the immunization process.\nAnother is the speed at which hard-hit sectors will be able to resume business. Will the return to normal be like flipping a switch, where activity and employment in sectors such as leisure and hospitality return to high levels fairly quickly as demand reappears? Or will significant start-up costs or sticky labor force adjustments slow the return? The potential for longer-term structural changes in some sectors, such as retailing and commercial real estate, pose similar questions about the path ahead.\nThe size and timing of the impact from fiscal policy also are uncertain. For example, with regard to the stimulus payments, those whose livelihoods have been most severely harmed by the pandemic will spend them quickly, but others will save theirs and spend them gradually.9 Similar uncertainties surround other elements of the recent fiscal packages. And then there is the possibility that further spending and tax changes will be coming soon. So, we could see more—or less—impact from fiscal policy than I’ve built into my projections.\nInflation and inflation dynamics\nLet me turn now to the price stability element of our dual mandate. This is a far more nuanced story. To set the stage, the FOMC has an inflation target of 2 percent.10 Since the Great Financial Crisis, inflation has persistently run under our target, only fleetingly touching 2 percent a couple of times prior to the pandemic. The pandemic further depressed inflation as demand plummeted for many goods and services, with outright price declines in sectors hardest hit by the pandemic, such as air travel and hotel accommodations. To be sure, prices rose for other items that were in higher demand—such as hand sanitizers, autos, and household appliances. But if you look at the overall basket of goods and services purchased by households—as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy (or core PCE for short)—inflation has declined from 1.9 percent just before the pandemic to 1.4 percent this past February.11 Core PCE inflation then popped up to 1.8 percent in March.\nI was not surprised to see such an increase, and I expect to see some further pickup in inflation in the coming months. Part of the increase will be purely mechanical as the low inflation reading from April of last year falls out of the 12-month calculation—a factor that boosted year-over-year inflation in March as well.12 In addition, as the virus subsides and people resume normal activities, demand should pick up further for those goods and services that are most affected by the pandemic, pulling their prices up to more typical levels. Finally, we are seeing supply chain bottlenecks develop as activity picks up rapidly in some sectors, and these can contribute to temporary price pressures in selected industries. We’ve all read about issues with steel, computer chips, construction materials, appliances, and other items.\nBut what happens once prices renormalize and supply chains adjust? Will inflation just settle back down to 1-1/2 percent, or will we see a more persistent increase in underlying inflation? And if we do see persistently higher inflation, how much higher will that inflation be?\nA number of economists have been warning that persistently higher inflation is coming. This has generally been in the context of the effects of the American Rescue Plan Act. They argue that the ARP is too big, will overheat the economy, and will generate higher inflation that we really ought to be worried about. But two important questions often are left unaddressed in their arguments: How high is this higher inflation? And what is the mechanism generating it?\nTo understand these concerns, you need to have some coherent framework for thinking about the inflationary process. The standard inflation-expectations-augmented Phillips curve model is one such framework. This model tells you that inflation is related to economic slack, supply shocks, inertia in the inflation process, and inflation expectations. This is the model Janet Yellen often used when she was Fed Chair to frame her discussions about inflation.\nTwo economists on my staff—Jonas Fisher and Leo Melosi—looked at a few alternative scenarios for inflation that might accompany the ARP.13 They took some standard calibrations of the resource pressures that might be generated and then ran those through several versions of the inflation-expectations-augmented Phillips curve. What did they find? In most of the models, the increase in PCE inflation relative to baseline over the next several quarters is fairly modest—topping out somewhere between 1/2 and 3/4 percentage points. And these increases don’t last that long, largely dissipating in two or three years.\nOne specification did yield some larger and persistently higher readings on inflation. This was a model in which inflation expectations were assumed to vary with recent inflationary experience and included so-called speed effects, in which the change in unemployment, not just its level, influences inflation. Here, PCE inflation increased by about a percentage point in some scenarios, and a feedback loop between higher actual inflation and inflation expectations meant the higher rate was largely maintained several years out.\nThe lessons from these exercises are well known. The coefficient on resource utilization in the Phillips curve is small, so that resource pressures on their own will have a limited impact on inflation. As an example of recent work documenting this, I would point you to a paper by Jonathon Hazell and co-authors that controls for simultaneity bias by analyzing state variation in prices for tradable goods and still finds that the Phillips curve is quite flat.14 Furthermore, even the modest effects of resource pressures on inflation will go away as those pressures dissipate. To generate larger and persistently higher inflation, you need higher inflation expectations.15 That is, you need to see households and businesses begin to incorporate a higher underlying rate of inflation into their decisions today and their plans for the future. As these plans take hold, they become embedded in actual inflation itself and, in a self-fulfilling process, justify the beliefs.\nNow it turns out that to get the results in those higher-inflation simulations, Jonas and Leo estimated the feedback between actual inflation and inflation expectations using data going back to 1959. We “seasoned veterans” remember that when working with data from the 1960s, ‘70s, and ‘80s, we usually estimated accelerationist Phillips curves, in which the change—not the level—of inflation was driven by the output gap. In these models, even if resource pressures were eliminated, inflation would remain at its new higher level. If resource pressures were maintained, inflation would continue to spiral upward. And theory gave us a very credible underpinning for this accelerationist result: It could be explained by a strong and long-lasting sensitivity of inflation expectations to recent inflation experience.\nIt seems to me that such an accelerationist view is on the minds of many of those warning about an outbreak of inflation today. I think the risk of this scenario is remote. Inflation certainly wasn’t spiraling upward prior to the pandemic, when the unemployment rate was at a historically low 3.5 percent. Furthermore, given the low inflation experienced over the past 15 years, inflation expectations have likely drifted noticeably below 2 percent. For example, the ten-year Treasury rate is just 1.6 percent today. That low rate can hardly reflect outsized inflation expectations on the part of financial market participants. Even with the increases we’ve seen in recent weeks, inflation compensation priced into Treasury rates over the five- to ten-year horizon are still noticeably below where they were in 2012 and 2013—a period when one might argue that inflation expectations were more aligned with our 2 percent target. So there is no evidence that inflation expectations are spiraling out of control.\nIndeed, I have to say that I hope we do get some feedback between actual inflation and inflation expectations as we move through the year. If expectations move up, then we could make some real progress toward reaching our inflation target. So, we will be watching measures of inflation expectations very carefully. And I would not be concerned about inflation moving persistently too high unless we saw some quite outsized movements in financial market pricing at the longer maturities or in survey-based measures of inflation expectations.\nWhat are forecasters looking for? Well, according to the March SEP, the median FOMC participant sees core inflation rising to 2.2 percent by the end of this year and then slowing to 2.0 next year before moving up slightly to 2.1 percent in 2023. That’s better than the 1.8 percent we have today. And while I can’t speak for others on the Committee, my outlook is consistent with some increase in longer-run inflation expectations. But does it mean we’ve reached our inflation goal?\nPolicy to remain accommodative for some time\nBefore I answer this question, let me say a few words about our policy goals. Congress gave the Federal Reserve a dual mandate to achieve maximum employment and price stability. Last August, after a lengthy review, the FOMC revised our long-run strategy statement that operationalizes this mandate.16 First, we stated that our employment goal is broad-based and inclusive and that our aim is to eliminate shortfalls of employment from our assessment of its maximum level.17 The term “shortfalls” is significant—in the past we characterized our employment mandate in terms of eliminating deviations from some long-run normal level of employment. Under the new framework, the FOMC will not be concerned about high employment—or low unemployment—unless it is also associated with undesirable inflationary pressures.\nWith regard to our price stability objective, we indicated we want to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time. This averaging is important in order to center longer-term inflation expectations at 2 percent and thus achieve our target on a persistent basis. Therefore, if inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, we need to have inflation overshoot our goal moderately for some time to bring the average back to 2 percent.\nAs you know, even before we adopted this new framework, monetary policymakers responded to the pandemic swiftly and strongly. In order to support the overall economy, we brought the federal funds rate down to nearly zero, introduced a host of liquidity and credit facilities, and purchased U.S. government securities on a large scale. While the emergency actions are behind us, today the fed funds rate remains near zero and we continue to purchase securities at a pace of $120 billion per month.\nI expect monetary policy will have to remain accommodative for some time to ensure that we meet the policy goals laid out in our new framework. With regard to our employment mandate, an important gauge is the unemployment rate. The median FOMC participant estimates that the longer-run unemployment rate is 4.0 percent. In other words, after the effects of various shocks to the economy dissipate, the unemployment rate should naturally settle at 4.0 percent. The median FOMC forecast has the unemployment rate falling below this level by the end of 2022. So, our employment mandate is within sight. Now, the median inflation forecast I just mentioned is at or somewhat above 2 percent. But after years of underrunning our target, in my view those increases and, down the road, some even higher rates of inflation are needed to get inflation to average 2 percent and to solidify inflation expectations about that number. So, I see the need for continued accommodative monetary policy to reach our goals.\nWhat does this mean in terms of our policy tools? The FOMC statements, released after each meeting, provide some guidance. The one we just issued in April reaffirmed that it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to purchase assets until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals.18 Judging from the most recent SEP, those conditions will not be met for a while. The median FOMC participant expects the federal funds rate to stay in its current low range of 0 to 1/4 percent through at least the end of 2023. So, policy is likely on hold for some time.\nConclusion\nIn sum, we still have quite a way to go before we return to pre-pandemic levels of employment, but given the growth prospects for the economy, I am confident that we will be making good progress toward our inclusive employment objective over the next couple of years. I expect inflation will pick up in the near to medium term, but a firming in inflation expectations will still be needed to achieve our goal of averaging 2 percent inflation over the longer run.\nThank you.\nNotes\n1 The $2.2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020, and an additional $900 billion in relief was provided as part of a government spending bill called the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, which was enacted on December 27, 2020. More recently, the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act (ARP) was signed into law on March 11, 2021. These bills have provided loans to businesses, direct payments and other benefits to individuals, and funding to health care providers and state and local governments, as well as other support to various segments of the economy.\n2 For instance, following the most recent round of stimulus payments, personal income in March 2021 from wages and salaries plus pandemic relief provided by the government was nearly 48 percent above its pre-pandemic level in February 2020. In addition, the average interest rate on 30-year mortgages declined 1 percentage point from 3.9 percent in March of last year to 2.9 percent in January of this year before rising to over 3 percent in mid-February, where it has remained.\n3 Single-family permits in March 2021 were more than 20 percent above their pre-pandemic level. Real consumer spending on goods in March 2021 was over 16 percent above its level in February 2020, and auto sales in the first quarter of 2021 were at nearly pre-pandemic levels.\n4 Between February 2020 and March 2021, total nonfarm employment decreased 5.5 percent, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Over the same period, employment in leisure and hospitality declined nearly 19 percent. Some of the other industries seeing large employment declines over this span include air, water, rail, and ground passenger transportation (–22.8 percent), education services (–8.2 percent), mining and logging (–11.6 percent), and motion picture production (–40.3 percent).\n5 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as of May 2, 2021, about 56 percent of the U.S. population aged 18 and over had received at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose and over 40 percent were fully vaccinated. CDC updates on the state of Covid-19 vaccinations across the United States are available online.\n6 The extension of unemployment benefits applies to the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC), Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA), and Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC) programs created by the CARES Act.\n7 Federal Open Market Committee (2021b).\n8 While economic growth is projected to moderate in the next two years, it is expected to remain above the economy’s long-run growth rate—which is estimated to be 1.8 percent by the median FOMC participant.\n9 See, for example, Karger and Rajan (2021).\n10 The Committee’s inflation goal is measured by the annual change in the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index.\n11 Core PCE inflation is a better gauge of underlying inflation trends than total PCE inflation.\n12 Core PCE prices fell 0.4 percent in April 2020. So even if core PCE prices were unchanged in April 2021, the 12-month change would rise by 0.4 percentage points solely because the April 2020 number fell out of the average.\n13 For details, see Bianchi, Fisher, and Melosi (2021).\n14 Hazell et al. (2021).\n15 Hazell et al. (2021) find that the greater stability of inflation since the 1990s is mostly due to long-run inflationary expectations becoming more firmly anchored.\n16 Federal Open Market Committee (2020).\n17 We consider a wide range of indicators in making that assessment; see Federal Open Market Committee (2021c)—which is the very latest version of the long-run strategy statement (reaffirming the 2020 version).\n18 Federal Open Market Committee (2021a).\nReferences\nBianchi, Francesco, Jonas D.

Community colleges have an important mission, serving many educational needs of our diverse community and helping our future workforce develop critical skills. It’s a great pleasure today to share some of my thoughts with you on the course of the economy and some roles community colleges might play in the outlook. But before I begin, I should note that these views are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\nNeedless to say, it has been a very challenging year in so many respects. With regard to the Fed, we, as the monetary policy authority, still have some ways to go before we reach our dual mandate goals of maximum and inclusive employment and inflation that averages 2 percent. We also face many uncertainties and risks on the road ahead. But I am very optimistic about our economy’s growth prospects, and am hopeful that our employment goal will be in sight before too long. Achieving our inflation goal, however, may prove more difficult. As we seek an equitable recovery, two-year colleges—with their proven track record for positive returns to their diverse graduates—can play a critical role.\nThe large and uneven impact of the pandemic\nThe pandemic has had a devastating impact on our nation. It has taken a horrible number of lives and caused immeasurable hardship in so many different ways. It is difficult to overstate the human costs of this tragedy. Economic developments over the past year also have been largely dictated by the pandemic and our efforts to contain it.

Indeed, before the pandemic, employment in leisure and hospitality accounted for only about a tenth of total payrolls in the economy. Yet the job losses in this sector account for nearly 40 percent of the 8.5 million current shortfall in total employment from its pre-pandemic level.4 The impact of the pandemic has been uneven across a number of other dimensions as well. For example, because a disproportionate number of women, minorities, and lower-wage workers are employed in leisure and hospitality or other vulnerable sectors, these demographic groups have been particularly hard hit. I will return to this topic later in my talk.\nAll told, even though the economy is recovering, we still have a long way to go before economic activity returns to its pre-pandemic vibrancy. Even after the very strong March employment report, at 6.0 percent, the unemployment rate is well above the 3.5 percent we saw on the eve of the pandemic. And many other workers have stopped looking for a job and exited the labor force.\nOptimistic outlook for growth\nDespite these numerous hardships, I am optimistic that the economy is poised for strong growth later this year, which will bring with it further significant improvements in the labor market. One important reason for my optimism is that we have made good progress on the health front. Though we’ve seen an uptick in new cases over the past couple of weeks, the numbers are much lower than they were at the turn of the year. Moreover, each day more and more people are getting vaccinated, and hopefully, before too long, much of the population will be able and willing to resume activities such as traveling, attending events, and dining out.5\nFiscal policy will also provide a big boost to the economy. Over the past four months, we have seen two large stimulus packages enacted: the $900 billion in relief from the Consolidated Appropriations Act in late December and the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act, or ARP, in early March. This legislation provides further direct stimulus payments to individuals; extends unemployment insurance and lending to small businesses; provides substantial funding to state and local governments; and spends on programs such as those for vaccines and testing, childcare, housing assistance, and education.6 Roughly $40 billion is going to colleges and universities. My staff found a calculation on the American Council on Education’s website that estimates Prairie State could be allocated about $10 million.7 Don’t hold me to that number.\nWith these developments, my outlook for growth and unemployment is much more positive today than it was just a few months ago. Since my forecast is similar to those made by my colleagues on the FOMC, let me discuss mine in the context of theirs. Four times a year each FOMC participant provides projections of key economic variables.

This quite strong figure reflects the return to more normal operations in sectors still impacted by the virus today, as well as the big boost from fiscal policy. As these factors run their course, growth is then expected to moderate to 3.3 percent next year and 2.2 percent in 2023.9 The median FOMC participant sees the unemployment rate declining steadily from 6.0 percent today to 4.5 percent by the end of this year and then to 3.5 percent by the end of 2023—back to where it was prior to the pandemic.\nOf course, there are always uncertainties underlying such projections. A very important one today surrounds the path for the virus. My base case is that the virus will become much less of a public health concern by the second half of this year. But that is not assured; and there are downside risks if people become less vigilant or vaccine-resistant variants of the virus take hold. The size and timing of the impact from fiscal policy also are uncertain. For example, with regard to the stimulus payments, those whose livelihoods have been most severely harmed by the pandemic will spend them quickly, but others will save theirs and spend them gradually.10 Similar uncertainties surround other elements of the recent fiscal packages. And then there is the possibility that further spending and tax changes will be coming soon. So, we could see more—or less—impact from fiscal policy than I’ve built into my projections.\nInflation is likely to increase this year\nLet me turn now to the price stability element of our dual mandate. This is a far more nuanced story. To set the stage, the FOMC has an inflation target of 2 percent.11 Since the Great Financial Crisis, inflation has persistently run under our target, only fleetingly touching 2 percent a couple of times prior to the pandemic. The pandemic further depressed inflation as demand plummeted for many goods and services, with outright price declines in sectors hardest hit by the pandemic, such as air travel and hotel accommodations.

But if you look at the overall basket of goods and services purchased by households—as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy (or core PCE for short)—inflation has declined from 1.9 percent just before the pandemic to 1.4 percent this February.12\nI expect inflation to increase in the coming months. Part of the increase will be purely mechanical as the low inflation readings from March and April of last year fall out of the 12-month calculation.13 In addition, as the virus subsides and people resume normal activities, demand should pick up for those goods and services that are most affected by the pandemic, pulling their prices up to more typical levels. Finally, we could also see supply chain bottlenecks develop as activity picks up rapidly in some sectors, which would contribute to temporary price pressures in some selected industries.\nBut what happens once prices renormalize and supply chains adjust? Will inflation just settle back down to 1-1/2 percent, or will we see a more persistent increase in underlying inflation? To generate persistently higher inflation, we need higher inflation expectations—that is, we need to see households and businesses begin to incorporate a higher underlying rate of inflation into their decisions today and their plans for the future. Given the low inflation experienced over the past 15 years, it is highly likely that inflation expectations have drifted noticeably below 2 percent. If they stay there, then we will only see a temporary boost to inflation this year. If they move up, then we could make some real progress toward reaching our inflation target. So, we will be watching measures of inflation expectations very carefully.\nWhat are forecasters looking for? Well, according to the March SEP, the median FOMC participant sees core inflation rising to 2.2 percent by the end of this year and then slowing to 2.0 next year before moving up slightly to 2.1 percent in 2023. That’s a lot better than the 1.4 percent we have today. But does it mean we’ve reached our inflation goal?\nPolicy to remain accommodative for some time\nBefore I answer this question, let me say a few words about our policy goals. Congress gave the Federal Reserve a dual mandate to achieve maximum employment and price stability. Last August, after a lengthy review, the FOMC revised our long-run strategy statement that operationalizes this mandate.14 First, we stated that our employment goal is broad-based and inclusive and that our aim is to eliminate shortfalls of employment from our assessment of its maximum level.15 The term “shortfalls” is significant—in the past we characterized our employment mandate in terms of eliminating deviations from some long-run normal level of employment. Under the new framework, the FOMC will not be concerned about high employment—or low unemployment—unless it is also associated with undesirable inflationary pressures.\nWith regard to our price stability objective, we indicated we want to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time. This averaging is important in order to center longer-term inflation expectations at 2 percent and thus achieve our target on a persistent basis. Therefore, if inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, we need to have inflation overshoot our goal moderately for some time to bring the average back to 2 percent.\nAs you know, even before we adopted this new framework, monetary policymakers responded to the pandemic swiftly and strongly. In order to support the overall economy, we brought the federal funds rate down to nearly zero, introduced a host of liquidity and credit facilities, and purchased U.S. government securities on a large scale. While the emergency actions are behind us, today the fed funds rate remains near zero and we continue to purchase securities at a pace of $120 billion per month.\nI expect monetary policy will have to remain accommodative for some time to ensure that we meet the policy goals laid out in our new framework. With regard to our employment mandate, an important gauge is the unemployment rate. The median FOMC participant estimates that the longer-run unemployment rate is 4.0 percent. In other words, after the effects of various shocks to the economy dissipate, the unemployment rate should naturally settle at 4.0 percent. The median FOMC forecast sees the unemployment rate falling below this level by the end of 2022. So, our employment mandate is within sight. Now, the median inflation forecast I just mentioned is at or somewhat above 2 percent. But after years of underrunning our target, in my view those increases and, down the road, some even higher rates of inflation are needed to get inflation to average 2 percent and to solidify inflation expectations about that number. So, I see the need for continued accommodative monetary policy to reach our goals.\nWhat does this mean in terms of our policy tools? The FOMC statements, released after each meeting, provide some guidance. The one we just issued in March reaffirmed that it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to purchase assets until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals.16 Judging from the most recent SEP, those conditions will not be met for a while. The median FOMC participant expects the federal funds rate to stay in its current low range of 0 to 1/4 percent through at least the end of 2023. So, policy is likely on hold for some time.\nThe potential role of two-year colleges in the recovery\nLet me now return to a topic I mentioned briefly earlier—the uneven economic impact of the pandemic across segments of society. As I noted earlier, because women, minorities, and lower-wage workers are disproportionately employed in leisure and hospitality or other vulnerable sectors, these demographic groups have been particularly hard hit. Furthermore, disruptions to education and childcare have placed an additional burden on families as they struggle to balance household demands and employment responsibilities. The toll has been enormous. We are seeing unequal impacts on health and economic outcomes across income, racial, and ethnic groups and between small and large firms. Worryingly, these shifts are magnifying the longstanding inequalities among these segments of our society. And depending on the path of the recovery, some of the recent changes may leave unfortunate longer lasting marks as well. Our economy cannot fully recover if a substantial portion of the population is left behind.\nThe path ahead depends on many factors. And, while the Federal Reserve’s pursuit of its inclusive maximum employment goal is very important, other institutions have key roles to play. One of those institutions is two-year colleges. They have a proven track record in broadening access to higher education and, through this, contributing to greater and more equitable economic resiliency among workers.\nFor example, research has shown that workers who have lost their jobs, as well as those who enroll while still employed, can achieve large economic returns by attending two-year colleges.17 Certification programs, retraining for new occupations, and associate’s degrees all boost wages immediately upon completion, and the gains grow over time.18 Indeed, a well-known study has shown that the returns to credits earned at two-year colleges appear similar to those earned at four-year colleges. In fact, students who initially enrolled at a two-year college and transferred to complete a bachelor’s degree at a four-year college had the same average earnings as those that completed all their credits at a four-year college.19 But the transfer students achieved these earnings while facing substantially lower tuition, making the cost–benefit proposition of two-year colleges quite impressive.\nGiven these facts, two-year colleges could play an important role in bolstering the economic prospects for many in the recovery ahead. Indeed, in the current economy, the returns of two-year colleges should seem highly alluring. However, enrollment in two-year colleges actually declined by about 10 percent in the 2020–21 academic year.20 Usually in recessions, two-year college enrollment goes up as more people take the time to acquire new job skills.\nThere are a number of possible reasons for this drop. The timing and uncertain duration of the pandemic might have discouraged potential students from committing to months of additional education, particularly when they were continually being told the economy might “open up” soon and they could then go back to their old jobs. Many who lost their jobs during the pandemic had worked in industries such as leisure and hospitality. This industry typically has a lot of labor turnover, and so workers from that sector may not be accustomed to retraining. Furthermore, there is a good chance that their old or similar jobs are coming back when the economy reopens. So these workers may not be aware of the potential returns to building skills or seeking retraining at a two-year college. And some students might have chosen to defer enrollment until the prospect of in-person education is less daunting or until their families’ economic situations improve so that tuition payments and student loans would be less of a hardship. Finally, many of the vocational programs at community colleges require hands-on work that can be difficult to impossible to do online. Regardless of the exact reasons, the decline in two-year college enrollment is disappointing.\nStill, there is little doubt that two-year colleges have a substantial role to play in supporting a more equitable recovery from this recession. Clearly, the benefits to “traditional” two-year college students are as essential as ever. And there are new opportunities as well. Research has shown that relatively few workers displaced from jobs outside of the manufacturing sector turn to two-year colleges for new certifications or degrees.21 What can two-year colleges do to reach these individuals who have been so disproportionately impacted in this recession? Additionally, the economic hardships imposed by the pandemic are likely to prevent many students from starting a four-year college program. Two-year colleges can play a crucial role in allowing these students to continue their education plans without interruption. Lastly, it might be valuable for two-year colleges to develop and offer new virtual classes at scale to expand their reach and benefit a broader range of students.\nBut these opportunities also come with challenges. Can two-year colleges continue to be a high-value, high-return proposition while adjusting to a potentially different composition of students? What about the competition with four-year colleges that may be adapting their admissions policies in the wake of their own declining enrollments?22 Can virtual options be developed that are effective substitutes for in-person learning? And, finally, will two-year colleges have the capacity and funding needed to make these adaptations? The answers to each of these questions are important elements of the conversation about equitable access to higher education, as well as the economic resiliency it provides, for years to come.\nConclusion\nTo sum up, I am quite optimistic about the growth prospects for our economy. Nonetheless, we have a long way to go before we return to the pre-pandemic levels of economic activity and achieve our average 2 percent inflation goal. Two-year colleges can play a critical role by increasing the skills and resiliency of our diverse workforce in the current recovery and beyond.\nThank you.\nNotes\n1 The $2.2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020, and an additional $900 billion in relief was provided as part of a government spending bill called the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, which was enacted on December 27, 2020. More recently, the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act (ARP) was signed into law on March 11, 2021. These bills have provided loans to businesses, direct payments and other benefits to individuals, and funding for health care providers and to state and local governments, as well as other means of support to various segments of the economy.\n2 For instance, personal income in February 2021 from wages and salaries plus pandemic relief provided by the government was nearly 8 percent above its year-ago level. In addition, the interest rate on 30-year mortgages declined 1 percentage point from 3.9 percent in March of last year to 2.9 percent in January of this year before rising to 3.3 percent in recent weeks.\n3 Even with the impact of severe winter weather, single-family permits in February 2021 were more than 15 percent above their year-ago level. Real consumer spending on goods in February 2021 was nearly 9 percent above a year ago, and auto sales in the first quarter of 2021 were at nearly pre-pandemic levels.\n4 Between February 2020 and March 2021, total nonfarm employment decreased 5.5 percent, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Over the same period, employment in leisure and hospitality declined nearly 19 percent. Some of the other industries seeing large employment declines over this span include air, water, rail, and ground passenger transportation (–22.8 percent), education services (–8.2 percent), mining and logging (–11.6 percent), and motion picture production (–40.3 percent).\n5 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as of April 1, 2021, over 38 percent of the U.S. population aged 18 and over had received at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose and nearly 22 percent were fully vaccinated. CDC updates on the state of Covid-19 vaccinations across the United States are available online.\n6 The extension of unemployment benefits applies to the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC), Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA), and Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC) programs created by the CARES Act.\n7 The American Council on Education’s simulated distribution of ARP emergency relief funds to institutions of higher education (including Prairie State College) is available online.\n8 Federal Open Market Committee (2021a).\n9 While economic growth is projected to moderate in the next two years, it is expected to remain above the economy’s long-run growth rate—which is estimated to be 1.8 percent by the median FOMC participant.\n10 See, for example, Karger and Rajan (2020).\n11 The Committee’s inflation goal is measured by the annual change in the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index.\n12 Core PCE inflation is a better gauge of underlying inflation trends than total PCE inflation.\n13 For instance, if we assume that the monthly change in core PCE inflation in March and April of this year will be 0.1 percent (the average reading over the past six months), then 12-month core PCE inflation would rise from 1.4 percent in February to 1.6 percent in March and 2.2 percent in April solely based on these base effects.\n14 Federal Open Market Committee (2020).\n15 We consider a wide range of indicators in making that assessment; see Federal Open Market Committee (2021c)—which is the very latest version of the long-run strategy statement (reaffirming the 2020 version).\n16 Federal Open Market Committee (2021b).\n17 Jacobson, LaLonde, and Sullivan (2005).\n18 Minaya and Scott-Clayton (2020).\n19 Kane and Rouse (1995).\n20 National Student Clearinghouse Research Center (2020).\n21 Minaya, Moore, and Scott-Clayton (2020).\n22 See Lovenheim and Reynolds (2011) for a discussion of some of the trends and evidence of this phenomenon before the pandemic.\nReferences\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2021a, Summary of Economic Projections, Washington, DC, March 17, available online.\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2021b, “Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement,” press release, Washington, DC, March 17, available online.\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2021c, “Statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy,” Washington, DC, as reaffirmed effective January 26, available online.\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2020, “2020 statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy,” Washington, DC, as amended effective August 27, available online.\nJacobson, Louis, Robert LaLonde, and Daniel G.

            "content": "Transcript\n\nIntroduction\nThank you for that kind introduction. It is a great pleasure to join you, albeit virtually. In my remarks today, I’d like to discuss the state of the U.S. economy and share my views on where the economy and monetary policy are likely headed. In addition, I will highlight how even an improving aggregate economy can mask distressingly wide economic disparities.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic and the efforts to contain it have taken a heavy toll on the lives and livelihoods of many of our neighbors, friends, and coworkers. I cannot stress the costs of this tragedy enough. And, unfortunately, those who have the fewest resources have borne a disproportionate share of these costs.\nThe pandemic has had devastating effects, and we are still far from the robust economy we had prior to it. Still, many sectors of the economy have shown great resilience in the face of the virus. Indeed, overall economic activity has recovered far more than most analysts had expected in the middle of last year. And I am optimistic about the future. With increased vaccinations and continued support from fiscal and monetary policies, we should make significant strides toward returning to normal levels of economic activity as we move through 2021.\nThe pandemic also has had an impact on inflation. Even before the pandemic, inflation had been running below the Federal Reserve’s target of 2 percent, and today the situation is even worse. I expect it will be some time before inflation is back to where we want it to be—monetary policy still has a good deal of work to do here.\nBefore I discuss these points in more depth, I should note that the views I will be sharing with you are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\nCurrent state of the economy and outlook\nClearly, last year was unprecedented. The behavior of the economy was not driven by familiar financial and business cycle developments, but rather by the pandemic. Public health mandated shutdowns and individuals’ voluntary changes in behavior resulted in a sharp drop in employment and economic activity last spring. We saw a strong rebound in the summer as the most stringent restrictions were lifted, followed by more moderate growth in the fall as the snapback effect faded. Still, all told, the U.S. economy shrank 2-1/2 percent last year.\nThe toll on workers has been immense. The unemployment rate quickly rose to nearly 15 percent—actually, closer to 20 percent when you account for measurement issues. By the end of last year, it had improved to 6.7 percent. But, clearly, we have a ways to go before we get back to the vibrant economy we had on the eve of the pandemic, when the unemployment rate stood at 3.5 percent and there were nearly 10 million more people on payrolls.\nMoreover—and quite disturbingly—the burdens of the pandemic have fallen disproportionately on minorities, women, and low-wage workers. As a macroeconomist and a central banker, I often focus on broad aggregate measures when gauging the performance of the economy. But even as these metrics improve, not all groups may benefit evenly.\nFor decades, the U.S. has experienced growing disparities in income and wealth across socioeconomic groups. And, sadly, the pandemic has aggravated these long-standing disparities. Monetary policy can help with these problems by fostering a strong macroeconomy that provides more and better job opportunities for disadvantaged segments of society. But it does not have better, more targeted tools that are designed for addressing these issues—those fall under the purview of other government policymakers, as well as the impressive efforts of many in the private sector. And I hope we all can give top priority to eliminating these inequalities.\nLet me return now to the macroeconomic outlook. While we still have a lot of ground to make up, the aggregate economy today is much better than I and many other forecasters had projected last spring.1 Many businesses and consumers were able to adapt to operating safely in the presence of the virus. And, sadly, others simply decided to largely ignore it. The relative resiliency of the economy also owes a lot to fiscal policy, which provided substantial direct support to household income and included a variety of programs to aid distressed households and businesses. Furthermore, aggressive monetary policy actions helped by fostering considerably more accommodative financial conditions than would have prevailed otherwise.\nSo what is in store ahead? Returning to normal requires getting the virus under control. The biggest factor here is vaccinations. Once a sufficient share of the population is inoculated, people will feel safe enough to resume a broader range of activities and the sectors where social contact is so important—such as travel and leisure and hospitality—can recover more robustly. In addition, education can return to normal. As a result, we will see further increases in aggregate spending and employment. At the same time, growth will be boosted by the fiscal policy package enacted in December, potential additional fiscal support, and continued accommodative monetary policy.\nAll told, my baseline expectation is that the U.S. economy will grow in the range of 5 to 6 percent this year. Once the vaccine-related impetus to economic growth has passed and as the boost from fiscal support wanes, real gross domestic product (GDP) growth is likely to moderate in 2022 and 2023; my forecast has it averaging in the 2 to 3 percent range. Given this path for growth, labor markets will continue to improve, and I expect the unemployment rate will return to close to its pre-pandemic level of 3.5 percent by the end of 2023.\nWith regard to inflation, there is still a long way to go. In December, inflation, as measured by the core Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures, was 1-1/2 percent on a year-over-year basis, well below the Federal Open Market Committee’s goal of averaging 2 percent over time.2 As I’ll elaborate more in a minute, the inflation outlook—particularly in the near term—is complex. But I expect underlying inflation won’t be back to our goal until the mid-2020s.\nUncertainties and risks\nEconomic forecasts always come with uncertainties and risks. But today we have more than the usual number. The main reason is that the principal drivers of the economy over the near term aren’t typical business cycle factors, but rather the course of the virus and the actions taken to arrest it.\nHere, things could go better—or worse—than expected. More successful vaccine distribution and take-up, as well as other efforts to contain the virus, could pave the road to a faster recovery. Conversely, a slower expansion of vaccination or the spread of more infectious strains of the virus could slow growth. Indeed, several of my contacts in the health care sector have expressed major concerns about some of the public’s reluctance to be vaccinated, particularly among certain racial and ethnic groups.\nThe degree of additional fiscal support that may be coming is also uncertain. The President has proposed a $1.9 trillion package, but the exact amount that will emerge from negotiations with Congress is unclear. As a placeholder, my forecast assumes a package about half that size will be enacted, which is similar to what many private sector analysts are building into their forecasts. Let me emphasize—strongly—that this is not an opinion about the appropriate size for the package or a prediction of the outcome of the budget negotiations. Those are jobs for the Congress and the President’s administration. But as a forecaster, I have to make some assumption, and that is all this is.\nOne thing that is more certain is the continued support from monetary policy. My contacts stress that the current financial environment is extremely beneficial for growth. And I can assure you that the Federal Reserve takes this to heart. We are committed to using all our available tools to support the return to maximum inclusive employment and 2 percent average inflation.\nReturning to the long list of uncertainties, another issue is what economists call “sectoral reallocation,” or the effects on overall growth and inflation from activity shifting between sectors of the economy. Now, in every business cycle, some sectors do better than others. But as a result of the vast differences in how the pandemic has affected various households and businesses, the degree of sectoral reallocation today is truly extraordinary. For instance, as consumers reduced activities that require close personal contact, restaurants and personal care service providers took huge losses. In contrast, in your hometown, automakers and their suppliers were able to change their production processes to operate safely. Moreover, demand for autos has held up relatively well during the pandemic: Higher-income households have continued to purchase new cars, and the demand for used vehicles has been boosted by fiscal stimulus payments and the desire to avoid public transportation.\nNow, these efforts haven’t come cheaply. Automakers and many other manufacturers have overstaffed shifts and relied on temporary workers to cover for increased absenteeism due to the virus. They’ve also made substantial investments in personal protective equipment (PPE) and other safety protocols. And many have allowed for more flexible work schedules or paid leave to help employees manage family illnesses or child and elder care difficulties.\nThese sectoral differences have led to an unusual situation in which even though overall unemployment is high and we are not back to pre-pandemic levels of activity, some firms are currently running into supply constraints that might impede their business plans and raise their costs. For example, for some time my business contacts in manufacturing have been saying they face a shortage of workers, and more recently I’ve begun to hear more about them raising wages.\nAnother example is a microchip shortage in the auto industry. Several factors are in play, but this is mainly a sectoral reallocation story. When ordering chips early last year, automakers and their parts suppliers underestimated the strength of the recovery. Meanwhile, chipmakers allocated more of their product to consumer electronics producers that benefited from a burst of demand. As a result, today automakers and their parts suppliers are struggling to find enough chips to meet production plans, and they see this shortage persisting for the next three to six months.\nIn contrast to these stories, sectors hit hard by the virus—such as leisure and hospitality, travel, and commercial real estate—are experiencing excess supply and stranded resources. Of particular concern here are the continued job market woes of many low-wage workers. These workers can’t easily transition to those places and sectors where jobs are available. This underscores the importance of continued fiscal support for these individuals to help smooth out the uneven incidence of the pandemic.\nHow do these factors balance out? Well, with 10 million fewer people employed today than before the pandemic, it’s safe to say the problem of excess capacity and unused productive resources is a far greater issue than the supply constraints some firms are facing. But there are still important implications going forward.\nThe labor shortages we hear about today appear to be largely due to virus-related absenteeism. These constraints should ease as more people get vaccinated, the virus threat abates, and education returns closer to normal. At the same time, the current resource slack in industries heavily impacted by the virus will likely be absorbed as demand normalizes. Taken together, this means we could see aggregate growth numbers bounce around quite a bit as some large, but transitory, swings in activity occur while particular sectors readjust. Until these sectoral adjustments have run their course, it will be challenging to gauge the underlying cyclical dynamics of the economy.\nThese sectoral developments have implications for inflation as well. As a result of shifting consumption patterns and business plans, we have seen large movements in prices of certain goods and services relative to others in 2020. For instance, in December while hotel prices and airfares were as much as 15 to 20 percent below year-ago levels, consumers were paying 9 percent more to purchase household appliances.\nToday, we see supply constraints and price pressures in industries where demand is very strong—such as construction materials, steel, and autos—but continued weak pricing in sectors where the virus has had a big negative impact on demand. Going forward, the unwinding of strong demand in some sectors and a sharp recovery in others could lead to new capacity constraints and higher prices in some parts of the economy. As the recovery gains momentum, it will be important to distinguish such short-lived, sector-specific phenomena from more widespread and lasting resource pressures.\nOverall, I expect to see some higher top-line inflation numbers in the spring because of these temporary constraints. In addition, we tend to look at average inflation over the past year, and there will be a mechanical increase in this average when the very low readings from last March and April roll out of the annual calculation. But after these factors have run their course, I expect inflation will settle down and end the year in the range of 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. With continued growth, further improvements in labor markets, and accommodative monetary policy, I see inflation moving up steadily and eventually running moderately above 2 percent for some time in the mid-2020s. This overshooting of 2 percent is a purposeful design feature of appropriate monetary policy. Let me elaborate.\nMonetary policy\nCongress has instructed the Federal Reserve to foster economic conditions that achieve both stable prices and maximum sustainable employment. These two objectives are known collectively as the dual mandate.\nIn order to achieve these goals, the Fed’s response to last year’s crisis was swift and strong. The Federal Open Market Committee quickly reduced the federal funds rate—our main policy tool—to a range of 0 to 1/4 percent, which is as far as we can effectively reduce it when trying to stimulate the economy. We also purchased large quantities of U.S. Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities; and with the approval and backing of the Treasury Department, we activated a number of special lending facilities to support the flow of credit to businesses, households, nonprofits, and state and local governments. Although some of the lending facilities have lapsed recently, we have kept the federal funds rate in the 0 to 1/4 percent range and since last spring maintained a steady pace of U.S. Treasury and agency mortgage-backed asset purchases.\nEven before the pandemic hit, the Federal Reserve had been in the process of conducting a multifaceted review of our longer-run strategy for achieving our monetary policy objectives. This review was motivated by trends that predated the pandemic: Importantly, because of declines in the underlying trend growth rate of the economy and other factors, the Fed has less room to use its interest rate tools to stimulate the economy than it did in the 1990s and early 2000s. I won’t go into the details here, but this means that without a change in strategy, inflation would get mired below 2 percent far too often. It also would be more difficult to achieve our maximum employment goal.\nWe kept this review going through the pandemic and last August incorporated its findings into a new monetary policy strategy statement.3 The inflation target remains at 2 percent. But we indicated that we now will seek to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time. Furthermore, we said that following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.\nWe also emphasized that maximum employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal and stated that the FOMC will seek to eliminate shortfalls from maximum employment. In contrast, the old strategy sought to minimize both positive and negative deviations from maximum employment, not just shortfalls. These are important changes. Maximum employment means bringing as many people as possible into the labor force and creating conditions where they can find productive jobs. Importantly, monetary policymakers should not be concerned with what might look like very tight labor markets as long as accommodative monetary policy is not generating unwanted inflation risks.\nWe then put these strategies into action. In September, the FOMC provided outcome-based forward guidance on its interest rate policies by saying we will maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate until we have achieved our employment mandate and inflation has reached 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.4 This overshooting after a period of sub-2 percent inflation is straight out of the new long-run strategy.\nThe statement also recognized that our work on inflation is unlikely to be complete when we first begin to raise rates. So it indicates that we will maintain accommodative monetary conditions until our inflation averaging goal is met. In December, the FOMC added similar outcome-based forward guidance regarding our asset purchases, stating that the current pace of purchases will be maintained until substantial further progress has been made toward our policy goals.5\nNote that there is no fixed date attached to these changes in interest rates or asset purchases—the timing will be dictated by the progress made toward our policy goals. Monetary policy will be accommodative as long as it takes to reach them.\nWhen I think about my economic forecast, I am reasonably confident that we will reach our maximum employment goal over the next three years. I am more concerned about the prospects for reaching our inflation mandate, however. Inflation is far too low today. And we have a long way to go to reach the magnitude of overshooting that I see as necessary to satisfy our average inflation objective.\nBecause businesses and workers do not want to fall behind rising prices, expectations of future inflation have a strong influence on price and wage setting today. So bolstering the inflation expectations of households, businesses, and financial market participants will be key to achieving our goals. The strong pickup in economic activity projected for this year should generate a temporary boost to inflation; but whether this becomes embedded into inflation expectations and produces a more sustained increase in underlying inflation is an open question. To help this process, it will be critical for monetary policymakers to look through temporary price increases and not even think about thinking about adjusting policy until the economic criteria we have laid out have been realized. So I see us staying the course for a while.\nLonger-term issues\nBefore I conclude, I would like to touch on an aspect of the developments over the past year that has potentially large negative consequences for the long-term well-being of our communities. As I mentioned before, the pandemic has amplified a number of long-standing disparities in economic and other outcomes by income, race, ethnicity, gender, age, and geography. These disparities have the potential to inflict long-lasting damage not only on the well-being of our communities, but on the nation’s economy overall.\nOne area of particular concern is the impact of the pandemic on children and young adults who have had their education disrupted. Many of these students have also experienced the trauma that comes from isolation, food insecurity, concerns about housing stability, and uncertain employment prospects for themselves and the adults in their lives. Left unaddressed, these disruptions could easily leave long-lasting scars that would make it even more difficult for these young people to realize their economic potential and other aspirations. This would certainly weigh on the inclusive nature of the Federal Reserve’s maximum employment objective, not to mention the individual hardships it would bring.\nAt the Chicago Fed, through our Project Hometown initiative,6 we are interested in supporting strategies and programs that research has shown to improve the lives of young people, especially the most vulnerable and those impacted most by the disruptions of the pandemic.\nSummer jobs programs are one such promising intervention. Research indicates that by providing disadvantaged youth employment and enrichment opportunities— including soft skills development and access to mentors—summer jobs programs improve educational and employment outcomes and reduce the likelihood that young people become involved with the criminal justice system. Research also indicates that summer jobs programs have higher returns on each dollar invested than some alternative interventions.\nBased on these results, we at the Chicago Fed are seeking ways to promote increased participation by at-risk youth and potential employers in summer jobs programs. There are many local organizations—such as Grow Detroit’s Young Talent (GDYT) in your area and One Summer Chicago—as well as many private sector businesses that have well-established and effective summer jobs programs.\nWhile the Fed is known primarily for its monetary policy responsibilities, community development and outreach are also key responsibilities. By adding the analytical expertise of our staff and resources to the efforts of community leaders and businesses, we are committed to improving economic opportunities for vulnerable youth and overcoming other long-standing inequities in our society.\nConclusion\nTo sum up, the U.S. economy still faces significant challenges in dealing with the Covid-19 virus and the economic fallout from our actions to contain it. With significant effort, many households and businesses are having success working their way back to higher levels of activity. But many others have been hit hard by the virus and its fallout, and face a tougher road back.\nFor its part, the Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting our inclusive maximum employment and price stability goals. We have a ways to go yet. But as I look ahead, I am optimistic that as the virus comes under control, we can return to the more prosperous economic times we were experiencing before the pandemic.\nThank you.\nNotes\n1 In June of last year, the Blue Chip forecasts were for real gross domestic product (GDP) to decline by about 6 percent in 2020 and for the unemployment rate to end the year at 10.4 percent (Wolters Kluwer, 2020).

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you for the introduction and the opportunity to participate alongside these distinguished panelists in today’s important discussion. I had hoped to welcome all of you to Chicago in person, but, well, here we are in our virtual world. Wherever you are, I wish you a happy and healthy new year. Before I begin my remarks, I should note that these views are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe current upsurge in Covid cases is a serious problem. But progress on the vaccine front has been very positive, and it looks like the health crisis will be brought under control as we move through the year. So as we look forward to life after Covid-19, what is in store for monetary policy?\nOf course, we’ll be entering this period with policy rates at the effective lower bound (ELB), where we swiftly brought them last March in recognition of the severe impact the pandemic would have on economic activity and inflation.1 We also took a wide range of classic lender-of-last-resort actions to address the massive shock in financial markets. My fellow panelists undoubtedly will have more to say about these actions. For my remarks, though, I would like to look beyond the short-term financial market response and focus on longer-term macroeconomic and financial stability issues raised by the proximity of the effective lower bound.\nThe effective lower bound has become all too familiar. Indeed, we have been in a similar situation before—when we brought policy rates to the effective lower bound with the Great Financial Crisis and, in the end, held them there for seven years.2 The threat of the ELB is now clearly a persistent feature of the economic landscape, and it poses profound challenges for central banks to provide sufficient accommodation to meet their monetary policy goals. One of these goals is hitting an inflation target. Recall that the Fed first announced a formal inflation target of 2 percent in 2012.3 In 2016, we clarified that the target was symmetric and that we would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below 2 percent.4 Yet, with only a few exceptions, inflation has consistently undershot our 2 percent objective ever since we announced that target.\nThis experience, together with a growing body of research, strongly shows that under traditional monetary policies, proximity to the effective lower bound imparts a downward bias to inflation expectations and actual inflation.5 This is a serious problem. The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy. It is the central bank’s responsibility. So in my view we can’t spend the next five years underrunning our target and just offer up explanations for why bringing inflation up to 2 percent is so hard. Instead, we have to avoid such poor outcomes by using policy strategies that offset this downward bias.\nWith these challenges in mind, the FOMC recently revised our long-run monetary policy strategy that guides our policy responses.6 In the remainder of my remarks, I will review the new framework in a bit more detail. I will discuss how I see our new framework relating to recent research on how monetary policy can address the downward bias in inflation expectations and then discuss what this might actually look like in practice. I will finish up with some implications of these policies for risk-taking in financial markets.\nThe revised long-run framework\nTo me, the biggest impetus for updating our monetary policy strategy came from an undeniable realization: The effective lower bound on the federal funds rate was not just an anomaly we stumbled into during the Great Financial Crisis, but a persistent threat to the achievement of our dual mandate goals.\nThe research here is clear. For all the well-known structural reasons, the long-run equilibrium real fed funds rate7 is much lower now than it was in the 1980s and ’90s. This means even average business cycle shocks will drive the funds rate to its effective lower bound—let alone the kind of shock we received in March. Research also shows that under traditional monetary policy strategies, the limits on reducing policy rates presented by the proximity of the ELB will impart a downward bias to inflation and inflation expectations relative to our 2 percent target. This bias is always present; it’s not just an occasional risk associated with a large negative shock. In addition, these limits on reducing rates will also impede achievement of our maximum employment mandate.\nThese facts imply a couple of things. First, a systematic adjustment to monetary policy strategy is needed to offset the bias. Second, at times this bias-adjustment will require generating inflation above 2 percent in order to center inflation and inflation expectations at target. I am happy to say that the new monetary policy strategy delivers on these two fundamental principles with its flexible inflation averaging goal and explicit recognition for the need, at times, for policy to purposely aim for inflation rates higher than 2 percent.\nThe new framework also emphasizes that our maximum employment mandate is a broad-based and inclusive goal and that monetary policy will seek to eliminate shortfalls from maximum employment. Recall that the old strategy sought to minimize deviations—both positive and negative—from maximum employment, not just shortfalls. This was an important refinement. The new framework recognizes that we should not rush to raise rates and risk ending a vibrant, more inclusive job market unless inflation threatens to become uncomfortably high. Such an approach can help ensure that the many individual and community benefits that come with high employment are more effectively reaching a broader share of the population. Furthermore, as we all are well aware, the link between unemployment and inflation pressures is subject to a great deal of uncertainty—just think how before the pandemic, inflation was running below target despite a historically low 3-1/2 percent unemployment rate.\nNow, the new strategy statement does not include specific operational details for how to achieve our goals. I think that is a feature, not a bug. I have long thought that no specific formulaic monetary policy rule will be robust to all of the changes in the economic environment that inevitably will occur. The strategy statement is, instead, a commitment to an outcome-based policy approach—a philosophy that I have supported throughout my tenure on the FOMC. The precise policy tools and their settings may vary with economic conditions, but the ultimate policy goals remain the same.\nPolicy research\nNow let me take a step back and talk about the academic literature. I believe our new framework is quite consistent with researchers’ conclusions about optimal monetary policy in the presence of the ELB.\nThis literature has established that the ELB induces a downward bias to achieving an inflation target under standard symmetric policy responses. It also has proposed a range of alternative monetary policy frameworks to address this bias. Such frameworks include flexible average inflation targeting, as the Federal Reserve has adopted; price level targeting; so-called dovish policies, such as described by Thomas Mertens and John Williams; and also asymmetric reaction functions and target ranges, as found in work by Francesco Bianchi, Leonardo Melosi, and Matthias Rottner.8\nNow, these types of models involve very strong assumptions: completely rational and forward looking agents, complete credibility of the monetary authority, and no adjustment lags or other inertias in the economy. Under such conditions, these models offer clear policy prescriptions and their implementation works perfectly. Rational agents immediately align their views with the bias-corrected distribution of inflation generated by the new policy rule.\nOf course, this idealized setting is unrealistic when it comes to actually implementing monetary policy. I view our new flexible average inflation target strategy as a way to implement the spirit of some of these models while acknowledging the complexities of the real world. Importantly, in the real world, actual outcomes are needed to build credibility. Some actors will need to see inflation actually average 2 percent in practice before they fully adjust their expectations. Real-world implementation also will require extensive and ongoing communication so that the public understands our efforts to offset the inflation bias. Well-articulated outcome-based forward guidance will be a key part of this process.\nPolicy under the new framework\nThis naturally brings us to the forward guidance the Committee issued in September.9 This guidance created a two-pronged plan. The first prong calls for the federal funds rate to remain at the effective lower bound until our employment mandate is met and inflation reaches 2 percent and is on target to overshoot. Then, the second prong involves increasing the federal funds rate slowly enough to maintain the accommodation needed to achieve moderate overshooting for some time, so that inflation actually averages 2 percent. And last month we augmented this with guidance saying we will maintain our current pace of asset purchases until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum and inclusive employment and price stability goals.10 For this approach to be successful, economic agents must have strong confidence that policy will remain sufficiently accommodative to generate these outcomes.\nHow will this work out in practice? After all, there are multiple paths that could achieve 2 percent average inflation, depending on the horizon and the extent of overshoot tolerated. Let me give you a couple of examples. Suppose that we take as our benchmark the average of inflation beginning in the first quarter of 2020. According to the most recent Summary of Economic Projections, core PCE inflation is projected to be 1.4 percent in 2020 and to gradually rise to 2 percent in 2023.11 Suppose then that core PCE inflation reaches 2-1/4 percent in 2024 and stays there. In this scenario, average core inflation would not reach 2 percent until late 2025 or early 2026. A 2 percent average could be achieved about a year sooner if inflation rose to 2-1/2 percent in 2024.\nNow, we are not going to follow a strict numerical formula for moving policy. Still, these examples illustrate an inevitable bottom line: It likely will take years to get average inflation up to 2 percent, which means monetary policy will be accommodative for a long time. This translates into low-for-long policy rates, and indicates that the Fed likely will be continuing our current asset purchase program for a while as well. So economic agents should be prepared for a period of very low interest rates and an expanding Fed balance sheet as we work to achieve both our dual mandate objectives. Of particular relevance for this session, financial market participants and financial market regulators are going to have to operate against this backdrop.\nFinancial stability\nWhat are the implications of this monetary policy accommodation for financial markets?\nLow interest rates for extended periods of time and a relatively flat yield curve12 amid ongoing asset purchases by the Federal Reserve raise concerns that a reach for yield in markets could generate financial instability risks. Institutional investors, such as life insurance companies and pension funds that have nominal return targets, may have an incentive to take on extra risk to meet a stream of fixed liabilities. Other investors may simply decide that low interest rates provide an opportunity to cheaply take on more leverage and, consequently, operate with more risk.\nOf course, looser financial conditions are part of the monetary policy transmission channel. By providing more accommodation, central banks encourage private risk-taking and investment that would not have otherwise been optimal for private-sector decision-makers. In such cases, the public policy goal of maximum, inclusive employment and average 2 percent inflation may be achieved sooner and more assuredly. So the concern is not just whether more risk is being taken by private agents, because of course it is. Rather, the concern is whether excessive risk-taking gives rise to marketwide financial instability by accelerating negative shocks when they arise or by otherwise imparting some negative economic externality that limits the attainment of maximum, inclusive employment and average 2 percent inflation.\nSuppose that monetary policymakers were to respond to these financial stability concerns and raise interest rates or reduce asset purchases preemptively, before being on track to meet their policy objectives. The result could be a lose-lose scenario. A premature tightening of monetary policy could not just threaten the achievement of our dual mandate objectives, but might not even improve financial stability either, given that financial stability is bolstered by a strong economy. Furthermore, if forced to react to highly uncertain and fast-moving financial stability concerns, monetary policy could become less predictable and, therefore, potentially less credible and effective. This lack of predictability would also raise the level of risk premiums in financial markets being generated by policy uncertainty instead of by underlying economic fundamentals. This is especially important in our revised framework, with its strong reliance on clear and consistent forward guidance.\nWith these considerations in mind, my view is that financial stability objectives are best addressed through supervision and regulation rather than through monetary policy tools. Since the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve and other regulators have made progress in macroprudential supervision, including enhanced monitoring of financial stability and the development of new tools, such as stress tests in the supervision of banks. But more can and should be done. The reality that the effective lower bound is no longer an unusual occurrence prompted the FOMC to embark on a comprehensive review of its monetary policy framework and make changes in our monetary policy strategy. Perhaps it is time for financial institutions and their supervisors to do the same—that is, review their business models and make their supervisory and regulatory strategies as robust and resilient as possible—in this low nominal interest rate environment.\nNotes\n1 See Federal Open Market Committee (2020e, 2020f).\n2 See Federal Open Market Committee (2008).\n3 Federal Open Market Committee (2012).\n4 Federal Open Market Committee (2016).\n5 Adam and Billi (2007).\n6 Federal Open Market Committee (2020d).\n7 The equilibrium, or neutral, federal funds rate is the funds rate associated with a neutral monetary policy (policy that is neither expansionary nor contractionary).\n8 See Mertens and Williams (2019) and Bianchi, Melosi, and Rottner (2019).\n9 Federal Open Market Committee (2020c).\n10 Federal Open Market Committee (2020b).\n11 Federal Open Market Committee (2020a). While our objective is stated in terms of overall inflation measured by the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), core inflation—which strips out the volatile food and energy sectors—is a better gauge of sustained inflationary pressures and where inflation is headed in the future.\n12 A yield curve is the line plotting the yields or interest rates of assets of the same credit quality but with differing maturity dates at a certain point in time. These assets, such as U.S. Treasury securities, typically yield incrementally more at longer maturities.\nReferences\nAdam, Klaus, and Roberto M.

Recall that the old strategy sought to minimize deviations—both positive and negative—from maximum employment, not just shortfalls. This was an important refinement. The new framework recognizes that we should not rush to raise rates and risk ending a vibrant, more inclusive job market unless inflation threatens to become uncomfortably high.\nA lot of factors can enter the characterization of an inclusive job market. One relevant statistic, for example, is the gap between Black and White unemployment rates. This gap fell to an all-time low of 2-1/4 percentage points with the strong labor market in 2019. This and other related indicators mean that the many individual and community benefits that come with high employment are more effectively reaching a broader share of the population. Indeed, the valuable features of a strong job market were a major theme brought out by community leaders in the public Fed Listens events we held as part of the framework review process—events we held to hear about how monetary policy impacts communities in the real world.8\nMonetary policy should not put these benefits of a strong labor market at risk if inflation is quiescent. Indeed, as we all are well aware, the link between unemployment and inflation pressures is subject to a great deal of uncertainty. For example, before the pandemic, inflation was running below target despite a historically low 3-1/2 percent unemployment rate. This experience highlights the challenge of interpreting monetary policy strictly through the lens of a simple bivariate Phillips curve.9 Importantly, even when rates are low and labor markets appear to be tight, we can’t definitely say policy is accommodative if inflation is still mired below our 2 percent average objective. This is important to remember when evaluating the lower-for-longer interest rate policies that accompany episodes at the ELB. In the end, it is actual inflation outcomes that matter.\nIn a related vein, the new strategy statement does not include specific operational details for how to achieve our goals. I think that is a feature, not a bug. I have long thought that no specific formulaic monetary policy rule will be robust to all of the changes in the economic environment that inevitably will occur. The strategy statement is, instead, a commitment to an outcome-based policy approach—a philosophy that I have supported throughout my tenure on the FOMC.

By responding less aggressively to upside shocks than to downside ones, these policies can shift up the distribution of inflation outcomes, thereby offsetting the downward bias from the effective lower bound and aligning expected inflation at target.\nNow, these types of models involve very strong assumptions: completely rational and forward-looking agents, complete credibility of the monetary authority, and no adjustment lags or other inertias in the economy. Under such conditions, these models offer clear policy prescriptions and their implementation works perfectly.

This translates into low-for-long policy rates, and indicates that the Fed likely will be continuing our current asset purchase program for a while as well. The examples also show that if we try to fine-tune a very modest inflation overshoot of only a tenth or two, we run a very large risk of failing to achieve our 2 percent averaging goal within any reasonable amount of time. For me, getting inflation moving up with momentum and delivering rates around 2-1/2 percent is important for achieving on our inflation objective in as timely a manner as possible.\nRisk management also argues for accommodative policy. This is because the close proximity of the ELB limits the Fed’s capacity to lower short-term policy rates. Instead, if the actual path of inflation turns out to be higher than expected, monetary policy can always react with higher policy rates to dampen inflation. But if we overestimate the underlying strength of the economy, the ELB could impede our ability to provide adequate interest rate accommodation and achieve our dual mandate goals within a reasonable amount of time.\nThis is a question that my co-authors Jonas Fisher, François Gourio, Spencer Krane, and I analyzed when thinking about exiting from the ELB back in 2015.14 To avoid the heavy costs of a return to the ELB, our analysis showed that, in both forward- and backward-looking models, optimal monetary policy under discretion should tilt toward being more accommodative than it otherwise would be and should risk inflation running above 2 percent for a time. Finding ourselves again at the effective lower bound, I believe this risk-management argument is as relevant today as it was back then.\nConclusion\nThe bottom line is that it will take a long time for average inflation to reach 2 percent. To meet our objectives and manage risks, the Fed’s policy stance will have to be accommodative for quite a while. Economic agents should be prepared for a period of very low interest rates and an expansion of our balance sheet as we work to achieve both our dual mandate objectives.\nNotes\n1 See Federal Open Market Committee (2020e, 2020f).\n2 See Federal Open Market Committee (2008).\n3 Federal Open Market Committee (2012).\n4 Federal Open Market Committee (2016).\n5 Adam and Billi (2007).\n6 Federal Open Market Committee (2020d).\n7 The equilibrium, or neutral, federal funds rate is the funds rate associated with a neutral monetary policy (policy that is neither expansionary nor contractionary).\n8 Federal Reserve System (2020).\n9 The Phillips curve is a statistical relationship that describes a negative correlation between inflation and unemployment—that is, lower unemployment is associated with higher price and wage inflation.

The EOS is currently the Chicago Fed’s longest-running conference series and has been held every December since 1987. Prior to the pandemic, the EOS was held in person, with many of you being regular attendees. We are very excited to be hosting our first hybrid symposium and are happy to welcome attendees on site for the first time since before the pandemic. Based on registrations, this will be our largest EOS audience ever. Over time, our audience has expanded significantly. Our original conference was by invitation only and hosted 26 local business economists, including Carl Tannenbaum, today’s keynote speaker, who tells us that one of the other attendees at that first symposium was the chief economist from Sears. Earlier in-person meetings were limited to the seats available in the auditorium, which was always filled to capacity. With our new hybrid format, we are pleased to be able to welcome participants from across our District.1 So, whether you are here with us in Chicago or participating remotely, we are really excited to have you join us.\nThis conference has always been an opportunity for us to hear from participants and presenters on the state of the economy. Thanks to our presenters today for sharing your expertise with us. A special thanks also to those of you in the audience who contribute to our advisory councils, roundtables, surveys, and contact calls. The information we gather from our contacts on the ground has always been valuable and has been even more essential to our understanding of the rapidly changing economic environment over the past couple of years. To illustrate the importance we place on your input, we have worked hard to augment our contact base to include organizations serving households with low and moderate incomes. So many thanks to those of you who bring that important perspective.\nAfter every symposium, we write a summary of the event and post it on our website.2 These summaries provide an archive of the concerns people have for the coming year, and a review of them shows some interesting patterns: We have continually been concerned about the health of the Midwest’s manufacturing base, the labor market, consumer attitudes and expectations, and balance sheets. However, some of the commentary changes over time and reflects where we are in the business cycle. I found a couple of past summaries particularly notable given some similarities and differences between the concerns expressed then and those expressed about today’s economic environment. In 1988 growth was quite robust, and the summary of the outlook for 1989 pointed out that participants were, and I quote, “seeking a soft landing.” It concluded that “the relatively favorable 1989 economy portrayed by the median forecast—with real GNP growth at a sustainable pace, little further acceleration of prices, and continued expansion of the nation’s productive capacity—could be just such a soft landing.”3 About a decade later, the symposium grappled with the question of where had all the workers gone. The summary of the outlook for 1998 noted that employers were struggling to find job applicants. One of the solutions proposed back then was “bringing retirees back into the work force.”4 With the labor force participation for older workers currently well below its pre-pandemic rate, this solution is being offered again to help address tight labor markets today. Across many years, EOS participants have remarked on the inflationary environment and, in particular, how energy prices were influencing overall inflation. For example, in late 2014, participants were anticipating inflation to remain low in the coming year partly because of low oil prices.5 As our own senior business economist Thom Walstrum will share in a moment, this year's participants are anticipating inflation to come down substantially, and I suspect that some of this reduction reflects the declines in energy prices from this summer’s highs.\nThis year’s conference has a wonderful combination of speakers—some of them are familiar faces, while others are new additions. You have a great afternoon ahead of you. Long-standing EOS participant Carl Tannenbaum, who is the chief economist for Northern Trust, will be giving a keynote outlook for the whole economy. Then we’ve got two great panels on important topics. In keeping with past years’ formats, the first panel is going to cover the outlook for the manufacturing sector, with a focus on autos and heavy machinery. We’ll also hear about freight and logistics—which are always crucial but have added relevance today given the supply chain snarls of the past year. The second panel is focused more on households. It includes experts who will discuss the consumer and labor markets. From a new addition to the program, which is part of the second panel, we will hear valuable perspectives on the challenges job seekers face and the difficulties households are encountering—particularly in regard to maintaining their health and well-being—as they come out of the pandemic.\nI am now going to turn things over to Thom, who will share the results of last year’s forecast competition, as well as this year’s forecast.

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you, President Reed, for your kind introduction.1 And thank you, Doug Evanoff, for inviting me to speak at the opening of Loyola University’s Kaufman Center for Financial Policy Studies, named in honor of George Kaufman.2 I am especially pleased to kick off the center and today’s conference, not least of which because I worked alongside Doug for over 25 years. Doug helped the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago achieve its policy goals as well as make it a top research organization. I know he will bring the skills he developed at the Chicago Fed to his new job as director of the Kaufman Center.\nBefore I begin, I should note that the views I share with you today are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\nLet me start with a few words about George Kaufman. George spent most of his career in Chicago—which began when he joined the Chicago Fed straight out of graduate school in 1959. After about a decade working at the Bank, George spent time on the East and West Coasts before deciding that Chicago is where he belonged: He took a job here at Loyola University, where he remained for the rest of his lengthy career. After returning to the area, he quickly reconnected with the Chicago Fed.\nGeorge had a deep and long-lasting connection to the Federal Reserve, which began when the institution wasn’t yet 50 years old. To give you an idea of that connection, when the Fed celebrated its centennial in 2013, George was invited to serve on the System’s centennial committee along with past Federal Reserve Chairs Paul Volker and Alan Greenspan, as well as other financial regulatory leaders.\nCreating the Bank Structure and International Banking Conferences\nAmong his many contributions, George played a central role in creating the Bank Structure Conference3 and the International Banking Conference,4 two long-running conference series organized by the Chicago Fed.\nThe inaugural Bank Structure Conference, which many considered the preeminent banking forum, was held in 1963. This conference was held regularly for over 50 years. George was likely the only person who attended both the first and last Bank Structure Conferences.5\nAs an economist, the director of research, and later president of the Chicago Fed, I made it a point to attend these conferences. As some of you no doubt remember, there was a strong group of regular attendees, including George, George Bentson, Ed Kane, and a number of younger scholars. The mix produced many interesting discussions that had a lasting impact.\nThe Bank Structure Conference that George was instrumental in founding quickly established a strong reputation. And as the global financial system became more interconnected, George—along with Curt Hunter, who was my predecessor as research director at the Bank—saw a need to supplement the generally more U.S.-focused conference with one having a more international emphasis. In 1997 they, along with Doug Evanoff, organized the Chicago Fed’s first International Banking Conference. This conference continued to draw thought leaders from around the world through 2016.\nThese two conferences brought together policymakers, academics, and industry representatives to discuss important changes in the banking environment, to debate future risks, and to anticipate promising opportunities. One of the highlights of the Bank Structure Conference was the appearance of the Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. While Chair, Ben Bernanke spoke at six conferences and Alan Greenspan spoke a remarkable 16 times.\nGeorge realized the advantages of bringing together the best research minds to discuss and debate the issues. Not surprisingly, that is also the goal of this center—and this conference.\nConference themes\nBoth conferences had a penchant for anticipating challenges. For example, the focus of the 1997 International Banking Conference was how to prevent banking crises. The conference was held in June, mere weeks before the Asian financial crisis began. Later, in the years before the Great Financial Crisis, the role of large banks in systemic financial risks was examined again in 2004—when the conference theme was Systemic Financial Crises: Resolving Large Bank Insolvencies—and in 2007—when the theme was Globalization and Systemic Risk.\nSimilarly, presentations at Bank Structure Conferences anticipated regulatory reforms in banking, with most proposed changes discussed at the conferences for many years before any actions were implemented.6 The topic of changes in bank capital regulation comes to mind, and I see that it is again on today’s program. Years before imposing a formal set of minimum capital requirements in the 1980s, their potential adoption was the focus of the 1975 conference. There is a long list of banking laws, with elements vigorously debated at the conferences both before and after their passage—FDICIA, Riegle–Neal, Gramm–Leach–Bliley, and FIRREA are among them.7\nThis is a good time to point out the central role George played in many of these debates. George was a leader in thinking about the importance of bank capital. He understood that banks had an incentive to take on more risk as they became weaker and approached insolvency. He pressed regulators to require banks to hold more capital as they weakened and, additionally, to increase their supervisory oversight. Through George’s efforts, both of these regulatory enhancements were incorporated in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act.\nDiscussion of research presented at the conferences\nThose earlier conferences inspired and produced much cutting-edge research. Doug Evanoff, along with several co-authors including Bob DeYoung, who’s in the audience today, examined over 600 research papers that were presented at the first 40 or so Bank Structure Conferences. Impressively, over three-quarters of them were later published—many in the top economics and finance journals.8 One-hundred and two were in what we call A-level journals, such as the Journal of Finance and the American Economic Review, with another 155 accepted by journals most academics would be very happy with. Some of these articles were quite influential in the academic literature and in the development of public policy. They spurred vigorous debate and produced a more nuanced understanding of the financial sector. Let me highlight a few of the contributions.\nGeorge correctly argued that banks with low capital have an incentive to take additional risk. However, there is also a countervailing force that was first pointed out by Michael Keeley of the San Francisco Fed in a paper he presented at the Bank Structure Conference in 1989.9 Keeley argued that the “charter value” of banks—that is, banks’ ability to earn profits in the future—reduces the incentives for banks to take risk. A bank that has market power—and thus the ability to profit in the future—may refrain from gambling even if it currently has low capital. His influential paper gave policymakers and academics a novel way to think about bank competition, which continues to this day.\nAnother important debate aired at the Bank Structure Conferences involved the question of what activities banks should be permitted to engage in. The banking crisis at the start of the Great Depression prompted Congress to pass the Glass–Steagall Act, which in part was designed to separate the banking business into two separate functions: Commercial banks would accept deposits and make loans, while investment banks would bring debt and equity issues to market and trade securities and other instruments. This distinction held for several decades; however, as early as the 1960s, both commercial and investment banks began to encroach on each other’s turf. This sparked a debate about whether the Glass–Steagall Act was necessary. Randy Kroszner and Raghu Rajan, both of the University of Chicago, presented an influential piece of research at the Bank Structure Conference in 1992. It was eventually published as “Is the Glass–Steagall Act justified? A study of the U.S. experience with universal banking before 1933.”10 In it, the authors argued persuasively that the fears that banks would have a conflict of interest when bringing to market securities of firms they had lent to were not well founded. Their influential paper helped support the repeal of the Glass–Steagall Act that happened as a part of the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act.\nThe Bank Structure Conference was also a forum to present research on whether and how banks are special—a topic that continues to be discussed today. In the early 1990s, Allen Berger and Greg Udell presented their work on relationship lending and the role of lines of credit in financing small firms. Their notable paper later appeared in the Journal of Business.11 Allen and Greg, both of whom are here, pointed out one way that banks can be considered special: They argued that banks learn about their customers and develop long-term relationships with borrowers that affect both the interest rates and collateral required on loans. This afternoon Allen will present his latest work with Arnoud Boot of the University of Amsterdam on bank specialness.\nBanks didn’t seem so special—at least in a good way—in the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis. Both the Bank Structure Conference and the International Banking Conference had a number of memorable presentations on risks and what to do in response to the Great Financial Crisis. We heard from Anat Admati of Stanford University about her work with colleagues arguing that banks be required to hold more capital to mitigate financial instability risks. This, as you can imagine, wasn’t very popular with the bankers in the audience. We also heard from Rob Engle of New York University, who with his co-author Christian Brownlees developed a measure of systemic risk. In a notable presentation, recent Nobel Prize winner Douglas Diamond discussed the consequences of liquidity risk.12\nThe Bank Structure and International Banking Conferences that George advanced were important forums for high-quality academic researchers to inform and learn from policymakers and industry professionals. While we’ve made a lot of progress since the first Bank Structure Conference in 1963, some of the same issues remain—and we have a host of new ones. Later today, you’ll hear about bank capital regulation—a perennial issue—as well as bank uniqueness and how bank regulators should think about social goals. The sessions on these topics promise to provide insightful and stimulating discussions.\nConcluding remarks\nThe Kaufman Center and this conference are meaningful extensions of George’s drive to create an ongoing forum for expert discussion. Among other objectives, the center aims to bring together nationally recognized experts in banking and financial services, students, the banking community, and the general public to inform policy debates and stimulate important research.\nThe center’s focus on topics that George Kaufman was passionate about is a fitting tribute to George’s memory and legacy. I anticipate hearing about the Kaufman Center and its impact on policy for years to come.\nNotes\n1 Mark C. Reed is the president of Loyola University Chicago.\n2 Douglas D.

George immediately gathered the most knowledgeable people in the Federal Reserve System to debate the alternatives.\n6 This observation is from Evanoff et al.

Most forecasters, including myself and many of you in this room, thought the momentum wouldn’t be sustained and were forecasting inflation to return near the Fed’s 2 percent target by the end of 2022.2\nWell, the economic landscape certainly looks different now! In the U.S. and elsewhere around the world, what began as narrowly concentrated shocks to relative prices has spread, turning into broad-based increases in overall inflation to levels far above every central bank’s target. Accordingly, monetary policymakers now are significantly tightening policy in order to bring inflation back in line with their price stability mandates. Since March 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has increased the federal funds rate—our main policy tool—by 3 percentage points. We also are reducing the size of our balance sheet at a relatively rapid clip.\nThe Federal Reserve is committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent average goal. To do so, I expect we will need to raise rates further and then to hold that stance for a while. Of course, the exact path forward for policy will depend on the evolution of the economy and risks to the outlook. My talk today will describe my thinking behind this path in more detail, as well as why I think we can bring inflation down relatively quickly while also avoiding a recession.\nBefore I begin, I am obliged to remind you that the views I share with you today are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the FOMC or others in the Federal Reserve System.\nEconomic overview\nThis audience is certainly familiar with the current situation. So I won’t spend too much time discussing the incoming data—which as you know have been mixed. Household and business spending have been moderating. Lower real disposable income and a policy-induced tightening in financial conditions are clearly in play, most notably in the very interest-rate-sensitive housing markets, where mortgage rates have about doubled since the beginning of the year.\nIn contrast, the labor market remains strong, with robust job growth, elevated job openings and quits, and an unemployment rate that is at the very low level we experienced before the Covid crisis.\nHowever, over the past few months we’ve heard more reports from our business and community contacts of reduced job turnover and that some are finding it easier to attract qualified workers. These are signs that some of the unusual strength in labor demand may be waning. Increasing pay and more flexible work arrangements may be part of the explanation, as well as the softer growth in spending. As of yet, these anecdotal reports haven’t shown through strongly in the aggregate data, although job growth has moderated some from its extremely rapid pace and last week’s JOLTS (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey) report contained a notable drop in vacancies.\nOn the labor supply side, while many workers who left the labor force during the pandemic have reentered the labor market, many others have not, and today labor force participation is still well below its pre-pandemic rate. Most of this shortfall is accounted for by older workers, as the pandemic apparently accelerated the retirement decision for many baby boomers who would have eventually exited from the labor force anyway. Another factor weighing on labor supply is the quite low inflow to the U.S. labor force from immigration.\nA strong labor market may still help draw some of those sitting on the sidelines back into the workforce and alleviate some labor market pressure. When I spoke here last year, I expected the labor supply response to be fairly large, but as time passes, I’ve become less optimistic that this channel will provide much relief from labor market pressures. Indeed, the labor force participation rate currently does not appear far from its long-term trend.3\nPolicy adjustments needed to bring inflation into line with goal\nThis brings me to a discussion of what is the principal issue facing the economy in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world—inflation. After more than a decade of missing our average 2 percent target to the downside, PCE inflation has risen quite quickly—from under 1 percent in mid-2020 to 6.2 percent in the most recent August data.4 Excluding food and energy, core PCE prices rose 4.9 percent over the past 12 months.\nReducing inflation to a level consistent with the Fed’s 2 percent objective will require a period of restrictive financial conditions to restore better balance between supply and demand economy-wide. This will generate below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions. But ensuring low and stable inflation is a prerequisite for achieving the sustained strong labor market outcomes that bring benefits to everyone in our society.\nThese broad contours are demonstrated in the FOMC’s latest Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which this audience is undoubtedly familiar with.5 The SEP dot plot shows that most FOMC participants are looking at something like another 100 to 125 basis points of rate increases this calendar year, with the median projection for the federal funds rate then rising a bit further to 4.6 percent at the end of next year.\nThis monetary restraint is clearly showing through in the projection for GDP growth, which the median participant sees running somewhat below its long-run rate over the next year and a half or so before moving back up to trend later in the projection period. The unemployment rate is projected to rise to 4.4 percent by late next year and then remain near that level in 2024 and 2025. While this does represent a noticeably softer labor market when compared with today’s, these certainly are not recession-like numbers.6\nAs for inflation, with supply-side improvements, restrictive monetary policy, and below-trend growth, inflation is expected to moderate significantly. According to the median SEP projection, total PCE inflation is expected to fall to 2.8 percent in 2023 and eventually return to our 2 percent target by the end of 2025. I should note that my personal forecast is broadly in line with the median SEP forecast. This is also true for many outside forecasters as we see in the NABE Outlook Survey that was released this morning, although the NABE survey’s median federal funds rate is somewhat below the SEP’s median.7\nDoes this forecast make sense?\nIn sum, the consensus baseline is projecting a large decline in inflation over the next year and a half, but with only a modest increase in the unemployment rate. A pretty good-looking soft landing. Now, we all recognize the substantial uncertainty surrounding the outlook today. But what about this baseline? What rationale can get us there? I can’t speak for others, but let me walk you through some of my thinking. And remember this is a modal forecast, and other, less rosy alternatives have a reasonable likelihood of occurring.\nI’ll begin with some familiar observations about the role that relative price adjustments and supply chain problems played in the rapid increase in prices. The pandemic induced a shift in household spending from services, such as travel or dining out, toward goods, such as appliances for home improvement projects or consumer electronics. Many goods-producing businesses struggled to keep pace with this strong demand, particularly as they faced Covid-related disruptions in production and supply chains. Labor shortages due to a broad-based drop in labor force participation were part of the story, too.\nInflation began to pick up in early 2021 as prices rose sharply for goods that were especially sensitive to supply chain problems and for services that were just beginning to reopen from the pandemic shutdowns. It has taken us time to get there, but today there are a number of signs that supply chain difficulties are improving: Ports are less congested, freight costs are falling, and supplier delivery times are improving. And with the pandemic bounce-back behind us, some heat is coming off items such as airfares and hotel prices.\nBut all is not well yet. For example, for quite a while, a shortage of microprocessors held back the production of motor vehicles. Well, the chip shortage seems to be largely resolved, but shortages of other parts are now reportedly limiting assemblies. The problems at parts suppliers appear related to difficulties they are still having in staffing production lines. I’m sure we’ve all heard many other anecdotes that highlight this interaction between labor market tightness and supply chain issues. Save this idea—I’ll come back to it in a moment.\nLooking ahead, supply chain repair will continue and consumption patterns will normalize; and we may also see some further recovery in labor force participation, though as I mentioned, I think the prospects for this are limited. Admittedly, these adjustments have taken much longer than I had expected. And disruptions from the Russian invasion of Ukraine and unpredictable Covid-related shutdowns, notably in China, haven’t helped. But progress has been made, and more is coming. And the reduced price pressures from these supply-side adjustments are an important factor in my forecast for declining inflation.\nHowever, over the past year or so we’ve seen a lot more inflation than can be explained by changes in relative prices: We’ve experienced a broad-based increase in inflationary pressures that monetary policy must address. Without a period of restrictive policy, inflation will come down some, but not to anything near our 2 percent objective. The required monetary response will restrain aggregate demand. An important question then is, how much will this restraint weigh on the employment leg of our dual mandate?\nObviously, the pandemic-era shocks have wreaked havoc on the usual relationships between economic variables and on the models we use to explain them. This has been particularly true in the labor market. Here, though, the unfamiliar patterns point to reasons why our inflation forecast may be achieved with only moderate increases in unemployment.\nFor example, there is the configuration of the Beveridge curve, where we have seen a marked increase in the vacancy rate observed for any given unemployment rate.8 It is possible that as labor demand subsides, we could see a large decline in vacancies and reduced pressure on wages and inflation without a corresponding large increase in the unemployment rate. Indeed, the drop in the ratio of vacancies to unemployment in the August JOLTS report is good news for this hypothesis.\nNow, there is a good deal of debate over this topic, and I don’t want to wade into that here. Indeed, I have a confession—I’ve always been more comfortable viewing labor market dynamics and inflation through the lens of the Phillips curve.9 Call me a hopeless romantic. Anyway, here, too, I see unusual behavior that suggests we can disinflate without a large increase in unemployment if we navigate the path to a reasonably restrictive policy setting carefully and judiciously.\nThe rapid increase in inflation we’ve experienced can be explained by a temporary steepening in the Phillips curve. Conceptually, this steeper-than-usual Phillips curve is due to the unusual interactions between labor market tightness and supply chain problems that I noted earlier—namely, the lack of materials and parts arising from shortages of labor at upstream suppliers. This phenomenon appears to be fairly widespread.\nBecause of this additional supply chain channel, at recent unemployment rates, labor market stress is having a larger effect on inflation than would typically be the case. These extra supply chain interactions were not an issue when the unemployment rate was around the same low level in 2019, and so we saw less of an inflationary impact from tight labor markets back then. If this steeper-than-usual Phillips curve is generating much of the higher inflation we are seeing now, then we should also expect this steeper curve to help bring inflation down relatively quickly with only moderate increases in unemployment. Steep on the way up is steep on the way down.\nFurthermore, I have in mind a nonaccelerationist Phillips curve, in which inflation expectations are not a mechanical function of recent inflation. Today, longer-term inflation expectations are anchored near our target, and so provide an important downward force on actual inflation. So my baseline forecast sees the combination of further supply-side repair, a steeper Phillips curve, and anchored long-run inflation expectations moving inflation back to target without having to generate an inordinate amount of slack in the economy.\nThis mechanism does, however, require reducing the heat in labor and product markets as well as maintaining a downward pull from inflation expectations. This is where tighter monetary policy comes into play. I see the nominal funds rate rising to a bit above 4-1/2 percent early next year and then remaining at this level for some time while we assess how our policy adjustments are affecting the economy. When you factor in inflation expectations and the reductions in our balance sheet, we’ll be at something equivalent to nearly a 2 percent real funds rate at this time. This is a fair amount of restriction when compared with the 1/4 to 1/2 percent long-run real neutral federal funds rate that is implied in the SEP. But I feel it is needed to facilitate market adjustments by bringing aggregate demand into better balance with aggregate supply and to ensure that long-run inflation expectations remain in check.\nOur rapid pace of rate increases has fast-tracked our arrival to such a restrictive stance. Front-loading was a good thing, given how far below neutral rates were. But overshooting is costly, too, and there is great uncertainty about how restrictive policy must actually become. This puts a premium on the strategy of getting to a place where policy can plan to rest and evaluate data and developments.\nRisks and policy communications\nThere are many risks that could derail this optimistic forecast. And, unfortunately, many of those risks appear to be to the downside: Supply-side repair could continue to move too slowly; events in Ukraine or further Covid-related shutdowns could put additional pressure on costs; and monetary policy may, on the one hand, not rein inflation in enough or, on the other hand, weigh too heavily on employment.\nAnother risk is that inflation expectations could become unanchored. Inflation will be much more difficult to rein in if households and businesses start thinking outsized increases in wages and prices are the new norm and incorporate those expectations into their decision-making. But the good news is that, in general, measures of longer-horizon inflation expectations have remained within a range that is consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective. This is true in most surveys or in the compensation for inflation that is priced into financial market assets, suggesting households and businesses see the primary drivers of inflationary pressures as being shorter-lived.\nThese perceptions can change and aren’t something we can take for granted. I believe the Federal Reserve’s strong policy actions and communications have played an important role in anchoring long-run inflation expectations by demonstrating and conveying our commitment to bring inflation back into line with our 2 percent average objective. The public and markets appear to believe we will be successful. But it is up to us to follow through and do our job.\nNow policy communications has many aspects to it. I admit we don’t always get it perfect—and we certainly hear from you when we don’t! Then again, sometimes we receive criticism about what I see as useful communications. In particular, I know some are uncomfortable with the idea that the Fed provides projections for policy rates in the SEP, knowing that we will certainly see a different path for rates if economic conditions or risks turn out otherwise. Some even say this is a good reason not to provide such projections at all—if you can’t tell me the number for sure, why tell me anything? I strongly disagree with this view. Monetary policy is clearly influencing our projections, so what’s the downside of revealing how we view its role in doing so?\nI know we have had elevated financial market volatility at times over this rate cycle. These are uncertain times, and no communications can—or should—reduce underlying fundamental economic uncertainty. But think how much additional uncertainty and costly volatility we would have unnecessarily generated over the past year if we had not augmented our policy moves with guidance about our plans for the ultimate level for the federal funds rate and its expected influence on economic outcomes.\nIndeed, even though rate hikes didn’t begin until March, the information in the SEPs and other Fed communications likely assisted in substantially tightening financial conditions by mid-year, and did so without the large dislocations in financial flows that have at times accompanied past changes in the trajectory of policy. And given how quickly financial conditions reacted to our policy communications, perhaps we have shortened one leg of the long and variable lags of the monetary transmission mechanism. This seems like a good development.\nConclusion\nI realize I may have come off this morning sounding rather optimistic. I don’t want to diminish the task in front of us or downplay the difficulties some may experience under the less favorable labor market conditions envisioned by my baseline outlook. And there is a real risk of seeing heavier costs with a larger-than-expected drop in employment. These are things we must be mindful of.\nNo matter the circumstances, the FOMC will always set policy with the goal of progressing toward both our dual mandate objectives of maximum inclusive employment and price stability as expeditiously as possible. Today, though, inflation is our primary concern. Reducing it will likely require a sustained period of restrictive monetary policy, below-trend growth, and some softening of labor market conditions. But this is necessary to restore inflation to our 2 percent target. We hope to achieve this goal as quickly and efficiently as possible, leading to a period of sustained price stability and strong labor market outcomes under which all can prosper.\nThank you.\nNotes\n1 Evans (2021).\n2 The median projection in the September 2021 NABE Outlook Survey for core inflation in 2022 as measured by the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) was 2.2 percent (National Association for Business Economics, 2021). Core inflation strips out the volatile food and energy sectors and is a better indicator of underlying inflation trends than is total inflation.\n3 After many years of sustained economic growth leading up to the Covid crisis, labor force participation had been higher than demographic and other trends would have predicted.\n4 The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge is the annual change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures.\n5 Federal Open Market Committee (2022).

Her years of long service, steadfastness, and dedication during times of great change were highly respected worldwide. The world has lost a most distinguished citizen.\nThe last time I was invited to speak here in London was in October 2018.1 Back then, central bankers around the globe were grappling with inflation that had been too low for quite a long time. And my remarks focused on the need for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to revise our monetary policy framework in order to counter what appeared to be entrenched impediments keeping inflation persistently below our 2 percent inflation objective.\nWell, almost four years later, the economic landscape certainly looks different! In the U.S. and elsewhere around the world, what began as narrowly concentrated shocks to relative prices has spread, turning into broad-based increases in overall inflation to levels far above every central bank’s target. Accordingly, monetary policymakers now are significantly tightening policy in order to bring inflation back in line with their price stability mandates.\nIn the U.S., since March 2022 the FOMC has increased the federal funds rate—our main policy tool—by 3 percentage points. We also are reducing the size of our balance sheet at a relatively rapid clip. In order to return inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent average goal, I expect we will need to raise rates further and then to hold that stance for a while. Of course, the exact path forward for policy will depend on the evolution of the economy and risks to the outlook. My talk today will describe my thinking behind this path in more detail. Before I begin, I am obliged to remind you that the views I share with you today are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the FOMC or others in the Federal Reserve System.\nEconomic overview\nThe incoming data on the U.S. economy have been mixed—with moderating spending, but quite strong labor demand. Following a robust recovery in 2021, gross domestic product (GDP) in the U.S. fell over the first half of 2022. Recent indicators point to softness in consumption and business investment, as well as a large decline in activity in the housing sector. Lower real disposable income and tighter financial conditions are clearly in play, most notably in the very interest-rate-sensitive housing markets, where mortgage rates have about doubled since the beginning of the year.\nIn contrast to these spending data, the labor market has remained very strong. Furthermore, household and business balance sheets look pretty healthy. Considering all of the various indicators and factoring in recent and prospective changes in financial conditions, I expect modest increases in GDP over the second half of the year. I’ll get into some specifics about the numbers in a few minutes.\nFirst, though, it’s important not to lose sight of how we got here. Through two-plus years of grappling with the Covid-19 pandemic and other disruptions, the economy has shown an impressive ability to adjust and carry on. By the second quarter of 2021, activity in the U.S. had surpassed its pre-pandemic level.\nIn the labor market, after peaking near an astonishing 15 percent early in the pandemic, the unemployment rate in the U.S. declined quickly. Despite the recent slowdown in GDP, the labor market remains extremely tight. Job growth has been strong, and at just 3.7 percent in August, the unemployment rate is only a bit above the very low level we experienced before the Covid crisis. Furthermore, unfilled job openings at businesses and the rate at which people quit their jobs for other opportunities remain extraordinarily high.\nHowever, over the past couple of months we’ve heard more reports of reduced job turnover and that some firms are finding it easier to attract qualified workers. These are signs that some of the unusual strength in labor demand may be waning. Increasing pay and more flexible work arrangements may be part of the explanation, as well as the softer growth in spending I noted earlier.\nOn the labor supply side, while many workers who left the labor force during the pandemic have reentered the labor market, many others have not, and today labor force participation is still well below its pre-pandemic rate. Most of this shortfall is accounted for by older workers. Of course, aging baby-boomers would have eventually retired, but the pandemic appears to have accelerated their exit from the labor force. Another factor weighing on labor supply is the quite low inflow to the U.S. labor force from immigration.\nA strong labor market may help draw some of those sitting on the sidelines back into the workforce and alleviate some labor market pressure. But as time passes, I’ve become less optimistic that this labor supply channel will be very large. Indeed, the labor force participation rate currently does not appear far from its long-term trend.2 I do, however, expect less accommodative monetary policy to be an important factor in dampening very high labor demand and bringing supply and demand conditions in the labor market into better balance over time.\nInflation dynamics\nThis brings me to a discussion of what is the principal issue facing the economy in the U.S. and elsewhere—inflation. The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge is the annual change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE). After more than a decade of missing our average 2 percent target to the downside, PCE inflation has risen quite quickly—from under 1 percent in mid-2020 to 6.3 percent in the most recent July data. With food and energy prices excluded, so-called core PCE prices rose 4.6 percent over the past 12 months.\nWhat is behind these rapid increases? Some of these increases are directly related to the pandemic. Earlier in the pandemic, with many people forced or choosing to spend more time at home, households shifted their spending from services, such as travel or dining out, toward goods, such as appliances for home improvement projects or consumer electronics. Many goods-producing businesses struggled to keep pace with this strong demand, particularly as they faced Covid-related disruptions in production and supply chains. Labor shortages due to a broad-based drop in labor force participation were part of the story, too.\nIn the U.S. these factors first showed through to inflation in early 2021, as overall activity began to normalize. Prices rose sharply for goods that were especially sensitive to supply chain problems and for services that were just beginning to reopen from the pandemic shutdowns. But these factors are not the entire story.\nBeginning last autumn, price pressures began to build more broadly. At first, price increases for goods spread beyond those items most directly impacted by pandemic dynamics. Higher inflation then extended to a wide range of services, including rent and owners’ equivalent rent (OER), which account for a significant portion of household spending and where price increases tend to be rather persistent once they get going. Overall, the broad-based nature of these increases is a sign of widespread, general demand pressures on the productive capacity of the economy.\nOf course, higher inflation is plaguing other industrialized economies as well. The U.S. experience is roughly in the middle of the pack. Here in the UK, for example, the consumer price index increased almost 10 percent over the past year.3 And across Europe the readings have been similarly high. There are differences in individual countries’ inflation experiences. Increases in durable goods prices contributed more to inflation in the U.S. than in other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries for which the comparable data are available, while rapid increases in food and energy prices intensified by the ongoing war in Ukraine were more important factors in the UK and many other industrialized economies.4 Even though the experiences differ, the rapid increase in inflation has created similar challenges across the world for consumers whose incomes may not have kept pace with rising prices and for monetary policymakers who are tasked with stabilizing prices.\nInflation should moderate\nThough the recent inflation data have been disappointing, most forecasters, myself included, anticipate that inflation in the U.S. will cool down substantially over the next couple of years. Let me explain the reasoning behind my forecast. Much of the same logic applies to other industrialized economies as well, though there undoubtedly will be differences depending on the particular circumstances faced by each.\nFirst, even though some problems still remain, there are a number of signs that supply chain difficulties are improving: Ports are less congested, freight costs are falling, and supplier delivery times are improving. But all is not well yet. For example, for quite a while, a shortage of microprocessors held back the production of motor vehicles. Well, the chip shortage seems to be largely resolved, but shortages of other parts are now reportedly limiting assemblies. The problems at the parts suppliers appear related to difficulties they are still having in staffing production lines.\nOver time, we will see supply chains further repaired. We will also see consumption return to more normal patterns. In the U.S. we may also see some further recovery in labor force participation, though as I mentioned, I think the prospects for this are limited. As these supply-side improvements occur, price pressures will diminish somewhat. Admittedly, these adjustments are taking much longer than I had expected. And disruptions from the Russian invasion of Ukraine and unpredictable Covid-related shutdowns, notably in China, have continued to snarl supply. But eventually these adjustments will occur: They are the hallmark of an economy in which prices and wages provide the signals that guide resources to their most productive and profitable uses.\nSecond, tighter monetary policy plays a very important role in my forecast of lower inflation. It is needed to pull back on aggregate demand and keep it from pushing too hard on today’s still-challenged supply conditions. It is also needed to prevent current large price increases from becoming embedded in pricing dynamics and longer-run inflation expectations. Inflation will be much more difficult to rein in if households and businesses start thinking outsized increases in wages and prices are the new norm and incorporate those expectations into their decision-making. At shorter time horizons, measures of inflation expectations picked up a lot beginning early last year as people took notice of the higher prices they’d been encountering. They have come down some lately with lower energy prices, but they still remain quite elevated. But the good news is that, in general, measures of longer-horizon inflation expectations have remained within a range that is consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective. This is true in most surveys or in the compensation for inflation that is priced into financial market assets, suggesting households and businesses see the primary drivers of inflationary pressures as being shorter-lived.\nNow, these perceptions can change and aren’t something we can take for granted. I believe the Federal Reserve’s strong policy actions and communications have played an important role in anchoring long-run inflation expectations by demonstrating and conveying our commitment to bring inflation back into line with our 2 percent average objective. The public and markets appear to believe we will be successful. But it is up to us to follow through and do our job.\nPolicy adjustments\nReducing inflation to a level consistent with the Fed’s 2 percent objective will require a period of restrictive financial conditions. These will generate below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions and restore better balance between supply and demand conditions in the U.S. My FOMC colleagues and I are acutely aware that this slowdown will, unfortunately, cause difficulties for some households and businesses. Yet, failing to restore price stability would result in far greater costs.\nSo, with this in mind, what comes next for monetary policy? Last week, the FOMC voted to raise the federal funds rate target by 75 basis points to a range of 3 to 3-1/4 percent and indicated that further rate increases will likely be in order. Also, as previously announced, in September we stepped up the pace at which we are reducing the size of our balance sheet.\nHow much more tightening might be necessary? One way to gauge this comes from the Committee’s quarterly Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) released last week, which presents FOMC participants’ forecasts of key economic variables over the next three to four years and for the longer run.5 The median SEP projection is for the federal funds rate to be in the range of 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent by the end of this year, though I would note almost as many FOMC participants wrote down 4 to 4-1/4 percent for their end-of-year numbers. So most think we’re looking at something like another 100 to 125 basis points of rate increases this calendar year. The median projection then has rates rising a bit further, to 4.6 percent at the end of next year, and then declining to 2.9 percent over the subsequent two years. My own viewpoint is roughly in line with the median assessment.\nHow should we benchmark this policy path? Here, it is useful to think of where real, or inflation-adjusted, rates are relative to some benchmark of neutrality. When making economic decisions, people naturally think about the future. With the median federal funds rate projected to be 4.4 percent by the end of the year and with core inflation next year forecast to be 3.1 percent, the real federal funds rate would be something like 1.3 percent. This is above the 1/4 to 1/2 percent range most FOMC participants see as the long-run real neutral rate, and so by this calculation, it’s clearly restrictive. And though the estimates are subject to a great deal of uncertainty, the reduction in our balance sheet is worth something like an additional 35 to 50 basis points of policy restraint.\nGiven that the funds rate was essentially at zero just seven months ago, this has been quite a pivot in monetary policy. In light of this expeditious repositioning—and because the full effect of tighter financial conditions takes time to show through to output and inflation—at some point it will be appropriate to slow the pace of rate increases and eventually let policy rates sit at a plateau for a while in order to assess how our policy adjustments are affecting the economy. As always, though, rates are not on a preset course: The FOMC will react to changes in the economic landscape as they occur and will adjust policy accordingly in order to achieve our goals of full employment and price stability.\nI know some are uncomfortable with the idea that the Fed provides projections for policy rates in the SEP, knowing that ultimately we will see a different path for rates if economic conditions or risks turn out otherwise. Some say this is a good reason not to provide such projections at all. I strongly disagree with this view. How can it be a bad thing to reveal how we see the base-case scenario playing out? Think how much uncertainty and costly volatility we would have unnecessarily generated this past year if we had not augmented our policy moves with guidance about our plans for the ultimate level for the federal funds rate. Indeed, in this rate cycle the information in the SEPs and other Fed communications likely has strongly assisted in tightening financial conditions quickly and substantially without the large dislocations in financial flows that have at times accompanied past changes in the trajectory of policy. There was no taper tantrum this time.\nThe outlook\nSo, what does all of this mean for the U.S. outlook for growth, employment, and inflation? Let us return to the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections.\nFor GDP growth, the median projection for this year is only 0.2 percent, which is consistent with growth averaging only about 1-1/2 percent over the second half of the year. Growth is projected at 1.2 percent in 2023, below the 1-3/4 percent most see as the underlying trend. So monetary restraint is clearly showing through in these numbers. Real GDP growth is expected to return to trend in 2024 and 2025.\nUnder this GDP forecast, the unemployment rate is projected to rise to 4.4 percent by late 2023 and then remain near that level in 2024 and 2025. While this does represent a noticeably softer labor market when compared to today’s, we are not looking at recession-like numbers. Indeed, the peak projected unemployment rate is less than a half a percentage point above where the FOMC sees the unemployment rate settling at over the longer run.6\nAs for inflation, with supply-side improvements, restrictive monetary policy, and below-trend growth, I expect inflation will moderate significantly. After all, that’s the goal. According to the median SEP projection, after ending this year at 5.4 percent, total PCE inflation is expected to fall to 2.8 percent in 2023 and 2.3 percent in 2024 before returning to our 2 percent target by the end of 2025.\nConclusion\nOf course, all forecasts are subject to a great deal of uncertainty and risks. And, unfortunately, many of those risks appear to be to the downside: Supply-side repair could continue to move too slowly; events in Ukraine or further Covid-related shutdowns could put additional pressure on costs; and monetary policy may, on the one hand, not rein inflation in enough or, on the other hand, weigh too heavily on employment. So we must be watchful and ready to adjust our policy stance if changes in economic circumstances dictate.\nIn sum, I can assure you that we will always set policy with the goal of progressing toward our dual mandate objectives of maximum inclusive employment and price stability as expeditiously as possible. Today, inflation is our primary concern. Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth, and there will most likely be some softening of labor market conditions. But this is necessary to restore inflation to our 2 percent target. Low and stable inflation is a prerequisite for achieving the kind of sustained strong labor market outcomes that bring benefits to everyone in our society. We hope to achieve this goal as quickly and efficiently as possible.\nThank you.\nNotes\n1 Evans (2018).\n2 After many years of sustained economic growth leading up to the Covid crisis, labor force participation had been higher than demographic and other trends would have predicted.\n3 The UK’s consumer price index data are available online.\n4 Hobijn et al.

            "content": "Good morning. On behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago I would like to welcome you to the third annual Exploring Career Pathways conference. Let me extend my deep thanks to our friends and colleagues at the Sadie Collective for pioneering this event and partnering with us to create a fantastic program. We are very excited that for the first time since we launched our partnership with the Sadie Collective, this event will feature a significant live, in-person component! We hope this will allow all of you to build even stronger connections. Speaking of being in person, I wish I could be in Chicago with you today, but my schedule changed at the last minute. Hence, I’m welcoming you on this recorded video.\nThis Career Pathways conference has quickly become the cornerstone of the Chicago Fed–Sadie Collective partnership. We look forward to building up our partnership with the Sadie Collective in the years to come through other events, initiatives, and additional support that the Chicago Fed can provide. Earlier this summer, in conjunction with the Sadie Collective, we held an event that highlighted the careers of Black women at the Chicago Fed. Nearly 100 individuals attended!\nAt the Chicago Fed we have a strong diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) program to ensure that DEI is embedded throughout our organization and within each and every one of our business lines. We do a better job of delivering on all aspects of the Federal Reserve’s mission when a diversity of backgrounds and experiences is reflected in our work. So, promoting DEI in our workplace is both the right thing to do and a business imperative for us. We include DEI goals in department and individual performance plans—with a cross-department DEI committee and our DEI consultants holding us accountable. We also work with 16 external partners and community groups, including the Sadie Collective, that support our efforts to diversify our talent pipelines. These partners help us to build and sustain a diverse workforce and an equitable and inclusive workplace where all employees feel valued, respected, and heard.\nWe believe our DEI efforts are important not just for the Chicago Fed, but also for the broader field of economics. It is no secret that economics has a representation problem—with few women, people of color, and first-generation students pursuing courses of study and careers in the field.\nBy fully committing to DEI efforts within the Bank and by emphasizing the recruitment, mentoring, and development of future economists from diverse backgrounds, we believe we can not only create a better community within the Federal Reserve, but also contribute positively to the economics discipline overall. Our partnership with the Sadie Collective is a crucial component of these efforts.\nWe are proud to cosponsor today’s event. It represents a truly collaborative effort intended to provide Black students and early-career talent with opportunities to explore career pathways in economics and related professions. We want to welcome you into these professions and support you in a variety of ways to help you thrive in these fields. As part of our partnership with the Sadie Collective, the Chicago Fed has recruited Sadie Collective Fellows into our summer internship program for the past two years, and we plan to continue this practice each summer. So, if you’re a junior, please consider applying soon to join us next summer!\nToday’s conference program features panels of economists and research assistants. You’ll be able to learn about the tools of economics research, and you’ll have the opportunity to participate in a career fair. We’re especially excited to hear from Helene Gayle, president of Spelman College. We know Helene well, as she currently serves as chair of the Chicago Fed’s board of directors. And we very much appreciate her highlighting this conference with a fireside chat conversation led by Marionette Holmes, chair of Spelman’s Economics Department.\nSpeaking of connections between the Chicago Fed and participants on today’s program, Ryan Perry, Maya Love, and Yetunde Oshagbemi—the three panelists on the research assistants panel—have all been Sadie Collective summer interns with our Research Department! Way to go! Let me now turn things over to Diamondnia Mack, membership growth associate at the Sadie Collective, who will be delivering additional welcome remarks.\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

            "content": "Introduction and disclaimer\nThe last time I spoke to you was in June 2020 for what was only my second of many virtual events to follow.1 I eventually learned how to look into the camera and how to unmute myself. Still, I much prefer to interact directly with people, and it’s great to be here in person with you today. I am especially looking forward to answering your questions and hearing your concerns following my prepared remarks. Thank you in advance for your insights.\nTwo years ago, we were just emerging from the shutdowns, unemployment was quite high, and vaccines had not yet been developed. The future looked quite uncertain. As for inflation, it was running below 1 percent and we were seeing large price declines for some items most directly affected by social distancing. Well, things sure do look different now!\nIn a nutshell, inflation is clearly much too high and monetary policy must be repositioned to bring aggregate demand and aggregate supply into balance. I support the quick removal of monetary accommodation that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has undertaken, increasing the federal funds rate 150 basis points since March and beginning to reduce the size of our balance sheet. And while the exact path forward for policy will depend on how the economy evolves, I expect it will be necessary to bring rates up a good deal more over the coming months in order to return inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent average inflation target.2\nBefore I begin, I am obliged to remind you that the views I share with you today are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the FOMC or others in the Federal Reserve System.\nEconomic overview\nThough gross domestic product (GDP) declined a bit in the first quarter of the year, underlying economic momentum continued to be strong. Importantly, growth in household consumption and business fixed investment continued at a solid pace last quarter. The top-line GDP number instead was held back by large reductions in business inventory investment and net exports, which tend to be quite volatile on a quarter-by-quarter basis. And when I look at the GDP data in conjunction with other indicators of economic activity—notably, the very strong labor market and healthy household and business balance sheets—I see the foundation for continued growth in economic activity.\nGiven how bleak the situation appeared in the spring of 2020—when much of the economy had shut down with the onset of the pandemic—our progress these past couple of years has been truly remarkable. How did we get here? Businesses showed ingenuity in finding ways to operate safely. The health care sector was able to develop and deploy vaccines extremely rapidly. And fiscal and monetary policymakers provided crucial support through prompt and massive policy actions. By the second quarter of last year, activity in the U.S. had surpassed its pre-pandemic level, and despite periodic new waves of infections, underlying growth has remained quite solid since then.\nIn terms of the labor market, after peaking near 15 percent early in the pandemic, the unemployment rate declined quickly and was a very healthy 3.6 percent in May of this year—essentially back to the low level we experienced before the Covid crisis. And by a number of other measures, such as unfilled job openings at businesses and the rate at which people quit their jobs for other opportunities, the labor market is downright tight. Many of my business and community contacts complain of difficulties in hiring and retaining workers, though increasing pay and other adjustments seem to be alleviating some of these issues.\nEven so, the number of people actually employed is still well below pre-pandemic trends, as many workers who left the labor force during the pandemic have not reentered the labor market. Today, labor force participation continues to be held down by factors such as an elevated level of retirements and Covid-related matters, including health concerns or childcare issues. Furthermore, inflows to the labor force from immigration have been quite low.\nAs the pandemic recedes further, a strong labor market will likely draw many of those still sitting on the sidelines back into the workforce. This should help alleviate some labor market pressures. At the same time, I expect less accommodative monetary policy will dampen very high labor demand.\nInflation dynamics\nThis brings me to a discussion of what is on everyone’s mind—inflation. Our preferred inflation gauge is the annual change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE). After more than a decade of sub-2 percent inflation, it has risen quite quickly from under 1 percent when I spoke to you in 2020 to 6.3 percent in the most recent April data. What is behind this rapid run-up?\nSome of it is directly related to the pandemic. With people forced or choosing to spend more time at home, households shifted their spending from services, such as travel or dining out, toward goods, such as appliances for home improvement projects or consumer electronics. Many businesses struggled to keep pace with this strong demand, particularly as they faced Covid-related disruptions in production and supply chains. Labor shortages due to the drop in participation were part of the story, too.\nThese factors first showed through to inflation in early 2021, as activity began to normalize. Prices rose sharply for goods that were especially sensitive to supply chain problems and for services that were just beginning to reopen from the pandemic shutdowns. But these pandemic-related and other supply-side factors are not the entire story. Notably, beginning last autumn, price pressures began to build more broadly. At first, price increases for goods spread beyond those items most directly impacted by pandemic dynamics. Higher inflation then extended to a wide range of services. The broad-based nature of these increases is a sign of widespread, general demand pressures on the productive capacity of the economy.\nInflation should moderate\nMost forecasters, myself included, predict that inflation will cool down substantially over the next couple of years. Let me explain the reasoning behind my forecast.\nFirst, over time, we will see supply chains repaired, consumption return to more normal patterns, and pandemic reopening effects fall behind us. In addition, the further recovery in labor force participation I mentioned earlier—some of it due to the strong labor market and higher wages we are seeing today—should lead to an easing of labor shortages that would benefit all sectors. As these supply-side improvements occur, price pressures will diminish.\nAdmittedly, these adjustments are taking much longer than I had earlier expected. And disruptions from the Russian invasion of Ukraine and unpredictable Covid-related shutdowns abroad are continuing to snarl supply, pushing prices higher for some items and adding to the overall uncertainty. But eventually these adjustments will occur: They are the hallmark of an economy in which prices provide the signals that guide resources to their most productive and profitable uses.\nSecond, tighter monetary policy plays a very important role in my forecast of lower inflation. It is needed to pull back on aggregate demand and keep it from pushing too hard on today’s still-challenged supply conditions. It is also needed to prevent current large price increases from becoming embedded in pricing dynamics and longer-run inflation expectations. Inflation will be much more difficult to rein in if households and businesses start thinking current outsized increases in wages and prices are the new norm and incorporate those expectations into their decision-making.\nMeasures of inflation expectations over shorter time horizons picked up a lot early last year and remain quite elevated. This is understandable as people took notice of the higher prices they’ve been encountering. But, in general, longer-horizon measures of inflation expectations have remained within a range that is consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective. This is true in most surveys or in the compensation for inflation that is priced into financial market assets, suggesting households and businesses see the primary drivers of inflationary pressures as being shorter-lived. And I believe the Federal Reserve’s policy actions and communications have played an important role in anchoring these expectations by demonstrating and conveying our commitment to bring inflation back into line with our 2 percent average objective.\nPolicy adjustments\nSo, with this in mind, what comes next for monetary policy? Last week, the FOMC voted to raise the federal funds rate target by 75 basis points to a range of 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent and indicated that more rate hikes will likely be in order.3 This tightening comes at the same time that we continue to reduce the size of our balance sheet.4\nHow much more tightening might be necessary? One way to gauge this comes from the Committee’s quarterly Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) released last week, which presents FOMC participants’ forecasts of key economic variables over the next three years and for the longer run.5 The median projection for the federal funds rate is for it to be in the range of 3-1/4 to 3-1/2 percent by the end of this year and 3.8 percent by the end of 2023. With projected inflation taken into account, the inflation-adjusted interest rates in this path are modestly above where the FOMC sees the long-run neutral rate—in other words, this path should have a modestly restrictive influence on the economy. My own viewpoint is roughly in line with the median assessment.\nOf course, rates are not on a preset course: The FOMC will react to changes in the economic landscape as they occur and will adjust policy accordingly in order to achieve our goals of full employment and price stability. This flexible data-driven approach was on full display at the FOMC meeting we held last week. Until just before the meeting, most or our communications had been telegraphing that a 50 basis point rate increase was in store. However, the Friday before we met, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for May was published. In it, the overall CPI accelerated and core inflation—which strips out the volatile food and energy components and is a better indicator of underlying inflation trends—remained quite high.6\nThis was quite disappointing, as the previous couple of reports had contained some hints of moderating inflation. For example, prices for core goods—where we would expect easing supply chain pressures to show up first—rose strongly in May after recording a slight decline, on balance, in March and April. Furthermore, rent and owners’ equivalent rent experienced large increases in May. Inflation in these components tends to be fairly persistent; furthermore, rent is an unavoidable expenditure that challenges many low- and moderate-income households, and as such, its inflation is particularly harmful. In addition, that same day there was a worrisome upside surprise in a key measure of long-run household inflation expectations.\nThis bad news on inflation was an important consideration for my supporting a 75 basis point hike in the federal funds rate instead of the 50 basis point increase we had signaled earlier. And as Chair Powell noted in his press conference after the FOMC meeting, this view was shared by most of the Committee.\nThe outlook\nSo what does all of this mean for the outlook for growth, employment, and inflation? Let us return to the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections.7 For GDP growth, the median projection for this year is 1.7 percent—a good deal lower than the FOMC median projection made in March, though still close to the underlying trend in GDP growth. Growth is projected to stay near this pace in 2023 and 2024. Some increase is expected in the unemployment rate, with it rising to 4.1 percent by the end of 2024. This still represents a healthy labor market by historical benchmarks; indeed, it is quite close to where the Committee sees the unemployment rate settling at over the longer run.\nAs for inflation, with supply-side improvements, somewhat restrictive monetary policy, and trend-like growth, I expect inflation will moderate significantly. My colleagues do as well. According to the median SEP, after increasing to 5.2 percent this year, total PCE inflation is expected fall to 2.6 percent in 2023 and 2.2 percent in 2024—just marginally above our 2 percent target.\nConclusion\nOf course, all forecasts are subject to a great deal of uncertainty and risks. And, unfortunately, many of those risks appear to be to the downside: Supply-side repair could continue to move too slowly; events in Ukraine or further Covid-related shutdowns in China or other countries could put additional pressure on costs; and monetary policy may, on the one hand, not rein inflation in enough or, on the other hand, weigh too heavily on employment.\nSo we must be watchful and ready to adjust our policy stance if changes in economic circumstances dictate. I recognize we have some difficult work ahead of us. But I can assure you that we will always set policy with the goal of progressing toward our dual mandate objectives of maximum inclusive employment and 2 percent inflation as expediently as possible.\nThank you, and now I look forward to your questions.\nNotes\n1 Evans (2020).\n2 For price stability, the FOMC seeks inflation that averages 2 percent over time, as measured by the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n3 This was the largest federal funds rate hike in 28 years.\n4 Federal Open Market Committee (2022b).\n5 Federal Open Market Committee (2022a).\n6 The Consumer Price Index increased 1.0 percent in May, and core CPI increased 0.6 percent; these changes brought the 12-month increases for the two measures to 8.6 percent and 6.0 percent, respectively. In normal times, inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics usually runs about 0.3 to 0.4 percentage points higher than our preferred inflation gauge—the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures.\n7 Federal Open Market Committee (2022a).\nReferences\nEvans, Charles L., 2020, “Some thoughts on the future of the U.S. economy,” speech presented virtually at the Corridor Business Journal Mid-Year Economic Review, June 24, available online.\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2022a, Summary of Economic Projections, Washington, DC, June 15, available online.\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2022b, “Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement,” press release, Washington, DC, June 15, available online.\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

            "content": "Introduction and disclaimer\nThank you for the invitation to speak to you this evening. The last time I was here, back in 2017, was for a dinner event not unlike this one.1 At the time, no one had heard of Covid, and my overwhelming monetary policy concern was the long-term undershooting of our 2 percent inflation target and the importance of getting inflation up to our symmetric target. Well, things sure do look different now!\nIn my remarks today, I will first set the stage by describing recent economic developments before delving more deeply into my thinking on underlying inflation dynamics and the implications for monetary policy.\nIn a nutshell, inflation is clearly much too high and monetary policy must be repositioned to address this. The exact path for policy will depend on the evolution of the economy. But from where we sit now, I support returning the federal funds rate to neutral expeditiously. My current assessment of neutral is in the range of 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent. And it may be necessary to bring rates somewhat above neutral for a time to return inflation to the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) 2 percent average inflation target.2\nBefore I begin, I am obliged to remind you that the views I share with you today are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the FOMC or others in the Federal Reserve System.\nEconomic overview\nThough gross domestic product (GDP) declined a bit in the first quarter of the year, underlying economic momentum continues to be strong. Importantly, growth in household consumption and business fixed investment continued at a solid pace last quarter. The top-line GDP number instead was held back by large reductions in business inventory investment and net exports.\nAs for inventories, firms continued to rebuild stocks at a hefty rate last quarter, but the pace fell short of the extremely rapid stockbuilding that took place in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nAnd the net export decline in part reflected a surge in imports, which themselves were satisfying domestic demand for consumption, investment, and inventory restocking.\nSo when I look at the GDP data in conjunction with other indicators of economic activity—notably the strong labor market and healthy household and business balance sheets—I see a good foundation for further solid growth.\nGiven how bleak the situation appeared in the spring of 2020 when much of the economy had shut down with the onset of the pandemic, our progress these past couple of years has been truly remarkable. How did we get here?\nBusinesses showed ingenuity in finding ways to operate safely. The health care sector was able to develop and deploy vaccines extremely rapidly. And fiscal and monetary policymakers provided crucial support through prompt and massive policy actions.\nBy the second quarter of last year, activity in the U.S. had surpassed its pre-pandemic level, and despite periodic new waves of infections, underlying growth has remained quite solid since then.\nIn terms of the labor market, after peaking near 15 percent early in the pandemic, the unemployment rate declined quickly and was a very healthy 3.6 percent in April—essentially back to the low level we experienced before the Covid crisis. And by a number of other measures, such as unfilled job openings at businesses and the rate at which people quit their jobs for other opportunities, the labor market is downright tight. Many of my business and community contacts complain of difficulties in hiring and retaining workers, though increasing pay and other adjustments seem to be alleviating some of these issues.\nEven so, the number of people actually employed is still well below pre-pandemic trends, as many workers who left the labor force during the pandemic have not reentered the labor market. Today labor force participation continues to be held down by factors such as fewer retirees reentering the workforce than in the past and Covid-related matters, including health concerns or childcare issues. Furthermore, inflows to the labor force from immigration have been quite low.\nAs the pandemic recedes further, strong labor market conditions will likely draw many of those still sitting on the sidelines back into the workforce. This should help alleviate some labor market pressures. But the timing and extent of this return are open questions.\nInflation dynamics\nThis brings me to a discussion of what is on everyone’s mind—inflation.\nOur preferred inflation gauge is the annual change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE). After more than a decade of sub-2 percent inflation, it has risen quite quickly from a very low 1.3 percent in 2020 to 6.6 percent in the most recent April data. What is behind this rapid run-up?\nSome of it is directly related to the pandemic. With people forced or choosing to spend more time at home, households shifted their spending from services, such as travel or dining out, toward goods, such as appliances for home improvement projects or consumer electronics.\nMany businesses struggled to keep pace with this strong demand, particularly as they faced Covid-related disruptions in production and supply chains. Labor shortages due to the drop in participation were part of the story, too.\nThese factors first showed through to inflation in early 2021, as activity began to normalize. Prices rose sharply for goods that were especially sensitive to supply chain problems and for services that were just beginning to reopen from the pandemic shutdowns.\nMotor vehicles were a prime example. In the early stages of the pandemic, the demand for cars plummeted and their prices actually declined. However, with high demand for personal as opposed to public transit and low borrowing costs, vehicle demand quickly turned around.\nAutomakers were unprepared for the surge: Expecting a severe and prolonged recession, they had substantially scaled back their production plans and ordered fewer of the microprocessors that are ubiquitous in vehicles today.\nAs a result of a dearth of chips and other shortages, auto and truck production has been severely curtailed. With constrained supply running into robust demand, motor vehicle prices have risen more than 17 percent over the past year.\nHome appliances are another example. With people spending more time at home, homeowners tackled long-delayed repairs and undertook new home improvement projects. Furthermore, low mortgage rates and pandemic-related relocations boosted the demand for housing. Demand for home furnishings accelerated accordingly, and prices for these items are running 10 percent higher than they were a year ago.\nThere is a different story coming from the service sector. Early in the pandemic people avoided traveling, and prices for hotel rooms plummeted. However, as the economy reopened and more people began to travel again, that quickly changed: Over the past 12 months, prices for lodging away from home have risen more than 20 percent.\nWhy did I pick these three items? Well, each has an easily identifiable pandemic-related reason to explain the large price increases they experienced. Also, price changes in these items had a big impact on the top-line inflation numbers—and so, too, they could contribute substantially to reductions in inflation as the particular factors I just noted are unwound. Let me give you some numbers to illustrate.\nBetween February 2021 and February 2022, 12-month core Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation shot up from 1.3 percent to 6.4 percent and has stayed near that pace since.3\nAlmost half of this pickup reflected outsized gains in prices for the three items I just mentioned—new and used motor vehicles, home furnishings and supplies, and hotel and motel accommodations—which together account for only about 15 percent of the core CPI.\nSo what about the flip side? I expect we will see meaningful relief from the pressures related to chip shortages, clogged supply chains, the shift to goods consumption, and reopening effects. This relief should provide a substantial deceleration in the overall core price index. For example, if the price levels for the three items I highlighted did not change at all over the next year while price increases for all other items stayed the same, then core CPI inflation would drop to about 3-1/2 percent. This would surely get everyone’s notice.\nMonetary policy must adjust\nEven improvements like these won’t be enough on their own. Other pricing challenges remain.\nFirst, supply chain issues have proved stubbornly difficult to solve. And as the Russian invasion of Ukraine and further Covid disruptions in China remind us, unexpected events can generate even further supply-side problems.\nAnd, second, we still have the other 85 percent of core CPI to deal with. Inflation for these items moved up from about 1-1/4 percent in February 2021 to almost 4-1/2 percent in April 2022—well above the CPI-equivalent of the Federal Reserve’s average 2 percent target for total PCE inflation.\nNow, surely supply chain factors played some role in pushing up these prices, so alleviating bottlenecks will also help restrain cost pressures on the 85 percent bucket as well. And all sectors should benefit from further recovery in labor force participation leading to an easing of labor shortages.\nWith that said, monetary policy still has a critical role to play in addressing this 85 percent bucket. Policy needs to moderate the strong demand pressures underlying the broad-based run-up in prices. Policy also needs to act to keep longer-run inflation expectations in check; inflation will be much more difficult to bring down if households and businesses start thinking current outsized increases in wages and prices are the new norm. So far these increases seem like adjustments to the unusual circumstances we have faced in the past two years. Indeed, although short-run measures of inflation expectations are quite high, longer-run expectations appear in line with our 2 percent average inflation target.\nSo, clearly, interest rates need to rise and we need to reduce the size of our balance sheet. How much adjustment will ultimately be needed? That is a tough question to answer.\nThe current fed funds rate is far below a neutral setting—which, as I mentioned before, I think is in the range of 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent. So policy needs substantial repositioning.\nI favor a front-loaded adjustment in the fed funds rate toward the neutral range. I think front-loading is important to speed up the necessary tightening of financial conditions, as well as for demonstrating our commitment to restrain inflation, thus helping to keep inflationary expectations in check.\nAnd given how far policy is below neutral today, the risks to our employment mandate of moving expeditiously seem modest.\nThe FOMC’s half percentage point increase in the funds rate at our May meeting is consistent with this approach, as is the initiation of balance sheet reduction that is coming in June.\nAfter front-loading our initial tightening, I am hopeful we can transition to a more measured pace of rate increases.\nWith inflation dynamics uncertain, this measured pace would give us time to monitor supply chains, assess inflation dynamics, and evaluate the impact of less accommodative monetary policy on the labor market.\nIf we need to, we will be well positioned to respond more aggressively if inflation conditions do not improve sufficiently or, alternatively, to scale back planned adjustments if economic conditions soften in a way that threatens our employment mandate.\nIt is too early to know what the outcome of that calculus will be. But with the current degree of inflationary pressures, I could see the need to take policy somewhat beyond neutral to achieve our price stability mandate. Given the current strength in aggregate demand, strong demand for workers, and the supply-side improvements that I expect to be coming, I believe a modestly restrictive stance will still be consistent with a growing economy.\nConclusion\nWe will learn a lot in the months ahead about how both monetary policy tightening and supply-side adjustments are influencing inflation. Monitoring and assessing inflation pressures and balancing risks to growth will be crucial for judging the appropriate path for policy over this time.\nAs always, monetary policymakers can best achieve our dual mandate objectives of price stability and maximum inclusive sustainable employment by staying focused on our goals and clearly communicating our strategy for achieving them. I am sure that those principles will serve us at the Federal Reserve well as we maneuver through the uncertain months ahead.\nThank you, and now I look forward to your questions.\nNotes\n1 Evans (2017).\n2 For price stability, the FOMC seeks inflation that averages 2 percent over time, as measured by the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n3 Measures of core inflation strip out volatile food and energy components.\nReference\nEvans, Charles L., 2017, “Monetary policy challenges in a new inflation environment,” speech for the Money Marketeers of New York University, Inc., New York, June 19, available online.\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

            "content": "Introduction\nThank you for inviting me to speak at the Prairie State College Foundation’s annual breakfast. It’s a pleasure to be with you again, and I am very much looking forward to our discussion after my formal remarks. The on-the-ground observations about the economy from community leaders like yourselves are very important inputs into my thinking on monetary policy.\nBut before I begin, I want to acknowledge the severe hardships the Ukrainian people are enduring as a result of Russia’s invasion. This is just an awful event. May the people of Ukraine and all who are affected by this crisis remain strong and as safe as possible.\nAnd I should note, too, that the views I share with you today are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or others in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe economy today\nWhen I spoke to you last April, vaccines were becoming widely available and there was good reason to be optimistic about the prospects for economic growth. At the same time, while we were seeing large price increases for some items, overall inflation was quite low—only 1.6 percent. In this environment, I expected policy rates to remain low for quite some time. Well, the situation sure has changed since then.\nAlthough the Covid-19 virus continued to take a horrible toll on the health and livelihoods of so many people, my optimism about growth in 2021 was well-founded. Indeed, our progress these past two years was remarkable given how dire an event the pandemic has been. Households and businesses showed amazing ingenuity in finding ways to operate safely. The health care sector was able to develop and deploy vaccines extremely rapidly. And fiscal and monetary policymakers provided crucial support through policy actions.\nBy the second quarter of last year, real gross domestic product (GDP) in the U.S. had surpassed its pre-pandemic level; and despite new waves of infections during the second half, growth for the year was a quite robust 5.6 percent and the economy appears to have entered 2022 with solid momentum. As for the labor market, after peaking near 15 percent early in the pandemic, the unemployment rate declined quickly and this morning’s report for March shows a very healthy 3.6 percent—just slightly above the 3.5 percent low we experienced before the Covid crisis.\nHere in the Chicago area the contours are similar. In the midst of the shutdowns, the local unemployment rate soared to almost 17 percent in April 2020—about 2 percentage points higher than the national average. As the economy reopened and growth picked up, the unemployment rate fell quickly and was 5.1 percent in January 2022. Though the rate is still too high—it was at an all-time low of 3.2 percent prior to the pandemic—this improvement is still quite impressive.\nIf you just look at the national unemployment rate, the labor market appears to have largely recovered from the pandemic. And by a number of other measures, such as unfilled job openings at businesses and the rate at which people quit their jobs for other opportunities, the labor market is downright tight. Many of my business and community contacts complain of difficulties in hiring and retaining workers. However, the number of people actually employed is still well below pre-pandemic trends, as many workers who left the labor force during the pandemic have not reentered the labor market. This is especially true of older workers who retired in unusually large numbers.\nIn economic statistics, the labor force counts how many people are either employed or actively looking for work—so it’s a measure of the supply of available workers. Today, for a variety of reasons about 175,000 fewer people are in the labor force than before the pandemic. However, given population and labor force participation trends, in the absence of the pandemic we would have expected an increase of about 1.3 million over this time. As the pandemic recedes further, strong labor market conditions will likely draw many of those sitting on the sidelines back into the workforce. This should help alleviate some labor market pressures. But the timing and extent of this return are open questions.\nBusinesses are adjusting to these labor shortages in a number of ways. One thing making this complicated is that the pandemic may have also permanently altered many work arrangements. A wide array of job features is in play. Take, for example, some conversations I recently had with business leaders located in small and medium-sized cities. On the one hand, a number of those running smaller operations talked about the difficulties they were having in retaining back-office staff because these workers are being actively recruited for remote positions with larger employers. On the other hand, an executive at a large manufacturer reported their company had recently hired back a number of high-skilled back-office and digital staff who had left them to take remote positions at West Coast firms, but had not relocated. The executive noted that employees’ desire for a more fulfilling in-person culture and the firm’s decision to increase salaries were important factors in this reversal.\nI find these anecdotes fascinating, as they highlight the many different ways we could see the labor market structure evolve over time. As of today, it is highly uncertain how it is all going to play out.\nWhile these pandemic-related adjustments are on the top of people’s minds today, we shouldn’t lose sight of some important labor market trends that were in place before the pandemic. The long-run sustainable growth rate of the economy is determined by the pool of available labor and the productivity of that labor. And productivity depends on workers’ skills and the technology and capital they use in production. This is simple arithmetic.\nAlthough we should get a temporary boost as the pandemic further retreats, that underlying growth trend in the pool of available workers was quite modest prior to the pandemic and is likely to remain so for some time. This is due to a number of demographic factors, such as the retirement of the baby boom cohort and reduced immigration.\nWell, if the pool of available workers isn’t growing much, it’s very important for that pool to be highly productive if we are going to achieve solid growth. Institutions such as Prairie State College can play an important role in this regard. A well-educated labor force with the skills to work with cutting-edge technology is key for boosting productivity and supporting the kind of sustainable economic growth that is so crucial for achieving broad-based prosperity over time.\nIn addition to upending the labor market, the pandemic set in motion other significant changes in the economy. Let me give you one example that’s illustrative of a more general challenge we are facing today. With people forced to spend more time at home, households shifted their spending from services, such as travel or dining out, toward goods, such as appliances for home improvement projects or consumer electronics. And many of these items contain a large number of sophisticated microprocessors. Well, so do cars. And at the same time, expecting a severe and prolonged recession, automakers substantially scaled back their production plans and ordered fewer microprocessors used in motor vehicles.\nAs it turned out, the demand for vehicles recovered much more robustly than most expected. But firms manufacturing consumer electronics and other such items had absorbed both chip inventories and new production, leaving fewer chips available for vehicles. As a result of this and other shortages, auto and truck production has been severely curtailed. And with supply curtailed but demand still robust, motor vehicle prices have surged more than 23 percent over the past year.\nThis is just one story, but in many areas we are seeing producers struggling with such supply bottlenecks. In some cases, lean, just-in-time production processes have come under pressure from multiple directions simultaneously as the flood of demand has put logistics systems under immense strain. The result has been a surge in costs that have been passed through to higher prices for many items.\nMarket forces should help temper the recent inflation surge\nThis brings me to inflation. Early last year, as activity began to normalize, prices for goods and services that were especially sensitive to the pandemic, such as hotel accommodations and air travel, adjusted higher. However, as the year progressed, strong demand and continuing supply challenges, including shortages of workers in many sectors, resulted in prices rising across a broader range of goods and services. Inflation for the year was an uncomfortably high 5.8 percent and rose further to 6.4 percent in February.1 For people whose incomes have not kept pace, higher inflation is a real hardship.\nIt is important to step back and think about the economic factors behind the massive jump in inflation over the past year. After all, in February 2021, inflation was only 1.6 percent—below the FOMC’s objective of inflation averaging 2 percent over time. We often hear commentary that today’s inflation is the highest we’ve seen since the early 1980s. But our experience today is much different. Back then, overly accommodative monetary policy during the 1960s and ’70s helped fuel a slow but persistent buildup in long-run inflation expectations—that’s economist jargon for the underlying views of wage and price growth that get built into the psychology of households and businesses. Of course, this was the inflation that former Fed Chair Paul Volcker eventually had to address with draconian measures.2 In contrast, the pickup in inflation over the past year occurred rapidly—and did so after more than a decade of sub-2 percent actual inflation and with longer-run inflation remaining quite low.\nAs I alluded to earlier, today’s surge largely reflects real supply shocks and weakened supply chains and logistics in the face of strong, outsized demand for goods and diminished labor force participation. These have been the strongest forces underlying the past year’s rapid increase. As we learned in our introductory economics courses, a shift up in demand and a shift down in supply in a market will cause the price for that good or service to rise. And that increase in price will dampen demand, bring forth more supply, and eventually eliminate shortages.\nA broad take-away I get from the data and discussions with business and community leaders is that this market mechanism is working to allocate scarce resources to their most critical uses. We’re not there yet, but a reallocation of demand back toward services, an increase in supply in response to higher relative prices and wages, and adjustments in business models to adapt to the evolving environment will eventually alleviate many of the supply-side pressures we face today. In many cases, though, this is going to be a complicated process.\nAdjusting monetary policy\nThat said, as I noted before, since last summer inflation has broadened out to a wide range of goods and services. This is a signal of more general pressure from aggregate demand on today’s impinged supply. If monetary policy did not respond to these broader inflation pressures, we would see the expectation of continued high inflation become embedded in economic decisions, and we would have even harder work to do to rein it in. So monetary policy must shift to removing accommodation in a timely fashion, which is what you’ve seen in the latest actions by and communications from the FOMC.\nA few weeks ago, the FOMC announced its decision to raise the federal funds rate target by 25 basis points to a range of 1/4 to 1/2 percent.3 Furthermore, we indicated we will begin reducing the size of our balance sheet at a coming meeting.\nThe Committee also released its quarterly Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which presents FOMC participants’ forecasts of key economic variables over the next three years and for the longer run.4 The projections show that including the initial move in March, the median FOMC participant expected the equivalent of seven 25 basis point increases in the federal funds rate by the end of this year and three more 25 basis point increases in 2023. All told, those increases would put the federal funds rate by the end of 2023 and 2024 at 2-3/4 to 3 percent. This is a bit above the median longer-run estimate of 2.4 percent, and so, it represents a slightly restrictive policy stance.\nAgain, this is the median projection, and my colleagues hold some range of views as to what exactly constitutes appropriate policy in the current environment. My own baseline assessment is in line with the median projection, though given the great deal of uncertainty we face today, I am well aware that developments may transpire in a way that would cause me to alter my assessment.\nFor GDP growth, the median projection for this year is 2.8 percent, with growth moderating to near 2 percent in 2023 and 2024. With the longer-term growth trend for the economy seen at about 1-3/4 percent, these GDP numbers are solid ones. The labor market is expected to remain quite strong as well, with the unemployment rate near 3-1/2 percent from the end of this year through 2024.\nThis brings me to the big question for today: What about inflation? As we continue to adapt to and better control the virus, as market forces work to reallocate productive resources, and as monetary policy tightens, we should see a reduction in inflationary pressure. At about 4-1/4 percent, the median forecast for inflation this year is still high, but inflation is expected to moderate as we move through the projection period, eventually coming down to 2.3 percent by the end of 2024. I would note that the general contours of these Federal Reserve projections are shared by most private-sector forecasters.\nNeedless to say, in the current environment all forecasts are subject to a great deal of uncertainty and risks. Of course, two major sources of uncertainty today are the crisis in Ukraine and waves of the virus that are currently hitting abroad. Both of these present upside risks to inflation and downside risks to growth, and we will be monitoring their impact on the economy very closely. As we move through the year, we will certainly learn more and will be prepared to adjust policy as needed.\nConclusion\nTo sum up, economic activity and employment continue to strengthen while inflation remains well above our objective. To steer the economy to our dual mandate goals of full employment and 2 percent average inflation, the Fed has begun to reduce the degree of monetary accommodation. Our recent 25 basis point rate hike was the first of what appears to be many this year.\nGiven all the uncertainty we face today, policymakers need to be cautious, humble, and nimble as we navigate the course ahead. Monetary policy is not on a preset course: Each FOMC meeting’s decision will be based on an assessment of economic and financial conditions at the time, as well as the risks to the outlook. But all of our decision-making will be squarely focused on achieving the Federal Reserve’s mandated policy goals of maximum inclusive employment and inflation that averages 2 percent over time.\nThank you.\nNotes\n1 Our preferred measure of inflation is the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n2 Paul Volcker was the Chair of the Federal Reserve from August 6, 1979, until August 11, 1987.

The Chicago Fed has been very fortunate to have you on our Detroit Branch board of directors since 2017. I’ve been very grateful for your many contributions, among which of course are your keen insights on the Detroit and Michigan economies.

And many of these items contain a large number of sophisticated microprocessors. Well, so do cars.

But firms manufacturing consumer electronics and other such items had absorbed both chip inventories and new production, leaving fewer chips available for vehicles. As a result of this and other shortages, auto and truck production has been severely curtailed. And with supply curtailed but demand still robust, motor vehicle prices have surged more than 23 percent over the past year.\nThis is just one story, but in many areas we are seeing producers struggling with such supply bottlenecks. In some cases, lean, just-in-time production processes have come under pressure from multiple directions simultaneously as the flood of demand has put logistics systems under immense strain. The result has been a surge in costs that have been passed through to higher prices for many items.\nMarket forces should help temper the recent inflation surge\nThis brings me to inflation. Early last year, as activity began to normalize, prices for goods and services that were especially sensitive to the pandemic adjusted higher. However, as the year progressed, strong demand and continuing supply challenges, including shortages of workers in many sectors, resulted in prices rising across a broader range of goods and services. Inflation for the year was an uncomfortably high 5.8 percent and rose further to 6.1 percent in January.2 For people whose incomes have not kept pace, higher inflation is a real hardship.\nIt is important to step back and think about the economic factors behind the massive jump in inflation over the past year. After all, in February 2021, inflation was only 1.6 percent—below the FOMC’s objective of inflation averaging 2 percent over time.\nWe often hear commentary that today’s inflation is the highest we’ve seen since the early 1980s. But our experience today is much different. Back then, overly accommodative monetary policy during the 1960s and ’70s helped fuel a slow but persistent buildup in long-run inflation expectations—that’s economist jargon for the underlying views of wage and price growth that get built into the psychology of households and businesses. Of course, this was the inflation that former Fed Chair Paul Volcker eventually had to address with draconian measures.3 In contrast, the pickup in inflation over the past year occurred rapidly—and did so after more than a decade of sub-2 percent actual inflation and with longer-run inflation remaining quite low.\nAs I alluded to earlier, today’s surge largely reflects real supply shocks and weakened supply chains and logistics in the face of strong, outsized demand for goods and diminished labor force participation. These have been the strongest forces underlying the past year’s rapid increase.\nA broad take-away I get from the data and discussions with business and community leaders is that markets are working to allocate scarce resources to their most critical uses. A shift in demand back toward services, an increase in supply in response to higher relative prices and wages, and adjustments in business models to adapt to the evolving environment will eventually alleviate many of the supply-side pressures we face today. Yet in many cases it is going to be a complicated process.\nAdjusting monetary policy\nThat said, as I noted earlier, since last summer inflation has broadened out to a wide range of goods and services. This is a signal of more general pressure from aggregate demand on today’s impinged supply. If monetary policy did not respond to these broader pressures, we would see higher inflation become embedded in inflation expectations, and we would have even harder work to do to rein it in.\nSo monetary policy must shift to removing accommodation in a timely fashion, which is what you’ve seen in the latest actions by and communications from the FOMC. Last week, the FOMC announced its decision to raise the federal funds rate target by 25 basis points to a range of 1/4 to 1/2 percent.4 Furthermore, we indicated we will begin reducing the size of our balance sheet at a coming meeting.\nThe Committee also released its quarterly Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which presents FOMC participants’ forecasts of key economic variables over the next three years and for the longer run.5 The projections show that including the initial move, the median FOMC participant expects the equivalent of seven 25 basis point increases in the federal funds rate by the end of this year and three more 25 basis point increases in 2023. All told, those increases would put the federal funds rate by the end of 2023 and 2024 at 2-3/4 to 3 percent. This is a bit above the median longer-run estimate of 2.4 percent, and so, it represents a slightly restrictive policy stance.\nThis is the median projection, and my colleagues hold some range of views as to what exactly constitutes appropriate policy in the current environment. My own viewpoint is in line with the median assessment.\nFor GDP growth, the median projection for this year is 2.8 percent, with growth moderating to near 2 percent in 2023 and 2024. With the longer-term growth trend for the economy seen at about 1-3/4 percent, these GDP numbers are solid ones. The labor market is expected to remain quite strong as well, with the unemployment rate near 3-1/2 percent from the end of this year through 2024.\nThis brings me to the big question for today: What about inflation? As we continue to adapt to and better control the virus, as market forces work to reallocate productive resources, and as monetary policy tightens, we should see a reduction in inflationary pressure. At about 4-1/4 percent, the median forecast for inflation this year is still high, but inflation is expected to moderate as we move through the projection period, eventually coming down to 2.3 percent by the end of 2024. I would note that the general contours of these Federal Reserve projections are shared by most private-sector forecasters.\nNeedless to say, in the current environment all forecasts are subject to a great deal of uncertainty and risks. Of course, two major sources of uncertainty today are the crisis in Ukraine and waves of the virus that currently are hitting abroad. Both of these present upside risks to inflation and downside risks to growth, and we will be monitoring their impact on the economy very closely.\nConclusion\nTo sum up, economic activity and employment continue to strengthen while inflation remains well above our objective. To steer the economy to our dual mandate goals of full employment and 2 percent average inflation, the Fed has begun to reduce the degree of monetary accommodation. Our recent 25 basis point rate hike was the first of what appears to be many this year.\nWith all of the uncertainty we face today, policymakers need to be cautious, humble, and nimble as we navigate the course ahead. Monetary policy is not on a preset course: Each meeting’s decision will be based on an assessment of economic and financial conditions at the time, as well as the risks to the outlook. But all of our decision-making will be squarely focused on achieving the Federal Reserve’s mandated policy goals of maximum inclusive employment and inflation that averages 2 percent over time.\nThank you.\nNotes\n1 Sandy K.

            "content": "Introduction\nBefore I begin my remarks, let me remind you that the views I will express today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\nThis paper raises three important questions facing policymakers today: 1) What is the extent of current labor market vitality, and how important is that? 2) How should financial stability issues be considered? And 3) what is the outlook for inflation control today?1 A hallmark of the Monetary Policy Forum is that the conference paper written by academic and Wall Street economists inevitably raises a number of probing questions for Fed policymakers like Governor Waller and me to discuss. To honor this tradition, I will focus on the broader policy issues raised in the paper and try to avoid ticking off areas of agreement or technical concerns. That’s better left for the Money and Banking workshop in Chicago.2 Well, ok, I suppose you rarely hear areas of agreement in the workshop, but you know what I mean.\nMacroprudential tools to manage financial stability risks\nIt is an understatement to say that our current situation is complex: two years of Covid-19 distress; global supply chains in disarray; strong fiscal, monetary, and financial support; and 7-1/2 percent annual CPI inflation in the U.S.3 As we discuss the implications of these factors for monetary policy, I feel the need for a quick public service announcement: Monetary policy is at its foundation a single tool capable of addressing a single objective. Asset purchases and forward guidance are different implementations of this tool, not independent instruments. Still, as a Fed policymaker, I enthusiastically embrace our dual mandate for maximum employment and price stability. The correlation structure of the economy means that usually there is no policy conflict in achieving both objectives. When a conflict does arise, we may face some difficult trade-offs, but these have been long-studied and the decision-making is manageable.\nBut monetary policy is not the only game in town. Fiscal and regulatory policies will be crucial complementary tools in many cases—such as when aggregate demand is far too weak or financial excesses loom large. Importantly, these situations are more likely to arise in a low r* environment4—when the proximity of the effective lower bound (ELB) reduces monetary policy capacity and investors’ views about potential returns may be at odds with the economy’s fundamentally lower average rate of return. On the former, the CARES Act and other fiscal measures provided strong support to the economy during this horrifying pandemic. The recovery we’ve seen could not have been achieved by monetary policy alone. On the latter, I have spoken about the roles of monetary and regulatory policy in addressing financial instability risks a good bit over the years since the Great Financial Crisis.5\nMy view is that as long as the U.S. and global economies are in a low r* world, nominal interest rates will remain low and we will experience episodes close to or at the ELB. Unless the FOMC is to jettison our responsibility to promote maximum employment and price stability, the financial stability burden should be primarily on financial regulators. Our dual mandate objectives are challenging enough without taking on a third financial stability mandate, all with a single interest rate tool. We instead need more macroprudential tools and appropriately vigilant supervisory oversight to address these concerns. Many prescriptions may seem unpalatable, such as Admati and Hellwig’s recommendation for at least 20 percent capital at banks.6 But I mention this example because the magnitude emphasizes that important unaddressed financial instability risks in the system could have serious consequences for tens of millions of households.\nCurrent inflation situation is not typical\nBefore I turn specifically to the topic of “running the economy hot,” let me offer a little different perspective on the history of monetary policy “cooling off the economy.” The Federal Reserve’s low inflation credibility was fought for and attained in the Volcker and Greenspan eras. In order to reduce inflationary pressures, restrictive monetary policies repeatedly led to employment losses and recessions.\nWhy was so much restriction necessary? During this time, underlying inflation was well above the Fed’s (then implicit) objective, and periodically cyclical inflation also rose higher still. Monetary policy needed to counter both of these factors that pushed inflation well above target. This two-fisted restrictiveness led to recessions and high unemployment—sometimes intentionally and sometimes because the already moderating economy was subsequently hit by unexpected shocks. So, historically, the other side of “how hot should the economy run?” is the recognition that labor market vibrancy has been sacrificed at times by more restrictive monetary policies in the name of curbing excess inflation or even an inflation scare, with higher inflation never showing up.\nWhat about now? Our present monetary policy setting is wrong-footed against the current, sharp increase in inflation. That is for sure. But the sources of these large relative price increases may be different from more typical cyclical inflation episodes. Furthermore, by my reading, underlying inflation appears to still be well anchored at levels consistent with the Fed’s average 2 percent objective, and so—unlike in the Volker and Greenspan eras—no extra monetary restraint is needed to bring trend inflation down. So I see our current policy situation as likely requiring less ultimate financial restrictiveness compared with past episodes and posing a smaller risk to the employment mandate than many times in the past.\nThat said, I recognize there is not a clean orthogonal decomposition between cyclical and underlying inflation, and we need to monitor developments carefully to make sure the current spike in inflation does not bleed over into an unwelcome increase in the underlying trend. If it does, more restrictive policy will be needed.\nInclusivity and the benefits of running the economy hot\nNow, more directly, what about the question of “how hot should the economy run,” and how does it relate to our maximum and inclusive employment mandate? In a low r* environment that is devoid of Covid-19-induced disruptions, we would most likely find ourselves in the position of battling the downward-bias to inflation caused by the proximity of the ELB. As a monetary policymaker, I would cheer continued vibrancy for all segments of the labor market and hold off on potentially unnecessary policy restrictiveness until inflation began rising to levels that were incompatible with average 2 percent PCE inflation over time.7\nIndeed, as you can see from this chart, we have been fighting this low inflation battle for nearly my entire tenure as Chicago Fed President. Even with the recent spike, the price level today is still 2-3/4 percent below a 2 percent trend line starting at 2007, when I got the job. It’s about 1-1/2 percent below a 2 percent trend line starting from 2012, when we formally adopted the 2 percent target. And this gap actually increased some during the “hot period” identified in the conference paper and shaded red on this chart.\nWe don’t know what is on the other side of the current inflation spike, but if a low r* world reemerges, we may once again be looking at a situation where there is nothing to fear from running the economy hot. And there are important benefits of doing so. As shown in the conference paper, a hot economy has provided added improvements in unemployment for groups that generally experience worse labor market outcomes.\nNow the paper does not identify similar improvements in labor force participation gaps. But there are significant long-term trends in the labor force participation rate that need to be accounted for. It’s also well documented that the cycle in participation lags considerably that of unemployment. So, the paper’s methodology, which is tightly tied to contemporaneous unemployment rate gaps, may not pick up relatively better labor force participation outcomes for disadvantaged groups. It seems natural that lower unemployment should eventually translate into higher participation. For instance, Hobijn and Şahin (2021) emphasize that people leave the labor force at much greater rates when they are unemployed than when they have a job, so lower unemployment rates would contribute to keeping people in the labor force.\nI also believe greater inclusion should take account of different parts of the income distribution, given its increasing skewness over the past 20 years. Mean household income is $97,000; median household income is $67,000. Income skewness means that focusing on average income pushes focus to the 65th percentile, away from the 50th percentile. And if the 65th is an interesting object, why not also 35th percentile income developments?\nWho bears the greatest costs from unnecessary restrictiveness or benefits more from strong and long growth? We should understand better the implications of restrictive policies in an economy with highly skewed income distributions. We can debate the merits of running the economy hot and the risks, sure. But I think we have a good deal of room to promote vibrant labor market outcomes for all up until the point we are more confident that inflation risks are incompatible with price stability.\nA policy adjustment is in order\nThis brings me to our current high inflation situation. Despite all the typical Evans dovishness I’ve just expounded, I agree the current stance of monetary policy is wrong-footed and needs substantial adjustment.\nLet’s go back to last spring, when prices first began to rise sharply. The April 2021 FOMC statement described the higher inflation then as coming from transitory factors.8 For me, this assessment hinged on the fact that the dramatic surge was accounted for by shockingly fast, large increases in prices for a limited number of items (used cars, gasoline, appliances, hotel accommodations, etc.).\nThese swift relative price increases didn’t look monetary in nature. The inflation path certainly didn’t follow the hallmark characteristics of the Friedman–Phelps narrative or many other models in which monetary accommodation slowly generates inflation: This encompasses inflation paths generated by movements along the Phillips curve (including a possible steeper one),9 excessive money growth, or even an erosion of Fed credibility.\nInstead, the spike in prices looks more like a volatility shock of the kind in the models of Stock–Watson and Cogley–Sargent. Those statistical models don’t come with economic labels for these shocks, but economic factors that could fall into this category can include the following: an abrupt increase in demand for goods to replace lost consumption of in-person services; an unusually large and swift fiscal response quickly fueling stronger demand for goods; and a sharp collapse of just-in-time supply chains under the weight of this outsized flow of goods.\nBut by the fall of 2021, with continued stress from the Delta variant and dysfunctional supply chains, these price increases had proven more persistent and become more widespread than I had expected. Furthermore, labor-market pressures had intensified as labor supply did not bounce back as quickly as expected.\nClearly, it is another understatement to say that inflation has greatly exceeded the moderate persistent overshooting of 2 percent the Committee sought earlier and that a policy adjustment is in order. But how big will it need to be?\nAn uncertain inflation outlook\nThe conference paper addresses the likelihood of scenarios with greater and broader persistence in inflation. The paper uses the lens of the three-equation linearized New Keynesian model to describe current risks of experiencing persistently higher inflation—particularly those emanating from the deanchoring of inflation expectations. As I noted earlier, to date longer-run inflation expectations have remained contained. I am well aware of the risk that these might move higher, however.\nOf course, there are other models to analyze. Our Chicago Fed dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model offers some insights into how to interpret the shocks emanating from semiconductor supply shortages, durable goods production straining logistics and transportation, and other factors. The model infers quarterly structural shocks from its history of forecast errors for real activity and inflation.\nCurrently, the data infer a configuration of shocks that portends declining inflation pressures through this year. This is because the model attributes most of the past year’s inflation to relatively shorter-lived markup shocks—and little to more persistent technology disruptions. Recall this shock identification reflects the model’s attempt to capture the full range of co-movements observed for output, consumption, investment, labor hours, and inflation. If the data roll-in in a way that is better explained by more persistent shocks in technology, then these would also generate more persistent high inflation pressures and lend support for a stronger policy response.\nI find this additional source of information about inflation persistence to be a good discipline against scary guesses that the world is about to end. As we move through the year, we should gain more evidence on the sources of persistence and the sources of improvement in the inflation outlook. At the moment, to me it still appears that inflation is due more to real-side factors, which relative price signals should eventually correct, than to persistent nominal monetary phenomena. But how this plays out will be key for my monetary policy decision-making over the year. “Careful monitoring” will continue to be the watchwords.\nConclusion\nSo, to conclude, how should one come down on the question of whether running the economy hot is foolish—or when does it become foolish? Of course, the answer is it depends. It depends on how strong the relationship between growth and inflation is today, the dynamics of inflation expectations, the level of r*, and the associated proximity of the ELB. Or, if you don’t believe in Phillips curves, the question is largely moot because you aren’t going to worry about high employment generating inflation.\nWith regard to the policy situation today, I still see current inflation as largely being driven by unusual supply-side developments related to the Covid-19 shock. But inflation pressures clearly have widened in the broader economy to a degree that requires a substantial repositioning of monetary policy. What that repositioning ultimately will look like will depend a good deal on the same factors that enter the running-hot calculus.\nNotes\n1 Carpenter et al.

            "content": "Welcoming remarks delivered by Austan D. Goolsbee, president and chief executive officer, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, at the Fed Listens event held at the Bank on August 22, 2023.\n\nGood afternoon. I am Austan Goolsbee, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. It is my pleasure to welcome those of you in the room and those of you attending virtually to this Fed Listens event: Joining the Labor Force After Covid—A Discussion on Youth Employment.\n\nI am excited to have Governor Michelle Bowman and our fine panelists joining me here today. Since Fed Listens launched in 2019, the Governor has been a passionate leader of the program, contributing to sessions like this one across the nation. I have been looking forward to the opportunity to welcome Governor Bowman, our panel, and our audience to this important conversation.\n\nThe Fed Listens series is a critical opportunity for Fed policymakers, at both the regional Banks and the Board of Governors in Washington, to hear directly from the people we serve.\n\nMany of you know that the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. Our main tool to fulfill that mandate is adjusting interest rates to speed up or slow down the economy. In making such decisions, we examine a wide variety of data. However, data alone do not paint a full picture of our economy.\n\nSince becoming Chicago Fed president in January, I have traveled to the different states in the Bank’s District to listen, learn, and build a better understanding of the region’s economic successes—and challenges. One of my first trips came in February 2023, when I visited Ivy Tech Community College in northern Indiana.\n\nThe message I delivered that day—one that remains a constant for me—is the importance of listening to what we call the “real economy,” that is, talking to people across our District from all walks of life about how they are experiencing the economy.1 I could not do my job without this essential—and unfiltered—real-time, real-life data.\n\nWe are doing that here today through Fed Listens: seeking to hear how monetary policy affects people’s daily lives and livelihoods.\n\nThe last time we gathered in person at the Chicago Fed for a Fed Listens event was in October of 2019.2\n\nIn October 2019, like today, many indicators for the economy as a whole were relatively healthy. Notably, the unemployment rate is nearly the same: This past July the reading was 3.5%, while in October 2019, it was 3.6%. However, in October 2019, we worried that inflation was too low! And, of course, we knew nothing of pandemics.\n\nStill, even in a strong labor market overall, many challenges remain. Our conversation back in 2019 focused on disadvantaged workers’ experiences in the labor market and the difficulties in building wealth in communities where most people have low and moderate incomes. These are still relevant topics today.\n\nIn March 2022, we gathered for another Fed Listens session—this time virtually—to talk about a topic similar to today’s: the impact of the pandemic on our young people as they experienced a challenging, frequently disrupted education.3\n\nToday’s conversation sharpens the focus on that critical group of 16- to 24-year-olds. This is the age when so many of our young people are leaving school and home—or thinking about leaving school and home—and beginning their lives as independent, working adults.\n\nHowever, as we who are parents know, the pandemic changed those plans for many, and we are still assessing its impact and figuring out what to do about it. Our experts here today will provide insight into where we stand currently and shed light on the pathways forward.\n\nI thank you for your time and attention.\n\nAnd now, it gives me great pleasure to introduce someone who, as I mentioned, is a driving force behind Fed Listens. Governor Michelle Bowman has served as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System since 2018. Before joining the Board in Washington, she served as the state bank commissioner of Kansas—and prior to that as vice president of Farmers & Drovers Bank in Kansas. Since joining the Fed, I have learned a great deal from Governor Bowman and am grateful for her deep commitment to Fed Listens. I am so pleased to welcome her again to Chicago, and I invite her to say a few words before the conversation starts. Governor Bowman.\n\n1 Goolsbee (2023).\n\n2 Details for this event are available online.\n\n3 Details for this event are available online.\n\nGoolsbee, Austan D., 2023, “The need for a ground-level view of the economy?,” speech, Ivy Tech Community College, Elkhart County Campus, Goshen, IN, February 28, available online.",

Chris is on the board of directors of the Chicago Fed and a mainstay of the community here in the region.\n\nNow, I know perfectly well that some of you are only here because your instructor told you to come. I used to hate stuff like that when I was a student, so I will try not to overstay my welcome. I am going to tell you about who we are and why I came here to Northeast Indiana for my very first speech as president of the Chicago Fed.\n\nLet me get the required part out up front: These are my own views and not necessarily those of others on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIf you came here wondering about the Fed’s role, you aren’t alone. In recent polling, a big majority of Americans say they have heard of the Fed, but they don’t know what it does.1 But that hasn’t stopped folks from judging how we are doing. A recent Gallup poll says that only 37 percent think the Fed is doing a good job—just 3 points better than the IRS.2\n\nSince I’ve become president, lots of folks have told me why: Some people are upset about inflation outstripping their wages, some about all the disruptions caused by the pandemic and the supply shortages making it harder for businesses to grow, others about the risk of unemployment creeping up and the danger that the economy might be headed for a recession. Even if they don’t know what, exactly, the Fed does, they know that they want it to fix things that feel broken.\n\nSo, let’s start with what we do. The Chicago Fed serves the Seventh District. It is your local branch of the Federal Reserve System. Geographically, our District covers the heart of the Midwest—all of Iowa and most of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan.3 Some people in Northeast Indiana don’t appreciate being lumped together with Michigan; imagine how I felt as a Bears fan when they told me the District includes the Green Bay Packers.\n\nThe Fed regulates banks in the District. And we serve, basically, as the bank for banks. We wire money. We do direct deposits of your paycheck. If one of our banks needs new bills to restock their ATMs, they get them from us. Our vault has billions of dollars of cash in it. That doesn’t look as cool as you would think, though. I thought it would be stacks and stacks of money piled up to the ceiling. Actually, the money is bound in small bundles wrapped in plastic baggies and sitting on pushcarts. It almost looks like a high school storage room or something. Still, if you look at a dollar bill in your wallet and it has a letter “G” displayed in the circle, it’s from us—the Seventh District.\n\nWe also work on community development and ways to foster economic growth that benefit everyone and ensure a safe and inclusive financial system. We are responsible for enforcing consumer protection laws and the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) to make sure financial institutions work fairly in their communities.4 In addition, we work with local partners to promote economic growth in low- and moderate-income communities.\n\nBut the Fed is most well-known for monetary policy—basically for setting some of the fundamental interest rates in the economy to meet the specific goals for us that are specified by law. The Federal Reserve Act requires the Fed to use its monetary policy tools to promote maximum employment and stable prices.5 This is called our “dual mandate”—to keep both unemployment and inflation low.\n\nIf the economy overheats, higher rates can cool it off. If we are in a recession, lower rates can heat it up. Generally, there isn’t any tension between what we need to do to reach our two objectives. However, sometimes they can conflict with each other. Then the job gets a lot tougher, and we have to think about trade-offs.\n\nOf course, it’s always hard to figure out what’s happening in the economy from the avalanche of data coming in. One of the toughest things about monetary policy is figuring out what to pay attention to. And that is the main reason I am here in Northeast Indiana.\n\nYou see, most of our economic data come out with a delay—the jobs numbers, the inflation numbers, gross domestic product (GDP)—they all come out a week, a month, a quarter after they happen. Sometimes these data bounce around a lot or give contradictory signals. It can be hard to get a clear picture of what is going on. So, it’s important to supplement these traditional data with observations on the ground from the real economy. This is especially true when things are as strange and up in the air as they have been through much of the pandemic times.\n\nThe temptation can be to look at what’s easy to find and lean more on that—stock market, bond market, and other financial data that give instant reactions to news about the economy and our policy announcements and tell us which way the markets want the Fed to move. But it is a danger and a mistake for policymakers to rely too heavily on market reactions.\n\nThe thing is, our job is ultimately judged by what happens in the real economy. We need to know how things are going in places like here in Elkhart County. We come here to find out the latest information: How is the job market? The unemployment rate around here has literally been as low as 1.4 percent, but how much has it been rising as the demand for RVs post-pandemic has cooled off? Are supply chain pressures easing for the transmissions plants in Kokomo or for the medical device makers in Warsaw? Are wages for middle-class workers keeping up with inflation?\n\nWe need this kind of information about the real economy. It’s why we do a lot of outreach. Each month we survey about 120 business and community leaders throughout the District—many from right around here; we host scores of industrial and community roundtables and conferences each year.\n\nThe best central bankers are ones we call “data dependent.” They decide what to do based on the conditions they see in the economy. They don’t start with an ideology. They start from facts. I came here to learn everything I can from you and to hear about how the economy is doing. This is information we need to watch when we make decisions about policy.\n\nMonetary policy can’t solve every economic problem. But when the Fed does its job well, it provides a stable environment that makes it easier for you to succeed and helps millions of people achieve their goals.\n\nNo doubt there will be bumps in the road to come. It’s a strange and unprecedented moment coming out of the pandemic. Lots of things in the economy got turned on their heads, and we need to figure out where they will land and what that means for the future. But we will figure it out. Here in the Midwest, we know how to get the job done no matter what the conditions. We know there is no bad weather, only bad clothing.\n\nSo thank you for everything you do for this region and this nation, and thank you for teaching me about what’s going on here in Northeast Indiana.\n\nDr. Robinson-Cooper, if they sat through that, they really deserve full extra credit.\n\n1 Diamond and Sawyer (2022).\n\n2 Jones (2022).\n\n3 Further details on the Seventh Federal Reserve District are available online.\n\n4 Details on the Community Reinvestment Act are available online.\n\n5 Congress amended the Federal Reserve Act (FRA) in 1977 to provide greater clarity about the goals of monetary policy.

            "content": "A speech presented by Austan D. Goolsbee, president and chief executive officer, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, on April 11, 2023, at the Economic Club of Chicago Forum Luncheon, in Chicago, IL.\n\nThank you, David, for your kind introduction. I’m happy to be back with you.\n\nSeems like some things never change. Chicago’s ten days of spring have begun. The Economic Club of Chicago is meeting to discuss the issues of the day. The Cubs and Sox both had their home openers, and if the playoffs started today, they would both already be eliminated.\n\nSome things are new, though. I became president of the Chicago Fed in January. It’s been quite an experience. In this short time on the job, I’ve already voted to increase the federal funds rate two times. My predecessor, Charlie Evans, it took him more than eight years to do that!\n\nOf course, the environment is much different now than it was back then. That’s why the first thing I’ve been doing as Chicago Fed president is traveling around our District to hear directly from people and businesses and community organizations about the economy. Our District covers the heart of the Midwest—all of Iowa and most of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin1—and I’ve heard from a lot of people in these places. Turns out, folks have some pretty strong opinions about the Fed these days.\n\nSpeaking of opinions, this is the point where I officially need to say that the views I am expressing are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe law assigns the Fed two monetary policy goals: maximum employment and stable prices. When inflation gets too high, as it has been lately, the Fed fights it with the main tool it has—cooling the economy through tighter financial conditions. That’s why the Fed has increased the federal funds rate so aggressively—almost 5 full percentage points over the past year.\n\nIt takes time for policy moves to work their way through the economy, and it’s hard to know how long that might take and how much is enough. So that’s why we say that central banks need to be “data dependent”—to watch how things go and adjust policy accordingly.\n\nWell, the data in late 2022 and early 2023 were surprisingly strong. Spending held up; job growth was remarkable. Inflation did not come down enough. Based on these data alone, you would think the Fed would be pushing more aggressive policy moves than we were a few months ago.\n\nBut if you look at the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) made by the Federal Reserve Governors and Reserve Bank presidents in mid-March,2 the expectations of where rates are headed for the rest of this year moved only slightly from the previous projections made in December,3 and many private sector estimates have them going down.\n\nOf course, that’s because these latest projections include an early assessment of the new big hairy elephant in the room—the fact that two significant banks failed in a high-tech version of an old-fashioned bank run and triggered broader financial market turmoil. To restore calm, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Treasury, and the Fed stepped in to guarantee all deposits at these banks, not just those below the FDIC cap, and also created a new lending facility and enhanced the existing discount window—all to help prevent further runs on the system.4\n\nToday, I want to explain why I think that at moments like this, of financial stress, the right monetary approach calls for prudence and patience—for assessing the potential impact of financial stress on the real economy.\n\nI don’t say that because I believe we should stop prioritizing the fight against inflation if markets get upset. That’s a perspective I call “financial dominance”—that financial issues should dominate monetary policy concerns. Some people believe that should drive Fed actions. I absolutely do not. Congress gave us a job: maximize employment and stabilize prices. They didn’t say to always keep financial markets happy or make sure investors don’t lose any money.\n\nThe reason to include financial conditions in our monetary policy discussion is that history has taught us that moments of financial stress, even if they don’t escalate into crises, can mean tighter credit conditions. These can have a material impact on the real economy in a way that the Fed absolutely needs to take into account when setting policy.\n\nNow, in today’s environment, there is no conflict between our current monetary policy and these tighter credit conditions, especially if they are part of strengthening the financial system; they can work in tandem to help cool inflation. But we also have to recognize that this combination could hit some sectors or regions in a way that looks different than if monetary policy was acting on its own.\n\nIf you are old enough to remember 2008—a few of you in this room look like you may be—or if you are a student of financial history, you know that when stress turns into a full-blown financial crisis, the entire economy—workers, businesses, and consumers—all suffer immense harm. So, in crises, central bankers and other policymakers act quickly to provide substantial support to the economy. Sidenote: Moments of financial stress are a particularly bad time to take actions that could ignite a financial crisis on their own like, say, defaulting on U.S. Treasuries in a fight over the debt limit.\n\nBut even financial stress that doesn’t spiral into a crisis can still lead to a pullback in credit and have a material impact on the real economy. The research is full of studies showing this across countries and across time. In U.S. history, think of the fallout from the savings and loan restructuring in the 1980s and 1990s. It didn’t spiral into a systemic crisis, but it made the 1990–91 recession worse and significantly slowed gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the subsequent recovery.\n\nNow, these historical episodes may not be perfectly analogous to what’s happening today. First of all, the banking situation and related market turmoil have quieted over the past couple of weeks. Second, our financial system today is less reliant on bank credit than most other countries are or than the U.S. itself was 30 years ago.\n\nStill, we need to be on watch for the real possibility of tighter credit conditions. Notably, banks could pull back on lending in order to protect their balance sheets. Indeed, the Fed’s Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey seemed to indicate tightening lending standards even before the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failures.5\n\nIf they develop, the Fed would need to account for these potential headwinds when setting monetary policy. In some ways, it’s almost mechanical; we’ve been tightening financial conditions to bring inflation down, so if the response to recent banking problems leads to financial tightening, monetary policy has to do less.\n\nIt’s not clear by how much less, but private sector analysts have speculated that it might amount to raising the funds rate by something in the range of 25 to 75 basis points. We need to get a handle on the size of the financial headwinds, and that’s why we need to monitor a wide variety of financial indicators. This is just today’s funkier version of the old “data dependence” moniker.\n\nOut here in the Reserve Banks, we’ll also talk to a lot of people. Hearing what households, businesses, and community groups are experiencing can reveal things that haven’t yet shown up in the formal data, which get released with some significant lags.\n\nGiven how uncertainty abounds about where these financial headwinds are going, I think we need to be cautious. We should gather further data and be careful about raising rates too aggressively until we see how much work the headwinds are doing for us in getting down inflation.\n\nThere is a branch of the financial dominance school of thought that takes the argument even further. They argue that if there’s a chance of significant financial stress, we should preemptively cut rates to reduce the odds of it.\n\nI think we should be careful with that logic, though, given our trouble getting inflation down in recent years—not to mention the dangers of setting a precedent for giving in any time the market throws a tantrum. The principal defense for avoiding or mitigating financial stress should be supervisory and regulatory tools that are aimed at ensuring the safety and soundness of both individual institutions and the financial system more broadly. These tools include capital and liquidity requirements, stress testing, and our supervision process that examines institutions’ portfolios and risk management practices. Pressing on these dimensions to strengthen the financial system can help it weather stress events like these recent bank failures.\n\nAnd it’s worth noting that our situation today is significantly better because of the reforms put in place after the Great Financial Crisis—particularly the higher capital and liquidity buffers required of our largest financial institutions.\n\nIt is also worth noting a couple of ways that the impact of credit conditions and monetary policy today may look different from normal.\n\nFirst, the economy is still coming back from the bizarre Covid times. Initially, people spent more time at home, and we saw a huge surge in demand for Pelotons and durable goods and a plunge in demand for services like travel or going to the dentist. More recently, consumption is shifting back toward such services, and that has been reflected in the inflation data, with goods inflation coming way down but services inflation—especially for categories where spending is very discretionary like travel, hotels, restaurants, and recreation—proving particularly persistent. With the service sector generally being less interest rate sensitive, it might take longer to reduce inflation here, though it will moderate as tighter financial conditions take the heat off of the economy in general.\n\nSecond, today we do not face a common problem found in many earlier times of financial stress: Our financial stability goals and our monetary policy goals do not conflict.\n\nOften, moments of financial stress happen when the macroeconomy is struggling. The kinds of actions that financial institutions need to take—or that the Fed or other regulators require them to take—like tightening lending standards or conserving and raising capital may strengthen the banking sector, but also reduce the availability of credit when the economy cannot afford to get slowed down.\n\nAt present, we do not face this dilemma. Actions that strengthen the banking sector’s financial position and reduce the likelihood of additional financial problems currently make the job of monetary policy easier—they tighten credit and help bring inflation down.\n\nThis brings me to the last point I want to make today. The impact of credit conditions and monetary policy now may look a bit different than during historical tightening cycles.\n\nMuch of the recent financial turmoil has seemed to be concentrated in the regional bank sector. If a potential credit crunch were concentrated there, it would mean that sectors and areas that are particularly exposed to these institutions would feel the impact of tighter conditions more acutely. These institutions are a particularly important source of credit card and midsize business funding, as well as lenders for commercial real estate and autos. Different parts of the country are more reliant than others on these regional banks as well.\n\nAt the end of the day, the best central bankers are data dependent and the Fed’s job is to be more paranoid than anyone else. In lucky times we might not need to follow too many data series to decide where inflation, unemployment, and GDP are headed. In unluckier, more interesting times like the one we are in right now, with wild shocks including a pandemic and wars and cryptocurrencies and financial stress, it means digging into loads of new information to glean where the economy is headed in order to set appropriate monetary policy.\n\nThe Fed must use everything in its toolkit to maximize employment and stabilize prices. Sure, it’s harder in an unpredictable world full of pandemics and digital currencies and social-media-fueled bank runs. But we will do it. We’re from Chicago. We get the job done no matter what the conditions. There is no bad weather, only bad clothing. So remember: Financial stresses come and go. The Fed’s mandate is forever.\n\n1 Further details on the Seventh Federal Reserve District, which is served by the Chicago Fed, are available online.\n\n2 Federal Open Market Committee (2023).

            "content": "Austan D. Goolsbee, president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, delivered a speech at the Chicago Payments Symposium on October 4, 2023.\n\nWelcome. I‘m Austan Goolsbee, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and it’s my privilege to kick off the Chicago Payments Symposium. Now in its 23rd year, the Symposium is a testament to the Chicago Fed’s long-standing commitment to collaboration with the industry on payments. It’s great to see all of you here in Chicago and online.\n\nBefore I start, I would like to personally thank Ellen Bromagen for her leadership both here at the Chicago Fed and in payments across the Federal Reserve System and for her work with Shonda Clay in putting this conference together. I would also like to thank colleagues from across the Fed System here with us today: Loretta Mester, Mark Gould, Kathy Paese, and Ken Montgomery. Thank you for your leadership and partnership.\n\nI want to also acknowledge the many leaders from the payments industry who are here today. We are grateful for your collective work managing the payments system and for your longstanding collaboration with the Fed. Some of you have traveled a long way, and we appreciate you making the effort to be here.\n\nIt’s my first time so let me give a brief line about why I am here. I am an economist. In the Great Financial Crisis, I was the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and chief economist for the Economic Recovery Advisory Board and its head Paul Volcker. I have said ever since that everyone that lived through that time has a lifetime interest in the plumbing behind the financial system.\n\nBut before the financial crisis and then after—for 28 years—I was a professor at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, where one of my main areas of research was the economics of innovation and of the Internet. For many years I taught the class on platform strategy.\n\nSo combining a love of payments with an interest in networks and platforms brought me right here: to the Payments Symposium. And looking through the themes of this year’s speakers, I’m struck by how several of the key themes facing payments today overlap with things from platform economics, whether online business in the twenty-first century, telecom in the twentieth, or even railroads in the nineteenth.\n\nThe starting point for platform business is that the size of the network has value to everyone because people connect to each other. The value of the network rises for each participant the more people add to it. And it makes it extra important that people work together to unlock the potential of the network as a whole.\n\nYou can probably already see where I’m going here with payments. But let me make two and a half points in the spirit of what-to-expect-when-platform-economics-meets-the-payments-symposium that come from the need for us to work together.\n\nBigger networks are useful. But building a big network is expensive. Users have connection costs and network infrastructure is generally a huge investment. Because uncoordinated investment is risky in this way, it’s usually easier to build smaller networks that are faster and cheaper and reach fewer participants.\n\nBut fragmented investments where different users end up with different standards can prevent the system from ever reaching its full potential value.\n\nWide accessibility of payments networks is one of the Fed’s explicit policy goals, as recognized by the Monetary Control Act, which requires that the Fed take into account the provision of an adequate level of service nationwide. The propensity for individual actors to start with the highest margin, lowest cost, easiest-to-service customers makes it especially important for there to be a broader push for ubiquity. The Fed has often played a key role as a force for expansion while collaborating with the financial and technology private sectors to make something ubiquitous and better than it would be segmented.\n\nFor example, some of you may remember working together 20 years ago to implement widespread use of check imaging technology after the passage of the Check 21 Act. Or the efforts for ACH payments to take off in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.\n\nOr even farther back, the introduction of magnetic ink technology for checks.\n\nIn the 1950s, the Fed and the banking industry considered other options to automate check processing, like bar codes or punch cards, but magnetic ink had some clear advantages. It was still readable by the human eye and also still readable by a machine, even if someone wrote over it or spilled a cup of coffee on it. To make it work, everyone had to agree on a standard way to place magnetic characters on checks for machines to read. The Fed and the American Bankers Association jointly campaigned for adopting the technology, emphasizing the benefits for the banking system as a whole, and the responsibilities of individual banks over and above their own cost-benefit calculations.1\n\nBottom line, without extensive cooperation and collaboration, this history might have unfolded very differently. Our predecessors knew that building out a large network was key. They couldn’t just rely on individual companies to do it themselves.\n\nBut history also shows us that it’s hard work getting a network all the way to ubiquity, even with a lot of collaboration. The rollout of ACH in the 1970s took a lot of time. We had to overcome inertia but also improve technology. ACH initially relied primarily on magnetic tapes. Each tape could hold information equivalent to 1.5 million checks, but they still needed to be physically couriered to and from banks. Even as some banks moved to electronic communication of ACH payments, others continued to rely on tapes or the next new thing, floppy disks. Because ACH processing schedules needed to accommodate the slowest endpoints, even small numbers of nonelectronic users slowed the network. ACH operators began to mandate all-electronic communications in the late 1980s and early 1990s and worked together with financial institutions extensively to get them ready.\n\nIf there had not been cooperation, many of these now ubiquitous systems would probably never have caught on. Or, at the least, would not have reached the levels of convenience and quality that they enjoy today.\n\nDeveloping a vibrant instant payments regime in the U.S. will require heavy investments in the ubiquity of the network done by all of us working together.\n\nWe would be remiss at an international symposium like this not to highlight the similar set of challenges and opportunities facing the international payments system.\n\nThe global payments sector is also highly fragmented and with multiple overlapping layers, including links between correspondent banks; messaging systems such as Swift; money transfer businesses and credit card networks; as well as foreign exchange markets, and arrangements between central banks.2 Each of these entities answers to its own authority, and the reputations and security practices of network participants vary widely. There is also the well-established challenge of aligning the standards of various sovereign payments systems—a task made all the harder if conflicts like the one in Ukraine lead to what the IMF has called “economic blocs” that restrict cross-border flows.\n\nAnd the global payments system is expensive. According to the World Bank, the average cross-border payment carries a 6.3% fee. We know that smaller volume senders tend to pay higher fees—which means the 6.3% data point probably understates the actual fees paid by many households and small businesses when they send money across borders.\n\nThe same idea of how expanding the network will raise the value of the system for everyone suggests there is an important role for collaboration across countries, too. It will be more challenging in many of the participating countries because there is no mandating authority. The lessons we are learning about encouraging voluntary adoption in the United States may be helpful in the global context, too.\n\nOne of the biggest potential barriers to the ubiquitous adoption of any network is security. For instant payments, it is absolutely critical for all of us—the Fed, industry, everyone with a seat at the table—to get security right from the start or lapses will otherwise undermine the network’s growth and reach. That’s the thing about network externality businesses—getting users begets more users, but losing users snowballs on itself, too. Early negative experiences can set back adoption for a long time.\n\nA key lesson from network economics is the ever-present conflict of incentives between an individual participant—who is understandably focused on their own wellbeing, and in fact isn’t powerful enough to protect the network on their own—and the needs of the broader group, which inherently relies on collective action to solve for security. In effect, networks must always be considering the same two questions:\n\nA timely example that illustrates this issue is fraud, a hot topic across the entire payments ecosystem, not just instant payments. Like with ubiquity, the best answers we have to fraud come from cross-industry collaboration. The trick is aligning incentives so that participants can work together as network participants, even as they compete against one another in the economy every day. For the wellbeing of the network, both of these postures—collaborator and competitor—can and must exist simultaneously.\n\nIn the case of fraud, some of these learnings are baked into the design of FedNow. For example, network participants—banks, credit unions, and payments companies—are obligated through network rules to report fraud that takes place on FedNow. The mandatory reporting not only helps remove stigma associated with self-reporting problems, but also helps the Fed and the industry better monitor and address warning signs.\n\nWe also know that some of the most valuable collective work is collegial and cultural, such as work groups of network participants that share candid information and fraud mitigation strategies.\n\nIn a sense, fraud and security are always individual events, because they have specific victims and costs. But the broader reality is that fraud—just like any other network security risk—is a collective issue that relies on collective efforts and collaboration to maintain safety and security.\n\nI know collaboration has been a key theme of this conference for more than two decades, and will no doubt be a key ingredient of this gathering for years to come.\n\nIt is an exciting moment in the history of the financial system, and we don’t know how things will end up.\n\nIt feels like the long history of other platforms in the economy has taught us that balancing cooperation and innovation to help the entire system achieve its full potential will remain front and center, and I can’t wait to see what you all come up with.\n\nThanks for being here.

The event was designed for Black high school and college students to hear from leaders in economics and related fields about their work and career journeys.\n\nGood morning. I’m Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. It is my pleasure to welcome you to the fourth annual Exploring Career Pathways conference.\n\nLet me start by extending my deep thanks to our friends and colleagues at the Sadie Collective for pioneering this event and partnering with us to create a fantastic program.\n\nWe are very excited that for the first time since we launched our partnership with the Sadie Collective, this event is fully in-person. We hope that being together like this will allow you to meet new people and draw fresh inspiration as you contemplate your\nfutures. And if you were at the networking breakfast this morning, you may have already started making connections.\n\nThe Chicago Fed is proud to cosponsor today’s event. It represents a truly collaborative effort intended to provide opportunities to—as the conference title says—explore career pathways in economics and related professions. We support diversity in economics and want to see you thrive in these important fields.\n\nThis conference has quickly become the cornerstone of the Chicago Fed–Sadie Collective partnership. The Chicago Fed has also recruited Sadie Collective Fellows into our summer internship program for the past three years, and we plan to continue this practice. So, if you’re a college junior, please consider applying soon to join us next summer.\n \nIf you are interested in the internship process, I recommend that you connect with Dawn Cox or Thomas Klier from our team. And not incidentally, I want to thank Dawn and Thomas for doing such a good job coordinating our internship and research assistant programs and helping to manage the Sadie Collective partnership.\n\nThe Chicago Fed is dedicated to this work because diversity, equity, and inclusion is\nvital not just for our Bank, but also for the broader field of economics. For too long, many extremely talented women, people of color, and first-generation students have been discouraged from choosing the field.\n\nBy committing to the recruitment, mentoring, and development of future economists from diverse backgrounds, we can create a better community within the Federal Reserve, contribute to the economics profession overall, and also raise our level of excellence.\n\nOur longstanding emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion ensures that these principles are embedded throughout our organization. We recognized early on that we do a better job of delivering on all aspects of the Federal Reserve’s mission when our work reflects a diversity of backgrounds and experiences and when we reflect the District we represent.\n\nWe also work with 16 external partners and community groups, including the Sadie Collective, that support our efforts to broaden our talent pipelines. These partners help us  build and sustain an equitable, inclusive workplace.\n\nThat brings me back to today’s conference program. You’ll hear about career experiences from both PhD economists and early-career research assistants. You’ll also be able to learn about the tools of economics research. We’re especially excited to hear from Nicole Elam, president and CEO of the National Bankers Association. Our own Anna Paulson,\nexecutive vice president and director of research, will host a fireside chat with Nicole after\nlunch.\n \nLet me now turn things over to Misha Williams, partnership and grants manager at the Sadie Collective, who will be delivering additional welcome remarks.",

            "content": "Austan D. Goolsbee, president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, delivered a policy speech and participated in a moderated Q&A at the Peterson Institute for International Economics on September 28, 2023.\n\nWhen I finished school many years ago, I headed to Chicago. My grandfather called me with advice. Grandpa Jack lived on a ranch outside Abilene, Texas, had served in World War II, and was one of those Greatest Generation wise men. He told me, “This is your first job, and you’ll need to save money. So let me tell you something very important: Never. Buy. Stocks.”\n\nI paused, was Grandpa Jack an efficient markets guy? I asked, “No individual stocks?”\n\n“No,” he said, “don’t buy any stocks. Your grandmother and I had friends who bought stocks. They lost everything when the market crashed.”\n\nHe was talking about the Great Depression. This one historical event scarred his thinking for 65-plus years and, evidently, led him to miss out on a few thousand percent cumulative return.\n\nGrandpa Jack’s life experience made him a font of wisdom about many things—and his background in meteorology during World War II meant he could give a stunningly accurate forecast just by looking at the clouds—but, clearly, in personal finance not every historical lesson is helpful for every moment. Today, I will argue the same may be true for monetary policy.\n\nHistory has taught us that bringing down high inflation without causing a major recession is an extraordinarily rare and difficult task. Indeed, there is what I will call a “traditionalist view” that says the substantial resource slack generated by a deep recession is necessary to reduce strong inflationary pressures—and that delaying taking this bitter medicine risks unhinging inflation expectations, making the job even more difficult. The U.S. inflation experience in the 1970s and ’80s is the one most etched in our minds, but other economies around the world have similar stories to tell.\n\nThis traditionalist view tempts us into looking at current growth and labor market conditions as the primary predictors of whether inflation is returning to target. This morning I will argue that this view misses key features of our recent inflationary experience and that, in today’s environment, believing too strongly in the inevitability of a large trade-off between inflation and unemployment comes with the serious risk of a near-term policy error.\n\nBefore continuing, let me bring some relief to my colleagues by giving the usual disclaimer: The views I am expressing are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAs I noted, bringing inflation down several percentage points in a reasonable period of time without suffering a severe recession and painfully high unemployment is historically quite rare. Many commentators have that historical perspective in mind when arguing that returning U.S. inflation to the Fed’s 2 percent target will be painful.\n\nThis perspective is also a statistical feature of many econometric models in the long-established literature identifying the effects of monetary policy shocks. Their results generally are consistent with a flat Phillips curve, so that a steep decline in activity is necessary to bring inflation down a lot. The research staff at the Chicago Fed recently updated a version of this analysis based on the work of Romer and Romer (2004) and using data going back to the 1960s.1\n\nThe chart shows the changes in the log levels of gross domestic product (GDP) and employment and the core PCE inflation rate2 that we would expect to see based on estimated historical relationships and Fed policy moves to date. Recall that when the Fed first increased rates in March of last year, core PCE inflation was nearly 5-1/2 percent. The historically based dynamics show inflation would not be expected to start moving down until sometime next year and it would come with a large recession and the recession would have already started prior to inflation moderating.\n\nThe red lines here show our actual experience so far. Notice how the real data have not followed the historical patterns at all. There are three points I want to make. First, GDP fell more quickly than the typical policy tightening effect. While the level at this moment is close to its average response, the typical pattern has further steep declines coming. Second, employment has been much stronger than expected, so it would need to weaken a lot to follow the typical relationship. Third, inflation fell much sooner than the historical average. And if past correlations were to hold, most of the reduction in inflation from monetary policy actions to date is still to come, and it would be large.\n\nThis traditional approach leaves us with a puzzle. Core inflation began moving down in 2023—not mid-2024. And it did so while the job market was still strong—not after it had already weakened substantially. For the traditionalist, the answer is that it must be noise: Just wait; the real economy will get much worse.\n\nIt’s possible. But another answer is that something very different is going on: Either nonmonetary shocks are heavily influencing the economy or the nature of the monetary policy environment we are working in today is different. I believe both of these factors are at play. If so, we need to be extra careful about indexing policy to this traditional view of what the incoming data on output and the labor market mean for the inflation outlook.\n\nLet’s start with the sources of inflation. Recall that inflation began to soar in 2021 even as the unemployment rate exceeded 6 percent and GDP was well below previous estimates of potential output. Such elevated slack should have lowered inflation, not raised it. Also, inflation surged all over the world, including in places with different fiscal responses, also suggesting something else was at work.3\n\nIn my view, the most important factors were Covid-related. There were well documented negative supply chain shocks and unusual shifts in the composition of demand. Adding to supply side difficulties, Covid reduced labor supply as labor force participation—especially for women and those nearing retirement—dropped and immigration collapsed.\n\nThere are analysts who don’t agree with the predominantly-supply-shocks view of inflation. They observe that supply chain disruptions and severe labor dislocations typically impact isolated sectors and, therefore, show up as a few relative price changes rather than a widespread increase in prices across the board.\n\nIt’s worth reexamining the evidence on our actual experience, though. I think a lot of the evidence points to the supply disruption channel. Chad Syverson’s (2023) contribution to this year’s Jackson Hole conference showed substantial differences in inflation across a wide range of industries, with the biggest price increases associated with the smallest increases in quantity, fully consistent with the role of supply shocks as an important driver of overall inflation.\n\nResearch with a more macroeconomic focus also finds a large role for supply shocks, such as recent papers by Bernanke and Blanchard (2023) and Liu and Nguyen (2023). Our Chicago Fed dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model ascribes a large portion of the run-up in inflation to supply shocks as well.4\n\nFortunately, the negative supply shocks and demand distortions have been unwinding steadily, which have been important factors in bringing inflation down over the past year or so. Most metrics indicate that supply chains have improved considerably—also corroborated by our business contacts—and that improvement is likely to continue working its way through the economy.\n\nWe have also seen increases in labor supply. The prime-age labor force participation rate is at its highest level since 2001. Perhaps because of more flexible post-Covid work arrangements, the female labor force participation rate is hitting record highs, as is the participation rate for those with disabilities. Immigration has recovered as well.\n\nHolding to the simple historical correlations of what growth and labor market conditions mean for inflation in the face of positive supply developments is a recipe for overshooting and causing an unnecessary downturn. Tying monetary policy too closely to contemporary output and labor market readings today risks giving a decidedly wrong answer.\n\nThe second reason I think the traditionalist perspective on the current underlying economic environment may miss the mark is the role of central bank credibility in keeping inflation expectations anchored now versus in past periods of high inflation.\n\nRegardless of what causes inflation, if high inflation rates get rolled into expectations of future inflation, it makes the job of reducing inflation that much harder. This is what happened in the 1970s: As inflationary psychology took hold, breaking it became extremely costly. It took much more aggressive tightening because inflation expectations had ratcheted up over time.\n\nIf economic agents make wage and price setting decisions that are consistent with their expectations, then inflation expectations become a strong attractor for actual inflation itself. Long-run inflation expectations that are anchored at our inflation target become an important force returning inflation to target with less economic pain than was needed in the past.\n\nAnd as can be seen by these graphs, today long-run inflation expectations indeed appear to be well anchored. There are different ways to measure inflation expectations. The top panel shows a survey-based measure, and the bottom panel is a market-based measure. Both tell a similar story: Longer-run inflation expectations, shown in red, have not moved much during this entire inflationary episode.\n\nThe idea that anchored inflation expectations can pull down inflation without as much economic damage as has happened in the past (when expectations lost their anchor) is another important reason to downweight the traditionalist view right now. Of course, this anchoring didn’t come out of thin air; it hinges on a belief in the inflation-fighting credibility of the Fed. In turn, appropriate monetary policy actions and communications aimed at hitting our inflation target reinforce credibility, anchor inflation expectations, and support the effectiveness of monetary policy.\n\nThere is a lot of research studying this channel. One example is a model developed by two Chicago Fed economists, Stefania D’Amico and Tom King.5 Standard models—such as vector autoregressions (VARs) that capture the traditionalist view I talked about earlier—generally have no independent role for forward-looking behavior. They only pick up whatever is captured by the average dynamics estimated in the model.\n\nStefania and Tom’s model explicitly accounts for measures of private sector expectations of activity, inflation, and interest rates, allowing them to identify shocks to both the current policy rate and the expected path going forward. The model estimates that throughout this tightening cycle the public has formed expectations for tighter policy well in advance of actual changes in the policy rate.\n\nThis results in more front-loaded effects on output and inflation than traditional analyses show, and although the confidence intervals are large, the forecasts from the model shown here have inflation reaching target soon, with only a modest slowing in GDP growth—what I have called the “golden path.” And these outcomes are achieved without further policy tightening.\n\nNow, some people don’t like the specific assumptions of any particular model. So fine. Forget the models. If you think expectations matter, just go look at them. Today, market participants largely expect the Fed to raise rates only a bit more and then hold them there for a while. And their economic forecasts generally see inflation getting down to target without a major recession, pretty much in line with the “golden path.” And as long as they expect that, it makes the outcome easier to achieve.\n\nOn a side note, the importance of inflation expectations and Fed credibility is why I think recent proposals to change the inflation target to something higher are quite risky. To do so now would undermine the power of expectations to bring actual inflation down. No matter what level the target, no matter what measure of inflation, the whole benefit of announcing a target comes from people expecting that you will do what it takes to achieve it. Raising the target when inflation is above the target would undermine the credibility of the Fed’s commitment to any inflation target and impairs the very mechanism of how it is supposed to help. It’s a recipe for ratcheting up inflation expectations just like we saw in the old days.\n\nThe unwinding of supply shocks, the composition of demand returning to more stable patterns, and Fed credibility are central to why I think it might be possible today to reduce inflation while avoiding a deep recession. These factors also argue against putting too much weight on the idea that strong labor market and growth conditions will necessarily stall out the disinflationary process. Doing so risks policy overshooting and unnecessarily derailing the expansion.\n\nOf course, the golden path is not guaranteed. External shocks pose risks to the outlook. Earlier, less challenging soft landings such as in 1990 and 2001 were derailed by such shocks. Today we are faced with oil price hikes, the slowdown in China, the possibility of an expanded and prolonged auto strike, and the potential for a disruptive government shutdown. Each of these shocks could have important effects on the economy—either directly or indirectly through consumer and business confidence or through financial markets.\n\nSo, if I am arguing that at this moment real-side economic conditions are not the primary thing telling us how soon we will get to target inflation, what should an empirically minded data dog pay closest attention to over the next few quarters? I will give you my big four.\n\nOne, watch the composition of price dynamics. I and others have remarked on this before, so let me be brief. Core inflation getting back to 2 percent must come from a combination of falling inflation for goods, housing,6 and nonhousing services. Before Covid, core inflation was actually running steadily somewhat below 2 percent. Over that time goods prices were falling about 1 percent, housing prices were rising about 3 percent, and inflation for services excluding housing was close to 2.5 percent. So, scale those up a few tenths and you have an idea of where we need to be heading.\n\nLooking at recent three-month annualized changes, we already got core Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation down to 2.4 percent; we’ll update that for core PCE tomorrow, but we have made excellent progress and wouldn’t be far from target if we can sustain it. Much of that improvement came from goods inflation getting back down to about –1 percent as before Covid. Housing inflation has fallen noticeably in recent months, and more is expected given the leading data on new-tenant market rents. Nonhousing services inflation is still near 4 percent, and given the persistence of inflation here, only small and gradual improvements can be expected for this piece. All this means that over the next few quarters the key to further progress will be what happens to housing inflation. Continued progress would bode well, but there is a risk that recent increases in home prices could spill over to market rents and stall the improvement here. So, this is a critical risk to monitor.\n\nTwo, watch productivity growth. Here there has been a little good news that affects the prospects for both growth and real wages. Productivity data are notoriously noisy, but it appears as if we could be settling in at a trend rate not far from what it was pre-pandemic, instead of the lower rate we were running in 2022 and early ’23. If so, the pace of long-run nominal output or wage growth consistent with our 2 percent inflation target would not be as low as some have feared.\n\nThree, don’t obsess over the near-term path for real wages. Many have expressed concern that a tight labor market with wages rising faster than prices would result in a wage–price spiral. Some have gone further and implicitly argued that the Fed’s stopping rule should be tied to getting wage growth down to a level consistent with 2 percent inflation.\n\nWe need to be especially careful about that type of argument. Over long periods of time, wages (adjusted for productivity) and prices grow in tandem. In the shorter term, however, wages generally are stickier than prices. This tends to make unit labor costs a lagging indicator of inflation.7 This doesn’t mean that wages are unimportant. They are a major input cost to most industries. But it does mean we shouldn’t be using short-term wage growth to predict inflation; indexing our monetary policy decisions to it at a moment of transition like this would almost certainly mean overshooting.\n\nAnd four, keep your eye on inflation expectations. As I noted earlier, their role is central to our effort. Expectations currently show a benign view of the economy and the road back to stable target inflation. The fact that they do makes the job that much more achievable. But if the influence of improved supply conditions wanes too quickly or other factors impinge on the disinflationary process, rising inflationary expectations could be one of the early signals that policy needs to adjust.\n\nAt the end of the day, we will get inflation back to our target, whatever that takes. Inflation still needs to come down. But we also can’t lose sight of the fact that the Fed has the chance to achieve something quite rare in the history of central banks—to defeat inflation without tanking the economy. If we succeed, the golden path will be studied for years. If we fail, it will also be studied for years. But let’s aim to succeed.\n\nAnd like with my grandpa’s investment tips, let’s be prepared to recognize when historical lessons might not work that well for today’s environment. No, at this moment, it feels like the Fed might do better following Grandpa Jack’s West Texas ranch advice instead: “Work ’til it’s dark and pray for rain.”\n\nThank you.\n\n1 For additional information on the Chicago Fed research staff’s recent update of this analysis, please contact Mark Peters.\n\n2 The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge is the annual change in the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE).

Below are planned talking points Goolsbee prepared for the event and shared with reporters in advance.\n\nThe views expressed are his own and are not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nNearly every serious reduction in very high inflation until now has come with a deep recession, in the United States and elsewhere. Yet in 2023, inflation according to the Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) was down about 3 percentage points from a year earlier—one of the biggest drops in 50 years—with GDP growth remaining strong and the unemployment rate holding steady at well below 4 percent.\n\nAs we enter 2024, a number of considerations are influencing my thinking about the economy and monetary policy:\n\n1. Over the past seven months core PCE inflation (which strips out volatile food and energy prices) has been running at the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target or even below. Rate cuts should be tied to confidence in being on a path toward the target. I don’t support waiting until inflation on a 12-month basis has already achieved 2 percent to begin to cut rates.\n\n2. Our current policy stance is quite restrictive.\n\n3. Supply developments have been important for both inflation and output.\n\n4. Inflation expectations have remained in check—evidence of the Fed’s credibility.",

It’s important to view inflation over a longer arc. We saw sizable reductions in inflation over the past nine months that have brought us closer to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent inflation target. In 2023, we hit what I was calling the “golden path.” It was one of the largest drops in inflation on record, and it didn’t come with the usual serious recession.

Inflation had one of the largest drops in the last 50 years and did so with solid growth, low unemployment, and no recession.\n\nSo far in 2024, that progress on inflation has stalled. You never want to make too much of any one month’s data, especially inflation, which is a noisy series, but after three months of this, it can’t be dismissed.\n\nI am still hopeful that we will again see a return to improvement on inflation in the months ahead, as our restrictive monetary policy continues to curb inflation pressures and the economy continues returning to pre-pandemic norms.\n\nAt the end of the day, we will get inflation back to target. I always say that the first rule for data dogs is that when you are uncertain, keep sniffing. Right now, it makes sense to wait and get more clarity before moving.\n\nWe were at our 2 percent target before Covid, but not because inflation of everything was 2 percent.. Housing was around 3.5 percent, services 2.5 percent, and goods –1 percent. Much of the improvement in inflation last year came from positive supply developments. As the supply chains healed, goods inflation returned basically back to pre-Covid rates. Most of that supply healing is now complete.\n\nPart of the supply side benefit last year came from increases in labor supply, in part from immigration and in part from higher participation rates of many groups. The impact of that will likely continue to help the economy this year. While we saw deterioration in services inflation last month, there was surprising improvement over the course of 2023—it remains above pre-Covid trends, but there may be more space for progress.\n\nThat leaves the main short-run problem as I see it, which is persistently high housing inflation—still much higher than it was pre-pandemic. Looking at market data on rents for new leases, I’d say housing inflation is supposed to have been falling. If it doesn’t, it will be hard to see a smooth path back to our 2 percent inflation goal.\n\nAs we have seen strong gross domestic product (GDP) and jobs numbers, we need to determine if this is a sign of overheating driving up inflation. But let’s be careful: As I have said before, when there are supply side developments (for example, higher productivity growth, supply chain improvements, or increasing labor force participation or population growth), aggregate numbers are not great measures of overheating.\n\nThere are crosscurrents at work. Not all the data suggest overheating in the labor market. The ratio of job openings to unemployed workers, the voluntary quit rate, the growth rate of wages—each of these seems to be returning closer to the pre-Covid reading.\n\nGiven the strength of the labor market and progress on easing inflation seen over a longer arc, I believe the Fed’s current restrictive monetary policy is appropriate. Ultimately, the proper policy going forward will depend on the data.",

            "content": "Austan D. Goolsbee, president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, delivered a policy speech discussing ways to improve Federal Reserve communications while participating in a panel discussion at the Hoover Institution Monetary Policy Conference: Getting Global Monetary Policy On Track, at Stanford University on May 3, 2024. The speech text is below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for the invitation out to the conference. It’s a special delight for me to see John Cochrane, my old neighbor from across the street. John used to keep our emergency house key for us, and the alarm company would call him if things went wrong and we weren’t there. I’m hoping that if my talk goes sideways here, he’s still willing to be my emergency contact.\n\nAnd I should add now, to the great relief of my colleagues, that these are my own views and not those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nToday, I want to talk a bit about central bank communications, but I came to it in an odd way.\n\nWhen I started at the Chicago Fed in January ’23, it felt like we had just lived through a really crazy time in our economic history and there were so many fundamental economic issues we needed to discuss and resolve.\n\nBut then at my first appearances with the press, the questions seemed to always center on the same thing: So, how many rate hikes do you see this year?\n\nI was actually a bit dismayed. By itself, with no economic context or rationale or even what a person thinks will happen with economic conditions, the answer to “how many?” is mostly just speculation. There is not much economic content in a question like that.\n\nWhy not ask about what is actually informative about future decision-making—like reaction functions or economic worldviews or risk assessments?\n\nIn my puzzlement about why they seem so interested in context-free numbers, I have concluded that this may be a bit of our own doing in that some aspects of our current communications approach actually encourage this kind of speculation.\n\nSo today I would like to make three points: where I think Fed communications, especially in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), fails to deliver economic information that it could; how it might be improved; and the importance of participants’ public speaking and writings for communicating their reaction functions and risk-management considerations. And I will conclude with a bit of a defense of cacophony, the much-maligned bugaboo of FOMC communications.\n\nEveryone knows that communications issues have always been important for central banks and are closely tied to inflation expectations, bank credibility, and even public trust. I’m not sure I’m fully on board with Ben Bernanke’s comment that monetary policy is 98 percent talk and 2 percent action, but we all know the importance of a clear understanding of a central bank’s goals and strategies in monetary policy transmission.\n\nThe Fed and many other central banks’ approaches to communications have changed dramatically in the past 30 years with the shift to much greater transparency.\n\nOne of the leading components of that has been the Summary of Economic Projections and its “dot plot” of FOMC participants’ interest rate projections. In it, each person gives an answer (anonymously) to the “how many?” question and does so for the next several years.\n\nIt is widely followed and provides a dose of transparency about a diverse collection of views. And its influence may be spreading. Recently there have been been high-level considerations of whether the European Central Bank (ECB) should adopt a dot plot.\n\nAs a starting thought, though, it is worth noting that in the 2020 Hutchins Center survey of academic and private sector Fed watchers, only about 50 percent of respondents reported that they find the dot plot useful.1\n\nOne thing that might be pulling that number down, in my opinion, is that the SEP is not actually that useful for identifying FOMC participants’ monetary policy reaction functions. I’m defining the reaction function broadly here—how someone would react to changes in economic conditions—rather than in a technical way, like what their policy function coefficients are in a Taylor rule.\n\nI mostly agree with the old Mervyn King (2000) argument that it’s a sign of success when markets react to new data releases more than to statements of central banker opinions.2 One key to achieving that outcome is that people understand FOMC participants’ reaction functions.\n\nThe SEP isn’t that helpful in communicating them. Each participant’s rate path projection is made with a forecast of economic conditions, but the SEP does not report which goes with which. Even the median doesn’t give you a coherent observation because the person making the median rate projection is not likely to be the same person making the median inflation or gross domestic product (GDP) projection.\n\nWithout a connection of economic conditions to rate projections, the dot plot is just a collection of opinions without economic content. No wonder the press doesn’t ask about anything else. Our own major communications document implicitly tells them that the economic rationale isn’t needed. Just tell us “how many” and we’ll put them in a plot.\n\nBecause it can’t be connected to the economic conditions the participant thinks will justify that interest rate, there is nothing to tell us why they think this a reasonable choice.\n\nWe can do better. In a way, this is really a cousin to the old debate about time-dependent versus state-contingent forward guidance. State-contingent guidance is more useful because it conveys economic content and a reaction function.\n\nSaying in 2011 that the Committee doesn’t expect to raise rates for two years is not as helpful as an Evans rule that it won’t consider moving until unemployment is below 6.5 percent as long as inflation is below 2.5 percent. The time-based guidance is basically just opinion. The Evans rule clarifies what the Committee is watching and conveys information about its reaction function.\n\nNow think about the dot plot. It’s a lot like time-dependent guidance. It’s not tied to anything. We would be better off if it could be more like state-dependent guidance—more like a reaction function.\n\nSo let’s consider how the SEP could be made more useful in this way: First, I am going to echo some comments that Mickey and Charlie just made. We could go a long way by publishing the matrix. It doesn’t need to personally attribute each projection, but at least a matrix that anonymously matches the economic forecasts to the rate path for each participant would answer some important questions.\n\nFor example, suppose you observe a high dot for next year’s funds rate. You could tell in the matrix whether it was that they think the economy is overheating and they want to rein in inflation or they think faster, noninflationary growth implies a higher equilibrium rate. Today you can’t.\n\nOver time, more would be revealed about reaction functions as observed changes in the economic environment show the relationships between participants’ views on the outlook and appropriate policy.\n\nAnother, more direct form of state-contingent information might be to add something like the stress test scenarios that are done for banks or the alt sims in the Tealbook. Of course this wouldn’t be as easy to implement as publishing the matrix, but it is food for thought on how to convey reaction functions.3\n\nBut the goal is to convey information about how participants might respond to developments. It’s also helpful when their speeches and writings explain their thinking. And this idea also highlights the important piece of communications—which is conveying the implications of unusual circumstances and risk management for setting policy. In times of heightened uncertainty or unusual risks, the policy playbook can be complicated and requires more than just dots. And such times seem to happen with uncomfortably high frequency.\n\nThe Committee has communicated unusual circumstances and practiced risk-management policy for a long time. This shows up in formal voted-upon FOMC statements, policy tilts, and other communications. Examples over the past 30 years include the 1990s policy responses to the Asian Financial Crisis and the Russian default; the recognition in 2003 of the then-novel risk that inflation in the U.S. could be too low; and the heightened uncertainty in 2007–08 as the financial crisis unfolded even while some inflation risk remained. And we are all familiar with examples surrounding the Great Recession and the pandemic.\n\nIn all of these cases, communications was an important tool to get us beyond context-free “how many?” discussions and to provide the public with better state-contingent information that underlies our policy decisions.\n\nSo my plea is that we try to push our communications and especially the SEP to better convey how we respond to economic conditions. This does mean a large number of voices. Alan Blinder (2007) and others have called this the cacophony problem and would probably view it as a negative of having this much information available to the public before every meeting.\n\nI don’t agree, though. Yes, it would be easier to understand if there is just one voice talking about policy. But the FOMC is a committee with lots of views, and the policy gets forged in that environment. Without offending the Senate, in my view, in the twenty-first century the FOMC is the world’s greatest deliberative body. Having folks with different worldviews makes for better decision-making. There’s nothing wrong with the public knowing these views. It’s reality.\n\nToday we are conducting policy during a fascinating and uncertain time. How we communicate will be critical. We should endeavor to convey our deliberations and our thinking, not just our opinion. It’s why I say that “how many?” is not enough.\n\n1 Powell and Wessel (2021).\n\n2 As King (2000) stated, “A transparent monetary policy reaction function means that the news should be in developments of the economy not in the announcements of decisions by the central bank.”\n\n3 People have been thinking about these kinds of ideas from the earliest days of the SEP releases. The FOMC discussed them as alternatives when it debated and ultimately rejected producing a consensus forecast back in 2012. Among external commentators, a prominent paper by Steve Cecchetti and Kim Schoenholtz written for the public Fed Listens portion of the 2019 policy framework review explicitly called for publishing the matrix (Cecchetti and Schoenholtz, 2019).\n\nBlinder, Alan S., 2007, \"Monetary policy by committee: Why and how?,\" European Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 23, No. 1, March, pp. 106–123.

Fighting inflation was the obvious priority.\n\nBut as we’ve gained confidence that we are on the path back to 2%, it’s appropriate to increase our focus on the other side of the Fed’s mandate—to think about risks to employment, too, not just inflation. And given the through line on economic conditions, that likely means many more rate cuts over the next year.\n\nIf we want a soft landing, we can't be behind the curve. Of course, getting the timing right at moments of transition is maybe the hardest challenge a central bank faces. It’s especially hard at a moment like this where conditions are so different from previous cycles. But knowing that labor markets tend to deteriorate quickly when they turn and that monetary policy takes time to act, it’s just not realistic to wait until problems show up.\n\nI am comfortable with a starting move like this—the 50 basis point cut in the federal funds rate announced last Wednesday—as a demarcation that we are back to thinking more about both sides of the mandate. To me, the specific timing of the initial cut is less important than the longer-arc view that conditions are good on both sides of the mandate. Rates need to come down significantly going forward if we want the conditions to stay that way.",
