        "content": "Dec. 4, 2024\n\nSt. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem spoke at a Bloomberg and Global Interdependence Center symposium in New York City. He gave the talk “Remarks on the U.S. Economy and Monetary Policy” and participated in a moderated Q&A during the event, which focused on “Monetary Policymaking: Central Banking in a Changing World.”\n\nThe text is as prepared for delivery.\n\nGood morning. It is great to see many friends and former colleagues again. I would like to thank Bloomberg and the Global Interdependence Center for the invitation to participate in this symposium, and for the opportunity to share a few observations about the U.S. economy and implications for monetary policy.1\n\nFirst, let me state that these are my personal views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nLet me begin by summarizing current conditions as follows: The dual mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices are within sight, monetary policy is well positioned, and there is more work to do on inflation.\n\nEconomic activity has been robust with real GDP above its long-term potential in terms of both levels and growth rates. Spending by households and businesses has remained elevated, and financial conditions are broadly supportive of a growing economy. The fourth quarter is also looking strong.\n\nLabor market conditions are consistent with full employment. The unemployment rate is low and below estimates of its natural rate. Businesses remain healthy in terms of revenues, earnings and balance sheets, providing some confidence that layoffs are expected to remain low.\n\nThe labor market has been gradually cooling in an orderly manner. Job creation, hiring and quits rates have slowed, along with worker transition rates between labor market states—for example, transitions from unemployment to employment. The labor market is no longer overheated or posing as much upside risk to inflation, though average hourly earnings growth remains above long-term trends.\n\nInflation has declined materially since peaking in June 2022, and headline PCE inflation is close to the FOMC’s 2% target. However, in the remainder of my remarks I will focus on core PCE inflation because it is a better measure of underlying trends.\n\nCore PCE inflation remains closer to 3% than to the FOMC’s 2% target. Convergence toward 2% has been bumpy and recently slowed. Recent progress has relied more on falling goods and energy prices, and less on lower housing and services inflation.\n\nMonetary policy is well positioned. At its two most recent meetings, the FOMC reduced its target range for the federal funds rate by a total of 75 basis points. This lessened but did not eliminate monetary restraint. The policy rate remains above plausible levels for the neutral policy rate, appropriately so with inflation above target and a labor market close to full employment.\n\nWith that overview of current conditions, I will now look ahead and share my baseline outlook.\n\nBased on current information, I expect inflation will converge toward 2% over the next two years. Progress should become more evenly balanced, shifting from a reliance on falling goods and energy prices and toward lower housing and services inflation. I expect economic activity will moderate toward its long-term potential in level and growth terms. Some further gradual labor market cooling is likely, accompanied by moderating compensation growth. I expect the labor market will remain consistent with full employment while the unemployment rate rises modestly toward estimates of its natural rate.\n\nMy baseline scenario reflects an expectation that monetary policy remains appropriately restrictive while inflation is above 2%. Based on what we know today, further easing toward a neutral policy stance will likely be appropriate over time to support maximum employment, provided inflation is projected to continue to converge toward 2%. The path toward a neutral policy stance could be accelerated, slowed or paused depending on how the economic environment and outlook evolve.\n\nThere are of course alternative scenarios to consider and risks to manage around the baseline outlook that I have just outlined.\n\nFrom my perspective, it will be important at upcoming FOMC meetings to achieve optionality that best positions monetary policy for managing risks around the dual mandate goals and uncertainty about the neutral policy rate and productivity trends. I believe a patient and careful approach to further policy easing is warranted for three reasons:\n\nFirst, and while it is not in my baseline scenario, information received since September suggests a higher risk that progress toward 2% inflation could stall, or possibly reverse. At the same time, the risk of an unwelcome deterioration in the labor market has remained unchanged or possibly fallen. Since September, the economy has been stronger than expected, inflation has been higher than desired, and the labor market has remained close to full employment. Election uncertainty has subsided, and in recent months monetary policy uncertainty has declined with interest rates beginning to fall.\n\nIn the current environment, easing policy too much too soon poses a greater risk than easing too little, or too slowly. To be clear, both could lead to undesirable outcomes. Easing too much too soon could prompt an increase in demand that initially outpaces supply, delaying efforts to get inflation back to 2%, or possibly causing inflation expectations to move higher. Easing too much too soon could also increase term premia, putting undesired upward pressure on long-term interest rates and downward pressure on employment. A rapid easing of policy could be detrimental to both sides of the FOMC’s dual mandate.\n\nSecond, there is uncertainty about the long-run neutral federal funds rate. It could plausibly lie between 3% and 4%, depending, among other things, on productivity trends. With core PCE inflation currently closer to 3% than to the FOMC’s 2% target, monetary policy rules suggest a federal funds rate between 4.3% and 5.4% for the fourth quarter of 2024.2 At 4.6%, the midpoint of the current federal funds target range is already well within the range suggested by policy rules, and below the median of this range. Further reductions in the federal funds rate will therefore require careful management and depend crucially on an expectation of further convergence toward 2% inflation.\n\nThird, there is uncertainty about the durability of productivity trends. In recent quarters, strong productivity growth reconciled continued disinflation with a strong economy and above-trend labor compensation growth. But will this last?\n\nIf productivity growth has durably risen, disinflation could continue even if the economy continues to grow at its current rapid pace. In this scenario, the neutral policy rate might be higher than before, and conceivably the policy rate could be reduced more quickly. However, if productivity growth slows, inflation convergence could be challenged. The neutral policy rate could be lower than before, and more time may be required to get to the neutral rate to ensure that inflation does converge to 2%.\n\nOf course, we would all prefer sustained high-productivity growth. Perhaps new business formations, capital deepening, a broader adoption of labor-saving automation technology, and AI have put the economy on a new higher-productivity path. Over the past year, labor productivity has returned to its cyclically adjusted long-term trend, and there are reasons for optimism. Productivity growth has been higher for industries with higher technology and AI intensity and a higher share of college graduates. But whether productivity growth will remain high is an open question. In the meantime, it seems preferable to remain careful about relying on higher productivity growth to return inflation to target.\n\nTo conclude, I expect that inflation will converge to the FOMC’s 2% target and that additional easing of moderately restrictive policy toward neutral will be appropriate over time. Along this baseline path, it seems important to maintain policy optionality, and the time may be approaching to consider slowing the pace of interest rate reductions, or pausing, to carefully assess the current economic environment, incoming information and evolving outlook.\n\nI favor a patient approach that focuses on returning inflation sustainably to 2% for several reasons: In the current environment, core PCE inflation is above target, the economy is strong and growing above its long-term potential, and the labor market is consistent with full employment. Also, the balance of risks around the price stability and maximum employment goals has shifted, and there is uncertainty about the neutral policy rate and productivity trends.\n\nGoing the last mile to return inflation to 2% will help keep inflation expectations anchored and provide the price stability underpinning needed to maintain maximum employment and a sustained economic expansion.\n\nThank you.\n\nNotes"

        "content": "Oct. 7, 2024\n\nSt. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem gave a speech, “Financial Conditions, the Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy,” at a Money Marketeers of New York University Inc. event in New York.\n\nThe text is as prepared for delivery.\n\nGood evening. Thank you for inviting me to speak with you today and for the kind introduction. It is a pleasure to be in New York City among so many friends and former colleagues.\n\nAt its September meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) reduced the target range for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points and released a Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) with a median projection of additional reductions in the quarters ahead. I supported the policy action and penciled in a baseline policy path slightly above the median. I did so because monetary policy was and remains moderately restrictive for an economy that appears close to equilibrium with respect to inflation and employment. The improved outlook for inflation and cooling of the labor market that occurred over the summer gave me greater confidence in achieving our dual mandate objectives.\n\nI believe it will likely be appropriate to further reduce the target range for the federal funds rate over time toward a neutral posture, with the size and timing of reductions depending on incoming data, the evolving outlook and the forward-looking balance of risks around this outlook. Over a policy horizon comprising the next few quarters, under my baseline outlook, the U.S. economy will continue to grow at a solid pace with a healthy labor market at or near full employment and inflation converging to 2%.\n\nIn this talk, I will first discuss current financial conditions for different parts of the economy and their implications for the outlook. Next, I will share my baseline outlook for the economy and associated policy path. Finally, I will discuss some plausible alternative scenarios and their policy implications.\n\nLet me stress that these are my personal views and not necessarily those of my FOMC colleagues.\n\nBecause financial conditions play a central role in monetary policy transmission to the broader economy, in my preparation for FOMC meetings I focus a great deal on understanding the availability and pricing of financing.1 Here is how I see financial conditions today.\n\nAt present, overall financial conditions in the United States appear broadly supportive of continued economic growth with financing generally available. Conditions do vary across different parts of the economy.\n\nMost closely watched indexes show that financial conditions were relatively tight in 2022 and early 2023. They began to ease after the spring 2023 banking turmoil and have been more accommodative than average over the past four quarters. Falling inflation in the second half of 2023 and resulting changes in expectations about the path of the Fed’s policy rate undoubtedly contributed to this easing. Yields on corporate and Treasury debt rose modestly in the first five months of 2024 as inflation progress stalled and caused expectations of the Fed’s rate path to revise upward, but overall financial conditions remained accommodative. Yields have since fallen as inflation has eased and the labor market has cooled somewhat.\n\nUnpacking the broad measures, financial conditions appear favorable for businesses, municipalities and households with access to capital markets but less favorable for some smaller firms and households. Low credit spreads and strong demand continue to provide an environment supporting sizable corporate bond, leveraged loan, and private credit issuance. New equity issues and initial public offerings remain below pre-pandemic levels but have risen over the past two years as companies have taken advantage of the lower cost of equity financing to raise cash.\n\nFinancial conditions are less accommodative for smaller businesses that rely on banks for financing. Credit is generally available, but nominal interest rates on short-term loans to small businesses remain meaningfully above their pre-pandemic levels.2 Banks have been tightening their lending standards for a few quarters, albeit at a decreasing rate, and the Fed’s most recent survey of senior loan officers indicates that lending standards are somewhat tighter now than before the pandemic.3\n\nAs with interest rates on loans to small businesses, rates charged to household borrowers remain higher than before the pandemic but have begun to ease. Credit card and auto loan rates have been sticky, but mortgage rates have declined from their peaks, with the average rate on 30-year fixed loans down more than 100 basis points over the past year.4 Data reported by the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) show a significant increase in refinancings in recent weeks as loan rates have fallen.5 The MBA also reports that home mortgage applications have risen to their highest level in more than two years, suggesting that sales might finally begin to pick up.6\n\nMeasures of credit quality and financial stress have deteriorated modestly in recent months among all borrower classes but remain low, especially for prime borrowers. Outside of commercial real estate, overall credit quality is strong for most corporate debt, home mortgages and other secured debt. Corporate bond and leveraged loan default rates are near their low pre-pandemic levels, and delinquency rates on small-business loans are also low. Loan modifications have been rising for both bank and private credit issuers for a few quarters. Modifications can help some stressed borrowers avoid delinquency and defaults, and thereby maintain production and employment.\n\nDelinquency rates on auto loans and credit cards have been rising for several months and are now somewhat higher than before the pandemic. Rising delinquency rates are indicative of greater financial stress among some households, especially low- and moderate-income (LMI) households. This bears watching, as I will discuss shortly.\n\nLow financing costs for borrowers with access to capital markets, and wealth gains from historically elevated equity, home values and other assets, suggest that at the present time, the economy might be unusually sensitive to asset prices. In this environment, the link between monetary policy, financial conditions, asset prices and broader economic outcomes could be tighter than usual. With that in mind, I will now provide my assessment of current economic conditions and the outlook.\n\nThe U.S. economy is continuing to expand at a solid pace with the Fed’s dual mandate objectives in sight. What could go wrong? Before getting into possible scenarios, let’s begin by reviewing some of the recent data that feed into my outlook for the economy.\n\nMy baseline outlook is for continued economic expansion over the next several quarters, supported by a gradual easing of monetary policy and accommodative financial conditions. The first half of 2024 saw strong growth in real GDP and labor productivity. Tracking forecasts indicate that third-quarter real GDP growth was also strong.7 Estimates of potential GDP are highly uncertain, but through the third quarter, both the level and growth rate of real GDP appear to have been somewhat above the long-term potential. Recent data revisions did not materially alter these facts and did give me greater confidence in them by largely eliminating a puzzling gap between GDP and gross domestic income (GDI).\n\nA full-employment labor market and accumulated wealth from gains in equities, home values and other assets are reasons to expect steady consumption growth in the quarters ahead. August core retail sales exceeded market expectations but growth in total real consumer expenditures was soft, and auto and light truck sales have been running below pre-pandemic levels. However, upward revisions to the household savings data suggest that consumers may have more residual spending power than previously thought. Recent declines in home mortgage rates are spurring cash-out refinancings, providing homeowners with additional funds for consumption or for paying down other forms of debt.\n\nOf course, not everyone owns a home or a stock portfolio. The combination of high inflation and high interest rates has been especially challenging for LMI households, necessitating tradeoffs in their spending and financial decisions. In the aggregate, lower-income households have maintained consumption growth at similar rates to higher-income households. They have done so by trading down to lower-tier brands and products, switching from discretionary to nondiscretionary products, and relying more heavily on debt. Rising auto loan and credit card delinquency rates indicate that many households are financially stretched, which may ultimately weigh on their ability to maintain consumption growth. Accordingly, some modest slowing in aggregate consumption growth over the next few quarters would not be surprising, especially if the labor market were to soften. The recent lowering of earnings forecasts for businesses in the consumer discretionary sector reflects market concerns about consumer spending growth.\n\nAs with consumption spending, the outlooks for other major sectors of the economy and GDP components do not suggest a significant slowing of economic activity is imminent. The services sector remains strong, as evidenced recently by the September ISM Services PMI, which has risen for three consecutive months.8\n\nTo be sure, there are pockets of weakness. Manufacturing output rose in August after two consecutive down months, but the pace of growth remains low. Conceivably, some of the weakness in manufacturing reflects the ongoing rotation of consumer spending toward services in the post-pandemic environment.\n\nThe housing market has been weak for several quarters with relatively high mortgage rates restraining both supply and demand. More recently, falling mortgage rates have begun to provide some relief to the market, as evidenced by increased refinancing. Housing starts have also picked up and housing completions recently reached a 17-year high.\n\nUncertainty about the path of interest rates and about the outcome of the upcoming election could be weighing on activity, perhaps causing some hesitancy on the part of firms to increase capacity or add workers. Some 30% of respondents to a recent survey by the Atlanta and Richmond Feds in conjunction with Duke University reported that election-related uncertainty has caused them to postpone, scale down, delay or cancel investment plans.9\n\nI’ve heard much the same in conversations with businesspeople in the Eighth Federal Reserve District and around the country. Of course, there is always uncertainty about future policies and other environmental factors, but I’ve heard enough “survive until 2025” comments from businesspeople and others to believe that resolving some uncertainty about the path for interest rates or the election could provide a meaningful boost to investment and spending.\n\nTurning now to the Fed’s dual mandate objectives, both the labor market and inflation are in a good place, and I see the risks to the two objectives as roughly balanced around the baseline.\n\nRecent data have given me greater confidence that inflation is converging toward the FOMC’s 2% target. Falling goods prices continue to offset still elevated services and housing inflation, producing benign overall inflation numbers. Falling rent inflation should bring down the housing component of the overall price indexes over time. I expect headline and core PCE inflation to converge to 2% on a 12-month basis over the next few quarters. It is possible that inflation will cease to converge, but I believe the risks that inflation becomes stuck above 2% or rises from here have diminished.\n\nMy outlook for inflation is based in part on the condition of the labor market. Unlike a year ago, the labor market is no longer overheated or posing upside risk to inflation. While the market has cooled from a year ago, it remains strong at or near maximum employment.\n\nThe increase in the unemployment rate over the last year has been notable, but at 4.1% it remains low by historical standards and below the 4.2% median long-run projection of FOMC participants.10 Substantial immigration and higher labor force participation have increased the available supply of workers since 2021, though more recently, immigration has slowed, and the labor force participation rate has been roughly stable. Job openings, which reflect the strength of labor demand, have gradually declined over the past year, but are still elevated relative to historical levels. Together, these developments led to the increase in the unemployment rate that has occurred since mid-2023. The decline in the unemployment rate in each of the last two months is mainly attributable to an increase in the job finding rate among unemployed workers and a decline in separations to unemployment.\n\nThe modest degree of labor market cooling over the past year is consistent with an economy that remains strong with rising labor productivity. Softer demand for labor has not translated into widespread layoffs. Instead, firms have relied mainly on attrition, reduced hours, and shifts to right-size their workforces. The business sector is generally healthy; corporate earnings have been strong, with small-business earnings less so. The consensus outlook for earnings is generally stable, albeit with some differentiation across industries, such as the outlook for the consumer discretionary sector I noted earlier.\n\nI now return to the question, “What could go wrong?” Any number of shocks could change the outlook. Disruptions to global shipping and energy supplies from expanded conflict in the Middle East or elsewhere, more frequent or prolonged labor strikes, and slower immigration flows, as observed over the last few months of data, are front-and-center risks that have the potential to impact the broader economy and progress on inflation, and thus bear on the outlook. I have not factored these events into my baseline outlook thus far but may do so should they worsen or become prolonged.\n\nIn recent months, the risks that inflation would become stuck above 2% or rise have diminished somewhat, while the risk of an unwelcome deterioration in the labor market has increased. At present, I see those risks as roughly balanced. Neither risk seems especially high, but we should be mindful of alternative scenarios that could play out and think about how to respond to them.\n\nOne possibility is that inflation ceases to converge to 2% or moves higher, perhaps because the economy responds more vigorously than expected to lower interest rates and easier financial conditions, as well as to resolution of election uncertainty. Should such a scenario arise, with demand increasing at a faster pace than supply, it would be appropriate to maintain a restrictive policy stance with fewer, if any, reductions in the policy rate until such time as inflation does continue to converge. The possibility that this scenario could arise is why, in the current environment, it is appropriate to withdraw monetary restraint at a pace and magnitude that allow time to evaluate the effects of policy easing.\n\nAnother possible scenario is that the labor market softens by more than expected while inflation remains on the path to 2% or falls below it. If that situation were to arise, then it would be appropriate to move the policy rate down more quickly and by a greater amount than my baseline projection.\n\nBoth easing too much too soon, and easing too little too late, can produce costly outcomes. Considering the costs of such policy paths is useful for framing decisions. Given where the economy is today, I view the costs of easing too much too soon as greater than the costs of easing too little too late. That is because sticky or higher inflation would pose a threat to the Fed’s credibility and to future employment and economic activity. Of course, I am not advocating easing too little too late. I am simply weighing the dual mandate costs of two undesirable policy paths and their outcomes.\n\nTo conclude, I supported the FOMC’s recent decision to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate, thereby beginning to normalize the stance of policy to align with 2% inflation and maximum employment. I concluded that a 50-basis-point reduction in the policy rate was appropriate because data suggested that inflation was falling more quickly toward 2% than I had previously anticipated.\n\nI believe that further gradual reductions in the policy rate will likely be appropriate over time. Patience has served the FOMC well in its pursuit of price stability and remains appropriate now, but I will not prejudge the size or timing of future adjustments to policy. As the poet Robert Burns wrote, “The best laid plans of mice and men often go awry.” That is true for monetary policymakers who must be attuned to shocks and other events that cause the economy to deviate from forecasts and projections. Robust policymaking requires being cognizant of the possibility—even the reality—that the economy will not evolve precisely, or even substantially, in line with baseline projections, and there is value in being prepared to pivot accordingly. Ultimately, incoming data, unanticipated shocks, evolving forecasts and the balance of risks around these forecasts will determine the policy path.\n\nThank you.\n\nNotes"

        "content": "Oct. 2, 2024\n\nSt. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem gave welcoming remarks at the 12th annual Community Banking Research Conference held at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The conference was co-sponsored by the Federal Reserve System, Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC). For more information, visit the 2024 Community Banking Research Conference website.\n\nAny views expressed here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nGood morning and welcome to the 12th Community Banking Research Conference.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System sponsors this conference in partnership with the Conference of State Bank Supervisors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The St. Louis Fed is proud to have served as the host for all 12 years of the conference.\n\nThe conference was known to me well before I joined the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis six months ago as its president and CEO. What takes place at this conference each year is known and appreciated by numerous constituencies around the world.\n\nIt’s a testament to the strength of this conference, and to its talented planning committee, that the conference attracts such strong interest from researchers, regulators, policymakers and community banks year after year.\n\nPart of that draw comes from the fact that this conference has several elements that are truly unique.\n\nIt is keenly focused on bringing together diverse perspectives to discuss emerging research and to debate important issues impacting the community bank business model. For example, community bankers are embedded on each research panel, a capstone panel of community bankers will synthesize everything we learn over the next day and a half, and a prominent community banker will offer keynote remarks tomorrow morning.\n\nThis event features state and federal regulators and policymakers alongside researchers who are joining us from all over the world.

The conference was co-sponsored by the Federal Reserve System, Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC). For more information, visit the 2024 Community Banking Research Conference website.\n\nAny views expressed here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nGood morning and welcome to the 12th Community Banking Research Conference.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System sponsors this conference in partnership with the Conference of State Bank Supervisors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The St. Louis Fed is proud to have served as the host for all 12 years of the conference.\n\nThe conference was known to me well before I joined the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis six months ago as its president and CEO. What takes place at this conference each year is known and appreciated by numerous constituencies around the world.\n\nIt’s a testament to the strength of this conference, and to its talented planning committee, that the conference attracts such strong interest from researchers, regulators, policymakers and community banks year after year.\n\nPart of that draw comes from the fact that this conference has several elements that are truly unique.\n\nIt is keenly focused on bringing together diverse perspectives to discuss emerging research and to debate important issues impacting the community bank business model. For example, community bankers are embedded on each research panel, a capstone panel of community bankers will synthesize everything we learn over the next day and a half, and a prominent community banker will offer keynote remarks tomorrow morning.\n\nThis event features state and federal regulators and policymakers alongside researchers who are joining us from all over the world. Their perspectives are combined to ensure that we look at community banking from many different angles.\n\nAnother element I find unique is our audience.

        "content": "June 18, 2024\n\nSt. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem gave a speech, “Remarks on the Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy,” at a CFA Society St. Louis event in St. Louis.\n\nGood afternoon. It is a great pleasure to offer my first public remarks on monetary policy and the U.S. economy as St. Louis Fed president to the CFA Society St. Louis.1\n\nWe have some background in common. I have been a practitioner in economics and financial markets for nearly three decades, and now a policymaker. Because we have finance in common, I thought you would be interested in how I view the connection between monetary policy, financial markets, and economic outcomes like inflation and employment.\n\nI will begin by discussing the transmission of monetary policy to the economy through financial conditions. I will follow with some observations about current economic developments, focusing on the Fed’s dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment. Finally, I will discuss scenarios under which adjustments in the stance of monetary policy could be appropriate.\n\nI will offer my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nAs the central bank of the United States, the Fed influences the economy in two ways through monetary policy.2 The FOMC takes policy action by setting the current target range for the federal funds rate. This is the interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans. The FOMC also communicates with the public and affects expectations about the future path of the federal funds rate.3 Communications can be as impactful as policy action.4 Both transmit through financial markets onto economic growth, employment and inflation outcomes.\n\nOf course, factors other than FOMC actions and communications can also affect financial conditions. For example, financial markets may react to new information about corporate earnings, credit quality of issuers, economic growth, inflation, and risk events like political uncertainty, armed conflict and pandemics, to name a few. In these remarks, my focus is on the effects of monetary policy.\n\nA lower federal funds rate, or a lower expected future path of the federal funds rate, eases financial conditions. Interest rates on Treasury debt, bank loans, mortgages and corporate debt decline. For businesses, the cost of equity financing also declines. Households respond by increasing their consumption of goods and services as well as their investment in real estate. Businesses increase their investment on equipment and structures used in production. The overall positive impact on aggregate demand tends to precede higher supply, supporting growth and employment, with positive and variable lagged effects on inflation.5\n\nHouseholds and businesses respond directly and indirectly to a lower interest rate. Directly, they face lower returns on savings and lower costs of financing. This supports higher current spending. Indirectly, lower interest rates raise the value of their debt, equity and real estate. This raises the value of collateral that households and businesses can use for debt financing of consumption and investment activities. Also, higher asset values are perceived as strengthening their balance sheets, producing positive confidence effects that support demand.\n\nThus far, I have considered a lower federal funds rate, or a lower expected future path of the federal funds rate. A higher federal funds rate, or a higher expected future path of the federal funds rate, works in reverse through the same channels, tightening financial conditions, restraining economic activity and reducing inflation.\n\nSo, how do Fed communications have an impact? They affect market expectations about the future path of the federal funds rate in two ways. They inform the public about how the FOMC will likely react to different economic scenarios to achieve its dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment over time. This is commonly referred to as the FOMC’s “policy reaction function.” Fed communications also reveal how the FOMC perceives incoming information about current and future economic scenarios. This involves communicating about the shape and probability of scenarios for inflation and employment.\n\nIn short, the Fed’s monetary policy communications reflect how the FOMC perceives its reaction function and the inputs to its reaction function in terms of scenarios for the economy and their likelihood. The Fed seeks to provide clarity about what the scenarios are, how likely they are, and how policymakers would respond in each scenario.\n\nIn providing clarity, I believe it is critical to communicate both about the most likely scenario and about less likely scenarios that could be consequential if they materialize. Communicating about a range of scenarios, rather than only the most likely, is an important component of robust policymaking. A forecast can prove to be incorrect. An unlikely scenario can materialize, instead of the most likely scenario. As Mark Twain purportedly said, “it is difficult to make predictions, especially about the future.”6 For me, a lesson of the past few years has been that humility is a virtue when it comes to forecasting and robust policymaking. I will say more about this later.\n\nTurning to economic conditions, the past year has seen substantial progress toward the Fed’s dual mandate goals of stable prices and maximum employment.\n\nEconomic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace underpinned by robust demand, especially in services. The downshift in first-quarter real GDP growth largely reflected declines in inventory investment and net exports, which are notoriously volatile. Growth in final sales to private domestic purchasers remained strong and close to trend. However, April data, especially on real consumer spending and nominal retail sales, mostly underwhelmed, and the few May data reported to date have been mixed. As reported this morning, May retail sales were weaker than expected, suggesting that aggregate demand is growing at a moderate pace thus far this quarter.\n\nThere are crosscurrents in the outlook for aggregate consumption growth. The cumulative effects of inflation and higher interest rates are straining low- and moderate-income households and those with high levels of debt. These consumers are becoming more price sensitive, trading down in product quality, shifting into nondiscretionary goods and services, and resorting to rising levels of credit card debt to sustain consumption growth. Other consumers are benefiting from higher interest income on bank deposits, higher dividends on money market funds, and gains in the value of equity and real estate assets. These consumers are continuing to propel a shift into the consumption of services, a fast-growing segment. Overall, I expect aggregate consumption to moderate in coming quarters, without stalling, and then return to or slightly exceed trend by 2026.\n\nThe labor market has continued to rebalance. It no longer seems overheated but remains tight. I expect some further cooling in coming months, as evidenced by the recent decline in job openings, the modest increase in new claims for unemployment insurance, and the uptick in the unemployment rate. However, the large and broad-based growth in payroll employment and the increase in average hourly earnings reported in the May establishment survey suggest demand for labor remains strong. Continued high employment and compensation growth, approximately in line with productivity growth, should moderate the impact of easing labor market conditions on aggregate demand.\n\nThere are potential early signs of continued progress on inflation. We at the St. Louis Fed are hearing reports from contacts in the Eighth District about price cuts and discounting because consumers are becoming more price sensitive. Favorable national reports on consumer and producer prices suggest the monthly reading for the personal consumption expenditures price index, or PCE price index, should show a welcome downshift of inflation in May. I am hopeful this could mark a resumption of progress toward 2 percent inflation. However, it takes more than one data point to establish a trend. Data for the first four months of 2024 indicated that inflation remained too high and was moving more sideways than down. Moreover, recent elevated readings on PCE inflation have been broad-based across expenditure categories of goods and services.\n\nI will now turn to an overview of monetary and financial conditions. The current target range of 5.25 to 5.5 percent for the federal funds rate seems restrictive. I believe that monetary policy is continuing to exert downward pressure on aggregate demand and inflation. I also perceive some uncertainty about the degree of restrictiveness for reasons that I will now explore.\n\nFirst, measures of monetary policy restrictiveness depend on views for underlying inflation and the long-run neutral rate of interest. Policy appears materially restrictive if the underlying rate of inflation is around 2.8 percent and the long-run neutral rate of interest is assumed at around 0.5 percent.7 However, policy appears less restrictive if the underlying rate of inflation is higher, say the 3.5 percent year-to-date PCE inflation rate that forecasters expect through May8, or if the long-run neutral rate of interest is thought to be higher.9 I believe the long-run neutral rate is higher than 0.5 percent.\n\nSecond, the effects of restrictive policy on some sectors of the economy have yet to become fully evident on inflation and aggregate demand. High interest rates continue to restrain residential investment as well as consumption of durable and nondurable goods.10 Other sectors and components of demand are also being restrained as loans made at low interest rates, two or more years ago, continue to reprice at higher rates. However, nonresidential investment and the consumption of services continue at a strong pace. Services inflation continues to be elevated.\n\nThird, it is possible that monetary policy transmission may be slower this cycle. Contributing factors include the mortgage lock-in effect and the meaningful refinancing of corporate debt before the federal funds rate began to rise in early 2022.11 Housing markets continue to experience low transaction volumes, low supply, increasing demand and rising home prices. This amounts to a lower interest rate sensitivity of an otherwise traditionally strong transmission channel. Debt refinancing appears to have reduced the interest rate sensitivity of corporate investment activities, otherwise another traditionally strong transmission channel.\n\nFourth, financial conditions feel accommodative for some parts of the economy while restrictive for others. A look at a cross-section of financial conditions indices12 suggests that financial conditions are accommodative for some parts of the economy.* Credit is generally available to businesses, households and municipalities. There is robust issuance in capital markets, ample financing in private credit markets and modest bank loan growth. Businesses with access to capital markets are taking advantage of compressed credit spreads and equity risk premia to issue debt and equity at a higher pace than in 2022 and 2023. Mergers and acquisition activity is rising. Margin debt is also rising. However, credit availability has remained tight and financial conditions are restrictive for small businesses and for households with low and moderate income or low credit scores. Borrowing costs are elevated and delinquencies are rising for these segments of the economy. I am keenly aware of these hardships from my frequent interactions with people and firms throughout our region.\n\nGiven my assessment of economic and financial conditions, I supported the FOMC’s decision last week to maintain its target range for the federal funds rate at 5.25 to 5.5 percent.\n\nI also supported the Committee’s statement that it “does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.” This conditional statement provides an option to ease policy in the more likely scenario of achieving confidence that inflation can be expected to converge to 2 percent.\n\nThe current policy posture balances the risk of easing policy too early with the risk of easing policy too late. It allows the Committee to patiently observe economic developments going forward. I will need to observe a period of favorable inflation, moderating demand and expanding supply before becoming confident that a reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate is appropriate. These conditions could take months, and more likely quarters to play out.\n\nI am also attentive to alternative scenarios where inflation becomes stuck meaningfully above 2 percent or moves higher. As discussed earlier, I believe that robust policymaking requires considering, and communicating about, less likely but consequential scenarios. Should evidence of alternative inflation scenarios begin to materialize, I would support an additional firming of monetary policy.\n\nTo be clear, I do not view the inflation “getting stuck” or “rising” as the most likely scenarios. But it is prudent to plan for and communicate about plausible scenarios that could play out.\n\nIf progress toward achieving 2 percent inflation stalls or reverses, I believe it would be appropriate for the Committee to act promptly to ensure that high inflation does not become entrenched. If the public came to believe that high inflation would persist, it would make restoring price stability harder to achieve and could entail greater economic costs.\n\nI am optimistic that price stability can be achieved and will remain vigilant until inflation is clearly and convincingly well on its way back to target.\n\nThank you.\n\n*This sentence was updated after the written remarks were initially posted on the website.

        "content": "June 18, 2024\n\nSt. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem gave a speech, “Remarks on the Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy,” at a CFA Society St. Louis event in St. Louis.\n\nGood afternoon. It is a great pleasure to offer my first public remarks on monetary policy and the U.S. economy as St. Louis Fed president to the CFA Society St. Louis.1\n\nWe have some background in common. I have been a practitioner in economics and financial markets for nearly three decades, and now a policymaker. Because we have finance in common, I thought you would be interested in how I view the connection between monetary policy, financial markets, and economic outcomes like inflation and employment.\n\nI will begin by discussing the transmission of monetary policy to the economy through financial conditions. I will follow with some observations about current economic developments, focusing on the Fed’s dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment. Finally, I will discuss scenarios under which adjustments in the stance of monetary policy could be appropriate.\n\nI will offer my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nAs the central bank of the United States, the Fed influences the economy in two ways through monetary policy.2 The FOMC takes policy action by setting the current target range for the federal funds rate. This is the interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans. The FOMC also communicates with the public and affects expectations about the future path of the federal funds rate.3 Communications can be as impactful as policy action.4 Both transmit through financial markets onto economic growth, employment and inflation outcomes.\n\nOf course, factors other than FOMC actions and communications can also affect financial conditions. For example, financial markets may react to new information about corporate earnings, credit quality of issuers, economic growth, inflation, and risk events like political uncertainty, armed conflict and pandemics, to name a few. In these remarks, my focus is on the effects of monetary policy.\n\nA lower federal funds rate, or a lower expected future path of the federal funds rate, eases financial conditions. Interest rates on Treasury debt, bank loans, mortgages and corporate debt decline. For businesses, the cost of equity financing also declines. Households respond by increasing their consumption of goods and services as well as their investment in real estate. Businesses increase their investment on equipment and structures used in production. The overall positive impact on aggregate demand tends to precede higher supply, supporting growth and employment, with positive and variable lagged effects on inflation.5\n\nHouseholds and businesses respond directly and indirectly to a lower interest rate. Directly, they face lower returns on savings and lower costs of financing. This supports higher current spending. Indirectly, lower interest rates raise the value of their debt, equity and real estate. This raises the value of collateral that households and businesses can use for debt financing of consumption and investment activities. Also, higher asset values are perceived as strengthening their balance sheets, producing positive confidence effects that support demand.\n\nThus far, I have considered a lower federal funds rate, or a lower expected future path of the federal funds rate. A higher federal funds rate, or a higher expected future path of the federal funds rate, works in reverse through the same channels, tightening financial conditions, restraining economic activity and reducing inflation.\n\nSo, how do Fed communications have an impact? They affect market expectations about the future path of the federal funds rate in two ways. They inform the public about how the FOMC will likely react to different economic scenarios to achieve its dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment over time. This is commonly referred to as the FOMC’s “policy reaction function.” Fed communications also reveal how the FOMC perceives incoming information about current and future economic scenarios. This involves communicating about the shape and probability of scenarios for inflation and employment.\n\nIn short, the Fed’s monetary policy communications reflect how the FOMC perceives its reaction function and the inputs to its reaction function in terms of scenarios for the economy and their likelihood. The Fed seeks to provide clarity about what the scenarios are, how likely they are, and how policymakers would respond in each scenario.\n\nIn providing clarity, I believe it is critical to communicate both about the most likely scenario and about less likely scenarios that could be consequential if they materialize. Communicating about a range of scenarios, rather than only the most likely, is an important component of robust policymaking. A forecast can prove to be incorrect. An unlikely scenario can materialize, instead of the most likely scenario. As Mark Twain purportedly said, “it is difficult to make predictions, especially about the future.”6 For me, a lesson of the past few years has been that humility is a virtue when it comes to forecasting and robust policymaking. I will say more about this later.\n\nTurning to economic conditions, the past year has seen substantial progress toward the Fed’s dual mandate goals of stable prices and maximum employment.\n\nEconomic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace underpinned by robust demand, especially in services. The downshift in first-quarter real GDP growth largely reflected declines in inventory investment and net exports, which are notoriously volatile. Growth in final sales to private domestic purchasers remained strong and close to trend. However, April data, especially on real consumer spending and nominal retail sales, mostly underwhelmed, and the few May data reported to date have been mixed. As reported this morning, May retail sales were weaker than expected, suggesting that aggregate demand is growing at a moderate pace thus far this quarter.\n\nThere are crosscurrents in the outlook for aggregate consumption growth. The cumulative effects of inflation and higher interest rates are straining low- and moderate-income households and those with high levels of debt. These consumers are becoming more price sensitive, trading down in product quality, shifting into nondiscretionary goods and services, and resorting to rising levels of credit card debt to sustain consumption growth. Other consumers are benefiting from higher interest income on bank deposits, higher dividends on money market funds, and gains in the value of equity and real estate assets. These consumers are continuing to propel a shift into the consumption of services, a fast-growing segment. Overall, I expect aggregate consumption to moderate in coming quarters, without stalling, and then return to or slightly exceed trend by 2026.\n\nThe labor market has continued to rebalance. It no longer seems overheated but remains tight. I expect some further cooling in coming months, as evidenced by the recent decline in job openings, the modest increase in new claims for unemployment insurance, and the uptick in the unemployment rate. However, the large and broad-based growth in payroll employment and the increase in average hourly earnings reported in the May establishment survey suggest demand for labor remains strong. Continued high employment and compensation growth, approximately in line with productivity growth, should moderate the impact of easing labor market conditions on aggregate demand.\n\nThere are potential early signs of continued progress on inflation. We at the St. Louis Fed are hearing reports from contacts in the Eighth District about price cuts and discounting because consumers are becoming more price sensitive. Favorable national reports on consumer and producer prices suggest the monthly reading for the personal consumption expenditures price index, or PCE price index, should show a welcome downshift of inflation in May. I am hopeful this could mark a resumption of progress toward 2 percent inflation. However, it takes more than one data point to establish a trend.

Adriana Kugler at the 2024 Women in Economics Symposium held at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\n\nAny views expressed here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nGood evening, and welcome to the St. Louis Fed!\n\nThis is the sixth Women in Economics Symposium hosted by the Bank, and it is my first. This also happens to be only my third day on the job, and I’m still finding my way around the building. I’m glad that I was able to find the auditorium and that you did, too! I’m told that there are around 2,000 people joining virtually from some 100 watch parties and individually. I also welcome all of you.\n\nI am proud that the Women in Economics Symposium is the first major event of my tenure at the Bank, and I am particularly pleased to introduce this evening’s keynote speaker, Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis has a longstanding commitment to encouraging and supporting women in the economics profession, and I firmly stand behind it. Although there are many outstanding female economists serving in consequential government, academic and private sector roles, the profession remains less diverse than it should be. This symposium is meant to help rectify female underrepresentation by providing information to young women about careers in economics and by giving attendees an opportunity to network with and hear from highly accomplished women in the profession.\n\nEarlier this afternoon, Oksana Leukhina presented interesting information on gender diversity in economics, and I will highlight a few data points from her presentation:\n\nAlthough women make up more than 50 percent of all college students, only about 35 percent of seniors majoring in economics are women, and just 30 percent of new Ph.D.s in economics are awarded to women.1 These percentages are considerably higher than they were in the 1970s and ’80s, but unfortunately there hasn’t been much improvement over the past 20 years or so.2\n\nAs Oksana mentioned, the pipeline of women in academic economics has been leaky. Women are less represented in senior positions, in academia and elsewhere than they are at lower levels. While more than 30 percent of assistant economics professors are women, less than 20 percent of full economics professors are women.3\n\nHow does economics compare with other fields of study? Women are particularly underrepresented in economics compared with other social sciences, where women receive 65 percent of all Ph.D.s awarded. In STEM fields, economics is roughly on par with engineering, and women are somewhat more represented among Ph.D.s awarded in economics than in math and computer science, where only about 25 percent are women.4\n\nThe underrepresentation of women in STEM fields is concerning because the problems faced by the next generation of engineers, scientists and, yes, economists, will be complex, difficult and consequential, and will require the brightest minds if they are to be tackled successfully. If women are blocked or discouraged from pursuing degrees in economics or other STEM fields, or simply not given the information to help them decide if a STEM career may be right for them, the world will be the worse for it.\n\nThe U.S. economy has reaped the benefits of greater female labor force participation since World War II. In early 1950, approximately 33 percent of all women were in the labor force.

Adriana Kugler at the 2024 Women in Economics Symposium held at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\n\nAny views expressed here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nGood evening, and welcome to the St. Louis Fed!\n\nThis is the sixth Women in Economics Symposium hosted by the Bank, and it is my first. This also happens to be only my third day on the job, and I’m still finding my way around the building. I’m glad that I was able to find the auditorium and that you did, too! I’m told that there are around 2,000 people joining virtually from some 100 watch parties and individually. I also welcome all of you.\n\nI am proud that the Women in Economics Symposium is the first major event of my tenure at the Bank, and I am particularly pleased to introduce this evening’s keynote speaker, Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis has a longstanding commitment to encouraging and supporting women in the economics profession, and I firmly stand behind it. Although there are many outstanding female economists serving in consequential government, academic and private sector roles, the profession remains less diverse than it should be. This symposium is meant to help rectify female underrepresentation by providing information to young women about careers in economics and by giving attendees an opportunity to network with and hear from highly accomplished women in the profession.\n\nEarlier this afternoon, Oksana Leukhina presented interesting information on gender diversity in economics, and I will highlight a few data points from her presentation:\n\nAlthough women make up more than 50 percent of all college students, only about 35 percent of seniors majoring in economics are women, and just 30 percent of new Ph.D.s in economics are awarded to women.1 These percentages are considerably higher than they were in the 1970s and ’80s, but unfortunately there hasn’t been much improvement over the past 20 years or so.2\n\nAs Oksana mentioned, the pipeline of women in academic economics has been leaky. Women are less represented in senior positions, in academia and elsewhere than they are at lower levels. While more than 30 percent of assistant economics professors are women, less than 20 percent of full economics professors are women.3\n\nHow does economics compare with other fields of study? Women are particularly underrepresented in economics compared with other social sciences, where women receive 65 percent of all Ph.D.s awarded. In STEM fields, economics is roughly on par with engineering, and women are somewhat more represented among Ph.D.s awarded in economics than in math and computer science, where only about 25 percent are women.4\n\nThe underrepresentation of women in STEM fields is concerning because the problems faced by the next generation of engineers, scientists and, yes, economists, will be complex, difficult and consequential, and will require the brightest minds if they are to be tackled successfully. If women are blocked or discouraged from pursuing degrees in economics or other STEM fields, or simply not given the information to help them decide if a STEM career may be right for them, the world will be the worse for it.\n\nThe U.S. economy has reaped the benefits of greater female labor force participation since World War II.
