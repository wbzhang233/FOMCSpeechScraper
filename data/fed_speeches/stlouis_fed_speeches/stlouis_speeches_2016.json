        "content": "Welcoming Remarks by James Bullard, President and CEO\nFourth Annual Community Banking in the 21st Century Research and Policy Conference\nThe Federal Reserve System and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS)\nSt. Louis, Mo.\nSept. 28, 2016\nGood morning, and welcome to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The St. Louis Fed is again\nproud to serve as the host site for the Community Banking in the 21st Century research and\npolicy conference. This year marks the fourth consecutive year of the conference and the\nfourth time the Federal Reserve has partnered with the Conference of State Bank Supervisors\non these proceedings.\nWhen the Federal Reserve and the CSBS first began this endeavor, our primary goal was to\nidentify and bring forward the latest research on community banking from a cross section of\nacademic institutions and regulatory agencies. I think we have been successful in meeting that\ngoal. By the conclusion of this year’s conference, we will have presented nearly 50 papers, with\nmore than twice as many papers submitted as accepted. These papers have addressed a range\nof issues of importance to community banks, to regulators and to policymakers. This\nconference has given us a forum to discuss the findings and debate the policy\nrecommendations.\nOne theme consistent throughout these conferences is something I hear during my discussions\nwith bankers across the Federal Reserve’s Eighth District: A strong banking system supports\nstrong communities and ultimately leads to a strong economy. Or, said more simply:\nStrong banks. Strong communities. Strong economy.\nThe 10 papers in this year’s conference—through their analysis of the community bank business\nmodel, their exploration of the relationship between community bank size and performance,\nand their assessment of the regulatory issues facing community banks—all ultimately support\nthis core idea.\nFor example, this year we’ll hear about the changing composition of minority depository\ninstitutions within communities they serve; another paper offers us a model for thinking about\nhow commercial and agricultural lending by community banks impacts state-level employment\n\n\fand gross state product; and another paper provides evidence that community bank use of\n“soft information” is an acceptable substitute for “hard information” (such as credit scores) for\nloan types where the bank has developed an expertise.\nIn addition to the excellent academic research, the effort on the part of the state banking\ncommissioners to administer a national survey of community banks is proving its value. For\nexample, last year’s survey was cited by the U.S. Government Accountability Office in a report it\nreleased last December on the impact of Dodd-Frank regulations on community banks and\nother financial institutions. The survey was also cited by the White House Council of Economic\nAdvisers in a brief on community bank performance released last month. Further, the survey\nand survey data have been requested by several academic institutions, and I was pleased to see\nthat the data from the 2015 survey was even used in a paper that will be presented during the\nsecond research session of this year’s conference.\nAlthough you’ll have to wait until tomorrow to see the results from the 2016 survey, what you’ll\nlearn is that the findings in the survey and the anecdotal information gathered by the state\nbanking commissioners to supplement and amplify the data will come back to that same core\nprinciple I mentioned earlier:\nStrong banks. Strong communities. Strong economy.\nThere are two other additions to this conference that I’d like to mention before turning the\nconference over to the researchers, the moderator and the community bank discussant in our\nfirst research session.\nThe first is the Community Bank Case Study competition that our partners, the Conference of\nState Bank Supervisors, piloted last year and conducted nationally this year. Encouraging\nstudents at the undergraduate level to develop an understanding and interest in our banking\nsystem, and in community banks specifically, is absolutely essential to the future viability of our\nbanking system. They are our future researchers, policymakers and bankers—the investments\nwe make in them today will pay great dividends.\nAnd I must say, from what I can tell from the winning case study paper prepared by students\nfrom Southeastern Louisiana University and from the incredible personal stories of the students\non the team, the students just might steal the show at this year’s conference. The work of these\nstudents and of all of the students in the competition shows how a single community bank has\nimpacted its community and its region.\n2\n\n\fFinally, I’d like to mention the video montage that you saw when we kicked off the conference\na few moments ago. The montage is comprised of videos from a series titled “Community\nBanking: In Your Community and Beyond Your Community.”\nSince early September, the conference committee has released two of these videos per week in\nthe lead-up to the conference. In the videos, community bankers and state banking\ncommissioners discuss how a single bank can not only motivate a local success, but how that\nsuccess can have impacts well outside the bank’s local community and into the broader\neconomy. In fact, I think Joe Kesler of First Montana Bank in Libby, Montana, who is featured in\none of this year’s videos, put it best when he said:\n“Every day you walk into the bank, you do not know what little loan that you’re making, how it\nmight transform not just that person’s life, but the community and potentially even the nation.”\nI encourage our audience here to develop relationships, too. As Julie mentioned, we\ndeliberately build an audience comprised of researchers, regulators and bankers. I’ve found in\nmy years of attending and sponsoring conferences that some of the best discussions take place\nduring networking breaks, and I understand that some great relationships have already been\nbuilt through these proceedings the past three years.\nI look forward to another great conference this year. I thank you all for joining us either here in\nperson or via our interactive webcast and look forward to seeing how the discussions here can\nhelp foster a stronger banking and regulatory system, leading to stronger communities and\nultimately leading to a stronger economy.\n\n3\n\n\f"

The old narrative assumed that the\neconomy is converging to a single, long-run steady state,\nwith key macroeconomic variables tending toward an\naverage of their past values. In the new narrative, the\nconcept of a single, long-run steady state is abandoned.\nInstead, there is a set of possible “regimes” that the\neconomy may visit, which are generally viewed as\npersistent. While switches between regimes are possible,\nthey are not forecastable. Bullard said that the projected\npolicy rate path is the main difference in the new approach:\nThe policy rate under the old narrative would likely rise over\nthe forecast horizon to be consistent with its steady-state\nvalue, whereas the policy rate under the new narrative\nwould likely remain essentially at over the forecast\nhorizon to remain consistent with the current regime.\nPresentation (pdf) | Press Release\n\nJames Bullard\nPresident and Chief\nExecutive O cer\nBio\nCurriculum Vitae\nStaff Contacts\nIDEAS/RePEc Pro le\nPhotos\nVideos\nSubscribe:\nEmail alerts\nRSS\n\"Rationally, let it be said in a\nwhisper, experience is certainly\nworth more than theory.\"\nAmerigo Vespucci\n\nGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\nCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\n\n\fEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\nOn the Economy Blog\nOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\nLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\nBridges\nEconomic Synopses\nHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.

Under this regime,\nthe appropriate policy rate path would be 0.63\npercent over the forecast horizon.\nFor the longer run, the new approach does not\ncontain forecasts for macroeconomic variables or\nthe policy rate, as predicting exactly how and when a\nregime will change is di cult. The best path today is\nto forecast that the current regime will persist and set\nappropriate policy for this regime.\nFull text of remarks:\nA New Characterization of the U.S. Macroeconomic and\nMonetary Policy Outlook1\nJames Bullard\nPresident and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nSociety of Business Economists\nAnnual Dinner\nLondon, United Kingdom\n\nOverview\nOn June 17, 2016, before the Brexit vote, the Federal\nReserve Bank of St. Louis announced an important change\nin its characterization of the U.S. macroeconomic and\nmonetary policy outlook. In my speech tonight, I plan to\ndiscuss this changed characterization in somewhat more\ndetail.\nThe St. Louis Fed had been using an older narrative since\nthe nancial crisis ended. That narrative has now likely\noutlived its usefulness, and so it is being replaced by a new\nnarrative. The hallmark of the new narrative is to think of\nmedium- and longer-term macroeconomic outcomes in\nterms of regimes. In this new narrative, the concept of a\nsingle, long-run steady state to which the economy is\nconverging is abandoned, and is replaced by a set of\npossible regimes that the economy may visit. Regimes are\ngenerally viewed as persistent, and optimal monetary\npolicy is viewed as regime dependent. Switches between\nregimes are viewed as not forecastable.\nThe upshot is that the new approach delivers a very simple\nforecast of U.S. macroeconomic outcomes over the next\ntwo and a half years. Over this horizon, the forecast is for\nreal output growth of 2 percent, an unemployment rate of\n4.7 percent, and trimmed-mean personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE) in ation2 of 2 percent. In light of this\nnew approach and the associated forecast, the appropriate\nregime-dependent policy rate path is 63 basis points over\nthe forecast horizon.3\n\n\fI will explain how and why the St. Louis Fed has come to\nthis new approach, as well as the key fundamentals of our\nnew view. Later, I will describe how the essentially at\ncharacterization of the recommended policy rate path\ncould be upset by switches in fundamental factors in the\nfuture.\nBefore I delve further into this new narrative, I would like to\ngive you some background on the slow and steady\nevolution of my thinking since last December.\nAs you may recall, I was an advocate of a policy rate\nincrease in December 2015. However, with the nancial\nmarket turmoil that prevailed early in 2016, it appeared that\nmarkets perhaps took our 25-basis-point move as much\nlarger than we intended—essentially as a 25-basis-point\nmove plus another 100 basis points for 2016, as suggested\nby the Summary of Economic Projections. When some of\nthe data in the U.S. came in a little weaker in early 2016, I\nstarted to think that perhaps the liftoff had a larger effect\nthan we thought. This spring, data came in a little stronger,\nopening us to the possibility of a June or July move.\nHowever, as I re ected on the general trend in the data—in\nparticular, the slowdown in real output growth over the last\nyear—it became clear to me that we could no longer count\non the usual cyclical dynamics. It no longer made sense to\nsubmit a forecast of output growing above trend,\nunemployment continuing to decline, in ation rising above\ntarget, and the policy rate increasing at a fairly steep pace.\nWe needed to rethink our approach to forecasting.\n\nWhy now?\nNow is a good time to consider a regime-based conception\nof medium- and longer-term macroeconomic outcomes for\nthe U.S. Key macroeconomic variables including real\noutput growth, the unemployment rate, and in ation appear\nto be at or near values that are likely to persist over the\nforecast horizon. Any further cyclical adjustment is likely to\nbe relatively minor. Therefore, I think of the current values\nfor those key variables as being close to the mean\noutcome of the “current regime.”\nOf course, the situation can and will change in the future,\nbut exactly how and when is di cult to predict. Therefore,\nthe best that we can do today is to forecast that the current\nregime will persist and set policy appropriately for this\nregime. If there is a switch to a new regime in the future,\nthen that will likely affect all variables—including the policy\nrate—but such a switch is not forecastable.\nConsistent with the regime-based concept, the new\napproach does not contain projected long-run values for\nmacroeconomic variables or for the policy rate. That is, the\nforecast simply stops at two and a half years.\nI do not think of the current regime as pessimistic. Output\ngrows at the trend pace of 2 percent, but the\n\n\funemployment rate remains quite low, and in ation\nremains at 2 percent. In addition, as I will describe below,\noutput growth could improve if productivity growth\nimproves.\n\nThe previous narrative\nThe St. Louis Fed’s previous narrative emphasized eventual\nconvergence to a single, long-run steady state. In that\nnarrative, in the medium term, the output growth rate was\nconsistently forecast to be above trend and the\nunemployment rate was forecast to decline. In ation (net\nof commodity-price effects) was forecast to return to and\nthen exceed 2 percent over the medium term. The policy\nrate was forecast to eventually rise in order to be\nconsistent with the single, long-run steady state.\nSome aspects of this previous narrative worked well. From\nthe third quarter of 2013 through the second quarter of\n2015, a period of two years, the average quarterly real GDP\ngrowth rate was 2.7 percent, well above our estimate of a\ntrend rate of 2 percent. The unemployment rate declined\nfrom 7.3 percent in July 2013 to 5.3 percent as of July\n2015. In ation, however, barely moved. The trimmed-mean\nPCE in ation rate was 1.56 percent in July 2013 and had\nonly increased to 1.64 percent as of July 2015.\nIn the last year, the usefulness of this narrative may have\ncome to an end. The average quarterly real GDP growth\nrate from the third quarter of 2015 through the present\nquarter (using a tracking estimate for the second quarter\nof 20164) is about 1.7 percent, somewhat below our\nestimate of trend. The unemployment rate is currently at\n4.7 percent. It may not fall much further, considering that\nduring the last expansion, the average unemployment rate\nfrom January 2006 to December 2007 was about 4.6\npercent. Trimmed-mean in ation, at 1.84 percent, is now\ncloser to 2 percent but has not been rising rapidly.\nOn balance, real output growth, the unemployment rate,\nand in ation may be at or near mean values that could be\nsustained over the forecast horizon provided there are no\nmajor shocks to the economy. We seek to describe this\nsituation in the new narrative we are adopting.\nFigures 1, 2, and 3 summarize the data on output growth,\nunemployment, and in ation along with the new St. Louis\nFed projections that assume the U.S. economy will remain\nin the current regime. (all gures are below)\n\nMultiple productivity regimes\nWith our new narrative, we are backing off the idea that we\nhave dogmatic certainty about where the U.S. economy is\nheaded in the medium and longer run. We are trying to\nreplace that certainty with a manageable expression of the\nuncertainty surrounding medium- and longer-run\noutcomes. By doing so, we hope to provide a better\n\n\fdescription of the nature of the data dependence of\nmonetary policy going forward.\nFundamental factors determine the nature of the regimes\nin play. One important fundamental is productivity growth.\nThe productivity growth rate has been low on average at\nleast since 2011. We think of this as a low productivity\ngrowth regime. We know from past observation of the U.S.\neconomy that productivity could switch to a higher-growth\nregime. If such a switch occurred, it might have important\neffects on many variables, but especially on output growth,\nwhich would be higher.\nBecause we view the low productivity growth regime as\nvery persistent, for the purpose of forecasting we simply\nassume we will remain in the low productivity growth\nregime (and hence the low output growth regime) through\nthe forecast horizon. The idea that productivity may switch\nto a high-growth regime is not incorporated in the forecast\ndirectly, but it is an upside risk to the forecast. The switch\nto the high-growth regime is viewed as possible, but not\nforecastable.\nFigure 4 shows the recent data on productivity in the U.S.\nHowever, simply having high and low productivity growth\nregimes is insu cient to describe the current\nmacroeconomic situation. There are at least two other\nfundamental factors that have to remain in their current\nstate in order to maintain the status quo. We now turn to\ndescribing these.\n\nMultiple real rate regimes\nOne important fundamental is the real rate of return on\nshort-term government debt. This is very low today by\nrecent historical standards, perhaps less than -1 percent. In\nour framework, we view this as a low real rate regime. The\nalternative regime, which has been observed historically, is\nfor a considerably higher value of this rate. Again, we view\nthe current low real rate regime as very persistent, and so\nfor the purpose of forecasting, we simply assume we will\nremain in the low real rate regime through the forecast\nhorizon. A switch to the higher real rate regime is possible,\nand if it occurred would likely affect many variables in the\nsystem, including the appropriate policy rate. The\npossibility of such a switch does not enter directly in the\nforecast; instead, it is a risk to the forecast.\nWhile the real return to short-term government debt is low\ntoday, the real return to capital does not appear to have\ndeclined meaningfully.5 For this reason we prefer to\ninterpret the low real rate of return on short-term\ngovernment debt not as re ecting low real returns\nthroughout the economy (as in a simple New Keynesian\nmodel), but instead as re ecting an abnormally large\nliquidity premium on government debt.6 It is this liquidity\npremium which is the fundamental factor. We sometimes\n\n\frefer to this conception of the low value of the real return\non short-term government debt as r† (“r-dagger”) to\ndistinguish it from the more commonly discussed r* (“rstar”).7\nFigure 5 shows the recent data on ex-post real returns on\nshort-term (i.e., one year) U.S. government debt. This\ncalculation can be viewed as a way to smooth out readings\non real returns over the last several years.\n\nThe state of the business cycle\nAnother important fundamental is the possibility of\nrecession, perhaps driven in part by a collapse in asset\nprices (as occurred for housing prices during 2006-2009)\nor other factors. We are currently in a no-recession state,\nbut it is possible that we could switch to a recession state.\nIf such a switch occurred, all variables would be affected,\nbut most notably, the unemployment rate would rise\nsubstantially. Again, the possibility of such a switch does\nnot enter directly into the forecast because we have no\nreason to forecast a recession given the data available\ntoday. The possibility of recession is instead a risk to the\nforecast.8\nFigure 6 shows that the current recession probability is\nabout 3 percent from a published empirical model.9\n\nThe policy rate path\nI have described a very basic set of fundamental factors as\nfollowing regime-switching stochastic processes. The\ncurrent con guration is: (a) low growth, (b) low real rate,\nand (c) no recession. Conditional on this con guration, our\nforecast is for real output growth of 2 percent, an\nunemployment rate of 4.7 percent, and trimmed-mean\nin ation of 2 percent over the two and a half year forecast\nhorizon.\nThe associated recommended policy rate path supporting\nthis outcome is regime dependent. I have already argued\nthat the unemployment and in ation gaps are essentially\nzero. The value of 63 basis points for the policy rate could\ntherefore be viewed in terms of a Taylor-type policy rule in\nwhich the gaps terms are zero. The Taylor-type rule would\nthen collapse to a Fisher equation. Let’s consider a oneyear Fisher equation with expected in ation at 2 percent.\nThe value of the real rate in the low real-return regime on\nshort-term government debt, r†, would have to be the value\nthat would solve this equation. This value is -137 basis\npoints. This is very close to, and hence consistent with, the\nvalue of r† described in Figure 5 (-142 basis points).\nFigure 7 shows the projected regime-dependent policy rate\npath through the end of 2018.\n\nRisks to the forecast\n\n\fThere are risks to this forecast in the sense that any of\nthese fundamental factors could switch to alternative\nvalues, thus knocking the system out of the current regime.\nPolicy would then have to react.\nThere are other risks to this projection that do not neatly t\ninto the description I have outlined.\nOne key risk not expressed in the regime-switching part of\nthe description is on in ation. I have described a situation\nin which Phillips curve effects on in ation are negligible.\nLow unemployment and generally strong labor markets,\ndespite being in place throughout the forecast horizon, do\nnot put upward pressure on in ation in the forecast I have\ndescribed. It could be that meaningful Phillips curve\neffects return and drive in ation higher even though\nnothing else about the situation as I describe it has\nchanged.\nA second key risk is that this projection says little about\nincoming data on in ation expectations, which according\nto market-based measures seem to be too low to be\nconsistent with the forecast I am describing.\nA third key risk is that the approach presented here says\nlittle about asset price bubbles, a factor that often enters\nthe actual policy discussion.\n\nA schematic diagram\nFigure 8 provides a schematic diagram of the new\nnarrative. We can start on the left side of the diagram with\nthe question, “What is a reasonable forecast for real output\ngrowth, the unemployment rate, and in ation over the next\ntwo and a half years?” First, we have no reason based on\ncurrent data to forecast a recession, so we adopt a “norecession” baseline scenario. Next, we assume that the\nvery large liquidity premium on short-term government\ndebt will remain in place over the forecast horizon, the low\nr† regime. Moving further to the right, we assume that the\nlow-productivity regime will remain in place over the\nforecast horizon. These considerations lead to the baseline\nforecast at the right on the diagram. As I have explained,\nwe recognize that regimes could switch, and this is the\narea labelled “upside risk” in the diagram. Policy is regime\ndependent—it is set to be consistent with the current\nregime.\n\nConclusion\nThe forecast values for output growth, in ation, and the\nunemployment rate in the new St. Louis Fed forecast are\nonly somewhat different from those given under the\nprevious narrative. The main difference in the new\napproach is in the characterization of recommended future\nmonetary policy via the projected policy rate. In the\nprevious narrative, we had a medium- and long-run\noutcome for the economy expressed in terms of a single,\nlong-run steady state. In that formulation, all variables\n\n\ftrended toward values that were consistent with the\nassumed long-run outcome. This includes the policy rate,\nwhich trended toward a value 350 basis points higher than\nit is today. If the Federal Open Market Committee moved at\na pace of 25 basis points per year, it would take 14 years to\nreach such a value.\nIn the new narrative, uncertainty about possible mediumand longer-run outcomes is more explicitly taken into\naccount. The economy does not necessarily converge to a\nsingle steady state, but instead may visit many possible\nregimes. Regimes can be persistent, as we think the\ncurrent one may be. The timing of a switch to an\nalternative regime is viewed as not forecastable, and so we\nsimply forecast that the current regime will persist. Policy\nis regime dependent, leading to a recommended policy rate\npath which is essentially at over the forecast horizon. Of\ncourse, the at policy rate characterization is conditional\non no switches occurring—if a switch does occur, then the\npolicy rate would have to change appropriately. This is a\nform of data dependence.\nI have described some of the risks to this forecast, and\ntaking these risks into account I think that, on balance, the\npolicy rate path may be somewhat higher than the one we\nare forecasting over the next two and a half years. In this\nsense I think there is some upside risk to our forecast.\nNevertheless, by describing the expected policy path as\nessentially at with some upside risk—and with no\npresumption about a long-run outcome—I hope I can\nprovide a better description of my view of the current policy\nsituation in this narrative as opposed to the previous\nformulation.\nEndnotes\n1\n\nThis speech is based on a paper that was released June\n\n17, 2016.

        "content": "Welcoming Remarks by James Bullard, President and CEO\nThe 2016 Homer Jones Memorial Lecture\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nApril 6, 2016\nWelcome to the Homer Jones Memorial Lecture.\nThe opening of the major league baseball season is an opportunity for fans to view with wide\nwonder the possibilities of future glory. Yet, the splendor of opening day notwithstanding, we\nall know in our hearts that for some teams, a pessimistic outlook will likely provide a better\nmatch to actual results. The hard reality of error-prone fielders, poor hitting and down-themiddle pitching can add up to a lot of losses before the All-Star break, leading fans of some\nteams to sigh and say, “Wait until next year.”\nIn many ways, “Wait until next year” has been a motto for the U.S. economy since the financial\ncrisis of 2007-09. Professional forecasters, monetary and fiscal policymakers, as well as Wall\nStreet analysts and traders, have been predicting each year since then a return to halcyon days\nin the U.S., only to be disappointed by the time the All-Star break rolls around. Although labor\nmarkets have shown dramatic improvement, U.S. real economic growth has remained\nstubbornly low. Many economists have lowered their assessment of the longer-term real GDP\ngrowth rate in the U.S. to 2 percent or less, as opposed to the 3 percent or more that might\nonce have been expected for the world’s largest economy.\nWhat is it that has caused this relative losing streak? Is it something that can be fixed with a\nnew power hitter, perhaps, or a left-handed relief pitcher who can get timely outs in the late\ninnings of a game? Or is it, like the Chicago Cubs, a situation that requires a total revamp of the\nentire approach to the game?\nToday’s speaker will likely offer some thoughts on this matter.\nThis is the 27th Homer Jones Memorial Lecture. This lecture series, which began in 1986 shortly\nafter Homer’s death, honors the contributions and legacy of a former Research director at the\nSt. Louis Fed. The series, much like the vaunted St. Louis-based Energizer Bunny, has persisted,\nin large part because of the past support of many organizations and people—several of whom\nare in this audience or who represent some of the institutions that were vital in the lecture\nseries’ long run. These include the St. Louis Gateway Chapter of the National Association for\nBusiness Economics, Saint Louis University, Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, the\n\n\fUniversity of Missouri at St. Louis and Washington University in St. Louis.\nHomer Jones is often described as “Milton Friedman’s teacher.” Jones taught Friedman when\nFriedman was an undergraduate at Rutgers University in the early 1930s. Jones had gone to\nRutgers after studying at the University of Chicago, where he was a student of legendary\nChicago professor Frank Knight. Friedman wasn’t the only person at Rutgers during Homer’s\ntime there to go on to become a well-known economist—the Rutgers economics faculty also\nincluded future Fed Chairman Arthur Burns. 1\nAccording to Friedman, Jones was one of the primary influences in Friedman’s choice to study\neconomics, as opposed to mathematics or statistics. In Friedman’s 1976 reminiscence, he says\nJones opened his eyes “to the broader reaches of economics and to the beauties and intricacies\nof economic theory.” 2 They remained lifelong friends, eventually teaming up to oppose the high\ninflation monetary policy of the Burns era.\nIn 1958, Homer Jones joined the St. Louis Fed. He is remembered for many contributions to the\nBank, but his role in the Bank’s development as a leader in monetary research and statistics\nstands out. Jones was a pioneer, perhaps the pioneer, within the Fed in developing the concept\nof independent research departments at the Reserve banks. This development, which\nsubsequently spread across the Federal Reserve System, has been invaluable to the Fed over\nthe years. The Fed’s ability to absorb and be open to multiple viewpoints helps prevent\ngroupthink and leads to superior monetary policy and ultimately to better macroeconomic\nperformance.\nToday, the St. Louis Fed is a leader in the public dissemination of economic data. Many of my\ncurrent and previous colleagues, building upon the legacy of Homer Jones, have designed and\nintroduced Bank products like FRED, mobile FRED, ALFRED, GeoFRED, CASSIDI, FRASER and\nIDEAS. Underlying all of these products is the core belief that underpinned Homer’s initial\ninnovative efforts: to keep the public better informed about its central bank and the U.S.\neconomy, and to provide accurate, timely data for economic researchers. Like Homer, we are\nalways striving to innovate—so stay tuned for some future St. Louis Fed acronym!\nThis year’s speaker is Lawrence H. Summers.\nSome of you may have heard of him!\nDr. Summers is the Charles W. Eliot University Professor and President Emeritus at Harvard\nUniversity. He served as the 71st Secretary of the United States Treasury for President Clinton\nand the Director of the National Economic Council for President Obama. Currently, Dr.\n1\n\nSee Friedman, Milton. “Homer Jones: A Personal Reminiscence.” Journal of Monetary Economics, November\n1976, 2(4), pp. 433-6.\n2\nFriedman (1976).\n\n\fSummers directs Harvard University’s Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government.\nDr. Summers was the first social scientist to receive the National Science Foundation’s Alan\nWaterman Award for scientific achievement. In 1993, he was awarded the John Bates Clark\nMedal, which is given to the most outstanding economist under 40 in the United States. He was\nelected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2002. He has published more than 150 papers in\nscholarly journals and maintains an active presence as a public intellectual.\nPlease join me in welcoming Dr. Larry Summers.\n\n\f"
