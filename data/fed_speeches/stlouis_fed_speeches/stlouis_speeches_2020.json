He said that flexible average inflation targeting takes into account more\nexplicitly the effective lower bound and its impact on actual inflation outcomes. This new\nstrategy would allow policymakers to make up for past misses on inflation, he said.\nBullard discussed other elements of the review, including the Federal Open Market\nCommittee’s emphasizing that the Fed’s employment goal is broad and inclusive of everybody\nin the economy; revised language that says the FOMC would worry only about shortfalls,\ninstead of “deviations,” of employment from full employment; and better description of the\nrole of financial stability in FOMC deliberations.\nDuring the panel discussion, he addressed questions related to overshooting the inflation\ntarget, additional actions the Fed could take should more be needed, and the U.S. Treasury\nyield curve.\nThe video for the event can be found here.\n\nFOLLOW US\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2020/bullard-discusses-feds-monetary-policy-framework\n\n1/2\n\n\f12/21/22, 5:41 PM\n\nBullard Discusses Fed’s Monetary Policy Framework during Virtual Panel | James Bullard | St. Louis Fed\n\nSIGN UP FOR EMAIL ALERTS\nReceive updates in your inbox as soon as new content is published on our website\nSIGN UP\nQUICK LINKS\nAbout Us\nLegal Information\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nCareers\nDoing Business with the Fed\nEvents\nFederal Reserve Services\nVisiting the St. Louis Fed\nFederal Banking Regulations\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2020/bullard-discusses-feds-monetary-policy-framework\n\n2/2\n\n\f",

While in�ation has mostly been below target since 2012, he said the U.S.\nmay start to see some in�ation in the future from several sources.\nBullard also discussed the increase in federal debt as a result of pandemic relief to\nhouseholds and businesses, Fed actions aimed at keeping the U.S. out of a �nancial crisis on\ntop of the pandemic, and continued adjustments made by businesses to provide their\nproducts and services safely.\nHaving trouble with the video?

He also outlined a scenario for how to stabilize the economy\nby the end of the year.\nBullard noted that the U.S. economy surprised to the upside in May and June, but that he\nwould expect less upside surprise with July data. However, the basic story that April was way\ndown and that May and June came back is encouraging and is something to build on in\ntrying to stabilize the economy, he said.\nHe also talked about how the economy is continuing to adapt to the new mortality risk posed\nby COVID-19, and about the use of some basic risk mitigation strategies.

He also spoke about the importance of an inclusive economy and promoting\nracial economic equity.\n“A more inclusive economy is a stronger economy, and the work of the St. Louis Fed must\nhelp to root out institutional racism and other inequities that systematically create economic\nbarriers,” Bullard said.\nHe cited research from the St. Louis Fed’s Center for Household Financial Stability, which\nhas consistently found that Black families in the U.S. have about 10 cents for every dollar in\n\n\fwealth held by white families—a gap that has been virtually unchanged for at least three\ndecades. The Center’s research suggests that structural and historical factors continue to\nsuppress the ability of Black Americans to accumulate wealth, Bullard noted.\n“Accordingly, to promote racial economic equity, we as a nation must also consider\nstructural or institutional responses,” he said. “While the St. Louis Fed has undertaken\nsigni�cant research and initiatives on this front, our work must continue in earnest. It’s\nwelcome news that many organizations are doing the same.”\nTurning to the pandemic, Bullard noted that the primary economic impact will be in the\nsecond quarter of 2020, when the U.S. economy was intentionally slowed down to invest in\npublic health.\nHe said that the set of health, �scal and monetary policies that has been put in place has\nbeen a good response and a good mitigator of the initial shock from the pandemic, but can’t\nbe maintained inde�nitely.\n“There is really no pause button for the U.S. economy, and attempts to go on too long with\nthis set of policies would risk �nancial crisis or depression or both,” Bullard said, adding that\nhealth and economic outcomes would be worse in that scenario.\n“The risks are signi�cant, but my base case is that all of that will be avoided and that we will\nget a robust recovery in the second half of the year,” he said.\nGoing forward, Bullard said that new risk mitigators will be put in place to control the\ndisease while also allowing production of goods and services and restoration of household\nincome. This would be a better policy overall because it would lead to fewer fatalities and\nmore household income, he noted.\nHe discussed two approaches for mitigating the health risk: ubiquitous testing, which would\nsolve the information problem by allowing people to know where the disease is; and riskbased stay at home, whereby people make their own decisions based on their risk from\nCOVID-19.\nHaving trouble with the video?

He also\ndiscussed the labor market and in�ation during a webinar that was part of the Milken\nInstitute Summer Series.\nDespite the second quarter being the worst quarter of all time from an economic growth\nperspective, quarterly output looks like it will be 90% of what would be produced in a normal\nquarter, Bullard said. He attributed this to people working from home and the ability of\nessential businesses to adapt.\n\"I think the bulk of the economy will be able to get back to the production levels that they\n\n\fwere at,\" he said. However, he added that it's a different world with a new mortality risk in\nthe economy that isn't going away in the near term. \"We're going to have to adapt and learn\nto cope with it as best we can and mitigate the risk to the most vulnerable individuals as best\nwe can,\" he said.\nBullard noted that one of the goals of the current situation is to stay out of a �nancial crisis,\nand another is to stay out of a depression.\n\"If you get into the depression scenario, the health outcomes and the economic outcomes\nwill be worse. I think that's really why we should all be motivated to think about how we can\nstay out of that situation,\" he said.\nAddressing a question about making monetary policy that's aimed at racial justice, Bullard\nsaid that ideally unemployment would be as low as possible nationwide with no statistical\ndifferences in unemployment rates across racial and ethnic groups. He noted that Black and\nHispanic unemployment rates have consistently been higher than white unemployment\nrates in the postwar era, but that the gaps were narrowing coming into this crisis.\nSome of the economics literature on this topic suggests that one of the best things that can be\ndone for racial equality and racial justice is to keep economic expansion going for a long\ntime, Bullard said.\n\"That's very much tied to our mandate from Congress, and we certainly try to carry that out\nas best we can,\" he said.\nHe also talked about in�ation, which has generally been below the Fed's 2% in�ation target\nin recent years.\n\"We've got a lot of very aggressive monetary policy and �scal policy in place to respond to\nthis crisis,\" Bullard said. \"I'm hopeful that we can get a pretty robust recovery in the second\nhalf here and that in�ation will actually come up to our 2% target.\"\nHaving trouble with the video?

He spoke during a Shadow Open\nMarket Committee (SOMC) virtual conference with Chapman University. The SOMC is an\nindependent organization that discusses economic policy.\nThe shutdown policy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic was appropriate initially when\nlittle was known about the disease, but cannot be maintained over a longer period of time,\nBullard said. If massive business failures occur, we’ll face depression risk, �nancial crisis\nrisk, or both, he said, adding that we want to stay out of those situations.\nAs we learn more about the disease, the economy will “adopt a more granular risk-based\napproach to disease management,” he said.\nBullard discussed two approaches: “ubiquitous” testing, which includes testing not just\nthose who are sick; and “risk-based” stay at home, where those who have different levels of\nrisk from the disease will protect themselves differently. A lot of those adjustments already\nare occurring, Bullard said, and will continue through the third quarter, at which point most\nof the easiest and simplest adaptations will have been made by �rms and households.\n“The end of the third quarter will be an important checkpoint for where we are in the crisis,”\nhe said.\nAs the days and weeks go by, more is learned about the nature of the mortality risk and how\nit can be mitigated, as well as how goods and services can be provided safely, Bullard said.\nRisk mitigation can be undertaken at the individual level and at the �rm level, he said.\n“The result will likely be higher output, as well as less fatalities than the economy initially\nexperienced during the March-April 2020 time frame,” he said.\nBullard also answered questions about prospects for the U.S. economic recovery, the policy\n\n\fresponses during this crisis compared with those during the 2007-09 �nancial crisis, the\nrisks of a higher federal debt-to-GDP ratio, and more.\n\n\f",

LOUIS FED\n\n00:00:00\n/ 01:02:20\nPresident30Jim Bullard,\nCD Howe\nInstitute Webinar30\nMay 27, 2020\n\nSt. Louis Fed President James Bullard shared his views on the partial-shutdown policy that\nhas been in place for the U.S. economy as an investment in national health. He also\ndiscussed two ways to solve the crisis from the COVID-19 pandemic. He spoke during a C.D.\nHowe Institute webinar.\nBullard said that the shutdown policy was appropriate initially, but that continuing it too long\nwould risk a �nancial crisis and would risk depression.\nHe then talked about two solutions to the crisis, which he said are happening to some degree\nalready—ubiquitous testing and a risk-based stay-at-home approach. He added that both\neconomic and health outcomes would be better using those two solutions than under the\nshutdown policy.\nBullard said the testing would solve an information problem, allowing people to know where\nthe virus was at all times. A highly productive economy that would also have very low\nfatalities from COVID-19 would result, he added.\nA risk-based stay-at-home approach would rely on data on who is being affected by the\ndisease, Bullard explained. He suggested using other mortality risks, such as from accidental\ninjuries, to size the mortality risk from COVID-19. Based on current projections, he said, the\nrisk posed by COVID-19 would be slightly less than the risk posed by accidental injury for\n2020.\nHe also said calibrating the risk could be done by age, which would suggest that younger\npeople would probably go to work, while older people would probably stay home, he\nexplained.\n\n\f“And because of that, you’d get more output, and you’d get very limited fatalities, as long as\nthe elderly population stayed away from infection,” Bullard said.\n\n\f",

He spoke on a virtual panel hosted\nby the Of�cial Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF).\nBullard said that going through the 2007-09 �nancial crisis prepared the Fed well to respond\nto the economic shock due to the health crisis. He noted that the Fed’s relatively quick\nresponse to this shock was to use 13(3) lending programs (authorized under that section of\nthe Federal Reserve Act) and provide liquidity to �nancial markets.\n“As far as the initial wave, I think the response has been much faster than it was in the\nprevious crisis, and that has served us very well in terms of market liquidity, preventing this\nfrom morphing into a �nancial crisis, at least so far,” he said.\nBullard also spoke about the shutdown policy, cautioning against continuing it for too long.\n\n\f“We cannot hit the pause button for very long in major economies around the world, and\ncertainly not in the U.S.,” he said, adding that there may be a 90- or 120-day shelf life on the\npolicy. After that, the shutdown policy can’t continue because too much will start to happen,\nhe said. “You’ll get business failures on a grand scale, and you’ll be taking risk that you’d go\ninto depression.”\nThe shutdown policy was rational at the beginning, when the pandemic caught everybody by\nsurprise and it was necessary to get the disease under control, he said. But it is a blankettype policy, he explained. “I think we have to get away from the shutdown policy and toward\nsomething that is more about risk mitigation,” Bullard said.\nIn terms of his economic outlook, he said that he expects a large decline in GDP in the\nsecond quarter for the U.S., followed by very positive growth in the third quarter.\nDuring the webinar, Bullard also discussed pandemic relief for disrupted workers and\nbusinesses, negative interest rates, the Fed’s balance sheet, the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio,\nin�ation risk, the Federal Reserve’s policy framework review, the future of central banking,\nand more.\nHaving trouble with the video?

He noted that the task at hand is to put the economy\non pause and ask people to stay home in order to invest in national health.\nHe reiterated his view that the main disruption in the U.S. economy will be in the second\nquarter. \"I do think we have a better chance of a swift recovery given this shock than others\nthat we have seen in the past if we manage the situation carefully and we continue to keep\nour wits about us as we move through, day by day, the pandemic threat,\" he said.\nBullard said that one goal during the shutdown period is to provide support to the �nancial\nsector to avoid having a �nancial crisis in addition to a pandemic crisis. \"I think that the Fed\n\n\fhas intervened effectively in �nancial markets in order to maintain market functioning,\" he\nsaid. \"I think we can do more, but I think weâ€™ve done probably the most obvious steps so\nfar.\"\nAnother goal during this period is to support the real economy, which the FOMC did right\naway by lowering the policy rate to zero, Bullard noted. He added that the �scal response has\nalso been aggressive in trying to compensate those who are being asked to pause in their\nbusinesses and their work, which is helping mitigate the risk of the crisis morphing into a\nvery serious and long-lasting depression.\nBullard noted that the general-pause situation is OK right now, but it cannot be maintained\nfor long. \"I think the shutdown policy was appropriate to handle the initial surprise of the\npandemic, but keeping the shutdown in place in the same way that we have it now as a\nblanket policy will cause too many problems longer term,\" he said, adding that he expects to\nsee a more risk-based and granular policy going forward.\nIn terms of ending the crisis, Bullard suggested putting resources toward technology that is\navailable, mainly testing. From an economic point of view, \"what we really have is an\ninformation problem\" in that people don't know where the virus is, he explained.\nHaving trouble with the video? Watch it here.\n\n\f",

He\nspoke at a webinar, \"The World Economy Transformed: Re�ections on Policy Responses and\nthe Future Post Pandemic Monetary Architecture.\" The Chamber of Digital Commerce,\nReinventing Bretton Woods Committee, and Accenture hosted the event.\nBullard said that he thinks the main economic impact will occur in the second quarter of\n2020, which he has suggested calling a \"pandemic adjustment period.\" He said that \"the\nnumbers coming out of the second quarter will be not comparable to anything we've seen in\nU.S. macroeconomic history.\" Comparing the time with other periods in the past is\nmisleading \"in thinking about how the economy might be able to behave going forward,\" he\nsaid.\nBullard also suggested that this is a time when economists have to come up with solutions\n\n\fthat will end this crisis and put the U.S. and global economy back on �rm footing.\nTo that end, he talked about the importance of ramping up testing for the virus. He proposed\nusing some of the dollars being spent on the crisis to pay the costs of production of tests for\nany entity that wants to produce them. The tests would be sold on an open competitive\nmarket. This would create a pop-up industry and lead to a glut of tests, Bullard noted.\n\"The reason I like this is because it doesn't count on a miracle happening,\" he said. \"It counts\non existing technology, but it's all about trying to scale up that technology and create a gold\nrush in the production of tests—not just in the U.S. but globally—and that would end the\ncrisis.\"\nBullard also discussed the Federal Reserve's response and the �scal response to the\npandemic.

Making tests for the disease widely\navailable to people would be the surest route, he said.\n\"We can't test them at the scale we would like to, but widespread testing of everybody in the\neconomy would put an end to this crisis,\" Bullard said.\nIf the U.S. is producing about half the normal output of $5 trillion per quarter [about $2.5\ntrillion], a rough guess is that the quarantine is costing $25 billion a day in lost household\nincome, Bullard said. That's only sustainable for a little while, he said.\n\"After a while you have to think about how you want to manage risk,\" Bullard said. \"We\nmanage all kinds of risks—health risks and other risks—to the economy, and we're going to\nhave to do that as well for COVID-19.\"\n\n\fBullard also spoke about the Federal Reserve's policies and programs to address the\neconomic effects from the pandemic, including addressing liquidity problems in many\nsegments of �nancial markets. \"I think the spirit of the times is to maintain market\nfunctioning through this crisis,\" he said.\nDuring the moderated Q&A, Bullard shared his views on the outlook for unemployment and\nthe economy as well as other topics. Asked if the economy would come back in a \"V\" shape—\nwith the sharp decline followed by a quick and strong recovery—he said there was no reason\nthe economy couldn't come back that way.\n\"It can happen if this is managed appropriately, if you make sure everyone is comfortable\nand able to pay their bills through the second quarter, if you can get the virus under control,\"\nBullard said, but added that there is a lot of uncertainty around the virus.\nHaving trouble with the video?

Cochrane is a senior fellow of the Hoover Institution at\nStanford University. He is known in part for his economic and public policy news and views\nblog, “The Grumpy Economist,” and also for his �scal and monetary policy research. During\nhis lecture, he discussed “Strategic review and beyond: Rethinking monetary policy and\nindependence.”\nFull text of remarks:\nPrepared Welcoming Remarks1\nJames Bullard\nPresident and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nThe 2020 Homer Jones Memorial Lecture\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nMarch 4, 2020\nWelcome to the 30th Homer Jones Memorial Lecture.\nThe Homer Jones Memorial Lecture—one of the Bank’s signature events—honors the lasting\nlegacy of a former research director.\nThe �rst lecture was given in 1987, shortly after Homer Jones’ death. The lecture has\npersisted, in large part, because of the past support of many organizations and people. These\nhave included Saint Louis University, Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, the\nUniversity of Missouri-St. Louis and Washington University in St. Louis. For the past several\nyears, the lecture series has been a joint collaboration between the St. Louis Gateway\nChapter of the National Association for Business Economics and the Federal Reserve Bank of\n\n\fSt. Louis.\nIn the early 1930s, Homer Jones taught at Rutgers University. Arthur Burns, a future\nchairman of the Fed in the 1970s, was also at Rutgers at the time. If you have attended this\nlecture before, you undoubtedly remember that Milton Friedman was a student of Homer’s\nat Rutgers University. Homer encouraged Friedman to pursue a graduate degree in\neconomics. Milton would do so and eventually ended up at the University of Chicago. Homer\neventually landed at the St. Louis Fed.\nDuring his time as research director, Homer Jones presided over the rise of monetary and\nmacroeconomic research at the Bank. His two-pronged approach—rigorous research using\neconomic and monetary data and the dissemination of those data—played no small part in\nthe Keynesian-Monetarist debates in the 1960s and 1970s.\nAfter Jones retired, a distinguished group of monetary economists—including Nobel\nLaureate Milton Friedman—published a series of articles praising him and the imprint he left\non economics, monetary policy and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. This compendium\nwas published in a 1976 issue of the Journal of Monetary Economics.\nThe St. Louis Fed’s tradition of rigorous economic research and data dissemination\ncontinues today. For example, last year there were a little more than 13 million visits to the\nBank’s FRED and family set of databases.\nAn enduring quality of time is that it has an element of forgetfulness. This can be a blessing\nor a curse. In his time and place, Homer Jones �gured prominently in the KeynesianMonetarist debates. Over time, though, debates are settled—the Monetarists won, by the\nway!—and new strains of research are developed that spawn other debates. The regrettable\nresult is that �gures from the past and their timeless contributions tend to fade.\nThe annual renewal of this lecture is our attempt to commemorate the legacy of Homer\nJones—while, at the same time, honoring those who speak with authority on the challenges of\ntoday’s economic problems.\nThis year’s speaker is Dr. John H. Cochrane. He speaks with authority and knowledge about\nmany of today’s economic issues.\nCochrane is the Rose-Marie and Jack Anderson Senior Fellow of the Hoover Institution at\nStanford University. Before going to Hoover, Cochrane was the AQR Capital Management\nDistinguished Service Professor of Finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of\nBusiness.\nHis monetary economics publications include articles on monetary policy and the �scal\ntheory of the price level. His �nance publications include the book Asset Pricing and articles\n\n\fon dynamics in stock and bond markets, the volatility of exchange rates, the term structure\nof interest rates, the returns to venture capital, liquidity premiums in stock prices, the\nrelation between stock prices and business cycles, and option pricing when investors can’t\nperfectly hedge. He has also written articles on macroeconomics, health insurance, timeseries econometrics, �nancial regulation and other topics. He writes occasional op-eds,\nmostly in the Wall Street Journal, and blogs as “The Grumpy Economist.” His most recent\ninnovation is the “Grumpy Economist” podcast.\nHaving known John for many years, I can assure you that while at times he may be grumpy,\nhe will by no means leave you sleepy!\nDr. Cochrane will present: “Strategic review and beyond: Rethinking monetary policy and\nindependence.”\nPlease join me in welcoming Dr. Cochrane.\n1Any opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily re�ect those of the Federal\n\nOpen Market Committee.\n\n\f",

S. Marshals Museum, which is scheduled to open in\n2021. The museum will tell the history of the 230-year-old U.S. Marshals Service, the nation’s\noldest federal law enforcement agency.\nBullard also visited ArcBest, a freight and logistics company, and met with members of the\nFort Smith Regional Council, a group of area leaders who are focused on economic\ndevelopment.\nBullard meets regularly with business and civic groups in the four zones that make up the St.\nLouis Fed’s District to share insight on the U.S. economy, as well as gather views from Main\nStreet.

Another question is whether interest-sensitive sectors in the U.S. will\nrespond to the 2019 change in U.S. monetary policy, Bullard pointed out. And the third\nquestion is whether the coronavirus outbreak in China is likely to be contained as other viral\noutbreaks have been, he noted. “The answer to all three questions is, ‘Let’s wait and see,’” he\nsaid.\n\nFOLLOW US\n\nSIGN UP FOR EMAIL ALERTS\nReceive updates in your inbox as soon as new content is published on our website\nSIGN UP\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2020/can-fomc-achieve-soft-landing\n\n1/2\n\n\f12/21/22, 5:42 PM\n\nCan the FOMC Achieve a Soft Landing in 2020? | James Bullard | St. Louis Fed\n\nQUICK LINKS\nAbout Us\nLegal Information\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nCareers\nDoing Business with the Fed\nEvents\nFederal Reserve Services\nVisiting the St. Louis Fed\nFederal Banking Regulations\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2020/can-fomc-achieve-soft-landing\n\n2/2\n\n\f",

He noted that global trade policy uncertainty is\nlikely to remain high over the medium term, but firms are now adjusting business strategies to\nremain profitable in the face of this uncertainty. Regarding the intensification of geopolitical\nrisk, he said this may mean higher oil prices, but the ultimate impact of that on the U.S.\neconomy may be approximately neutral given lower oil intensity and higher production in the\nU.S. than historical levels.\n\nHaving trouble with the video?
