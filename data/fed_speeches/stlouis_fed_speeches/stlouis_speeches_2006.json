        "content": "Responding to Financial Crises:\nWhat Role for the Fed?\nPanel Discussion\nCato Institute 24th Annual Monetary Conference\nWashington, D.C.\nNovember 16, 2006\n\nI\n\nam delighted to return to Cato, an organization with which I feel a natural affinity,\nespecially through Bill Niskanen with\nwhom I served as a member of the Council\nof Economic Advisers a quarter century ago.\nThat sounds like a long time ago, and I guess it\nwas. However, when it comes to the subject of\nthis panel, I do not think much has changed. The\nkey issue then, as today, is time inconsistency.\nIt seems to make sense in the middle of a financial crisis for someone to bail out a failing firm\nor firms. However, the inconsistency is that,\nhowever sensible a bailout seems in the heat of\ncrisis, bailouts rarely make sense as a standard\nelement of policy. The reason is simple: Firms,\nexpecting aid if they end up in trouble, hold too\nlittle capital and take too many risks. As every\neconomist understands, a policy of bailing out\nfailing firms will increase the number of financial\ncrises and the number of bailouts. Along the way,\nthe policy also encourages inefficient riskmanagement decisions by firms.\nIn writing the previous paragraph, I at first\nbegan by saying, “Everyone knows that a policy\nof bailouts will increase their number.” But here\nwe are in Washington, and a cursory examination\nof federal policy proves that not everyone knows.\nFederal disaster relief policy is exhibit A, but\nevery company, financial or otherwise, knows\nthat if it gets into trouble it is at least worth a\nmajor effort to attempt to secure a bailout because\nthere is always a significant probability of success. Given this state of affairs, in place for many\ndecades despite economists’ pleadings, I think\n\nthe most important issue is not reflected in the\ntitle of this panel—what to do in the event of\nfinancial crisis—but instead how to avoid financial crisis in the first place.\nBefore proceeding, I want to emphasize that\nthe views I express here are mine and do not\nnecessarily reflect official positions of the Federal\nReserve System. I thank my colleagues at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for their comments, especially Robert H. Rasche, senior vice\npresident and director of Research and William\nR. Emmons, senior economist. However, I retain\nfull responsibility for errors.\n\nAVOIDING FINANCIAL CRISIS\nDeposit insurance and a broader, fuzzy, safety\nnet for financial firms creates an incentive for\nfirms to take too much risk and hold too little\ncapital. That is a fact of life. I believe that we\nshould continue to seek reforms to the deposit\ninsurance system. I am particularly fond of proposals that would establish a formal policy of\n“haircutting” the insurance coverage to, say, 90\npercent of insured liabilities and/or requiring that\ninsured financial institutions issue explicitly\nuninsured long-term subordinated debt. Such\nreforms would administer a healthy dose of market discipline to financial firms. But until such\nreforms are put in place, I do not see any other\noption than maintaining substantial supervisory\noversight of large, systemically important financial institutions. The supervisors need to have\n1\n\n\fFINANCIAL MARKETS\n\nthe authority to require adequate capital and\nmaintenance of robust risk-management policies\nin financial firms.\nI believe that supervisory oversight is in\npretty good shape, with one glaring exception.\nGovernment-sponsored enterprises are not adequately capitalized and the supervisory powers\nof the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise\nOversight (OHFEO) are inadequate. I’ll concentrate on the housing GSEs—Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac. This is a topic I’ve addressed several\ntimes in the past (Poole, 2003 and 2004) and I’ll\nnot repeat those arguments in any detail here.\nAlthough the GSEs are not formally insured by\nthe federal government, the market clearly\nbelieves that they are effectively backstopped.\nAs I’ve emphasized before, the Federal Reserve\ndoes not have the legal authority to bail out a\ntroubled GSE. The Fed can provide liquidity\nsupport through its discount window, but only\nindirectly through collateralized loans to banks\nthat would then bear the credit risk of making\nloans to a troubled firm. Under emergency conditions, the Fed does have the authority to make\nloans directly to a GSE, but the loans must be\nfully collateralized. The Fed is obviously disinclined to use its emergency powers to lend to\nfirms other than banks; despite numerous financial upsets over the years, the Fed has not used\nthis authority since the 1930s.\nGiven the obvious moral hazard facing the\nGSEs, the first best solution would be to turn the\nGSEs into fully private firms subject to normal\nmarket disciplines and with no special connection to the federal government. Absent that step,\nwhat supervisory policy actions could reduce\nthe threat they pose to financial stability? The\ntwo items of highest priority are, first, that the\nGSEs’ portfolios should be limited in both scope\nand scale to assets with a clear public purpose;\nand, second, capital at the GSEs should be higher—\nsubstantially higher. As I have argued before, the\n\ncapital standards applied to the GSEs are simply\ninconsistent with the interest rate risks the firms\nhave assumed. It does not make sense for public\npolicy to permit GSEs to hold far less capital than\nrequired in large banks given that GSEs have\nsubstantially similar or even greater risks than\nlarge banks.\nFinally, Congress should create a prompt\ncorrective action (PCA) policy regime for the\nGSEs that truly mimics the one that was introduced into U.S. banking law 15 years ago.1 The\nidea behind PCA is simple—if a regulated firm\nholds only a small buffer of capital to protect the\nfirm’s debt holders from loss, it is critically important that the firm face immediate and increasingly\nstringent restrictions on its activities as its capital\ndwindles. Otherwise, an undercapitalized firm\nexperiences even stronger incentives to exploit\nits unpriced real or perceived guarantees.\nThe PCA regime is well established for banks\nbut the situation for the housing GSEs is not so\nclear. Unfortunately, OFHEO did not publish a\nfinal rule implementing its version of PCA until\n2002, and even now OFHEO lacks the legal authority to impose the ultimate PCA sanction on a\ncritically undercapitalized GSE, namely, closure\nof the institution and appointment of a receiver.\nThus, the promise of PCA for reducing risks to\nfinancial stability posed by the GSEs remains\nunfulfilled. New legislation should provide the\nGSEs’ supervisor with clear and credible receivership authority. Carried out faithfully, a distressed\nGSE would be subject to a PCA regime of phased\nearly intervention (including prompt closure, if\nwarranted) and required recapitalization.2\nThe PCA regime has a major advantage for\nregulators in that they are instructed by law not\nto engage in regulatory forbearance, the source of\nsome of the problems that eventually led to the\ncollapse of numerous savings institutions in the\n1980s and early 1990s. The only way to deal with\ntime inconsistency is to make bailouts unlikely\n\n1\n\nThe statutory authority for prompt corrective action applied to depository institutions is found in the 1991 Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) at 12 USC 18310; for the GSEs, it is in the 1992 Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and\nSoundness Act (FHEFSSA) at 12 USC 4611 through 4623.\n\n2\n\nFor evidence that the PCA regime has been effective in minimizing the FDIC’s losses at banks, see Aggarwal and Jacques (1998).\n\n2\n\n\fResponding to Financial Crises: What Role for the Fed?\n\nby tying the hands of regulators. Taking away the\npower to provide a bailout permits regulators to\nput more pressure on firms earlier. Moreover, in\nthe absence of regulatory discretion, firms know\nthat a bailout requires a successful approach\ndirectly to Congress, which might or might not\nbe successful. Uncertainty over congressional\naction adds to market discipline.\nThe Fed’s role in contributing to general\nfinancial stability through a policy of maintaining\nprice stability is also important. Historically,\nperiods of restrictive monetary policy designed\nto bring inflation down have often been accompanied by failures of many financial and other\nfirms. The Fed also contributes to general financial stability by cushioning disturbances to\nemployment and output. The Fed cannot make\nthe economy recession-proof but it can reduce\nthe severity of recessions.\nSome have argued that the Fed’s success in\nstabilizing inflation at a relatively low level and\nmoderating recessions during the period since\nthe early Volcker years has actually made the\nfinancial system less stable. The argument is that\na more stable economy reduces risk and makes\nfinancial firms more willing to pursue risky\nstrategies, just as flood-control projects actually\nincrease flood losses by encouraging people to\nbuild on flood plains. Eventually, a large flood\noverwhelms the defenses, the floodplain is inundated and those who thought it safe to build on\nthe flood plain suffer large losses.\nI believe that there is an important difference\nbetween flood control experience and the effect of\ngreater macroeconomic stability. Macroeconomic\nstability does not eliminate risk from microeconomic adjustments. In our vigorously competitive\neconomy, one firm can take market share from\nanother, creating risks and opportunities for both\nfirms, without affecting aggregate economic\nactivity. Diversification across firms can reduce\nportfolio risk for individual investors without\naffecting the incentives individual competitive\nfirms have to manage their risks appropriately.\nIn fact, reducing macroeconomic risk, such\nas risk from currency instability through counterfeiting or generalized inflation, permits firms to\n\nconcentrate on managing their own inherent\nbusiness risks more effectively. In the flood control case, individuals and firms make mistakes\nbecause of poor estimates of flood risks and the\nexpectation of compensation should there be a\nflood. Unlike that case, firms’ responses to a more\nstable macroeconomic environment improve\nproductivity because they concentrate on business risks they can affect rather than on macroeconomic risks beyond their control. I know of\nno convincing arguments that the Fed could\nimprove productivity and growth by deliberately\nintroducing random disturbances to the economy.\nIf that point is accepted, then the converse must\nalso be true—reducing macroeconomic instability\nimproves economic efficiency. Of course, there\nis an important corollary: If the Fed fails to maintain price stability after achieving it and creating\nexpectations of its permanence, then the disruption to the economy from renewed inflation will\nbe considerable precisely because firms ceased\nto plan for such an event. Unlike the situation\nwith natural variability of rainfall, however, inflation is controllable and not inevitable.\n\nDEALING WITH FINANCIAL\nUPSETS\nNow for the topic of the panel. What should\nthe Fed do when financial instability strikes?\nIn most cases, nothing. The important principle here is support for the market mechanism\nrather than support for individual firms. The Fed\nhas, appropriately, permitted many highly visible\nfirms to fail without any attempt to provide support, or even any particular comment except to\nsay that it does not intend to intervene.\nOf course, the Fed has intervened from time\nto time. One important case was the provision of\nadditional liquidity and moral support to the\nmarkets when the stock market crashed in 1987.\nThe Fed also provided support to the market at\nthe time of the near failure of Long Term Capital\nManagement in 1998. In both cases the Fed cut\nthe federal funds rate, which provided evidence\nto the markets that the Fed was on the job and\n3\n\n\fFINANCIAL MARKETS\n\nprepared to provide extra liquidity as needed. I\nrealize that the Fed’s presence in the negotiations for additional financial support for LTCM\nfrom other firms is controversial; I would simply\nemphasize that the Fed itself did not provide any\nfinancial support and, in my opinion, would not\nhave done so if the effort to encourage support\nfrom other firms had failed.\nSome observers have viewed the large expansion of hedge funds as a rising danger to financial\nstability, requiring additional regulation and Fed\nreadiness to intervene. I myself believe the dangers\nof systemic problems from hedge fund failures\nare vastly overrated. The hedge fund industry is\nindeed large but it is also highly diverse and\ncompetitive. Many and perhaps most of the large\npositions taken by individual firms have other\nhedge funds on the opposite side of the transactions. I trust normal market mechanisms to handle\nany problems that might arise.\nThe Fed has not had to face the issue of a\npotential large bank failure since enactment of\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\nImprovement Act (FDICIA) in 1991. I believe that\nthe correct principle is that no bank is too large\nto fail, although a bank may certainly be too large\nto liquidate quickly. As already noted, the Fed\ncan provide liquidity support but cannot provide\ncapital to prop up a failing firm. Ultimately, the\nonly source of capital from the federal government, absent new legislation, is from the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corp.\nA very interesting case arose with the terrorist attacks on 9/11. Thinking back to my academic\nyears before coming to St. Louis, I recall no discussion or journal articles analyzing the possibility that the payments system might crash because\nof physical destruction. But that is what nearly\nhappened, because the Bank of New York, a major\nclearing bank, was disabled when the twin towers\ncame down. Moreover, trading closed in the U.S.\nTreasury and equity markets, and banks were\nunable to transfer funds because the Bank of New\nYork was not functioning. With normal sources\nof liquidity shut down, many banks faced the\nprospect of being unable to meet their obligations.\nThe Fed’s provision of funds through the dis4\n\ncount window and in other ways prevented a\ncascading of defaults around the world. No private entity would have been able to provide liquidity on such a massive scale.\nI do not know what a totally unanticipated\nfuture systemic shock might be but am sure that\nthe Fed needs to be ready to respond, and to some\nextent, invent the appropriate response on the\nfly to a currently unimaginable shock. That is\nsurely what a central bank is for, among other\nthings. At the same time, a great reluctance to\nintervene will serve the economy well in the\nlong run.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nI can summarize my position very succinctly.\nThe Fed has a responsibility above all to maintain\nprice stability and general macroeconomic stability to reduce the likelihood of economic conditions that would be conducive to financial\ninstability. Included in this responsibility is provision of advice to Congress on needed legislative\naction to deal with possible risks. The largest of\nthese risks on my radar screen arises from the\nthin capital positions maintained by governmentsponsored enterprises and the ambiguity of\nwhether Congress would or would not act to bail\nout a troubled firm. The time to deal with potential financial instability caused by structural weaknesses of the GSEs and their regulatory regime is\nbefore instability strikes. The steps I outlined\nearlier would go a long way to improve prospects\nfor sustained financial stability in coming years.\nAlthough prevention is the most important\nof the Fed’s responsibilities, without question the\nFed needs to be prepared to provide liquidity\nsupport should markets be in danger of ceasing\nto function. We know a lot about this subject and\nhave in place deep contingency arrangements to\nassure that the Fed itself will remain operational\nat all times. I do not see any way that these functions could be privatized; I believe the markets\ndo have confidence that the Fed has necessary\nlegal authority and the internal strength to act as\nnecessary. That said, the Fed’s reluctance to act\nis also an important element of strength.\n\n\fResponding to Financial Crises: What Role for the Fed?\n\nREFERENCES\nAggarwal, Raj and Jacques, Kevin T. “Assessing the\nImpact of Prompt Corrective Action on Bank\nCapital and Risk.” Federal Reserve Bank of New\nYork Economic Policy Review, October 1998,\npp. 23-32.\nPoole, William. “Housing in the Macroeconomy.”\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, May/June\n2003, 85(3), pp. 1-8.\nPoole, William. “The Risks of the Federal Housing\nEnterprises’ Uncertain Status,” in Federal Reserve\nBank of Chicago, Proceedings: 40th Annual\nConference on Bank Structure and Competition.\nPanel on Government Sponsored Enterprises and\nTheir Future.

        "content": "U.S. Labor Input in Coming Years\nChartered Financial Analysts Society of Philadelphia\nWilmington, Delaware\nNovember 14, 2006\n\nA\n\nmajor issue facing the U.S. economy\nin coming years, and facing those of\nus who have to try to understand the\nevolution of the economy, is the probable growth rate of labor input. The issue arises\nbecause the first wave of the baby-boom generation is now beginning to retire. If those reaching\nretirement age in the near future retire at the\nsame rate as those reaching retirement age over\nthe past ten years or so, then labor force growth\nwill decline dramatically. In this case, the number of those retiring will almost match the number of young persons plus immigrants entering\nthe labor force. In that case, the U.S. labor force\nwill grow only very slowly. Conversely, with\nonly a relatively small change in retirement patterns, labor force growth could be substantially\nhigher than suggested by retirement patterns\nobserved in the recent past. Estimates of labor\nforce growth for coming years—even as soon as\nnext year—by various experts differ by a factor\nof two. That is an enormous discrepancy.\nLabor force growth matters for a number of\nreasons. The trend of total GDP growth is determined by the trend of hours worked and growth\nof output per hour, or productivity. The growth\nof government revenues, including revenues flowing into the Social Security and Medicare systems,\ndepends centrally on the growth of total national\noutput. In the context of short-run business cycle\nanalysis, we in the Federal Reserve will have to\nreach judgments about whether observed employment growth is outrunning, or falling short, of\nlabor force growth. I’ll return to some of the\nimplications of uncertainty over labor force\ngrowth in my concluding remarks.\n\nBefore proceeding, I want to emphasize that\nthe views I express here are mine and do not\nnecessarily reflect official positions of the Federal\nReserve System. I thank my colleagues at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for their comments, especially Christopher Wheeler, senior\neconomist in the Research Division, who provided\nspecial assistance. However, I retain full responsibility for errors.\n\nTHE FRAMEWORK\nEconomists analyze trends in total labor input\nby examining components of the total. We typically start with population growth. Then, we\nexamine the fraction of the population at work\nor seeking work. The sum of those employed\nand those unemployed is the labor force. The\nparticipation rate is the fraction, usually expressed\nas a percentage, of the labor force in the population. The next step is to examine the split of the\nlabor force between employment and unemployment. Finally, we need to examine the behavior\nof average hours of work of those employed. This\nanalytical framework provides a way to study\nchanges over time in the total hours of labor input\nin the economy.\nOf these various analytical components,\npopulation growth and fluctuations in the labor\nforce participation rate are quantitatively most\nimportant for understanding changes in total\nhours of labor input over a span of a few years or\nmore. However, fluctuations in the unemployment\nrate are particularly important for understanding\nbusiness cycle fluctuations lasting a few quarters\nor a year or two. We also know that when business\n1\n\n\fECONOMIC GROWTH\n\nconditions turn soft, labor force participation\ndeclines. Some who lose their jobs drop out of\nthe labor force rather than continue to look\nactively for work. In the reports compiled by the\nBureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), active job search\nis required for a person not working to be classified as unemployed rather than not in the labor\nforce.\nGiven the dramatic changes that are ahead of\nus as the baby-boom generation begins to retire,\nit makes sense to look closely at issues surrounding likely future labor force participation.\nThe total labor force participation rate is\nmeasured each month by the BLS as the fraction\nof the civilian, non-institutional population aged\n16 years or older who are either working or\nactively seeking work. The participation rate\nprovides a sense of how engaged in work the\nU.S. population is. High levels indicate that a\nlarge fraction of the adult population is either\nsituated in a job or is looking for one. We can\ninterpret a high rate of participation, therefore,\nas an indication that the potential supply of labor\nis large relative to the size of the working-age\npopulation.\nLabor force participation in the United States\nhas shown two striking trends over the past 50\nyears: a long-run increase in the decades following World War II and a significant decline over the\npast six years. It is this latter trend, the decline,\nthat has attracted so much attention among economists recently, in part because it represents a\nsignificant break with the past and in part because\nthere are potentially significant long-run consequences associated with it. With a decreasing\nfraction of the adult population engaged in work,\nour economy will have fewer individuals producing income and output relative to the total\nnumber of residents in the country. In this case,\nthe output of each worker will have to sustain the\nconsumption of a larger number of individuals.\nImproving on, or even simply maintaining, our\nper capita standard of living, therefore, will\nbecome a more difficult goal to achieve in the\nface of declining labor force participation.\n2\n\nTRENDS IN LABOR FORCE\nPARTICIPATION\nTo begin the analysis, consider how participation rates have evolved in the United States over\nthe past half century. The BLS has compiled\nmonthly statistics on labor force participation\ndating back to 1948. These figures are based on a\nsurvey that at present covers approximately\n60,000 households.\nWhat is by far the most noticeable trend in\nthese statistics is the overall increase in the participation rate since 1948. In January of 1948,\nthe overall rate of labor force participation in the\nUnited States was roughly 59 percent. This figure\nheld steady until the early 1960s, when it began\nto rise, reaching 61 percent in 1975, 65 percent\nin 1985, and just over 66 percent in 1995. During\nthe first quarter of 2000, the labor force participation rate reached its highest level in the history\nof the series, hitting 67.3 percent of the workingage population.\nOver the past six years, however, there has\nbeen a notable decrease. Labor force participation dropped from 67.3 percent in early 2000 to\n65.8 percent in the first quarter of 2005. It has\nsince risen to just over 66 percent. The most recent\nfigure available at the time of this writing—that\nfor October of 2006—was 66.2 percent. In absolute\nterms, this 1 percentage point drop in the participation rate since 2000 corresponds to a decrease\nin the size of the labor force of more than 2 million individuals relative to what it otherwise\nwould have been.\n\nSOME EXPLANATIONS\nHow do we explain these trends, both the\nincrease between 1965 and 2000, and the decrease\nthereafter? Most of the increase in labor force\nparticipation after 1960 can be attributed to the\ngrowing presence of women in the labor market.\nIn 1950, roughly one in three women 16 years\nof age or older participated in the labor force.\nBy 1998, nearly 60 percent did. Although this\nincrease occurred in most age groups, it was par-\n\n\fU.S. Labor Input in Coming Years\n\nticularly pronounced among women between\nthe ages of 25 and 54; that is, women in the socalled “prime” working years. Among these\nwomen, the rate of participation rose from less\nthan 40 percent in 1950 to more than 75 percent\nby the end of the 1990s.1\nAs many economists have observed, this\nincrease in women’s participation has been the\nproduct of several elements. The improvement\nin household technologies simplified many daily\ntasks, such as cooking and cleaning, thereby\ngiving those responsible for carrying them out\ngreater time to pursue other activities, including\nwork outside of the home (Hotchkiss, 2005).\nMedical advances provided women with greater\ncontrol over their child-bearing decisions, allowing them to focus to a greater extent on education\nand the pursuit of a career (Goldin, 2004). Evolving social norms also made it more acceptable\nfor women to delay marriage and concentrate on\nboth schooling and work, to work while married\nand to work while raising small children\n(Aaronson et al., 2006). Such changes also opened\ndoors to careers in fields such as business, law\nand medicine, as well as increased levels of compensation, both in absolute terms and relative to\nthe earnings of men (Goldin, 2004).\nThe participation of men in the labor force,\nin contrast, has shown a gradual decrease in the\nlast half century, dropping from more than 85\npercent in 1948 to less than 75 percent today. As\nwith the rise in female participation rates, there\nare likely many reasons for the decline in men’s\nlabor force participation. The creation of the\nSocial Security System in 1935, the rise in the\nprovision of private pensions following the\nRevenue Act of 1942 and greater generosity in\ndisability insurance, for example, may have\nencouraged men to retire earlier (Hotchkiss, 2005).\nThe drop in men’s participation may also be tied\nto the rise in women’s participation if married\ncouples view men’s and women’s labor market\nactivity as substitutes. A cynic might say that\nwomen increased their labor force participation\nso men can retire early.\n1\n\nOf course, the fact that the overall rate of participation increased during the latter half of the\n20th century indicates that the rise in women’s\nparticipation greatly outweighed the decline\namong men. When viewed from this perspective,\nthe rise in female labor force participation was a\ncrucial aspect of the rise in overall labor input\nand, thus, the rapid expansion of the U.S. economy during the latter half of the 20th century.\nThe second and more distressing trend in the\nparticipation rate is the significant decline since\nthe first quarter of 2000. Recall that in the past\nsix years, the participation rate has dropped by\nroughly one percentage point, implying a decrease\nin the size of the labor force of approximately 2\nmillion workers. To be sure, some of this turnaround can be linked to the recession of 2001.\nEconomists have long observed that labor force\nparticipation tends to be procyclical: it decreases\nwhen the economy weakens and increases when\nit strengthens.\nHowever, the persistent decrease in the participation rate during the economic recovery\nsince 2001 has led many economists to believe\nthat there are longer-run, structural changes at\nplay. The most salient of these changes is the\naging of the U.S. labor force associated with the\nbaby-boom generation. This group, born between\n1946 and 1964, has been estimated to comprise\nroughly 78 million individuals and, consequently,\nrepresents more than a third of the adult noninstitutional population. In 2000, boomers were\nbetween the ages of 36 and 54—an age range with\na particularly high rate of labor force participation. In 2000, approximately 92 percent of men\nand 77 percent of women in this age category\nparticipated in the labor market (Toossi, 2005).\nIn addition to the expanding U.S. economy during\nthe 1990s, this demographic feature of the labor\nforce likely contributed to the peaking of the\nparticipation rate at this time.\nHowever, after 2000 the baby-boom generation began to move into age categories with substantially lower rates of labor force participation.\nRecent participation rates among men 55 to 59\n\nThese figures are derived from the Bureau of Labor Statistics: http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2000/feb/wk3/art03.htm.\n\n3\n\n\fECONOMIC GROWTH\n\nyears of age, a group into which the boomers\nbecame increasingly represented between 2001\nand 2006, averaged 77 percent while the participation rate for women was 66 percent (Aaronson\net al., 2006). As individuals age beyond 60, participation rates typically fall even further.\nThe aging of the baby-boom generation, however, only represents one part of the recent decline\nin labor force participation. A sizable part of the\ndecline can be attributed to changes in the behavior of workers at the opposite end of the age distribution: teens. Between 2000 and 2003, labor\nforce participation among workers between the\nages of 16 and 19 dropped by 7.5 percentage\npoints. Since that time, there has been no tendency for teen participation to rebound, and\ncurrent rates are hovering around 44 percent\n(Aaronson, Park and Sullivan, 2006).\nEconomists looking into this trend have\nidentified a number of possible explanations,\nand most begin, once again, with the 2001 recession. Because teen workers have a somewhat\ntenuous connection to the labor market, they are\nparticularly sensitive to economic downturns. It\nis, therefore, not surprising that their participation rates dropped off significantly as the U.S.\neconomy entered recession in 2001.\nThe fact that the number of teens in the labor\nforce has not rebounded in spite of the recovery\nover the past 5 years, however, suggests that there\nare longer-run, structural factors beneath this\ndecline. The downward trend in teen participation since the late 1970s further supports this\nnotion. As it turns out, there appears to be one\nparticularly important reason for this change:\neducation.\nIn 1987, the percentage of individuals\nbetween 16 and 19 years of age who were enrolled\nin school was roughly 61 percent but rose to 73\npercent in 2005. This is a very substantial increase\nand by comparing 2005 with 1987, years with\nsimilar overall labor market conditions, the\nincrease is not distorted by different cyclical\nconditions in the labor market. In part, the surge\nin school enrollment can be linked to the increase\nin the economic return to schooling since the\nlate 1970s, particularly the payoff associated with\n4\n\na college degree. Yet, it may also derive from the\nexpansion of educational opportunities, particularly at the post-secondary level (Aaronson, Park\nand Sullivan, 2006) as well as the evolution of\nsocial norms that place a greater emphasis on\nschooling than in years past.\n\nTHE FUTURE OF LABOR FORCE\nPARTICIPATION\nWhat do these trends in labor force participation imply about the future of U.S. labor supply\nand about the prospects for continued growth in\nour collective standard of living?\nThe aging of the population, of course, should\ncontinue to decrease aggregate labor force participation, and therefore, the potential supply of\nlabor in the United States. As I mentioned before,\nthe baby-boom cohort began to enter the 55-andolder age category back in 2001, indicating that\nthe fraction of workers beyond their prime working years will steadily rise in the years ahead. A\nBLS study projects that over the next eight years\nthe fraction of individuals over the age of 55 will\nrise to more than one third of the adult population\nfrom a level of 29 percent today (Toossi, 2005).\nThe Census Bureau projects this figure to rise to\nmore than 38 percent by 2030. On the other hand,\nthe fraction of the population in prime working\nyears—that is, between 25 and 54—is projected\nto decrease from approximately 53 percent today\nto 51 percent by 2014 and 45 percent by 2030.\nGiven the lower participation rates among\nolder workers, these trends suggest that the fraction of the U.S. population either working or\nlooking for a job will decrease in the coming\ndecades. In 2005, the participation rate among\nmen aged 55 to 59 was more than 77 percent.\nAmong men 10 years older, 65 to 69, the rate was\nless than half this figure: 33.5 percent. For men\n70 and older, the participation rate was only 13.5\npercent (Aaronson et al., 2006). Assuming that\nthis general pattern of participation continues to\nhold, the aging of the U.S. population will necessarily produce further declines in potential\nlabor supply.\n\n\fU.S. Labor Input in Coming Years\n\nOf course, participation rates need not remain\nat current levels. In fact, there are a number of\nreasons to expect participation rates among older\nworkers to rise somewhat in the coming years.\nFirst, the age at which workers may draw full\nbenefits from Social Security is, under current\nlaw, increasing. The full retirement age is 65 for\nindividuals born in 1937 or earlier, 66 for those\nborn between 1943 and 1954, and 67 for individuals born in 1960 or later. Furthermore, workers\nwho choose to delay retirement until age 70 are\neligible for higher benefits. Social Security benefits used to be reduced when a person receiving\nbenefits also had earned income, but that tax-like\nprovision has been eliminated. These provisions\nin the law, taken together, may encourage some\nworkers to retire later than has been true of those\nreaching retirement age in the recent past. However, it remains to be seen how large the effect\nmight be.\nSecond, the rate at which Social Security\nbenefits are growing has slowed, particularly\nwhen compared with the decades prior to the\nmid-1980s. According to data from the Social\nSecurity Administration, real average monthly\nbenefits rose by 88 percent between 1965 and\n1985. Between 1985 and 2004, they increased by\n23 percent.2 Social Security benefits today represent a substantial fraction of the average household’s retirement income—indeed, Social Security\nbenefits represent more than half of total income\nfor 65 percent of the beneficiaries (Social Security\nBulletin: Annual Statistical Supplement, 2005).\nGiven this fact, the decreased rate of growth in\nbenefits over time may lead some retirees to supplement their Social Security benefits. Taking a\njob, of course, is one possible option. Reaching\nretirement age may not necessarily mean retirement. Some may seek another career, or partial\nretirement.\nA third development that could increase the\nlabor force participation rate among older workers is increased life expectancy. Since 1970, life\n\nexpectancy for 65-year-olds in the United States\nhas risen by nearly four years for men and three\nyears for women.3 With greater numbers of productive years, individuals may decide to lengthen\ntheir careers.\nFourth, older workers may choose to remain\nemployed longer to maintain health insurance\ncoverage. Surveys by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational\nTrust have suggested that the fraction of firms\noffering retiree health insurance to their workers\ndecreased by one half between 1988 and 2005\n(Aaronson et al., 2006). Because workers, in general, do not qualify for Medicare until age 65,\nthis development may also encourage workers to\ndelay retirement until age 65.\nIndeed, we may have already seen some of\nthe effects of these changes. Among all age groups,\nonly that for workers 55 years of age or older has\nshown a significant increase in participation\nsince 2000.\nNevertheless, it is almost certain that we will\nsee a decrease in the growth of total labor supply\nover the next several decades. Even though we\nmight reasonably project increases in participation\namong older Americans, rates of participation\namong those 55 years of age and older will still\nbe substantially lower than among individuals\nof prime working age. Hence, as our population\ngrows older, overall participation will decline.\nOn this point, researchers tend to agree. Although\nthe exact projections of organizations such as the\nCongressional Budget Office, the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics and the Social Security Administration\ndiffer, all expect a decline in the participation\nrate in the years ahead.\nOf course, a decline in the rate of participation\ndoes not necessarily imply that either the level\nof, or rate of change in, labor supply itself will\ndecrease, because the U.S. population continues\nto grow. Smaller fractions of a larger total population may still translate into greater absolute\nnumbers of people working over time. Unfortu-\n\n2\n\nThese are derived from the Social Security Bulletin: Annual Statistical Supplement, 2005.\n\n3\n\nThese statistics are derived from the National Center for Health Statistics at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/lifexpec.htm.\n\n5\n\n\fECONOMIC GROWTH\n\nnately, two additional trends are working against\nthis possibility. First, while the U.S. population\nis growing, its rate of growth is likely to slow in\nthe future. Second, for many decades, there has\nbeen a secular decrease in the average weekly\nhours worked by employees in the non-farm U.S.\nbusiness sector, and this decrease is unlikely to\nturn around in coming years (Aaronson et al.,\n2006).\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR THE U.S.\nECONOMY’S FUTURE\nIf these projections hold true, the U.S. economy will face some daunting challenges in the\ncoming decades. In particular, because labor\nrepresents the largest single input in U.S. production, GDP—which measures the total value of\nthe goods and services our economy generates—\nmay begin to exhibit slower rates of growth over\ntime. Because income for the country as a whole\ndepends on production, slower growth in GDP\nand income implies slower growth in consumption of U.S. households. Thus, a decrease in labor\nsupply growth will lead to slower growth in our\nwell-being.\nIn addition, as noted recently by Fed\nChairman Ben Bernanke, a decrease in the fraction of the U.S. population at work will present a\nnumber of fiscal challenges for our government.4\nMost obviously, as the rate of labor income growth\nslows, the growth of tax revenue will also begin\nto diminish, threatening the viability of programs\nsuch as Social Security and Medicare, which have\noutlays that are expected to double as a fraction\nof GDP by 2050, as well as our ability to increase\ndiscretionary spending, including military\nexpenditures.\nHow might we respond to these challenges?\nThe current path of spending and taxation, certainly, can be altered, and suggestions of this type\nhave been offered by many influential writers\nand speakers. We should be open to multiple\n4\n\n6\n\navenues to address the challenges ahead. We\nshould not rule out additional steps to encourage\nthose who might otherwise retire to remain in\nthe labor force longer. And we need to examine\nways to increase productivity—to obtain more\noutput per hour of labor input.\nOur nation’s capital stock—our office buildings, factories and equipment—is like labor, a\nfundamental input into the production of goods\nand services. Increasing our capital stock, therefore, provides a means to boost production in the\nface of declining labor input. Because investment\nin capital depends directly on how much our\neconomy, including our federal government, saves,\nit is in our interest to place greater emphasis on\npolicies that encourage higher rates of saving.\nWe can increase the productivity of working\nindividuals by increasing levels of education\namong our population. Policies aimed at improving the effectiveness of primary and secondary\neducation, curtailing the rate at which students\ndrop out of school and increasing access to postsecondary education, for example, would be\ninstrumental in making our labor force more\nproductive.\nProductivity also depends on developing\nmore efficient production methods; that is, on\nthe creation of new ideas and discoveries through\nresearch. A recent study of long-run trends in\neconomic growth suggests that roughly half of\nthe U.S. economy’s growth during the second\nhalf of the 20th century can be linked to rising\nresearch activity (Jones, 2002). Continued devotion of resources to scientific research, therefore,\nwould help to ensure that our economy continues\nto expand. Translating research into actual production requires that we enhance, where possible,\nentrepreneurial activity by maintaining adequate\nrewards and reducing burdensome regulation\nthat yields more costs than benefits.\nEconomists, of course, have long stressed\nthat productivity growth is the key to rising living\nstandards, and perhaps accordingly, have offered\nsuggestions similar to those I have just outlined.\n\nThese remarks, entitled “The Coming Demographic Transition: Will We Treat Future Generations Fairly?” were given at the Washington\nEconomic Club on October 4, 2006.\n\n\fU.S. Labor Input in Coming Years\n\nI would like to stress, however, that the stakes of\nnot pursuing these types of strategies are likely\nto rise in the years ahead. In the face of an impending slowdown in the growth of our economy’s\nlabor force, productivity growth has become more\ncrucial than ever.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nAlthough the direction of effects from the\naging baby-boom generation on labor force growth\nis clear, the magnitude is not. A paper published\nearlier this year in the Brookings Papers on\nEconomic Activity (Aaronson et al., 2006) contains a summary table reporting four different\nprojections of labor force growth out to 2014 based\non the authors’ model and estimates from the\nCongressional Budget Office, the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics and the Social Security Administration.\nFor 2007, the projections range from a low of 0.6\npercent growth to a high of 1.1 percent growth.\nFor 2014, the projections range from a low of 0.2\npercent to a high of 0.8 percent.\nThe magnitude of these differences is stunning. Based on these projections, if the unemployment rate remains about steady next year we can\nexpect average monthly growth of employment\nranging from a low of about 70,000 to a high of\nabout 120,000. These are rough, rounded off estimates—to provide the estimates any other way\nwould imply a false sense of precision. On the\nsame basis, in 2014, the range is from about\n30,000 to about 100,000 new jobs each month.\nThese are very large differences. Moreover, given\nthat each of the models used to produce these\nestimates is subject to error, in fact the range of\nuncertainty is even greater than the numbers just\nquoted.\nIt is important to digest not only the large\ndifferences in these estimates but also the large\nchange now taking place in the labor market.\nFrom 1996 through 1999, we became accustomed\nto job growth in the neighborhood of 250,000 per\nmonth. In 2004-05, job growth averaged about\n170,000 per month. With the baby-boom genera-\n\ntion starting to retire, we’ll have to change our\nview of normal job creation. Not to do so will\ninvite a serious misperception of the state of the\nlabor market.\nUncertainty over trend labor force growth\nwill complicate the Fed’s job next year. While we\nknow that there is no long-run tradeoff between\ninflation and unemployment, policymakers try\nto maintain an equilibrium in the labor market at\napproximately full employment both because full\nemployment is an important goal and because\navoiding short-run strains in the labor market\nhelps to maintain price stability. If actual employment growth slows, we will have to make the\njudgment as to whether the slowing is consistent\nwith a slowing of trend labor force growth or is\na sign of impending recession. If employment\ngrowth next year remains only modestly below\nthis year’s average pace of about 150,000 per\nmonth, we will have to make the judgment as to\nwhether this growth is outrunning available labor,\nwhich would be the case if we accept the low\nestimate of trend labor force growth, or whether\none of the higher estimates of trend labor force\ngrowth is being realized. To make this judgment,\nwe will have to collate as many different scraps\nof information we can find to supplement the\nstandard labor force statistics released every\nmonth.\nFor many years now economists have been\ndiscussing the long-run implications of retirement\nof the baby-boom generation. And I suspect that\nthose debates will intensify now that the retirement wave is beginning. What we did not expect\nis that there would be so much uncertainty about\nthe size of the wave when it started. The life of\nthe monetary policymaker is always interesting,\nthat is for sure!\n\nREFERENCES\nAaronson, Daniel; Park, Kyung-Hong and Sullivan,\nDaniel. “The Decline in Teen Labor Force\nParticipation.” Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nEconomic Perspectives, 2006, pp. 2-18.\n7\n\n\fECONOMIC GROWTH\n\nAaronson, Stephanie; Fallick, Bruce; Figura, Andrew;\nPingle, Jonathan and Wascher, William. “The Recent\nDecline in the Labor Force Participation Rate and\nIts Implications for Potential Labor Supply.”\nBrookings Papers on Economic Activity, 2006, 1,\npp. 69-154.\nGoldin, Claudia. “From the Valley to the Summit:\nThe Quiet Revolution that Transformed Women’s\nWork.” NBER Working Paper 10335, 2004.\nHotchkiss, Julie. “What’s Up with the Decline in\nFemale Labor Force Participation?” Working Paper\n2005-18, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, 2005.\nJones, Charles I. “Sources of U.S. Economic Growth\nin a World of Ideas.” American Economic Review,\n2002, 92(1), pp. 220-39.\nMunnell, Alicia and Sunden, Annika. “401(k) Plans\nare Still Coming Up Short.” Boston College Center\nfor Retirement Research Brief, March 2006, pp. 1-9.\nToossi, Mitra.”Labor Force Projections to 2014:\nRetiring Boomers.” Monthly Labor Review,\nNovember 2005, pp. 25-44.\n\n8\n\n\f"

The topic is also one I’ve not\naddressed in a speech.\nA personal recollection might be a good place\nto begin. In the early 1960s, in my Ph.D. studies\nat the University of Chicago, I was fortunate to be\na member of Milton Friedman’s Money Workshop.\nFriedman stoked my interest in flexible exchange\nrates, in an era when mainstream thinking was\nfocused on the advantages of fixed exchange rates\nand central banks everywhere were committed\nto maintaining the gold standard. Well, I should\nsay central banks almost everywhere, given that\nCanada had a floating-rate system from 1950 to\n1962. Friedman got me interested in doing my\nPh.D. dissertation on the Canadian experience\nwith a floating exchange rate, and later I did a\npaper on nine other floating rate regimes in the\n1920s. For this paper I collected daily data on\nexchange rates from musty paper records at the\nBoard of Governors in Washington.\nWhat was striking about the debates over\nfloating rates in the 1950s is that economists\nwere so willing to speculate about how currency\nspeculators would destabilize foreign exchange\nmarkets without presenting any evidence to support those views. In this and many other areas,\ncareful empirical research has resolved many\ndisputes. Our profession has come a long way in\ninstitutionalizing empirical approaches to resolving empirical disputes. The enterprise requires\ndata, and what I will discuss is some of the history of the role of the Federal Reserve Bank of\nSt. Louis in providing the data.\n\nBefore proceeding, I want to emphasize that\nthe views I express here are mine and do not\nnecessarily reflect official positions of the Federal\nReserve System. I thank my colleagues at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for their comments. Robert H. Rasche, senior vice president and\ndirector of Research, provided special assistance.\n\nORIGINS\nThe distribution of economic data by the\nResearch Division of the Federal Reserve Bank\nof St. Louis can be traced back at least to May\n1961. At that time, Homer Jones, then director\nof research, sent out a memo with three tables\nattached showing rates of change of the money\nsupply (M1), money supply plus time deposits,\nand money supply plus time deposits plus shortterm government securities. His memo indicated\nthat he “would be glad to hear from anyone who\nthinks such time series have value, concerning\npromising applications or interpretations.”\nRecollections of department employees from\nthat time were that the mailing list was about\n100 addressees.\nApparently Homer received significant positive feedback, since various statistical releases\nemerged from this initial effort. Among these\nwere Weekly Financial Data, subsequently U.S.\nFinancial Data; Bank Reserves and Money, subsequently Monetary Trends; National Economic\nTrends (1967) and International Economic Trends\n(1978), all of which continue to this date. In April\n1989, before a subscription price was imposed, the\n1\n\n\fMISCELLANEOUS\n\ncirculation of U.S. Financial Data had reached\nalmost 45,000. A Business Week article published\nin 1967 commented about Homer that “while most\nleading monetary economists don’t buy his theories, they eagerly subscribe to his numbers.” As\nan aside, as a Chicago Ph.D., I both bought the\ntheories and subscribed to the data publications.\nBy the late 1980s, according to Beryl Sprinkel\n(1987, p. 6), a prominent business economist of\nthe time, “weekly and monthly publications of\nthe Research Division, which have now become\nstandard references for everyone from undergraduates to White House officials, were initially\nHomer’s products.”\nWhy should a central bank distribute data as\na public service? Legend has it that Homer Jones\nviewed as an important part of his mission providing the general public with timely information\nabout the stance of monetary policy. In this sense\nhe was an early proponent, perhaps the earliest\nproponent, of central bank accountability and\ntransparency. While Homer was a dedicated\nmonetarist, and data on monetary aggregates\nhave always figured prominently in St. Louis\nFed data publications, data on other variables\nprominent in the monetary policy debates at the\ntime, including short-term interest rates, excess\nreserves, and borrowings, were included in the\ndata releases.\nEarly on, the various St. Louis Fed data publications incorporated “growth triangles,” which\ntracked growth rates of monetary aggregates over\nvarying horizons. Accompanying graphs of the\naggregates included broken trend lines that illustrated rises and falls in growth rates. This information featured prominently in monetarist critiques\nof “stop-go” and procyclical characteristics of\nmonetary policy during the Great Inflation period.\nDoes the tradition of data distribution initiated\nby Homer Jones remain a valuable public service?\nI certainly believe so. But I will also note that the\nSt. Louis Fed’s data resources are widely used\nwithin the Federal Reserve System. This information is required for Fed research and policy\nanalysis; the extra cost of making the information\navailable also to the general public is modest.\n2\n\nRATIONAL EXPECTATIONS\nMACROECONOMIC EQUILIBRIUM\nThe case for making data readily available is\nsimple. Most macroeconomists today adhere to a\nmodel based on the idea of a rational expectations\nequilibrium. Policymakers are assumed to have\na set of goals, a conception of how the economy\nworks, and information about the current state\nand history of the economy. The private sector\nunderstands, to the extent possible, policymakers’\nviews and has access to the same information\nabout the state and history of the economy as\npolicymakers have.\nAn equilibrium requires a situation in which\n(i) the private sector has a clear understanding of\npolicy goals and the policymakers’ model of the\neconomy and (ii) the policy model of the economy\nis as accurate as economic science permits. Based\non this understanding, market behavior depends\ncentrally on expectations concerning monetary\npolicy and the effects of monetary policy on the\neconomy, including effects on inflation, employment, and financial stability. If the policymakers\nand private market participants do not have views\nthat converge, no stable equilibrium is possible\nbecause expectations as to the behavior of others\nwill be constantly changing.\nThe economy evolves in response to stochastic disturbances of all sorts. The continuous flow\nof new information includes everything that\nhappens—weather disturbances, technological\ndevelopments, routine economic data reports,\nand the like. The core of my policy model is that\nmarket responses and policy responses to new\ninformation are both maximizing—households\nmaximize utility, firms maximize profits, and\npolicymakers maximize their policy welfare\nfunction.\nA critical assumption in this model is the symmetry of the information that is available to both\npolicymakers and private market participants. In\ncases where the policymakers have an informational advantage over market participants, policy\nlikely will not unfold in the way that markets\nexpect, and the equilibrium that I have characterized here will not emerge. Hence, public access\n\n\fData, Data, and Yet More Data\n\nto current information on the economy at low\ncost is a prerequisite to good policy outcomes.\n\nTHE EVOLUTION OF ST. LOUIS\nFED DATA SERVICES\nData services provided by the Federal Reserve\nBank of St. Louis have evolved significantly from\nthe paper publications initiated by Homer Jones.\nThe initial phase of this evolution began in April\n1991 when FRED®, Federal Reserve Economic\nData, was introduced as a dial-up electronic bulletin board. This service was not necessarily low\ncost. For users in the St. Louis area, access was\navailable through a local phone call. For everyone\nelse, long-distance phone charges were incurred.\nNevertheless, within the first month of service,\nusage was recorded from places as wide ranging\nas Taipei, London, and Vancouver.1 FRED was\nrelatively small scale. The initial implementation\nincluded only the data published in U.S. Financial\nData and a few other time series. Subsequently,\nit was expanded to include the data published in\nMonetary Trends, National Economic Trends, and\nInternational Economic Trends. At the end of\n1995, the print versions of these four statistical\npublications contained short histories on approximately 200 national and international variables;\ninitially FRED was of comparable scope.\nThe next step occurred in 1996 when FRED\nmigrated to the World Wide Web. At that point,\n403 national time series became available instantaneously to anyone who had a personal computer\nwith a Web browser. An additional 70 series for\nthe Eighth Federal Reserve District were also available. The data series were in text format and had\nto be copied and pasted into the user’s PC. In July\n2002, FRED became a true database and the user\nwas offered a wider range of options. Data can be\ndownloaded in either text or Excel format. Shortly\nthereafter, user accounts were introduced so that\n\nmultiple data series can be downloaded into a\nsingle Excel workbook, and data lists can be stored\nfor repeated downloads of updated information.\nIn the first six months after this version of FRED\nwas released, 3.8 million hits were recorded to\nthe web site. In a recent six-month period, FRED\nreceived 21 million hits from over 109 countries\naround the world. FRED currently contains 1,175\nnational time series and 1,881 regional series.\nFRED data are updated on a real-time basis as\ninformation is released from various statistical\nagencies.\nAfter 45 years, Homer Jones’s modest initiative to distribute data on three variables has developed into a broad-based data resource on the\nU.S. economy that is available around the globe\nat the click of a mouse. Through this resource,\nresearchers, students, market participants, and\nthe general public can reach informed decisions\nbased on information that is comparable to the\ninformation policymakers have.\nIn the past year, we have introduced a number\nof additional data services. One of these, ALFRED®\n(Archival Federal Reserve Economic Data), adds\na vintage (or real-time) dimension to FRED. The\nALFRED database stores revision histories of the\nFRED data series. Since 1996, we have maintained\nmonthly or weekly archives of the FRED database.\nAll the information in these archives has been\npopulated to the ALFRED database, and the user\ncan access point-in-time revisions of these data.2\nWe have also extended the revision histories of\nmany series back in time using data that were\nrecorded in U.S. Financial Data, Monetary Trends,\nand National Economic Trends. For selected\nquarterly national income and product data, we\nhave complete revision histories back to 1959\nfor real data and 1947 for nominal data. Revision\nhistories are available on household and payroll\nemployment data back to 1960. A similar history\nfor industrial production is available back to 1927.\n\n1\n\nEighth Note (1991, p. 1).\n\n2\n\nWe do not maintain histories of daily data series in ALFRED. Interest rates and exchange rates appear at daily frequencies in FRED. In principle, these data are not revised, though occasional recording errors do slip into the initial data releases. Such reporting errors are corrected in\nsubsequent publications, so there is sometimes a vintage dimension to one of these series.\n\n3\n\n\fMISCELLANEOUS\n\nPreserving such information is crucial to\nunderstanding historical monetary policy. For\nexample, Orphanides (2001, p. 964) shows “that\nreal-time policy recommendations differ considerably from those obtained with ex-post revised\ndata. Further, estimated policy reaction functions\nbased on ex-post revised data provide misleading\ndescriptions of historical policy and obscure the\nbehavior suggested by information available to the\nFederal Reserve in real time.” Orphanides concludes that “reliance on the information actually\navailable to policy makers in real time is essential for the analysis of monetary policy rules.”\nSuch vintage information also is essential for\nanalysis of conditions at subnational levels. For\nexample, in January 2005 the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics estimated that nonfarm employment in\nthe St. Louis MSA had increased by 38.8 thousand\nbetween December 2003 and December 2004.\nThis increase was widely cited as evidence that\nthe MSA had returned to strong employment\ngrowth after four years of negative job growth.\nHowever, these data from the Current Employment\nStatistics were not benchmarked to more comprehensive labor market information that is available\nonly with a lag.3 The current estimate of nonfarm\nemployment growth in the St. Louis MSA for this\nperiod, after several revisions, is only 11.6 thousand, less than 30 percent of the increase originally\nreported.\nAnother data initiative that we launched several years ago is FRASER®—the Federal Reserve\nArchival System for Economic Research. The\nobjective of this initiative is to digitize and distribute the monetary and economic record of the\nU.S. economy. FRASER is a repository of image\nfiles of important historical documents and serial\npublications. At present we have posted the entire\nhistory of The Economic Report of the President,\nEconomic Indicators, and Business Conditions\nDigest. We have also posted images of most issues\nof the Survey of Current Business from 1925\nthrough 1990 and are working on filling in images\nof the remaining volumes. The collection also\n3\n\nWall and Wheeler (2005).\n\n4\n\nSee, for example, Poole (2005).\n\n4\n\nincludes Banking and Monetary Statistics and the\nAnnual Statistical Digests published by the Board\nof Governors, as well as the Business Statistics\nsupplements to the Survey of Current Business\npublished by the Department of Commerce. We\nare currently working, in a joint project with the\nBoard of Governors, to create digital images of\nthe entire history of the Federal Reserve Bulletin.\nFinally, we are posting images of historical statistical releases that we have collected in the process\nof extending the vintage histories in ALFRED\nback in time. These images should allow scholars,\nanalysts, and students of economic history to\nreconstruct vintage data on many series in addition to those we are maintaining on ALFRED.\n\nTRANSPARENCY,\nACCOUNTABILITY, AND\nINFORMATION DISTRIBUTION\nAs just indicated, the scope of the archival\ninformation in FRASER extends beyond numeric\ndata. Ready access to a wide variety of information\nis essential for transparency and accountability\nof monetary authorities and the public’s full\nunderstanding of policy actions. Since 1994, the\nFederal Reserve System and the FOMC have\nimproved the scope and timeliness of information\nreleases. I have discussed this progress in previous\nspeeches.4 Currently, the FOMC releases a press\nstatement at the conclusion of each scheduled\nmeeting and three weeks later follows up with\nthe release of minutes of the meeting. The press\nrelease and the minutes of the meetings record\nthe vote on the policy action. The policy statement and minutes give the public a clear understanding of the action taken and insight into the\nrationale for the action.\nContrast the current situation with the one in\n1979. At that time, actions by the Board of\nGovernors on discount rate changes were reported\npromptly, but there was no press release subsequent to an FOMC policy action and FOMC meet-\n\n\fData, Data, and Yet More Data\n\ning minutes were released with a 90-day delay.\nOn September 19, 1979, the Board of Governors\nvoted by the narrow margin of four to three to\napprove a ½-percentage-point increase in the\ndiscount rate, with all three dissents against the\nincrease. This information generated the public\nperception that Fed officials were sharply divided\nand, therefore, that the Fed was not prepared to\nact decisively against inflation. John Berry (1979,\np. A1), a knowledgeable reporter at the Washington\nPost, observed that “the split vote, with its clear\nsignal that from the Fed’s own point of view interest rates are at or close to their peak for this business cycle, might forestall any more increases in\nmarket interest rates.” However, the interpretation\nof the “clear signal” was erroneous. On that same\nday, the FOMC had voted eight to four to raise the\nrange for the intended funds rate to 11¼ to 11¾\npercent. More importantly, three of the four dissents were in favor of a more forceful action to\nrestrain inflation (see Lindsey, Orphanides, and\nRasche, 2005, pp. 195-96). Neither the FOMC’s\naction, the dissents, nor the rationale for the dissents were revealed to the public under the disclosure policies then in effect. The result was to\ndestabilize markets, with commodity markets, in\nparticular, exhibiting extreme volatility.\n\nREFERENCES\nBerry, John. “Fed Lists Discount Rate to Peak of 11%\non Close Vote.” Washington Post, September 19,\n1979, p.

However, perhaps strangely, I’ll not say much about the\noutlook. Others are better qualified than I to discuss that subject. My topic is how the Fed adjusts\npolicy when the economy departs from the central tendency outlook. Of course, forecasters commonly have somewhat different views, but each\nforecaster’s central tendency, or baseline, forecast\nprovides his or her best guess as to how the economy will evolve. However, forecasters also need\nto be able to say something about probabilities\nof other outcomes. The probability distribution\nof possible outcomes is substantially affected by\npolicy responses to deviations from the baseline\noutlook if and when those deviations occur. And,\nalthough I say “if and when,” everyone in the\nforecasting business knows that our knowledge\nof forecast errors requires that we put much more\nweight on the “when” than the “if.”\nThe views I express here are mine and do not\nnecessarily reflect official positions of the Federal\nReserve System. I thank my colleagues at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for their comments. Bill Gavin, vice president in the Research\nDivision, provided special assistance.\nLet me also note at the outset that this speech\nis something of a companion to another speech I\ngave recently, “Understanding the Fed,” which\nwas published in the St. Louis Fed’s Review and\nis available on our web site.1\n1\n\nSOME BACKGROUND\nMore than three years ago now, in June 2003,\nthe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) set\nits federal funds rate target at a 40-year low of 1\npercent, completing, as it turned out, a series of\nreductions from a rate of 6½ percent in 2000. The\npolicy statement accompanying the change in the\npolicy target concluded with a concern about an\n“unwelcome substantial fall in inflation.” The\ndecline in the inflation rate was only one of a\nstring of surprises to which the FOMC reacted as\nit brought its target rate down. The most shocking\nof the surprises, of course, was the terrorist attack\non the United States on September 11, 2001. It\nwould be time consuming, but not difficult, to\nrecount this history, pointing to the data releases\nand events that led the FOMC to reduce its target\nrate between early 2001 and June 2003; such an\naccount would provide a clear illustration of what\nis meant by “data dependence.”\nThe roughly two-year period after June 2003\nwas quite different in the sense that monetary\npolicy does not appear to have been very data\ndependent. Following its meeting on August 12,\n2003, the FOMC issued a statement that said,\namong other things, that “the Committee believes\nthat policy accommodation can be maintained\nfor a considerable period.” The funds rate target\nremained at 1 percent for a full year. The era of a\n1 percent target ended when the FOMC raised the\ntarget to 1¼ percent on June 30, 2004, a policy\nadjustment the FOMC had signaled at its previous\n\nWilliam Poole, “Understanding the Fed,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, January/February 2007, 89(1), pp. 3-13;\nhttp://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/past/2007/.\n\n1\n\n\fMONETARY POLICY AND INFLATION\n\nmeeting in May. By then, as the economy’s recovery continued, there was no doubt that the FOMC\nwould have to raise its policy target by a substantial amount to support its long-term inflation\nobjective.\nIn each of the next 16 consecutive meetings,\nthe FOMC voted to raise the target for the federal\nfunds rate by 25 basis points, finally pausing at 5¼\npercent in August of 2006. It appeared to some\nthat policy was on autopilot, as the FOMC raised\nthe target by 25 basis points meeting after meeting,\napparently independent of incoming information.\nThat view, I believe, was mistaken. When the\nFOMC began the series of rate increases, in June\n2004, the statement included this sentence:\n“Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to\nchanges in economic prospects as needed to fulfill\nits obligation to maintain price stability.” Similar\nlanguage has appeared in every statement since,\nand the minutes of the meetings have emphasized\nthe same point. What happened over the 18\nmonths after June 2004 was, basically, that incoming data indicated that the economy was so close\nto the track expected earlier that there was no reason to depart from the “measured pace” of rate\nincreases of 25 basis points at every meeting.\nMy purpose today is to discuss in a systematic\nfashion the dependence of policy on new information. I can give you a feel, though not a formula,\nfor why policy decisions are sometimes more data\ndependent than at other times. When the target\nrate was at 1 percent, or only modestly above, it\nwas clear that rates had to rise, but a sufficiently\nlarge surprise would have led the FOMC to stop,\nslow, or accelerate the increase. In the event, data\nsurprises were minimal and the FOMC raised the\ntarget by 25 basis points 17 times in a row. Increasingly, though, as the FOMC raised the target funds\nrate, policymakers became more sensitive to the\npossibility that data surprises could alter the\npolicy course. As it turned out, the decision to\nstop raising rates was determined, in my mind,\nless by data surprises than by the economy’s slowing more or less as had been expected many\nmonths before. The August FOMC meeting turned\n2\n\n2\n\nout to be a good time to pause to take stock of\nwhere the economy stood and the likely course\nof events going forward. Whether the August decision to hold the target funds rate unchanged will\nturn out to be a pause in the process of raising\nrates, a longer-lasting stop, or even the peak, will\ndepend on the economy’s evolution in coming\nmonths.\n\nTHE MODEL\nTo operate monetary policy effectively and\nto understand how policy actions affect the economy, the Federal Reserve relies heavily on economic theory developed over the span of many\ndecades. The theoretical framework is complicated in its technical form and implementation\nbut quite straightforward in its bare-bones abstract\nframework. The real economy evolves along a\ntrend that is buffeted by a variety of economic\nshocks. Inflation evolves along a trend that is\ndetermined by monetary policy and also buffeted\nby these same economic shocks. Although these\nshocks drive the business cycle and make the\nnear-term uncertain, expectations about longerterm trends in both real output growth and inflation have become quite stable.\nLong-run output growth has almost always\nbeen fairly predictable because its trend is determined by the trends in the growth of real factors\nsuch as the labor force, the capital stock, and the\nlevel of technology in science, industry, and\nmanagement. These trends evolve slowly; since\nWorld War II, real growth has fluctuated around\na 3½ percent average and forecasts of future\ngrowth tend to be centered on that number or\nperhaps somewhat lower because labor force\ngrowth is slowing as baby boomers retire.\nInflation, on the other hand, has not always\nbeen so predictable. Before 1987, there were wide\nswings in the inflation trend and, unlike the case\nfor real gross domestic product (GDP), longhorizon forecasts of inflation were actually more\nuncertain than short-horizon forecasts.2 Today,\n\nSee Stephen K. McNees, “How Accurate Are Macroeconomic Forecasts?” Federal Reserve Bank of Boston New England Economic Review,\nJuly/August 1988, pp. 15-36.\n\n\fData Dependence\n\nafter a quarter century of effort by the Fed to\nactively contain inflation, inflation has also\nbecome more predictable over all horizons; and\nforecasts over longer horizons are now much more\naccurate than those over shorter horizons.3 Evidence that long-term inflation has become more\npredictable is important, because it means that\nthe Fed has found a way to anchor the inflation\ntrend.\nThus, our basic model is of an economy in\nwhich both real growth and the inflation rate are\nbuffeted by economic shocks in the short run but\nthen tend to return to predictable long-term trends.\nThe fluctuations of both output and inflation\naround trends have moderated a great deal over\nthe past 25 years, partly and importantly because\nof better monetary policy. This better policy is\ndue to the Fed concentrating on its objective for\nlong-run price stability through a more systematic\nreaction to incoming information about the economic shocks.\nAt one time, many economists believed that\nthere was an inherent tension between stabilizing\ninflation and stabilizing the real economy. Over\nthe past 25 years, we have learned that a condition for stabilizing the real economy is stabilizing\nlong-run inflation expectations. Thus, one of the\nmost important things to understand about the\ndependence of monetary policy actions on arriving\ninformation is that the Federal Reserve has a deep\ncommitment to achieving a long-run outcome for\ninflation that is in accord with its price stability\nobjective. Put another way, short-run policy is\nstrongly motivated by long-run considerations.\n\nMONETARY POLICY\nA fundamental component of monetary policy\nis the decision about the long-run policy objective\nfor inflation. This aspect of policy should not be\ndata dependent. It is possible that an advance in\neconomic knowledge will teach that we should\nhave a different long-run inflation objective. No\n3\n\nsuch advance is on the horizon; but even if it were,\nit would not be an exception to the rule that the\npolicy objective should be independent of incoming information about the current state of the\neconomy. The policy objective determines the\nlong-run inflation trend in our model and, more\nimportantly, the nominal anchor for the economy.\nThe reaction of policy to incoming news\ndepends on the state of the economy relative to\nthe trends. The private sector needs to know the\nFederal Reserve’s inflation objective so that it\nknows how to view fluctuations around the trend.\nRecently, several individual FOMC members\nhave characterized the long-run inflation goal as\na “comfort zone of 1-2 percent inflation” as measured by inflation in the chain price index for personal consumption expenditures. Although the\nFOMC itself has not adopted a formal, quantitative inflation objective, several members, including me, have said that they believe that greater\nclarity about the long-run objective would help\nboth the Committee and the markets to make more\ninformed decisions.\nIt is much easier to agree on a long-run inflation objective than on short-run policy actions\nconsistent with the objective. There is agreement\non two conflicting principles. First, it is all too\neasy to overreact to short-run developments.\nAgreement on that principle is reflected in the\nFOMC’s emphasis on core inflation—inflation\nmeasures excluding volatile food and energy\nprices—as a guide to short-run policy. Moreover,\nabove-trend inflation may be acceptable under\nsome circumstances, provided we are confident\nthat past policy actions have been sufficient to\nslow inflation in the future. Nevertheless, there\nis also agreement on a second principle: It is all\ntoo easy to allow wishful thinking on inflation\nto delay necessary tough policy decisions. The\nFOMC does its best to make the right choices\nwhen, as is often the case, “all too easy to overreact” collides with “all too easy to allow wishful\nthinking on inflation.”\n\nSee evidence on forecast errors over 3-, 12-, and 24-month intervals from 1997 through 2006 in William T. Gavin and Kevin L. Kliesen,\n“Forecasting Inflation and Output: Comparing Data-Rich Models with Simple Rules,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Working Paper\n2006-054A, September 2006.\n\n3\n\n\fMONETARY POLICY AND INFLATION\n\nIn one sense, long-run policy is the accumulation of individual short-run policy decisions.\nHowever, if individual decisions reflect only reactions to short-run developments in the economy,\nthen there is no telling where long-run policy\nwill go. The right way for the Fed to think about\nshort-run policy decisions is that they have to be\npart of, or fit into, a coherent long-term plan. The\nmarket’s understanding of this plan is central to\nthe determination of long-term interest rates. In\ngeneral, the rate on any bond depends on expected\nshort rates over the horizon of the bond. Thus, the\n10-year Treasury bond rate depends on expectations of short-term interest rates over the 10-year\nhorizon.\nMarket expectations about future interest rates\ndepend on the interaction of two interrelated\nsources of influence. One, obviously, concerns\nFederal Reserve decisions on the intended federal\nfunds rate. Also important are expectations as to\nthe demands for and supplies of funds in the\nprivate market. For example, with simultaneous\ninvestment and housing booms, credit demands\nwill be high and interest rates will tend to be bid\nup. In pursuing its policy goals, the FOMC will\nbe adjusting the federal funds rate as needed to\nkeep the inflation rate low and stable. Thus, the\nmarket forms expectations about the underlying state of the economy that will bear on Fed\ndecisions.\nThe Federal Reserve is constantly evaluating\nthe situation in the markets and trying to adjust\nthe intended federal funds rate to produce a satisfactory equilibrium in the economy. When we put\nthe Federal Reserve’s and the market’s decisions\nand expectations together, we have a macroeconomic equilibrium.\nThe interaction between the Federal Reserve\nand the markets may be confusing at first sight,\nand indeed was confusing to economists for generations until conceptual breakthroughs in the\n1960s and 1970s clarified the issue. Market behavior depends on expectations as to what the Federal\nReserve is going to do, and what the Federal\n4\n\n4\n\nReserve is going to do depends on what the market\nand the economy are anticipated to do. The full\nrational expectations macroeconomic equilibrium\noccurs when the market behaves as the Federal\nReserve expects and the Federal Reserve behaves\nas the market expects. In both cases we assume\nthat the expectations are fully rational, by which\nwe mean that the expectations are fully informed\non the basis of all available information. The\nabstraction of a full rational expectations macroeconomic equilibrium provides a powerful starting point for analysis of a data-dependent policy.\n\nCAN THE MARKET PREDICT\nDATA DEPENDENCE?\nThe “Taylor rule” is a stylized view of the\nFed’s reaction to incoming information. In 1993,\nStanford economist John Taylor proposed a simple\nformula relating the federal funds rate to (i) a\nlong-run inflation target and (ii) short-run deviations of inflation from that target and short-run\ndeviations of real GDP from a measure of “potential real GDP.”4 Taylor suggested that his simple\nrelationship characterized in broad outline the\nactual behavior of the federal funds rate in the\nearly years of the Greenspan FOMC. The essence\nof this relationship is that in the long-run the\nFOMC seeks to keep the federal funds rate roughly\nconsistent with a level that is believed to produce\na target level of inflation. Taylor assumed a target\nrate of inflation of 2 percent per year measured\nby the total consumer price index (CPI). In the\nshort run, the relationship implies that the FOMC\nadjusts the target federal funds rate up as either\nthe observed inflation rate exceeds its target or\nreal GDP exceeds potential real GDP. Conversely,\nunder the Taylor rule, the FOMC reduces the target federal funds rate when inflation falls below\nits target and/or real GDP falls short of potential\nreal GDP.\nThe Taylor rule reflects the primacy of a longrun inflation objective while incorporating short-\n\nJohn B. Taylor, “Discretion versus Policy Rules in Practice,” Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy, 39, December 1993,\npp. 195-214. Taylor compared the values of his formula against the observed history of the funds rate from 1987 through 1992.\n\n\fData Dependence\n\nrun stabilization efforts. The rule provides a formula for computing a baseline, or reference,\ninterest rate that is consistent with policy achieving the Fed’s objectives for both output stabilization and price stability. I discussed the Taylor rule\nin some detail in the speech I mentioned earlier,\n“Understanding the Fed,” and refer you to its\npublished version in this Review if you want to\ndig into the subject more deeply.\nNow I’ll turn to some comments on future\nFed policy, but I want to remind you that I am\nspeaking for myself—other FOMC participants\nmay have different views about how future policy\nadjustments will depend on arriving information.\nAll economic indicators may have implications\nfor the evolution of the real economy and inflation.\nI emphasize “may” because we have to filter out\nas best we can possible data errors and inconsistencies across various indicators.\nBefore I discuss future Fed policy in any detail,\nI begin with a warning. New information drives\nboth market adjustments and policy changes, but\nnew information is inherently unpredictable. To\ngain a sense of the impact of new information on\ninterest rates, I’ve analyzed data from the eurodollar futures market and discussed the results in\nsome detail in “Understanding the Fed.” The\nbottom line of that analysis is that forecasts embedded in the eurodollar futures market explain 42\npercent of the variance of fluctuations in the actual\neurodollar yield three months ahead. Thus, unpredictable events even over a three-month horizon\nare responsible for 58 percent of the variance of\nthe eurodollar yield. Over a six-month horizon,\nunpredictable events are responsible for more than\n70 percent of the variance. Thus, I can discuss\nvarious scenarios but have no way of knowing\nwhich scenario will come to pass.\nLet’s start with the outlook for the rest of\n2006. Forecasts made by FOMC members and\ntransmitted to Congress in July were 3¼ to 3½\npercent growth for real GDP and an increase for\nthe core personal consumption expenditures\n(PCE) chain price index of 2¼ to 2½ percent. As\nfor 2007, the central tendency of the FOMC members’ GDP forecasts is 3 to 3½ percent. This growth\n\noutlook should be consistent with keeping the\neconomy close to full employment, based on the\nCongressional Budget Office forecast of potential\nGDP growth of 3.24 percent in 2007. As for inflation, the central tendency forecast of FOMC participants for 2007 is 2 to 2¼ percent. Thus,\ninflation is expected to recede only very slowly\nfrom its current level.\nThere are two cases in which the economic\nnews will pretty clearly predict a change in the\nFed’s policy stance. If incoming economic indicators show that both output and inflation are\nrising above these forecasts, then, in the absence\nof any other information, we can expect that the\nFOMC will increase its target federal funds rate.\nOn the other hand, if both output and inflation\ncome in weaker than expected, we are unlikely\nto see further increases in the federal funds target; indeed, if economic weakness is pervasive\nenough, the FOMC will at some point reduce the\ntarget funds rate.\nThe most interesting—not to mention controversial and difficult—cases are those in which the\noutlook for inflation and output move in opposite directions. In such cases, the FOMC has to\ncall on all its experience and judgment to reach a\ndecision. It is very difficult for me to be precise\nabout the judgments I am likely to reach based\non incoming information because a host of considerations, some of which I cannot foresee, may\nenter the calculus. But I’ll make a stab at how\nthings could play out to illustrate my thought\nprocess.\nA critically important consideration in my\nmind concerns the inflation process and the\nimportance of the Fed’s commitment to low and\nstable inflation. It is my conviction that temporizing on actions to control inflation is an invitation\nto trouble. Accepting higher inflation, or even a\ncontinuation of the current rate of inflation, in\nan effort to sustain current employment levels\nwill only lead to more grief later. Once inflation\nand inflation expectations rise, the economy will\nbecome less stable and reducing inflation from\nan elevated rate will be more costly than taking\nthe medicine now. Having said that, if inflation\npressures are easing, even if only gradually, and\n5\n\n\fMONETARY POLICY AND INFLATION\n\nthere is a genuine prospect that inflation will\nreturn to the comfort zone, then I see no reason\nto accelerate the decline in inflation by maintaining a restrictive policy in the face of declining\nemployment. Policy needs to be as disciplined\nas necessary to get the job done, but not more so.\nThe long-run inflation goal and the attitude\nI’ve expressed about what risks to take suggest\nthat I will have a bias in the way I interpret incoming information. If data on the real economy come\nin weaker than expected—if it appears that the\neconomy is falling below the baseline forecast\npath—then my bias will be in the direction of\nwanting to be sure that the data paint a consistent\npicture before I’ll advocate a policy easing. But\nif the picture is consistent, and inflation risk is\nreceding, then I’ll not hesitate to advocate policy\neasing.\nWhat I hope the FOMC can accomplish is to\nretain full market confidence that the long-run\nrate of inflation will remain in the comfort zone.\nI hope that forecasters assign very low probability to inflation outcomes over the medium term\nof 3 to 5 years outside the comfort zone no matter\nwhat the incoming data look like. Although I am\ntalking about inflation over a horizon well beyond\nthe usual forecast horizon of 1 to 2 years, the longrun inflation outlook has a direct bearing on the\nforecast. The long bond rate today depends critically on expected inflation over the maturity of\nthe bond. Thus, rates that enter importantly into\nany economic forecast, such as mortgage and\ncorporate bond rates, depend on the long-run\ninflation outlook. This outlook has been quite\nstable in recent years, and that fact is evidence of\na major monetary policy success.\nWith long-run inflation contained, the FOMC\nhas flexibility to respond, vigorously if necessary,\nto economic weakness should it arise. The FOMC\nbrought the target federal funds rate down aggressively in 2001 in response to incoming information. Aggressive easing kept the recession mild.\nIf the economy comes in below the baseline forecast in coming quarters, the FOMC will have room\nto act as aggressively as required. I have no idea\nwhat scale of easing might be appropriate, for\nthat will depend on the nature of the incoming\n6\n\ninformation. Still, I believe forecasters should\nassign a relatively low probability to deep recession precisely because of the FOMC’s demonstrated willingness to act aggressively as necessary.\nI’ve given you my take on what data dependence means and the attitudes that underlie my\nlikely responses. I’ve also emphasized that an\nefficient rational expectations equilibrium requires\nthat the market behave as the policymakers expect\nand policymakers behave as the market expects.\nThe market’s evaluation of the prospects for policy is revealed in the futures markets for federal\nfunds and eurodollar deposits. Current futures\nprices predict that the federal funds target is\nexpected to begin moving down. Because these\nmarket quotes change day by day in response to\nnew information, I do not want to attempt to be\nparticularly precise as to the timing—anything I\nwrite as I draft these remarks may be out of date\nby the time I deliver them or within a few weeks,\nanyway. What I can safely note is that the market’s\nexpectation of future policy easing has been taking\nhold gradually since late June, say, in response\nto data on the real economy suggesting that real\ngrowth is slowing and inflation data suggesting\nthat the worst may be over on that front.\nAlthough expectations about future policy\nactions are revealed transparently in the futures\nmarket for short-term interest rates, I want to\nunderscore my earlier point about the limited\naccuracy of those forecasts. Some of the forecast\nmisses have been pretty dramatic. For example,\nin December 2000, the futures market forecasts\nwere for a decline in the eurodollar yield of 35\nbasis points over the following three months\nand a total of 67 basis points over the six-month\nperiod. Instead, the FOMC acted aggressively to\nlower the funds rate target starting in January and\ncontinuing through May 2001 by a total of 250\nbasis points. The FOMC acted aggressively as\nincoming information pointed to growing weakness in economic activity. Both the FOMC and\nthe markets were surprised by incoming information indicating that the economy was weakening\nquickly and significantly.\nAlthough I cannot predict unpredictable new\ninformation, I’ve tried to provide a sense of how\n\n\fData Dependence\n\nI might respond to new information as it arrives.\nI note, however, that it is rare that a single data\nreport is decisive. The economic outlook is determined by numerous pieces of information. Important data such as the inflation and the employment\nreports are cross-checked against other information. The FOMC is aware of the possibility of data\nrevisions and short-run anomalies. Sometimes\ndata ought to be discounted because of anomalous\nbehavior.\nAn example was the increase in tobacco\nprices in late 1998. Tobacco prices had a transitory impact on measured inflation, both total and\ncore indices, during December 1998 and January\n1999, but produced no lasting effect on trend\ninflation. Similarly, information about real activity\nsometimes arrives that indicates transitory shocks\nto aggregate output and employment. An example\nof such a transitory shock is the strike against\nGeneral Motors in June and July 1998. Similarly,\nthe September 2005 employment report reflected\nthe impact of Hurricane Katrina, which was\nexpected to be, and turned out to be, temporary\nfrom a national perspective.\nTransitory and anomalous shocks to the data\nare ordinarily rather easy to identify. Both Fed and\nmarket economists develop estimates of these\naberrations in the data shortly after they occur.\nThe principle of looking through aberrations is\neasy to state but probably impossible to formalize\nwith any precision. We know these shocks when\nwe see them, but could never construct a completely comprehensive list of such shocks ex ante.\nPolicymakers piece together a picture of the\neconomy from a variety of data, including anecdotal observations. When the various observations fit together to provide a coherent picture,\nthe Fed can adjust the intended rate with some\nconfidence. The market generally understands\nthis process, as it draws similar conclusions from\nthe same data.\nSo, given policy objectives, and given a view\nabout how policy decisions affect the economy,\n5\n\nthe central bank can in principle specify a policy\nrule, or response function, that guides policy\nadjustments in response to incoming information.\nTo achieve a good result, the general public and\nmarket participants need to understand the objectives and the response function so that the private\neconomy can determine its activities with full\nknowledge of how the central bank will act. Of\ncourse, uncertainty is an inherent characteristic\nof the economic world. What should be predictable are the central bank’s responses to the neverending sequence of surprises that characterize\nthe economic environment.\nMarket commentary often indicates frustration that the FOMC does not lay out a clearer path\nfor policy, arguing that the FOMC is unpredictable. That view, I believe, is off base. Typically\nthe FOMC cannot be predictable with regard to\nthe path of the target federal funds rate because\nnew information driving policy adjustments is\nnot predictable.

        "content": "The Monetary Policy Model\nNational Association of Business Economics (NABE) Annual Meeting\nBoston, Massachusetts\nSeptember 11, 2006\n\nI\n\nam sure that all of us find it sobering to\nmeet on the fifth anniversary of the tragic\nevents of September 11, 2001. Many of\nyou were present at the NABE annual\nmeeting at the World Trade Center that day and\nwere fortunate to escape before the great towers\ncame down.\nIt is a distinct honor to be here today to accept\nthe Adam Smith Award. I’ll be talking about the\nsubject I know best—monetary policy. I would\nhave used the title,“My Monetary Policy Model”\nexcept for the fact that the model I use is not mine.\nOur current understanding of monetary economics has been built on contributions over many\nhundreds of years. In preparing this lecture, I\nreminded myself of just how clearly Adam Smith\nunderstood monetary issues by going back to\nreread sections of the Wealth of Nations. Smith\nbegins the book with three short chapters on the\ndivision of labor. Chapter 4 is entitled, “Of the\nOrigin and Use of Money.” Smith explains that\ndivision of labor requires exchange, and exchange\nrequires money. He discusses the difficulty of\nconducting exchange efficiently because metallic\nmoney needs to be weighed and assayed. Smith\ndiscusses the practice of princes and sovereign\nstates in debasing the currency. He notes that\n“[s]uch operations, therefore, have always proved\nfavourable to the debtor and ruinous to the creditor, and have sometimes produced a greater and\nmore universal revolution in the fortunes of private persons, than could have been occasioned\nby a very great public calamity.”\nMonetary policymakers are acutely aware of\nthe potential for monetary policy to create “a\nvery great public calamity” and they feel deeply\ntheir responsibility not to permit such an outcome.\n\nOur most fundamental challenges are basically\nthe same ones Smith noted. Uncertainty over the\nvalue of money is one; another is the incentive\nof sovereign states to debase the value of money.\nMy aim in this lecture is to provide a skeletal\npicture of how I view the Federal Reserve’s task.\nBefore proceeding, I want to emphasize that\nthe views I express here are mine and do not\nnecessarily reflect official positions of the Federal\nReserve System. I thank my colleagues at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for their comments, but I retain full responsibility for errors.\n\nRATIONAL EXPECTATIONS\nMACROECONOMIC EQUILIBRIUM\nMost macroeconomists today adhere to a\nmodel based on the idea of a rational expectations\nequilibrium. All aspects of government policy\nenter the rational expectations model—the\n“RE model” for short—but I’ll confine my remarks\nto monetary policy. Policymakers are assumed to\nhave a set of goals and a conception of how the\neconomy works. The private sector understands,\nto the extent possible, policymakers’ views. An\nequilibrium is characterized by a situation in\nwhich the private sector has a clear understanding\nof policy goals and the policymakers’ model of\nthe economy, and the policy model of the economy is as accurate as possible. If the policymakers\nand private market participants do not have views\nthat converge, no stable equilibrium is possible\nbecause expectations as to the behavior of others\nwill be constantly changing.\nIn this setting, market behavior depends centrally on expectations concerning monetary policy\n1\n\n\fMONETARY POLICY AND INFLATION\n\nand the effects of monetary policy on the economy,\nincluding effects on inflation, employment, and\nfinancial stability. A stable equilibrium requires\nthat markets behave as policymakers expect and\nthat policymakers behave as markets expect.\nIt is easiest to describe the rational expectations equilibrium in a context of certainty. But,\nof course, all the really interesting questions arise\nin a context of uncertainty. One form of uncertainty concerns future states of the world. In\nprinciple, we can think about a model in which\nmarket responses and policy responses to new\ninformation reflect maximizing behavior. In the\nprivate sector, in response to new information,\nhouseholds change consumption plans to maximize utility and firms make operating and investment decisions to maximize profits. Similarly,\npolicymakers revise the stance of monetary policy\nin an attempt to pursue policy goals as efficiently\nas possible. The continuous flow of new information includes everything that happens—weather\ndisturbances, technological developments, routine\neconomic data reports and the like. Thus, we\ncan think of the economy as evolving efficiently\nin response to stochastic disturbances of all sorts.\nOf course, in practice, there is also uncertainty\nabout market and policy responses to new information, and there are improvements over time in\nknowledge about how the economy works. Nevertheless, the RE model provides the core insights\nthat shape my views as to how to make routine\npolicy decisions and how to design a longer-run\nprogram to improve policy.\n\nMONETARY POLICY\nIMPERATIVES IN THE MODEL\nWe can think of the actual, observed equilibrium as a full rational expectations equilibrium\nunder current policy. There may well be an alternative policy that would induce a new rational\nexpectations equilibrium that would have more\ndesirable properties than the current equilibrium.\nThinking of the model this way provides an agenda\nfor long-run improvement in monetary policy.\n2\n\nClarity of Goals\nFor the private sector to form accurate expectations about future monetary policy and outcomes\nof key economic variables, policymakers need to\nstate their goals clearly. The literature on inflation targeting emphasizes this point, and I have\nlong believed that the FOMC could improve the\nclarity with which it conveys its objectives to\nthe general public. In the past, I have stated my\nown personal inflation objective as “zero inflation, properly measured” but have also said that\nFOMC agreement on an inflation objective, which\nsome might express as a “comfort zone of 1 to 2\npercent inflation,” is more important than which\nprecise specification is selected. There are practical difficulties that can and should be addressed,\nsuch as what price index to use, over what period\nto measure price changes, and what degree of\ntolerance to adopt if inflation runs outside the\nrange. I do not believe that uncertainty about the\nFed’s inflation objective is a large issue at present\nbut do believe that there is an opportunity to\nimprove clarity.\n\nMaintaining Credibility\nTo maintain credibility, the monetary authorities must deliver what they said they would\ndeliver. Credibility is essential to the stability of\nlonger-term inflation expectations. Central banks\naround the world emphasize the importance of\nachieving low and stable inflation. In the United\nStates, the Federal Reserve lost considerable\ncredibility in the 1970s because the inflation rate\nrose to unacceptable levels. With impaired credibility, the FOMC under Paul Volcker had to pursue a sustained anti-inflationary policy even in\nthe face of the most severe recession since the\nGreat Depression. The cost of restoring credibility\nmakes clear the reason for not losing it.\nCredibility is not, however, one-dimensional.\nSustained low inflation is desired for its own\nsake but even more for the contribution it makes\nto high employment and economic growth. Thus,\nwhile inflation damages credibility, so also can\nhigh unemployment. There is a fine balance here.\nWe know that monetary policy cannot affect\n\n\fThe Monetary Policy Model\n\nemployment in the long run, but we also know\nthat monetary policy mistakes can create unemployment over an uncomfortably long short run.\nWhen unemployment rises, policymakers need\nto be able to explain in credible fashion why the\nproblem is not a consequence of a monetary policy\nmistake, for that perception is always present\namong some observers in such circumstances.\nThere is, after all, some historical justification for\nsuch a perception given that almost all economists\nagree that monetary policy mistakes contributed\nto the severity of the Great Depression. Given the\nimportance of high employment, a period of sustained excessive unemployment may create\ndoubts about future policy, and this uncertainty\nis a manifestation of impaired credibility.\nThe Federal Reserve’s credibility is also\naffected by other matters. Sound performance in\ndealing with financial crises and regulatory\nresponsibilities enhances credibility. Reputational\nrisk applies to the institution as a whole. Poor\nperformance of responsibilities outside the monetary policy realm can affect the public’s confidence in the central bank’s leadership.\nMonetary policy success depends on high\ncredibility, but it is important to recognize that\ncredibility adheres to the entire institution that\nconducts monetary policy and not just to the\ndepartment within the institution responsible\nfor monetary policy.\n\nSOME IMPLICATIONS OF THE\nMODEL\nThe model I’ve sketched provides a way of\nthinking about current policy decisions. At least,\nthe model provides a way for you to think about\nmy thinking about current policy decisions. The\nmodel also provides a framework for analyzing\npotential policy improvements over time.\nThe model clearly calls for improved clarity of\ncentral bank goals, a topic I’ve already discussed.\nClearly, also, the model supports continuing\nmacroeconomics research to improve understanding of how the economy works. Because a full\nrational expectations equilibrium requires com-\n\nplete knowledge on the part of the private sector\nof central bank thinking and analysis, Federal\nReserve research findings should be distributed\nwidely. More generally, the model points to the\nimportance of reducing asymmetries of knowledge through central bank transparency.\nA finding of the optimal control literature is\nthat when a policy authority uses all available\ninformation as efficiently as possible in pursuing\nits goals, simple correlations between observable\nvariables and goal variables may go to zero.\nAlthough the exact result will be model dependent, we should not expect correlations such as\nbetween money growth and nominal GDP growth\nor between unit labor costs and inflation to be\nindependent of the policy regime. This is a familiar proposition in the securities markets, where\nit is stated as the efficient markets hypothesis.\nObservable information should be quickly\nreflected in securities prices, leaving no riskadjusted profit opportunities from trading on\npublicly available information. There is, of course,\nan opportunity to exploit nonpublic information.\nIn the monetary policy context, research suggests that inflation-forecasting models have not\nworked very well in recent years. The reason, I\nbelieve, is that the Federal Reserve has been pretty\nsuccessful in exploiting all available public information in its monetary policy decisions aimed at\nmaintaining low and stable inflation. However,\nthere is an opportunity to exploit non-public\ninformation. The Federal Reserve has an extensive process of gathering anecdotal information\nfrom business contacts. Much of this information\nis published in the Beige Book two weeks before\nevery FOMC meeting. The policy model I’m\nsketching certainly leaves room for greater and\nmore systematic effort to gather and exploit anecdotal information.\nWhat does the model imply about the value\nof financial-market information to policymakers?\nConsider the fed funds futures market. Does that\nmarket’s response to, say, the employment report\nhelp policymakers to assess the significance of\nthe new data? In the RE model the clear answer\nis “no.” The behavior of the fed funds futures\nmarket tells us what the market believes will be\nthe Fed’s response to the news. That is useful\n3\n\n\fMONETARY POLICY AND INFLATION\n\ninformation for the Fed, but does not help in\nunderstanding what the new information itself\nmeans for the evolution of the economy. The same\nargument holds for other financial prices, which\nreflect a mixture of direct effects from new information and indirect effects from anticipated policy responses to the new information. The\nimplication for policymakers is that we need to\nprovide our own analysis of the implications of\nnew information and cannot rely on financial\nmarkets to do that job for us.\nThe model also contains a surprising implication for central bank communication. Consider\nthe most extreme version of the model, in which\nthere are no information asymmetries. The central\nbank and the private markets have the same information. The economy evolves as stochastic shocks\noccur. When shocks are observed, the central\nbank and the markets get the new information at\nthe same time and both understand the implications of the new information for each others’\nactions. Moreover, and this is the surprising result,\nthe central bank does not need to say anything\nabout the policy implication of any particular\nshock. The markets already know the implications because there is full knowledge and no\ninformation asymmetry.\nThe practical import of this implication for\ncentral bank communication policy is that communications should focus on policy fundamentals of goals and the model of how the economy\nworks. The economy works best when policymakers disclose the systematic part of policy\nand minimize the random part. That is, policy\nshould not itself be a source of random disturbance. In the extreme, austere version of the\nmodel I am now discussing, central bank communication about policy responses to individual\nshocks is unnecessary and more likely to create\nmarket disturbances than enlightenment. Only\nwhen the central bank believes that the market is\nmisinterpreting the policy significance of a shock\nis comment on the particular shock desirable.\nWe can think of such communication as being\ndesigned to reduce an information asymmetry.\nYou may believe that my argument from an\nextreme, austere model is far-fetched. However,\n\n4\n\nas one who routinely talks with the press after\nevery speech, I can tell you that imparting the\ncorrect interpretation of the policy significance\nof recent data is not a simple matter. It is all too\neasy to create an unintended market disturbance.\nThus, I personally really do take seriously the\npractical relevance of the extreme model.\nI have discussed the implication of the RE\nmodel for central bank communication because\nit seems to me that there are many opportunities\nfor improving communication, and many possible communications pits into which it is easy to\nfall. Central bank communications are not just\n“PR” issues, which I put in quotes to indicate\nhow some might dismiss their importance, but\nessential to the monetary policy process. Expectations are critical to how markets perform and\nexpectations are affected both by what the central\nbank says and by what it does.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nThe economics profession has converged to\na basic conception of how the economy works\nbased on a rational expectations view of the world.\nThat core idea is at the heart of every model today\nand at the heart of monetary policy practice.\nNevertheless, there is ample room for disagreement and further development. Some—and I\ninclude myself in this group—think about policy\nin a way that is pretty close to an austere version\nof the model in which information asymmetries\nplay a minimal role, while others see a much\nlarger role for imperfections in the market’s information set. In any event, the RE model provides\nan organizing framework and common language\nfor analyzing monetary policy issues. Adam\nSmith posed fundamental issues well, but in the\ncontext of the gold standard. Since Smith’s day,\nwe’ve come a long way. Indeed, we’ve come a\nlong way since the 1960s and 1970s when fundamental differences between Keynesians and\nmonetarists, as the split was then described, left\nmonetary policy in a state that could only be\ndescribed as incoherent. Fundamental advances\nin economics really have made a difference.\n\n\f"

        "content": "Understanding the Fed\nDyer County Chamber of Commerce Annual Membership Luncheon\nDyersburg, Tennessee\nAugust 31, 2006\nPublished in the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, January/February 2007, 89(1), pp. 3-13\n\nP\n\neople often ask me questions about\nthe Fed, sometimes out of simple\ncuriosity and sometimes out of a real\nneed to know for business reasons.\nPortfolio managers, for example, have a real need\nto know. My remarks reflect my effort to provide\nrather systematically some answers to common\nquestions. And I will also answer questions that\nought to be put to me, but usually are not. There\nis no reason why the Federal Reserve should be\na mysterious organization—we ought to be\nresponsive to your concerns.\nObviously, I want to emphasize that the views\nI express here are mine and do not necessarily\nreflect official positions of the Federal Reserve\nSystem. I suspect that each of us involved in\nFederal Reserve policy would answer the questions somewhat differently and emphasize different things. In any event, I’ll offer my answers. I\nthank my colleagues at the Federal Reserve Bank of\nSt. Louis for their comments, especially Robert H.\nRasche, senior vice president and director of\nresearch, who provided special assistance.\n\nTHE ROLE OF ECONOMIC\nSCIENCE IN MONETARY POLICY\nA very general question concerns the basis on\nwhich policy decisions are made. It is important\nto recognize that economists have developed a\nformal theory of monetary policy over the past\n60 years or so and that this theory really does\nguide our thinking. The theory has two logical\nparts. The first is a clear set of objectives. The\nsecond is a specification of how policy, in pursuit\nof these objectives, affects the economy.\n\nThe model of how the economy works is\ncomplicated, and I could not possibly begin to\npresent it here. But I will say that our understanding of how the economy works is based on economic theory and an enormous body of empirical\nresearch that tests the theory. Our understanding\nis often qualitative, and we know that we must\nattach standard errors to our numerical predictions. An active research program within the\nFederal Reserve and by academic and business\neconomists continuously refines the theory and\nour empirical understanding.\nLet me use an analogy: Hurricane forecasting\nhas come a long way, but, as anyone who watches\nthe weather news knows, the forecasts are not\nperfectly reliable. Ship captains have to make\npolicy decisions on what courses to set, taking\ninto account the forecasts and what is known\nabout forecast accuracy. Economic policymakers\nhave to make the same sorts of decisions based\non incomplete knowledge.\nSo, given policy objectives, and given a view\nabout how policy decisions affect the economy,\nthe central bank can in principle specify a policy\nrule, or response function, that guides policy. To\nachieve a good result, the general public and market participants need to understand the objectives\nand the response function so that the private\neconomy can determine its activities with full\nknowledge of how the central bank will act. Of\ncourse, uncertainty is an inherent characteristic\nof the economic world. What should be predictable are the central bank’s responses to the neverending sequence of surprises that characterize\nthe economic environment.\n1\n\n\fFEDERAL RESERVE\n\nMonetary Policy Objectives\nCongress sets the mission of the Federal\nReserve in the conduct of monetary policy. Originally, the Fed’s mission was specified in the Federal\nReserve Act signed into law by President Woodrow\nWilson in December 1913. The Fed’s current mandate, set formally in an amendment to the Federal\nReserve Act in 1977 and reaffirmed in 2000,\nrequires the Federal Reserve to pursue three objectives through its conduct of monetary policy. They\nare “maximum employment, stable prices and\nmoderate long-term interest rates” (Bernanke,\n2006a). Economists recognize that long-term\ninterest rates incorporate a premium for expected\ninflation. Thus, the objectives of price stability\nand low long-term interest rates are essentially\nthe same objective.\nThis “dual mandate,” so-called because of its\nemphasis on both employment and price stability\nobjectives, differs from that of other central banks,\nespecially the “inflation targeting” central banks.\nInflation targeters, including the Bank of Canada,\nthe Bank of England, and the Reserve Bank of\nNew Zealand, among others, operate under an\nagreement with their respective governments that\ndefines price stability as the single objective and\nspecifies a quantitative definition of the inflation\nobjective. In a similar fashion, the European\nCentral Bank (ECB) is given a price stability mandate under the Maastricht Treaty, though the treaty\ndoes not give a numeric value or range to the ECB.\nThe ECB has interpreted its mandate as preventing the inflation rate from exceeding 2 percent\nper annum over a “medium term” horizon.\nToday, there is general agreement among\nprofessional economists and central bankers\naround the world that, in the long run, monetary\npolicy cannot achieve a tradeoff between inflation\nand employment. Successive Fed chairmen have\nemphasized that price stability is not only a mandated objective of monetary policy but also the\nmeans by which monetary policy contributes to\nachieving the other two objectives. The view goes\nback at least to Chairman William McChesney\nMartin: “My interest in a monetary policy directed\ntoward a dollar of stable value is not based on the\n2\n\nfeeling that price stability is a more important\nnational objective than either maximum sustainable growth or a high level of employment, but\nrather on the reasoned conclusion that the objective of price stability is an essential prerequisite\nfor their achievement” (McChesney Martin, 1959,\np. 5). In his 1979 confirmation hearing, Chairman\nPaul Volcker (U.S. Congress, 1979) made this statement: “I believe that ultimately the only sound\nfoundation for continuing growth and prosperity\nof the American economy is much greater price\nstability.” Early in his tenure, Chairman Alan\nGreenspan (1988) concurred in this view: “The\nCommittee continued to focus on maintaining\nthe economic expansion and on progress toward\nprice stability, which was seen as a necessary condition for long-term sustained economic growth.”\nIn July 2006, Chairman Ben S. Bernanke (2006b)\nacknowledged the following: “The achievement\nof price stability is one of the objectives that make\nup the Congress’s mandate to the Federal Reserve.\nMoreover, in the long run, price stability is critical\nto achieving maximum employment and moderate long-term interest rates, the other parts of the\ncongressional mandate.”\nI believe that we can go a step beyond these\nstatements. In my view, the goal of price stability\nmust be the primary goal for three reasons. First,\nin the long run, employment and economic growth\nare maximized in an environment of price stability.\nSecond, only in an environment of price stability\nand market confidence that the central bank will\ncontinue to maintain price stability will the central\nbank be in a position to act deliberately to offset\nmany types of disturbances that would otherwise\ncreate fluctuations in employment and output.\nThe Federal Reserve does not have the power to\ncompletely offset all such disturbances, but it\ncan cushion their effects and thereby improve\neconomic stability. Finally, price stability is a\ngoal in its own right simply because price instability creates arbitrary and unfair redistributions\nof income and wealth.\nI have often noted that my own personal\npreference is to define “price stability” as a condition in which the rate of inflation, properly\nmeasured, is on average zero. I insert the qualifier\n\n\fUnderstanding the Fed\n\n“properly measured” to point out that actual price\nindices may have statistical problems such that\nzero measured inflation on a particular price index\nmight not in fact reflect a true state of zero inflation. Although my own preference is for zero inflation properly measured, I believe that a central\nbank consensus on some other numerical goal of\nreasonably low inflation is more important than\nthe exact number chosen. Thus, I find that recent\ndiscussion of a “comfort zone” of 1 to 2 percent\ninflation measured by the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures (PCE), excluding the\nvolatile food and energy components, is perfectly\nconsistent with my own thinking.\nNote that the congressional mandate to the\nFederal Reserve does not include any of numerous\nobjectives that from time to time have been advocated by supporters of various interests: for example, stable exchange rates, stable asset prices, or\nhousing investment. Clarity of objectives is an\nimportant attribute of monetary policy today and\ncontributes greatly to its success.\n\nSystematic Policy\nThe dual nature of the Fed mandate is well\nsummarized in the “Taylor rule.” In 1993, Stanford\neconomist John Taylor proposed a simple formula\nrelating the federal funds rate to (i) a long-run\ninflation target and (ii) short-run deviations of\ninflation from that target and short-run deviations\nof real gross domestic product (GDP) (Taylor, 1993)\nfrom a measure of “potential real GDP.”1 Taylor\nsuggested that his simple relationship characterized in broad outline the actual behavior of the\nfederal funds rate in the early years of the\nGreenspan FOMC. The essence of this relationship\nis that, in the long-run, the FOMC seeks to keep\nthe federal funds rate roughly consistent with a\nlevel that is believed to produce a target level of\ninflation. Taylor assumed a target rate of inflation\nof 2 percent per year measured by the total consumer price index (CPI). In the short run, the\n\nrelationship implies that the FOMC adjusts the\ntarget federal funds rate up as either the observed\ninflation rate exceeds the target level of inflation or\nreal GDP exceeds potential real GDP. Conversely,\nunder the Taylor rule, the FOMC reduces the target\nfederal funds rate when inflation falls below its\ntarget and/or real GDP falls short of potential real\nGDP. Thus the relationship incorporates the primacy of a long-run inflation objective while incorporating short-run stabilization efforts.\nFigure 1 shows the actual value of the federal\nfunds rate target on FOMC meeting dates starting\nin 1987 as well as a computed value based on\nTaylor’s original formula and the information\navailable to the FOMC at the time of each meeting.2 The inflation rate in the figure is the total\nCPI. Through 2000, the gap between real GDP\nand potential real GDP is the value measured by\nthe staff of the Board of Governors at the time of\neach FOMC meeting.\nAfter 2000, the staff assumptions about the\nGDP gap are not yet publicly available, so the\ndotted line in the graph for this period is computed with the GDP gap as constructed by the\nCongressional Budget Office. Also beginning in\n2000, the FOMC changed its inflation objective\nin two ways. First, the Committee emphasized\nthe inflation rate as measured by changes in the\nPCE inflation rate rather than the CPI inflation\nrate. Second, the Committee emphasized the core\nPCE index, which excludes the volatile food and\nenergy components. Hence, it is likely that after\n2000 the Taylor formula does not accurately reflect\nthe information used by the FOMC as input to its\ndeliberations.\nNote that the target funds rate predicted by\nthe Taylor formula generally tracks the actual\nfunds rate through 2000, though there are sizable\nand persistent deviations of the funds rate from\nthe values predicted by the formula. Nevertheless\nseveral of these episodes are consistent with a\nsystematic monetary policy. First, in 1989, the\n\n1\n\nTaylor compared the values of his formula against the observed history of the funds rate from 1987 through 1992.\n\n2\n\nIn the figure, the Taylor formula is evaluated on the basis of “real time” information that could have been used in reaching a policy decision.\nSince May 17, 1989, all changes in the intended funds rate have been 25 basis points or multiples thereof. Since April 18, 1994, all changes\nin the intended funds rate have been voted on by the FOMC either at a regularly scheduled meeting or on an intermeeting conference call.\n\n3\n\n\fFEDERAL RESERVE\n\nFigure 1\nGreenspan Years: Federal Funds Rate and Taylor Rule\n(CPI p* = 2.0, r* = 2.0) a = 1.5, b = 0.5\nPercent\n12\n\nBoard’s Output Gap: CPI, 1987:09–2000:10\nFederal Funds Rate\n\n10\n\nCBO Output Gap: CPI, 2000:11–2006:06\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n1986\n\n1988\n\n1990\n\n1992\n\n1994\n\n1996\n\n1998\n\n2000\n\n2002\n\n2004\n\nFOMC Meeting Dates\n\nFOMC increased the target funds rate more quickly\nthan predicted by the formula, suggesting that the\nCommittee responded more vigorously to rising\ninflation than incorporated in the Taylor specification. Second, during 1990-91, the FOMC reduced\nthe funds rate more quickly than predicted by the\nformula, suggesting a stronger response to the\nrecession than incorporated in the Taylor specification. Third, between late September 1992 and\nFebruary 1994, the target funds rate was held at\na lower level (3 percent) than predicted by the\nTaylor specification. It was during this period that\nthe FOMC expressed concern about “financial\nheadwinds” that were restraining the recovery\nfrom the 1990-91 recession. Finally, in the fall of\n1998, the FOMC lowered the funds rate when the\nTaylor specification predicted that the rate would\nbe held constant. At this time, concern about\nfinancial stability figured strongly in policy deliberations in the wake of the Asian financial crisis,\nthe Russian Default, and the collapse of Long Term\nCapital Management (LTCM).\nThe FOMC, and certainly John Taylor himself,\nview the Taylor rule as a general guideline. Depar4\n\ntures from the rule make good sense when information beyond that incorporated in the rule is\navailable. For example, policy is forward looking,\nwhich means that from time to time the economic\noutlook changes sufficiently that it makes sense\nfor the FOMC to set a funds rate target either above\nor below the level called for in the Taylor rule,\nwhich relies on observed recent data rather than\non economic forecasts of future data. Other circumstances—an obvious example is September 11,\n2001—call for a policy response. These responses\ncan be and generally are understood by the market.\nThus, such responses can be every bit as systematic as the responses specified in the Taylor rule.\n\nCredibility of the Inflation Objective\nA critical ingredient in the Taylor specification\nas a description of monetary policy is the longrun target rate of inflation. In practice, financial\nmarket participants and the public in general\ncannot adequately understand the Fed’s monetary\npolicy—that is, the strategic thinking that guides\nthe sequence of individual policy actions—with-\n\n\fUnderstanding the Fed\n\nout a good understanding of what the FOMC considers to be an acceptable long-run average rate\nof inflation. When monetary policymakers articulate their goal for long-run inflation and pursue\ncredible policies to achieve that goal, they provide\nthe basis for “anchoring” the inflation expectations\nthat guide consumption behavior of households\nand investment decisions of firms. Inflation expectations also determine the inflation premiums in\nnominal interest rates that are required to equilibrate financial markets.\nEvidence suggests, particularly in the U.S.\neconomy, that the actual inflation experience is\ndriven by inflation expectations, resource utilization—usually measured by a gap term as in the\nTaylor rule—and “supply shocks” such as changes\nin the world market prices of energy and other\ncommodities. Of these, the most significant factor\nhistorically has been the influence of inflation\nexpectations. Hence, when the anchor for inflation expectations begins to drag, actual inflation\nbecomes volatile, and the resulting distortions to\neconomic activity and conditions in financial\nmarkets produce significant disruptions in the\neconomy. The most recent severe example from\nour economic history of inflation expectations\ngetting out of control occurred in 1977-79.\nIt is a terrible thing if monetary policymakers\nlose their credibility that they will maintain low\nand stable long-run inflation. Once credibility is\nimpaired, it can only be re-established the “old\nfashioned way”—policymakers have to earn it!\nRestoring credibility takes time in the face of substantial persistence in the actual inflation process.\nIt took well over a decade to completely restore\nlow inflation in the United States after the Great\nInflation of the 1970s, and in the process the\neconomy experienced the worst recession, in\n1981-82, since the Great Depression.\n\nINTERPRETING NEW\nINFORMATION\nFinancial market participants form expectations with respect to the prospective state of the\n3\n\neconomy from evidence of the current state of the\neconomy as indicated in regular data releases,\nand other activities, such as political events and\npolicy actions that influence economic activity\nand market prices. The evidence for such forwardlooking expectations is widespread. Futures contracts in commodities, interest rates, and foreign\nexchange are actively traded in large volume on\norganized exchanges. Surveys of forecasts of\nforthcoming data releases appear regularly (e.g.,\nThe Ticker, which appears every Monday in the\nWall Street Journal, and the Calendar of Releases,\nwhich appears each Friday on the cover page of\nU.S. Financial Data published by the Federal\nReserve Bank of St. Louis).3 Prices in financial\nmarkets respond to differences between the\nobserved information on the economic situation\nand the expectations about such information—\nthat is, markets respond to “news.”\nThere are many claims but no convincing\ndocumented evidence of lagged responses to\n“news.” Economic theory suggests that market\nprices of assets should behave like random\nwalks—that the accumulated information at a\npoint in time should have no predictive power\nfor future changes in prices. Put another way, new\ninformation is quickly reflected in market prices,\nleaving no remaining predictable change in market\nprices that would permit an investor to expect\nan above-normal return from buying or selling\nthe asset.\nA huge body of empirical research is broadly\nconsistent with this hypothesis. Thus, market\ncommentary that today’s market adjustments are\ncaused by, or due to, continuing concerns over\nimplications of old information are of doubtful\nvalidity. Traders, financial journalists, and economic pundits seem to believe that they have to\nattribute market adjustments to something, even\nwhen there is no evidence to support the asserted\nreasons.\nAn analyst who is presumed to be an expert\nought often to say that price changes appear inexplicable or random. But few experts in fact say\nsuch a thing. Therefore, I recommend that the\n\nThe latter data are from a survey conducted by Thomson Financial.\n\n5\n\n\fFEDERAL RESERVE\n\nFigure 2\nActual and Predicted Changes in Eurodollar Yields, 3-Month Horizon\n3-Month Actual Eurodollar Yield Change (basis points)\n300\nCorrelation of Predicted Changes\nwith Actual Changes = 0.65\n\nPerfect Forecast Line\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\nMarch 1995\n–100\n\n–200\nBlue = Dec 1994–June 2003\n\nMarch 2001\n\nBlack = Sept 2003–June 2006\n–300\n–300\n\n–200\n\n–100\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n3-Month-Ahead Predicted Eurodollar Yield Change (basis points)\n\nwary observer be skeptical about purported explanations for price changes and should always\ncheck an explanation against behavior in other\nmarkets. In my experience, explanations for stock\nmarket fluctuations are especially suspect. In\nrecent years, I have often read claims that the\nstock market went down because of interest rate\nfears, only to find that interest rates in the bond\nmarket were unchanged or went down instead of\nup. Given that so many institutions deal in both\nthe equity and bond markets, it makes absolutely\nno sense that interest rate fears could drive down\nstock prices and have no effect on interest rates.\nClearly, Federal Reserve policy adjustments\nand market expectations about future policy\n4\n\n6\n\nadjustments do explain some stock market fluctuations. I accept that fact. Indeed, the transmission\nmechanism linking monetary policy decisions to\nchanges in the inflation rate and employment\nrequire such effects. But, I really don’t want to be\nheld responsible for stock market fluctuations\nthat occurred for other reasons or are simply\ninexplicable! So, next time you read that the stock\nmarket went down because of “interest rate fears,”\nplease do take a quick look at the bond tables to\nsee if interest rates actually changed that day.4\nNew information drives both market adjustments and policy changes. Policy decisions ordinarily cannot be set long in advance because the\n\nThose who report on the stock market do not confine their misleading causal statements to the Fed. In mid-August 2006, the Dow Jones\naverage closed down over 90 points, attributed by at least one report to “oil price fears.” Looking at trading in the oil markets, September oil\nfutures on the NYMEX exchange closed up only 4 cents, but October futures closed down 19 cents.\n\n\fUnderstanding the Fed\n\nFigure 3\nActual and Predicted Changes in Eurodollar Yields, 6-Month Horizon\n6-Month Actual Eurodollar Yield Change (basis points)\n300\nCorrelation of Predicted Changes\nwith Actual Changes = 0.54\n\nPerfect Forecast Line\n\n200\n\n100\n\nJune 1995\n–100\nDec 2000\n\n–200\nBlue = Dec 1994–June 2003\n\nJune 2001\n\n–300\n–300\n\n–200\n\n–100\n\nBlack = Dec 2003–June 2006\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n6-Month-Ahead Predicted Eurodollar Yield Change (basis points)\n\nFOMC must be open to changing its policy stance\nin response to new information, which is inherently unpredictable. To gain a sense of the impact\nof new information on interest rates, I’ll analyze\ndata from the eurodollar futures market. Eurodollar\ndeposits are not federal funds, though changes\nin the two yields are highly correlated. To study\nmarket expectations about the federal funds rate\nover horizons of four or more months, it is best\nto use eurodollar futures because these contracts\nare actively traded over far future horizons,\nwhereas trading of federal funds futures is relatively thin on horizons of more than a few months.\nPrices in the eurodollar futures market provide direct information on market expectations\nof future FOMC policy actions setting the target\n5\n\nfederal funds rate. Consider the forecasting record\non three-month and six-month horizons. Figure 2\nfocuses on the difference between the yield on a\nthree-month eurodollar futures contract with three\nmonths to maturity and the actual eurodollar\ndeposit yield. This difference is plotted on the\nhorizontal axis against the actual change in the\nyield on eurodollar deposits over the corresponding three months to the maturity date on the vertical axis. Thus, the three-month actual change\nin the eurodollar deposit rate is plotted against\nthe forecasted change in the eurodollar deposit\nyield over the same time period. The observations\nare taken every three months starting in December\n1994.5 The same exercise is repeated at a sixmonth horizon in Figure 3.\n\nHence, the observations are nonoverlapping.\n\n7\n\n\fFEDERAL RESERVE\n\nIn each of the two graphs, the diagonal line\nfrom the lower left to the upper right represents a\nline of perfect forecasts—if all the points lay along\nthis line, the eurodollar futures market would\nnever have made any errors in forecasting the\nchange in the eurodollar yield over the succeeding three (six) months. It is evident from the figures\nthat the futures markets fall short of such perfection. In fact, over the entire period, the correlation\nbetween the forecast changes and the actual\nchanges on a three-month horizon is only 0.65; on\nthe six-month horizon the correlation falls to 0.54.\nAs an aside, note that economists and statisticians usually measure forecasting accuracy by the\nsquare of the correlation coefficient, or R 2. Thus,\na correlation of 0.65 is an R 2 of 0.42, which means\nthat the forecasts embedded in the eurodollar\nfutures market explain 42 percent of the variance\nof fluctuations in the actual eurodollar yield. Thus,\nunpredictable events even over a three-month\nhorizon are responsible for more than half of the\nvariance of the eurodollar yield. Over a six-month\nhorizon, the R 2 is 0.29, which means that unpredictable events are responsible for more than 70\npercent of the variance over a six-month horizon.\nThe overall correlations mask some interesting\ndetails. The points plotted in black in each figure\nrepresent observations since the middle of 2003,\nwhen the FOMC started providing “forward\nguidance” regarding future policy actions. Note\nthat these points scatter fairly tightly around the\nline of perfect forecasts—markets were not particularly surprised by the evolution of policy actions\nover this period. In contrast, consider the forecasts\nfor the first half of 1995. The three-month and\nsix-month futures market forecasts in December\n1994 were for large positive changes in the eurodollar deposit rate over the succeeding three and\nsix months. In the event, the eurodollar deposit\nrate fell a bit over these horizons. The December\n1994 futures prices were observed shortly after\nthe FOMC increased the funds rate target by 75\nbasis points in November 1994, and the market\nhad expected further substantial increases. In fact,\nthe FOMC increased the funds rate target by only\n6\n\n8\n\nSee, for example, Poole (2005).\n\n50 basis points in the first half of 1995 (at the\nJanuary FOMC meeting).\nAnother large miss occurred in December\n2000. At that time, the futures market forecasts\nwere for a decline in the eurodollar yield of 35\nbasis points over the following three months and\na total of 67 basis points over the six-month\nperiod. Instead, the FOMC acted aggressively to\nlower the funds rate target starting in January and\ncontinuing through May 2001 by a total of 250\nbasis points. The FOMC acted aggressively as\nincoming information pointed to growing weakness in economic activity. Both the FOMC and the\nmarkets were surprised by incoming information\nindicating that the economy was weakening\nquickly and significantly.\nIt is rare that a single data report is decisive\nfor the FOMC. The economic outlook is determined by numerous pieces of information. Important data such as the inflation and the employment\nreports are cross-checked against other information. The FOMC is aware of the possibility of data\nrevisions and short-run anomalies.\nMy key point is that market commentary\nindicating that the FOMC is unpredictable is off\nbase. Typically, the FOMC cannot be predictable\nbecause new information driving policy adjustments is not predictable. All of us would like to\nbe able to predict the future. We in the Fed do the\nbest we can, but the markets should not complain\nthat the FOMC lacks clairvoyance! What the\nFOMC strives to do is to respond systematically\nto the new information. There is considerable\nevidence that the market does successfully predict\nFOMC responses to the available information at\nthe time of regularly scheduled meetings.6\n\nFOMC PROCESSES\nThe Board of Governors and the Reserve Banks\nare fortunate to have highly professional, nonpolitical staffs of economists. The role of the staff is\nto provide analysis of current economic conditions, forecasts of the evolution of the economy\n\n\fUnderstanding the Fed\n\nover a horizon of a couple of years, and assessments of the risks to those forecasts. Such information is a valuable and valued input into policy\ndiscussions. I myself do not finally make up my\nmind on a policy position until I’ve heard both\nstaff presentations and the views of other FOMC\nparticipants. More accurately, I go into each FOMC\nmeeting with a view on the appropriate policy\naction given my assessment of the economic outlook, but I try to be as open as I can to having my\nview altered by discussion at the FOMC meeting.\nThere are certainly instances when I have changed\nthe view I took into the meeting as a consequence\nof the discussion.\n\nDistinction Between Members and\nParticipants\nExcept when there are vacancies in offices,\nthere are 19 principals, or participants, at each\nFOMC meeting—the 7 members of the Board of\nGovernors and the 12 Reserve Bank presidents.\nAll of these participants are fully engaged in presenting their views. They bring information from\ntheir business and academic contacts, comment\non staff presentations, discuss analytical issues\nrelevant to understanding the economy and policy\nissues, and present their views as to the most\nappropriate policy action. However, at any particular meeting there are only 12 voting members\nof the Committee. Each of the 7 members of the\nBoard of Governors is a permanent member of\nthe FOMC. The president of the Federal Reserve\nBank of New York is also a permanent member.\nThe remaining Federal Reserve Bank presidents\nrotate as members of the FOMC. As president of\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, I am in a\nrotation group with the presidents of the Federal\nReserve Banks of Atlanta and Dallas. This structure of the FOMC dates from 1942. In the early\nyears of the FOMC, not all the principals were\nallowed to participate, or even attend, meetings\nat which they were not voting members of the\nCommittee.\nThe purpose of FOMC meetings is to reach a\nconsensus among the participants and, particularly, among the members about the appropriate\n\npolicy action (setting of the funds rate target) given\npolicy goals and the outlook for the economy.\nUnanimous decisions, while desirable, are not\nrequired, and members are free to dissent from\nthe consensus view if they feel strongly that an\nalternative policy action is preferable. Indeed, I\nbelieve that it is my obligation under the Federal\nReserve Act to dissent when I believe strongly\nthat an alternative policy course would be better.\nHistorically, dissents were not unusual; though,\nin the recent years, they have been relatively rare.\n\nCommunication\nOnce policy action has been set, it is absolutely necessary that communication to the public\nabout the policy action not be garbled. Hence,\nthe Chairman is the only participant who speaks\nofficially for the Committee. He presents official\nFederal Reserve positions through testimony\nbefore congressional committees and in public\nspeeches. The minutes of FOMC meetings, currently released three weeks after each meeting, also\nrepresent the official position of the Committee.\nParticipants other than the Chairman express\ntheir own views in speeches. These speeches often\nmay seem to reflect a “party line” but are rarely\ncentrally coordinated in any way. In my experience, the only time there has been a real effort to\ncoordinate public comments by the participants\nwas in the late summer of 1998. At that time,\nfinancial markets were skittish as a result of the\nRussian default and financial troubles of LTCM.\nI recall an informal gathering in the late summer\nof 1998 with Chairman Greenspan and a couple\nof other FOMC members when the Chairman made\na request that we say very little given the rather\ntense state of the markets as the LTCM situation\nunfolded.\nSeeming coordination at other times is a consequence of the fact that FOMC participants\nordinarily see things quite similarly. But most\nparticipants are not shy about expressing their\ndifferences. Differences are registered in a formal\nway through discount rate decisions of the Reserve\nBanks and informally through positions stated\nin speeches. Anyone can obtain an excellent feel\n9\n\n\fFEDERAL RESERVE\n\nfor what goes on at an FOMC meeting by reading\ntranscripts that are released with a lag of five years\nand are made available on the website of the\nBoard of Governors.\n\nDealing with the Press\nDifferent FOMC participants have different\nattitudes and comfort levels in dealing with the\npress. I myself give many speeches and almost\nalways talk with the press after my speeches.\nI try to be as clear as I can, but from time to time\nI realize after the fact that I have not expressed\nmyself as clearly as I would have liked. When\nreading press accounts, be aware that FOMC members misspeak from time to time and press interpretations are not always as intended. We all try\nto be as careful as possible but are not infallible.\nBe wary of headlines. Reporters will tell you that\nthey are sometimes frustrated with the headlines\nthat appear over their stories. Be aware also that\nwire service reports are sometimes designed to\nmove markets. Considerations behind policy\nadjustments are often complex—be cautious\nabout simple interpretations.\nI believe that one of my responsibilities is to\ncommunicate to a wider audience through the\npress, doing the best I can to be accurate and to\nconvey both policy fundamentals and policy\nnuances. A well-informed public is essential to\nan effective monetary policy. In my experience,\npress reports are generally, but not always, accurate. The financial journalists with whom I interact\nare genuinely interested in getting the story right.\nThey do ask probing questions, as they should,\nbut do not try to impose their own personal slant\nto the reports they publish. Inaccuracies are generally a consequence of the complexity of the subject and the need, on my part and the journalists’\npart, to make reports simple enough for a wide\naudience to understand.\nWhen talking with the press, one of the points\nI try to convey is that I do not come to a firm conclusion about my policy position until just before\nthe FOMC meeting; as I have said, even then, I\ndo my best to maintain an open mind, which can\nbe changed by the staff presentation and general\n10\n\ndiscussion at the meeting itself. I have already\ndocumented the most important reason for this\npolicy of mine. Inherently unpredictable information can arrive right up to the day of the meeting.\nIt would not be sound practice for policymakers\nto lock themselves into decisions impervious to\nnew information.\nAnother reason why I ordinarily do not have\na settled policy position weeks before an FOMC\nmeeting is this: I follow economic reports continuously between FOMC meetings, but do not\nordinarily dig deeply into them until the period\nof intense preparation the week before an FOMC\nmeeting. Thus, my views on incoming information\nare often tentative and incomplete; I know that\nI’ll be reviewing all available information in the\nintense preparation period. I believe that it would\nnot be helpful to the markets for me to convey\nviews that I know are tentative and incomplete;\nthus, I try not to speculate about the significance\nof new information for the policy decision to be\ndebated at the next FOMC meeting. My responsibility is to convey accurate information and,\nequally, not to be a source of misleading or inaccurate interpretations of incoming information.\n\nBottom Line\nThe Federal Reserve has the responsibility to\nprovide leadership. The ideal situation is when\nthe market can reasonably predict what the Fed\nis going to do because the Fed has provided the\nleadership to make clear its objectives and how\nit pursues those objectives. The Fed is not and\nought not to be viewed as an adversary of the\nmarkets. Policy actions and statements do have\nmarket effects. Those are unavoidable, but the Fed\nstrives to make policy as clear as it can so that\nwhat is really surprising the markets is not Fed\nactions but the arrival of new information that\nsurprises the Fed and markets together.\nI’ve tried to answer questions that are commonly put to me and to provide a general framework for better understanding of the Federal\nReserve. And I hope that I have provoked some\nadditional questions.\n\n\fUnderstanding the Fed\n\nREFERENCES\nBernanke, Ben S. “The Benefits of Price Stability.”\nRemarks at the Center for Economic Policy Studies,\nWoodrow Wilson School of Public and International\nAffairs, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ,\nFebruary 24, 2006a; www.federalreserve.gov/\nboardDocs/Speeches/2006/200602242/default.htm.\nBernanke, Ben S.

Kanawha Scales and Systems is a\ncompany located in Poca, West Virginia, which\nhas a population of roughly 1,000. Chinese purchases of this company’s coal-loading machines\nhave grown to account for about one-third of\nthe company’s $50 million in annual revenues.1\nHow many stories are there like the Kanawha\nScales story? Well, I’ll share another example. A\nrecent report indicates that a group from Kentucky\nwill be involved in the construction of a Thoroughbred racetrack in China, the first in mainland\nChina.2 As part of this deal, 1,500 Kentucky\nThoroughbreds will be sold and shipped to China\nand it is also possible that a number of Chinese\nwill come to Kentucky to learn how to be trainers,\nexercise riders, jockeys, grooms, and hot walkers.\nAre these isolated examples? Just how important to the United States are sales of U.S. goods\nand services to China?\nMy purpose this morning is to convince you\nthat the answer to this question is clear. Sales of\nU.S. goods and services to China are large, are\ngrowing, and are very important to the United\nStates. In fact, as I’ll detail shortly, firms in the\n\n16 member states of the Southern Legislative\nConference (SLC) are engaged in substantial\nexporting activity to China. I’ll discuss major\nfeatures of the economic relationship between\nthe United States and China, but with special\nemphasis on U.S. exports to China because that\ncritically important part of the relationship is not\nwell understood.\nBefore proceeding, I want to emphasize that\nthe views I express here are mine and do not\nnecessarily reflect official positions of the Federal\nReserve System. I thank my colleagues at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for their comments, particularly Cletus C. Coughlin, vice\npresident and deputy director of Research, who\nprovided special assistance.\n\nTRADE PROSPECTS\nIncreases in international trade depend on\nthree key factors—income growth, reductions in\ntrade barriers, and declines in transportation costs.\nIncome growth has been the most important of\nthese three factors stimulating increased trade\nworldwide, with reductions in trade barriers a\ndistant second and declines in transportation\ncosts an even more distant third.3 The direct impli-\n\n1\n\nSee www.usatoday.com/money/world/2006-04-19-china-exports-usat_x.htm.\n\n2\n\nSee http://charlotte.bizjournals.com/charlotte/stories/2006/03/20/ story6.html.\n\n3\n\nSee Baier and Bergstrand (2001). Trade barriers and transportation costs are key components of trade costs, which are discussed in detail by\nAnderson and van Wincoop (2004).\n\n1\n\n\fINTERNATIONAL TRADE AND FINANCE\n\ncation of this research finding is that any discussion of trade flows should begin by examining\nincome growth. In fact, almost without exception\nover the past 55 years, growth in world merchandise exports has exceeded growth in gross domestic product (GDP).4 (See Figure 1.)\nIt is reasonable, therefore, to anticipate a\nstrong relationship between Chinese growth and\nU.S. exports, and that’s exactly what we observe.\nThe transformation of the Chinese economy has\nbeen accompanied by a huge increase in international trade and capital flows. U.S. exports to\nChina have also been spurred by reductions in\nChinese trade barriers, especially as part of China’s\nentry into the World Trade Organization in 2001.\nIn addition to a substantial decline since 1982\nin import tariffs, in 2005 China eliminated the\nlicenses that were required for the importation\nof many goods.5\n\nCHINESE AND U.S. GROWTH\nChina, with a population in excess of one\nbillion, has maintained an astonishing rate of\neconomic growth over the past 28 years. Beginning\nin 1978, China embarked on a series of policy\nchanges that have led to an economy increasingly\nreliant on markets and price signals for allocating\nproductive resources.6\nAs of July 2006, the Chinese population was\n1.3 billion, which is more than four times as large\nas the U.S. population of 298 million. In terms of\ntotal production, measured in dollars at purchasing power parity, the Chinese economy is the\nworld’s second-largest economy, trailing only the\nUnited States. In 2005 the Chinese GDP exceeded\n\n$8 trillion, which was roughly two-thirds the U.S.\nGDP. (See Figure 2.) Not surprisingly, these two\ncountries were two of the three leading exporting and importing countries in the world.7 (See\nFigure 3.)\nThe most vivid illustration of rapid Chinese\ngrowth can be seen by examining the Chinese\neconomy on a per capita basis. Adjusted for inflation, China’s per capita GDP in 2004 was 6.6 times\nits 1980 level. (See Figure 4.) Annual growth rates\nof real per capita GDP in excess of 5 percent have\nbeen the norm in recent years. (See Figure 5.) In\nthe late 1970s, China’s real GDP per capita was\nslightly less than 5 percent of the U.S. level. Today\nit exceeds 10 percent. (See Figure 6.) Thus,\nalthough the overall Chinese economy is large,\nChina is still a country with a relatively low level\nof per capita income. To provide perspective,\nChina’s real per capita GDP today is about equal\nto U.S. per capita GDP in 1886.\n\nTHEORY OF INTEGRATING A\nLARGE LABOR-ABUNDANT\nCOUNTRY INTO THE WORLD\nECONOMY\nSome basic economic theory will provide a\nfoundation for viewing the integration of the\nChinese economy into the world economy. The\nanalysis applies not only to the integration of\nthe Chinese economy but also to similar developments that are occurring simultaneously in India\nand the countries of the former Soviet Union.8\nEconomists view the integration of these\neconomies into the global economy as a labor\n“shock.” Their integration can be viewed as a\n\n4\n\nUsing annual data from the World Trade Organization’s International Trade Statistics 2005, world merchandise export growth exceeded\nworld GDP growth in all but eight years between 1950 and 2004.\n\n5\n\nSee “Building Explosion in China Pumps Up Exports from USA,” a web article at www.usatoday.com/money/world/\n2006-04-19-china-exports-usat_x.htm in USA Today.\n\n6\n\nPrasad and Rajan (2006) estimate that between one-half and two-thirds of the Chinese economy is currently market-based.\n\n7\n\nFor 2004, the leading countries in terms of total world exports were Germany with a 10.0 percent share, the United States with an 8.9 percent\nshare, and China with a 6.5 percent share. In terms of imports, the leading countries were the United States with a 16.1 percent share,\nGermany with a 7.6 percent share, and China with a 5.9 percent share.\n\n8\n\nThis idea has been expressed by Wolf (2006).\n\n2\n\n\fChinese Growth: A Source of U.S. Export Opportunities\n\nFigure 1\nWorld Merchandise Export Growth and GDP Growth, 1950-2004\nGrowth (% year/year)\n16\n12\n9.0\n2004\n\nExport Growth\n8\n4\n\n3.7\n2004\n\nGDP Growth\n0\n\n–0.6\n1981\n\n–4\n\n–2.8\n1958\n\n–7.3\n1975\n\n54\n\n57\n19\n60\n19\n63\n19\n66\n19\n69\n19\n72\n19\n75\n19\n78\n19\n81\n19\n84\n19\n87\n19\n90\n19\n93\n19\n96\n19\n99\n20\n02\n\n19\n\n19\n\n51\n\n–8\n\n19\n\n–0.6\n2001\n\n–2.2\n1988\n\nSOURCE: World Trade Organization, International Trade Statistics 2005.\n\nFigure 2\nChina: The World’s Second-Largest Single Economy in Terms of Purchasing Power Parity\n$12.37\n\nU.S.\nE.U.\nChina\n\n$8.16\n\nJapan\nIndia\nGermany\nU.K.\nFrance\nItaly\nBrazil\nRussia\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n$ Trillions in 2005\n\nSOURCE: CIA World Factbook.\n\n3\n\n\fINTERNATIONAL TRADE AND FINANCE\n\nFigure 3\nLeading Exporters and Importers in World Merchandise Trade, 2004\n\nRank\n\nExporters\n\nValue\n($ billions)\n\nShare\n(%)\n\nRank\n\nImporters\n\nValue\n($ billions)\n\nShare\n(%)\n\n1,525.5\n\n16.1\n\n716.9\n\n7.6\n\n1\n\nGermany\n\n912.3\n\n10.0\n\n1\n\nUnited States\n\n2\n\nUnited States\n\n818.8\n\n8.9\n\n2\n\nGermany\n\n3\n\nChina\n\n593.3\n\n6.5\n\n3\n\nChina\n\n561.2\n\n5.9\n\n4\n\nJapan\n\n565.8\n\n6.2\n\n4\n\nFrance\n\n465.5\n\n4.9\n\n5\n\nFrance\n\n448.7\n\n4.9\n\n5\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n463.5\n\n4.9\n\n6\n\nNetherlands\n\n358.2\n\n3.9\n\n6\n\nJapan\n\n454.5\n\n4.8\n\n7\n\nItaly\n\n349.2\n\n3.8\n\n7\n\nItaly\n\n351.0\n\n3.7\n\n8\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n346.9\n\n3.8\n\n8\n\nNetherlands\n\n319.0\n\n3.4\n\n9\n\nCanada\n\n316.5\n\n3.5\n\n9\n\nBelgium\n\n285.5\n\n3.0\n\n10\n\nBelgium\n\n306.5\n\n3.3\n\n10\n\nCanada\n\n279.8\n\n2.9\n\nSOURCE: World Trade Organization.\n\nFigure 4\nChina’s GDP per Capita\nRMB\n12,000\n10,000\n8,000\n6,000\n4,000\n2,000\n\n0\n20\n0\n\n5\n19\n9\n\n0\n19\n9\n\n5\n19\n8\n\n0\n19\n8\n\n5\n19\n7\n\n0\n19\n7\n\n5\n19\n6\n\n19\n6\n\n0\n\n0\n\nSOURCE: National Bureau of Statistics, China Statistical Yearbook 2004; National Bureau of Statistics Plan Report.\n\n4\n\n\fChinese Growth: A Source of U.S. Export Opportunities\n\nFigure 5\nChinese and U.S. Growth Rates of Real GDP per Capita\nPercent\n15\n\n10\nChina\n5\nU.S.\n0\n\n–5\n\n0\n\n19\n9\n\n20\n0\n\n5\n\n0\n19\n9\n\n5\n19\n8\n\n0\n19\n8\n\n5\n19\n7\n\n0\n19\n7\n\n5\n19\n6\n\n0\n19\n6\n\n5\n19\n5\n\n19\n5\n\n0\n\n–10\n\nSOURCE: Penn World Tables (constant prices: chain series).\n\nFigure 6\nChina’s Real GDP per Capita Relative to the U.S.\nPercent\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n20\n0\n\n19\n9\n\n5\n\n0\n19\n9\n\n5\n19\n8\n\n0\n19\n8\n\n5\n19\n7\n\n0\n19\n7\n\n5\n19\n6\n\n0\n19\n6\n\n5\n19\n5\n\n19\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\nSOURCE: Penn World Tables (U.S. = 100 in current prices).\n\n5\n\n\fINTERNATIONAL TRADE AND FINANCE\n\nvery large increase in the world’s effective labor\nsupply. To facilitate my discussion, assume that\nthe bulk of this increase in the labor supply in\nrecent years has tended to be low-skilled. Employing this simplifying assumption, two consequences\nare a direct result of the increased supply of lowskilled labor. One is that wages of low-skilled\nlabor in high-income countries will tend to fall,\nor to increase more slowly, than before China’s\nentry into the world trading system. Second, prices\nof those goods that require relatively large amounts\nof low-skilled labor should tend to decline relative\nto the prices of those goods that require relatively\nlarge amounts of high-skilled labor. For convenience of exposition, I’ll refer to goods produced\nwith low-skilled labor as “low-tech” goods and\ngoods produced with high-skilled labor as “hightech” goods. Obviously, there is a continuum of\ngoods from low to high tech, but the simplification\nwill make it easy to understand the basic economic\nforces at work.\nThe first effect tends to depress income gains\nof low-skilled labor in high-income countries.\nObviously, the share in total population of highskilled workers is greater in high-income countries\nthan in low-income countries. Because of the large\nincrease in low-skilled workers worldwide, lowskilled workers in the United States are likely to\nexperience downward pressure on their real wages\ndue to the increased competition associated with\nChinese exports.9 The adverse income change\ngenerates demands for a government response to\nameliorate the adverse market change.\nThe problem is real: Low-skilled workers in\nthe United States have been adversely affected by\nimports of goods produced by low-skilled workers\nabroad. However, the nature of the government\nresponse is very important. Trade restrictions that\nhinder the importation of goods from China are\n\nunlikely to be a good solution because the United\nStates would simply be forgoing the benefits of\nChinese imports. Indeed, those lower-priced goods\nare important to lower-income, working families\nin the United States. The only appealing solution\nfor the United States as a whole is to adopt policies that will increase the skill levels of affected\nworkers, so that they can increase their compensation and employment prospects, which will\nallow them to adjust to the evolving economic\nenvironment.\nNow consider the effect tending to reduce\nthe prices of goods made with low-skilled labor.\nThis relative price change, in which low-tech\ngoods decline in price relative to high-tech goods,\nis associated with two other important price\nchanges. The first involves a country’s terms of\ntrade, which is the (average) price of a country’s\nexports relative to the (average) price of its imports.\nIn the case of China, the prices of the goods that\nChina ships to the rest of the world should tend\nto decline relative to the prices of goods that it\nbuys from the rest of the world.\nGenerally speaking, as the price of Chinese\nexports declines relative to the price of its imports,\ncountries purchasing Chinese goods should\nbecome better off. In theory, the more dissimilar\nanother country’s production and consumption\nis to China’s, the more likely the country is to benefit by China’s integration into the world economy.\nThus, a country such as the United States should\ntend to benefit from China’s integration. Of course,\nthe magnitude of the gains for the United States\ndepends on the impact of Chinese exports on U.S.\nimport prices. Recent research by staff economists\nat the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem found that Chinese exports have caused\ndeclines, albeit small, in U.S. import prices.10,11\nThe public-policy challenge is considerable, how-\n\n9\n\nIn fact, declining real compensation for low-skilled workers has been an issue for many years in the United States.\n\n10\n\nSee Kamin, Marazzi, and Schindler (2006).\n\n11\n\nRodrik (2006) argues that China’s export bundle is more sophisticated than other countries with similar per capita incomes. While laborintensive exports, such as toys, clothing, and electronics products that entail simple assembly operations, are important in China’s export\nbasket, Rodrik argues that foreign investment has played a major role in the evolution of Chinese exports. Foreign investors dominate\nChinese exports. Their contribution of advanced technology, and the resulting transfer of technology, has resulted in Chinese exports that are\nrelatively more sophisticated than those of comparably developed countries.\n\n6\n\n\fChinese Growth: A Source of U.S. Export Opportunities\n\never, because gains for the United States as a whole\nare accompanied by downward pressure on wages\nof U.S. low-skilled workers, as already noted.\nThere is another change that reduces and\npossibly negates the net benefits for the United\nStates. Coinciding with China’s rapid growth\nhas been substantial increases in China’s imports\nof commodities such as oil. In fact, China has\nbecome the world’s second largest consumer of\noil. Chinese demand for oil has undoubtedly\ncontributed to higher oil prices. Given the scale\nof U.S. oil imports, higher oil prices have certainly\nreduced the beneficial effects for the United States\nof recent developments in China.12\n\nHOW CHINESE GROWTH\nAFFECTS TRADE\nThe preceding discussion has focused on the\nrelative-price impacts of China’s integration into\nthe world economy. Changes in relative prices,\nhowever, are not the only spur to changes in\neconomic activity. China’s economy has reached\nsuch a size that in recent years it has served as an\nengine of growth not only in Asia but also worldwide. Put simply, a wealthier China means rising\nChinese demand for goods of all sorts, including\nhigh-tech goods that China does not produce.\nOne manifestation of this fact is that Chinese\ngrowth has resulted in large effects on overall trade\nflows. The integration of the Chinese economy\ninto the world economy can be seen very clearly\nby examining how Chinese exports and imports\nhave changed since the late 1970s. In 1979,\nChinese exports as a share of Chinese GDP was\n5 percent. Since then the share has risen to 36\npercent. (See Figure 7.) The course of Chinese\nimports has taken a similar path, rising from\nroughly 6 percent of GDP in 1979 to 34 percent\nin 2005. These import and export shares may be\ncompared with the shares for the United States:\nImports are 16 percent of U.S. GDP and exports\nare 10 percent.\n12\n\nAs Chinese exports have grown faster than its\nimports, the Chinese trade balance has increased.\nA close look at China’s trade balance reveals that\nfrom 1979 to the mid-1990s, the average yearly\nbalance was roughly zero. (See Figure 8.) Since\nthe mid-1990s, the balance has tended to rise,\nreaching a level of $102 billion in 2005, which is\n4.4 percent of China’s GDP.\n\nUNITED STATES–CHINA TRADE\nThe increase of China’s trade surplus since the\nmid-1990s coincides with a substantial increase\nin the United States–China bilateral trade balance.\nIn 1995 the U.S. bilateral trade deficit with China\nwas approximately $20 billion. (See Figure 9.)\nSubsequently, this deficit has increased yearly,\nreaching $202 billion for 2005, which was 28\npercent of the overall U.S. trade deficit. (See\nFigure 10.) Surprisingly, in 1995, China’s share\nof the overall U.S. trade deficit was actually larger,\nat 35 percent of the overall U.S. trade deficit.\nObviously, since 1995 the growth of U.S.\nimports from China has exceeded the growth of\nU.S. exports to China. Between 1995 and 2005,\nU.S. imports from China increased more than\nfivefold, while U.S. exports to China increased\nby a factor of 3.6. (See Figure 11.) But note this\nimportant fact: The growth in U.S. exports to\nChina has been far greater than the growth of U.S.\nexports overall. Between 1995 and 2005, total U.S.\nexports increased by a factor of 1.6, which is less\nthan half the rate of increase of U.S. exports to\nChina. In light of the rapid Chinese growth, it is\nnot surprising that U.S. exports to China rose\nrapidly. It is especially noteworthy that in 1995\nChina was the 13th leading export market for\ngoods produced in the United States and in 2005\nit was the 4th leading export market. Put simply,\na wealthier China is a better market for U.S. goods\nand services, especially for high-tech and agricultural goods, which the United States produces in\nabundance.\n\nNot surprisingly, oil is at the center of a contentious political issue. China’s desire for increased oil supplies has led to relationships with a\nnumber of countries, such as Sudan and Uzbekistan, who many view as unsavory in terms of their records on human rights.\n\n7\n\n\fINTERNATIONAL TRADE AND FINANCE\n\nFigure 7\nChinese Exports and Imports as a Percent of GDP\nPercent\n40\n35\n30\n25\n\nExports\n\n20\n15\n\nImports\n\n10\n5\n\n20\n0\n\n4\n\n9\n19\n9\n\n4\n19\n9\n\n9\n19\n8\n\n19\n8\n\n19\n7\n\n4\n\n9\n\n0\n\nSOURCE: IMF, Direction of Trade Statistics, and official Chinese statistics.\n\nFigure 8\nChina’s Trade Balance, 1979-2005\n$ Billions\n$101.9\n2005\n\n100\n80\n60\n40\n\n$32.0\n2004\n\n20\n0\n\nSOURCE: China Statistical Yearbook.\n\n8\n\n4\n20\n0\n\n9\n19\n9\n\n4\n19\n9\n\n9\n19\n8\n\n4\n19\n8\n\n19\n7\n\n9\n\n–20\n\n\fChinese Growth: A Source of U.S. Export Opportunities\n\nFigure 9\nU.S.–China Bilateral Trade Deficit and U.S. Trade Deficit\n$ Billions\n100,000\nU.S.–China Bilateral Trade Deficit\n\n0\n–100,000\n\n–201.54\n2005\n\n–200,000\n–300,000\n–400,000\n–500,000\n\nU.S. Trade Deficit\n\n–600,000\n–716.73\n2005\n\n–700,000\n\n3\n\n8\n\n20\n0\n\n19\n9\n\n19\n9\n\n3\n\n8\n19\n8\n\n19\n8\n\n19\n7\n\n3\n\n8\n\n–800,000\n\nSOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, Foreign Trade Statistics.\n\nFigure 10\nChina’s Portion of the U.S. Trade Deficit\nPercent\n45\n35\n\n28.12\n2005\n\n25\n15\n5\n–5\n\n3\n20\n0\n\n8\n19\n9\n\n3\n19\n9\n\n8\n19\n8\n\n3\n19\n8\n\n19\n7\n\n8\n\n–15\n\nSOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, Foreign Trade Statistics.\n\n9\n\n\fINTERNATIONAL TRADE AND FINANCE\n\nFigure 11\nU.S. Exports to and Imports from China\n$ Millions\n250,000\n\nImport Growth\n\n200,000\n\n150,000\n\n100,000\n$45,543\n1995\n$11,754\n1995\n\n50,000\n\nExport Growth\n\n5\n20\n0\n\n2\n20\n0\n\n9\n19\n9\n\n6\n19\n9\n\n3\n19\n9\n\n0\n19\n9\n\n7\n19\n8\n\n4\n19\n8\n\n1\n19\n8\n\n19\n7\n\n8\n\n0\n\nSOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, Foreign Trade Statistics.\n\nChinese purchases of U.S. goods took center\nstage during President Hu Jintao’s visit to the\nUnited States last May. During the visit, President\nHu agreed that China would buy $16.2 billion\nworth of Boeing jets and various other goods, such\nas networking equipment, medical devices, and\nbeef. A close look at the top 10 exporting industries to China in 2005 reveals that the industry\ncode including aircraft was the third leading\nexport industry and that the industry code including medical devices was the fourth leading export\nindustry. (See Table 1.) The two leading industry\ncodes were (i) electrical machinery and equipment\nand (ii) nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery, and\nmechanical appliances. Together, these industries\naccounted for 31.5 percent of U.S. exports to China.\nLarge multinational corporations play a major\nrole in U.S. exports to China. However, according\nto the U.S. Commercial Service, since 1992 the\nnumber of small and midsize exporters has\nincreased from 3,143 to 19,201, a gain of 511\npercent.13 I opened my remarks today with an\nexample of exports sales by Kanawha Scales and\n13\n\nSystems. This same phenomenon of small firms\nselling to the Chinese market is found all over the\nUnited States. Consider Sharpe Mixers of Seattle.\nThis firm makes specialized “absorbers mixers”\nthat strip sulfur dioxide from power plant emissions. Chinese power plant construction is proceeding rapidly to meet large increases in power\ndemand. Most of these power plants are coal-fired,\nand Sharpe has seen its Chinese business increase\nsubstantially since receiving its first order in 2004.\nThis additional business has led to 10 additional\nemployees for a total of 30.\n\nEXPORTS FROM SLC MEMBER\nSTATES\nLet’s look more closely at the total exports\nfrom the SLC states to China.

For the remaining 10 states, various commodity codes appear: plastic products\nfor Alabama and West Virginia, oil seeds for\nLouisiana, cotton for Tennessee, wood pulp for\nGeorgia, base metals for Virginia, iron and steel\nproducts for Kentucky, fertilizers for Florida,\nvehicles and parts for Mississippi, and inorganic\nchemicals for Arkansas.\nFor these states, 2005 exports to China range\nfrom $4.9 billion from Texas to $0.1 billion from\nOklahoma. One fact is that, for SLC states, exports\n\nto China relative to gross state product tend to be\nbelow the national average for all states together.\nUsing figures for 2005, only 4 of the 16 SLC states\nhad shares in excess of the national average of\n0.36 percent. Those states were Louisiana (1.1),\nTennessee (0.62), Texas (0.50), and South Carolina\n(0.45).\nWhat is especially encouraging, however, is\nthat firms in the SLC states have played a key role\nin the growth of exports to China. Comparing\n2002 with 2005, total U.S. exports to China\nincreased by a factor of 1.9.

This growing demand for U.S.\ngoods and services provides not only more but\n14\n\nalso better-paying employment opportunities.\nThis simple message is easy to miss because\nthe continuing integration of China into the world\neconomy presents both political and economic\nchallenges. It is still very easy to identify numerous factors that hinder the sales of goods and\nservices to China by U.S. firms.14 Without ques-\n\nE. Anthony Wayne, Assistant Secretary for Economic and Business Affairs in the U.S. Department of State, enumerated many of the contentious issues in a speech on May 25, 2005, at the Executive’s Club of Chicago.\n\n12\n\n\fChinese Growth: A Source of U.S. Export Opportunities\n\ntion, Chinese infringement of intellectual property\nrights remains a problem that limits U.S. exports.\nIn addition, government procurement policies,\nrestrictions involving the wholesale and retail\ndistribution of foreign products in China, and\nthe lack of transparency of many regulations also\nlimit U.S. exports.\nAs I look to the future, I continue to see much\nnegotiation between the Chinese and U.S. governments as well as many adjustments to the changing economic and political environment by U.S.\nfirms and consumers. Political pressures will\ncontinue to be felt by U.S. policymakers. Given\nthe insights from economic theory as well as the\nlessons of economic history, my hope is that\npolicymakers will resist the calls for isolationist\nresponses. U.S. trade restrictions are highly\nunlikely to increase employment opportunities\nat home, but clearly would deprive American\nconsumers of lower-cost goods from China. The\nbest course of action is to continue to encourage\nChina to protect intellectual property rights and\nto lower barriers on trade.\nTaking advantage of the opportunities presented by Chinese growth—rather than simply\nattempting to negate the competitive pressures—\nis in the best interest of both countries. Opportunities to increase exports are in fact being seized\nby U.S. firms, many of which are located in the\n16 states served by the Southern Legislative\nConference. Recent export growth by nearly all\nof these states has exceeded the national average.\nIn light of the continuing strong Chinese growth\nprospects, prospects for exports to China from\nthe states represented here today are very bright.\nI’ll finish with a general comment. For over\n70 years, since the Reciprocal Trade Agreements\nAct of 1934, the United States has led the way\ntoward a more open international trading system,\nand I am hopeful that this historic process will\ncontinue. Both economic theory and economic\n\nhistory have provided ample reasons showing\nthat changes in legislation and regulation that\ntilt toward economic isolation are unwise. Our\nfuture prosperity depends on continuing to build\non past successes in extending open markets and\nenjoying the fruits of the productivity advances\nopen markets promote.\n\nREFERENCES\nAnderson, James E. and van Wincoop, Eric. “Trade\nCosts.” Journal of Economic Literature, September\n2004, 42(3), pp. 691-751.\nBaier, Scott L. and Bergstrand, Jeffrey H. “The Growth\nof World Trade: Tariffs, Transport Costs, and Income\nSimilarity.” Journal of International Economics,\nFebruary 2001, 53(1), pp. 1-27.\nKamin, Steven B.; Marazzi, Mario and Schindler,\nJohn W. “The Impact of Chinese Exports on Global\nImport Prices.” Review of International Economics,\nMay 2006, 14(2), pp. 179-201.\nPrasad, Eswar S. and Rajan, Raghuram G. “Modernizing\nChina’s Growth Paradigm.” American Economic\nReview, May 2006, 96(2), pp. 331-36.\nRodrik, Dani. “What’s So Special about China’s\nExports.” NBER Working Paper 11947, National\nBureau of Economic Research, January 2006.\nWayne, E.

Before developing that\nargument, I offer the usual Fed disclaimer that\nthe views I express here are mine and do not\nnecessarily reflect official positions of the Federal\nReserve System. I thank my colleagues at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for their comments, especially Robert Rasche, but I retain full\nresponsibility for errors.\nCentral bankers around the world are currently faced with a challenge not experienced in\nover 40 years: maintaining low and stable inflation\nnow that it has been achieved for more than a\npassing quarter or two. In the aftermath of the\nGreat Inflation, the primary objective of monetary\npolicy was clear and distinctly one-sided: Bring\ninflation down to achieve a low and stable longterm rate of inflation. In the early 1990s, inflation\nsubsided to levels that are widely regarded as\nroughly consistent with price stability, and the\nshort-run volatility of inflation became substantially smaller. This observation applies to countries that adopted formal inflation targets and to\ncountries such as the United States where monetary policy inflation objectives are asserted only\nqualitatively.\n1\n\nAs yet, the run-up in the prices of energy and\nother commodities appears to have had only\na modest effect on core inflation, ongoing productivity gains have helped to hold the growth\nof unit labor costs in check, and inflation\nexpectations remain contained. Still, possible\nincreases in resource utilization, in combination with the elevated prices of energy and\nother commodities, have the potential to add\nto inflation pressures.2\n\nFOMC Press Release, May 6, 2003.\n\n2\n\nToday central banks are concerned with twosided risk with respect to their inflation objective.\nOn the one hand, no one wants to see an upward\ndrift of inflation, either sudden or gradual, and\non the other hand, no central bank wants a systemic deflationary environment. In the United\nStates it is likely that the inflation rate bottomed\nout in 2003, around the time that the FOMC\nexpressed concern that “...the probability of an\nunwelcome substantial fall in inflation, though\nminor, exceeds that of a pickup in inflation from\nits already low level.”1\nNow, approximately three years later, after a\nperiod of strong economic growth in many parts\nof the world and demand driven increases in\nenergy prices, the perceived risk has shifted in\nthe other direction. The current assessment of\nthe FOMC is summarized in its statement following its meeting in May 2006:\n\nFOMC Press Release, May 10, 2006.\n\n1\n\n\fMONETARY POLICY AND INFLATION\n\nMeeting the challenge of sustaining a lowinflation environment may require new\napproaches to policy analysis. Policymakers\nunderstand that their actions do not generate\nimmediate responses in the economy, which is\nwhy they must look out into the future. Perfect\nforesight may be a useful construct for theoretical\nanalyses, but policymakers in practice must make\ntheir decisions with full knowledge of the normal\nrange of forecast errors. Economic forecasts are\nrooted in statistical models estimated from historical data, and the model forecasts are then\nmodified, often substantially, through the application of expert judgment. Experience indicates\nthat forecasting inflation is hardly precise and\nthat forecasting models are not robust.\nStock and Watson summarize their experiments with numerous forecasting models for\ninflation across seven industrial economies:\nThese forecasting successes, however, are isolated and sporadic...For example, the seasonal\nno-change forecast works well in the United\nStates in the second period but poorly in the\nfirst, a similar pattern as in Canada (but the\nopposite pattern as in the United Kingdom).3\nThe only set of predictors that usually\nimproves upon the AR [autoregressive] forecasts is the measures of economic activity.\nFor example, the IP [Industrial Production]\nand unemployment gaps both improve on the\nAR (or are little worse than the AR) for both\nperiods for Canada, Germany and the United\nStates. Even for these predictors, however, the\nimprovement is neither universal nor always\nstable.4\n\nEconomists have long understood that control\ntheory implies that the more successful a central\nbank is in achieving and maintaining a low inflation environment, the smaller are the correlations\n\nbetween the control objective—here, the inflation\nrate—and the instruments that a policymaker\nhas available to affect the economy. Years ago\nSolow and Kareken provided a straightforward\nillustration of this proposition:\nSuppose that by heroic (and perhaps even\ncyclical) variation in the money supply and\nits rate of change, the Federal Reserve manages\ndeftly to counter all disturbing impulses and\nto stabilize the level of economic activity\nabsolutely. Then an observer following the\nFriedman method would see peaks and troughs\nof monetary change accompanied by a steady\nlevel of aggregate activity. He would presumably conclude that monetary policy has no\neffects at all, which would be precisely the\nopposite of the truth.5\n\nThe observation that correlations are changing or disappearing does not mean that the economy has fundamentally changed. In particular, it\nis likely that the correlation between the growth\nof monetary aggregates and the inflation rate (or\neven nominal income growth) will be small in\nlow inflation environments. Yet central bankers\nwho fail to monitor the growth rates of monetary\naggregates do so at their own peril. History illustrates that rapid and accelerating monetary growth,\npositive or negative, is a recipe for the demise of\nthe low inflation regime into inflation or deflation.\nJust because a low inflation environment has been\nestablished, central bankers cannot print money\nwithout restraint. Large correlations, then, provide evidence that the central bank has failed to\nexploit relevant information; as policy becomes\nmore effective, correlations tend toward zero.\nIn a low inflation environment, the stability\nof expectations of long-run inflation is certainly\none, and perhaps the single most important, element in the continued success of the low inflation\npolicy. Of first importance is that such expecta-\n\n3\n\nJ.H. Stock and M.W.

Kareken, “Lags in Monetary Policy”, in A. Ando, E.C. Brown, R.M. Solow and J. Kareken, eds., “Lags in Fiscal and\nMonetary Policy,” in Commission on Money and Credit, Stabilization Policies, Englewood Cliffs NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1963, p. 16.\n\n2\n\n\fThe Role of Anecdotal Information in Monetary Policy\n\ntions remain “well contained” or “well anchored.”\nIn rational expectations models of the macroeconomy, monetary policy rules specified with\na nominal interest rate instrument require a constant expected long-term (or equilibrium) expected\nrate of inflation to assure the existence of an\nequilibrium rate of inflation. The familiar “Taylor\nrule” contains a ≠* term, the desired rate of inflation of the monetary authorities. Note that in the\nTaylor rule the term is ≠* not ≠*.6 In such models,\nt\n≠* is the “anchor” on which the long-term\nexpected inflation rate of private agents is based.\nIf the inflation objective is time-varying, or is\nperceived by private agents as time-varying, then\nlong-term inflation expectations become unglued\nand the inflation rate will not remain low and\nstable; indeed depending on how the desired\ninflation rate of the policymakers is perceived,\ninflation can become a self-fulfilling explosive\nprocess.\nSuch models provide insight into how to\nconduct monetary policy that will successfully\nsustain a low and stable inflation environment:\nThe monetary authorities must clearly communicate their inflation policy objectives. The communication must be symmetric: Private agents\nmust understand what rates of inflation are\nunacceptably high and what are unacceptably\nlow to the central bank. Central banks that\nannounce explicit numeric inflation objectives\ngo a long way towards satisfying this communication objective. However, announcements must\nbe confirmed by deeds. Central banks must\ndemonstrate that they are prepared to act decisively against sustained deviations from their\nannounced objective. Further, to preserve the\ncredibility of the announced inflation objective,\nchanges in the announced objective must be\nundertaken sparingly and infrequently, and certainly not in directions away from low rates of\ninflation. If the central bank loses credibility with\n\nrespect to the announced inflation target, then\nlong-term inflation expectations of private agents\nwill become disconnected from the target, and\nthe economy will begin to drag its nominal anchor.\nCentral bankers may be reluctant to take decisive policy actions as actual inflation approaches\na perceived boundary of price stability because\nof their imprecise forecasts of inflation and economic activity. Faced with an uncertain view of\nthe future, the natural tendency of policymakers\nis to wait for further information on the state of\nthe economy. In the absence of decisive policy\nactions, central bankers may be able to stabilize\nlong-term inflation expectations by clarifying\ntheir vision of price stability. The text in the\nminutes of the May 2003 FOMC meeting is an\nexample of such a clarification:\nGiven the pressure of a considerable amount\nof unused resources, any adverse developments\nthat held down economic expansion would\nincrease the probability of further disinflation.\nMembers commented that substantial additional disinflation would be unwelcome\nbecause of the likely negative effects on economic activity and the functioning of financial\ninstitutions and markets, and the increased\ndifficulty of conducting an effective monetary\npolicy, at least potentially in the event the\neconomy was subjected to adverse shocks.7\n\nNote that these minutes provide symmetry to\nthe concerns of FOMC participants about inflation:\nthey reveal that the implicit inflation objective\nof the Committee evaluated downside as well as\nupside risk.\nA difficult question facing central bankers is\nhow to judge when inflation expectations remain\nanchored. One way to approach this question is\nto ask what critical data might be expected to\nshow different characteristics when inflation\nexpectations are “well anchored” compared with\nwhen they are coming unglued. Most such data\n\n6 There is an ongoing debate in the monetary policy literature over “instrument rules” versus “targeting rules.” See for example, B.T. McCallum\nand E. Nelson, “Targeting versus Instrument Rules for Monetary Policy,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, September/October 2005,\n87(5), pp. 597-612 and L.E.O. Svensson, “Targeting versus Instrument Rules for Monetary Policy: What Is Wrong with McCallum and Nelson?”\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, September/October 2005, 87(5), pp. 613-26. In both approaches it is important that the policy\nrules specify ≠*, not ≠*.\nt\n7 Minutes, FOMC Meeting, May 6, 2003.\n\n3\n\n\fMONETARY POLICY AND INFLATION\n\nwill require direct or indirect measures of inflation\nexpectations. Survey data on inflation expectations provide some evidence, but typically have\nlimitations such as small sample size, nonscientific sample design, and a restricted population\nfrom which survey respondents are drawn. The\nintroduction, over the past decade in a number of\ncountries, of inflation-indexed long-term government debt instruments and the emergence of liquid secondary markets in such securities offers\nadditional information.\nIn an economy with well-anchored inflation\nexpectations, it can be expected that those expectations would not be highly responsive to changes\nin the observed rate of inflation. A limitation of\nsurvey data in this respect is that historically they\nhave been characterized by strong persistence.\nFor example, in the 34 quarterly Surveys of\nProfessional Forecasters conducted by the Federal\nReserve Bank of Philadelphia since the second\nquarter of 1998, the average 10-year-ahead forecast of CPI inflation has differed from 2.5 percent\non only five occasions. On those five occasions,\nthe range of the average forecast was from 2.3\npercent to 2.6 percent.\nIn contrast, with highly liquid markets for\nboth nominal and indexed government debt of\ncomparable maturity, it is possible to observe both\nreal interest rates and inflation compensation. If\ninflation expectations are well-anchored, the\ncorrelation between changes in yields on nominal\nsecurities and indexed securities should be quite\nhigh. At the opposite end of the spectrum, if\ninflation expectations become unanchored, then\nthe correlation between changes in these yields\nshould be much lower. In the extreme of highly\nunstable inflation expectations, changes in nominal yields will be dominated by changes in inflation expectations and the correlation of changes\nin nominal and real yields will approach zero.\nIn the absence of precise statistical forecasting models, another potentially useful source of\ninformation to assess the stability of inflation\nexpectations and the likely course of the real\neconomy is real-time anecdotal information. The\n\n4\n\ndrawback of anecdotal information is that there\nis no scientific basis for the sample. Yet the accumulation of forward-looking anecdotal information at critical times can be informative. An\nexample can be drawn from the recently released\ntranscripts of the FOMC meetings of October,\nNovember, and December, 2000. At that time,\nthe best inference from statistical forecasting\nmodels was that economic growth in the U.S.\nwould gradually slow from the very high rate of\nthe first half of the year to rates that were regarded\nas more sustainable. Yet, also at that time, more\nand more FOMC participants were reporting stories indicating sharply slowing conditions from\nan ever increasing number of respondents. We\nnow measure real growth in the second half of\n2000 as less than 1 percent (annual rate), with\nnegative growth in the third quarter. In this\ninstance, the anecdotes gave a better early warning signal of the turn in activity than did the\nforecasting models.\nA similar situation may prevail today. Statistical studies to detect pass-through from recent\nenergy price increases have failed to show significant effects in U.S. price data, but stories about\nwidespread pass-through are becoming increasingly common. We may—and I emphasize “may”\nbecause my purpose is to make a general point\nand not to conduct a full analysis of the current\nsituation—face more inflation pressure than currently shows up in formal data. The general point\nis that the more successful are policymakers in\nexploiting regularities in formal data, the more\nthey will have to rely on anecdotal information\nto make further progress in stabilizing inflation.\nRefining collection and analysis of anecdotal\ninformation promises earlier policy responses to\nchanging economic conditions. The Federal\nReserve already devotes substantial resources to\nmaking judgmental adjustments to its formal\nforecasting model, but my hunch is that there\nwill be significant improvements in policy analysis from strengthening our sources of anecdotal\ninformation.\n\n\f"

        "content": "Inversion\nGlobal Interdependence Center\nCentral Bank Series\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nMay 18, 2006\n\nI\n\nnversion has been much in the news for\nsome months now. Indeed, inversion has\nmade the big time, with William Safire\ndevoting a column in the Sunday New\nYork Times (April 23, 2006) to IYC—inverted\nyield curve. By inversion, of course, I’m referring to a situation in which short-term interest\nrates are higher than long-term interest rates.\nWhen I agreed to speak on this topic last fall,\nmarket concern over IYC was running high.\nThe FOMC had been providing guidance that it\nwould probably continue to raise the target federal\nfunds rate; given the level of the 10-year Treasury\nyield in the 4¼ to 4½ percent range, market\nobservers expected that the funds rate would soon\nbe above the 10-year rate. Recession concerns\nwere widely discussed, because in the past IYC\nhas often been associated with recession. Moreover, many found it odd that until last month the\nmonthly average 10-year bond rate was actually\nlower than it had been in June 2004, when the\nFOMC began to raise the fed funds rate target. It\nseemed a puzzle that the 10-year rate was actually\nthe same in March 2006 as it had been in June\n2004, even though the FOMC had raised the target\nfed funds rate from 1 percent to 4¾ percent. Now\nthat the 10-year rate has risen by another 50 to\n75 basis points, to about 5.15 percent, apparently\neveryone feels a lot better!\nFor simplicity, using monthly average data,\nexcept where indicated otherwise, I’ll concentrate\non the difference between the 10-year constantmaturity Treasury yield and the federal funds\nrate. Some analysts this past winter called attention to an inversion between the 1- or 2-year rate\n\nand the 10-year rate, but looking for some particular part of the yield curve where a shorter rate\nis above a longer rate is scratching for a story.\nSurely, no important issue can depend on an\ninversion somewhere along the yield curve of a\nfew basis points.\nBefore proceeding, I want to emphasize that\nthe views I express here are mine and do not\nnecessarily reflect official positions of the Federal\nReserve System. I thank my colleagues at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis—especially\nMichael Dueker—for their assistance and comments, but I retain full responsibility for errors.\n\nTERM-STRUCTURE THEORY\nAn important problem with much IYC commentary is that it involves a search for patterns\nin the data without an effort to understand the\neconomics that might lie behind the patterns.\nUnderstanding why observations follow a particular pattern is essential to judging whether a pattern\nis likely to persist or apply to today’s situation.\nEconomists have been studying the term\nstructure of interest rates for a long time. The\nfirst proposition is that a long interest rate reflects\ninvestor expectations of the average short rate\nover the horizon of the long rate. Thus, today’s\n1-year rate reflects expectations of the next 52 1week rates; today’s 10-year rate reflects expectations of the next 10 1-year rates.\nI deliberately used the phrase “reflects\nexpectations” because there is ample evidence\nthat a long rate is not always equal to the appro1\n\n\fFINANCIAL MARKETS\n\npriately weighted average of the short rates over\nthe horizon of the long rate. Most of the time, long\nrates are somewhat above short rates. Over the\npast 50 years, for example, the 10-year Treasury\nrate has averaged about 90 basis points above the\nfederal funds rate. The difference between the\nlong rate and average expected short rate over\nthe horizon of the long security is called the\n“term premium.”\nOn average, the term premium is positive,\nbut theory does not predict any particular relationship. The term premium is thought to arise\nfrom investor attitudes toward risk. Capital values\nfluctuate more the longer a bond’s maturity, and\ninvestors averse to capital risk therefore prefer\nshorter maturities. On the other hand, interest\nincome fluctuates more for a series of investments\nin short-term bonds than for a long-term bond;\ninvestors averse to income instability therefore\nprefer longer-term bonds.\nThe balance of investors with different and\nchanging attitudes toward risk changes over time,\nand other conditions may also change. Thus,\nthere is no reason to expect that term premiums\nwill be constant, and they aren’t. Given that\ninvestor expectations about future short rates are\nnot directly observable, and their preferences\nthat create term premiums are not directly observable either, there is no absolutely reliable way to\ndisentangle changing interest rate expectations\nfrom changing term premiums.\n\nSOME HISTORY\nMany of the inversions of the yield curve\nstarting in the 1960s occurred under the old\ndeposit interest rate ceilings established under\nRegulation Q. The ceiling on the deposit rate led\nto “disintermediation” from the banking system\nwhen monetary policy tightened and increased\nthe responsiveness of the quantity of money inside\nthe banking system to Federal Reserve policy\nactions. However, there was no inversion associ1\n\n2\n\nated with the recessions of 1957-58 and 1960-61.\nBefore the mid-1960s, the Fed adjusted Regulation\nQ interest ceilings in a fashion timely enough to\nprevent significant disintermediation.\nIn an environment of slow adjustment of Reg\nQ ceilings, when the Fed stepped on the monetary\nbrakes, bank credit became tight and the real\nshort-term interest rate quickly rose well above\nits equilibrium level. Because the market anticipated that the monetary brakes would be loosened\nwithin a relatively short time frame, long-term\ninterest rates rose by a much smaller amount,\nand the yield curve inverted temporarily. It was\nduring this era that yield-curve inversions came\nto carry negative business-cycle connotations.\nAll too often, the clampdown on credit was\nsevere enough to be associated with a recession\nbut not steadfast enough to bring about lasting\ndisinflation.\nFortunately, since the early 1980s, three\nthings have changed for the better. First, lasting\ndisinflation was achieved in the VolckerGreenspan era. Second, financial deregulation\ndid away with Regulation Q, and important financial innovations, such as hedging instruments,\nhave lessened the economic fallout from shocks.\nThird, the economy itself has become more stable—a phenomenon known as the “Great\nModeration.” Moreover, these positive developments reinforce each other because, as Chairman\nBernanke has noted in Congressional testimony,\na more stable environment provides monetary\npolicymakers greater latitude to respond aggressively to shocks.1 It was this latitude that permitted the Federal Reserve to maintain the federal\nfunds rate at 1 percent from June 2003 to June\n2004 while waiting patiently for the current\nexpansion to establish firm legs.\n\nIYC AS RECESSION PREDICTOR\nOne quip about the predictive power of yield\ncurve inversions is that they have predicted six\n\nTestimony of Chairman Ben S. Bernanke, Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress before the Committee on Financial Services,\nU.S. House of Representatives, February 15, 2006.\n\n\fInversion\n\nof the last four recessions. In fact, starting in the\nmid-1960s, there have been nine notable inversions of the yield curve and six business recessions. The historical record of yield curve\ninversions, recessions, and false alarms reveals\nseveral regularities. Such an analysis also sheds\nlight on today’s relatively flat yield curve.\nThe basic proposition is that the yield curve\nreflects investor expectations of future interest\nrates. These expectations depend on anticipated\nFed policy adjustments, which in turn reflect\nexpected developments in the real economy and\nthe rate of inflation. Consider a classic episode\nto illustrate the process. Inflation began to rise\npersistently in 1967 and, after the middle of the\nyear, the Fed began to tighten policy. In response\nto tighter fiscal policy enacted in mid-1968, which\nmany believed would cool the economy, the Fed\neased policy a bit. However, the economy did\nnot slow and inflation continued to worsen. The\nFOMC then raised the fed funds rate almost every\nmonth. The yield curve had inverted slightly in\nthe spring of 1968, and the inversion deepened\nas the Fed tightened policy. In August 1969, the\npeak month for the funds rate, the inversion\nreached its maximum extent of 250 basis points.\nThe business cycle peak was December. Not until\nMarch 1970 did the Fed ease policy enough to\nbring the funds rate down significantly.\nThe basic story, as I see it, was that the Fed\nwas slow to ease policy in 1969 and 1970 because\nit was concerned about the inflation rate. The\nbond market could see that the economy was\nweakening and that rates would be coming down,\nwhich is why the inversion developed. But the\nFed did not want to ease policy until inflation\nslowed, both because it wanted to maintain downward pressure on the inflation rate and because\nit was concerned that premature easing would\nraise inflation expectations. This same pattern\nplayed out in spades in the months around the\nNovember 1973 business cycle peak. Inflation\nwas much higher and inflation expectations more\nentrenched. Using monthly average data, the peak\nfed funds rate was in July 1974 and the inversion\nthat month was over 500 basis points. The economy weakened dramatically in the second half\n\nof 1974, and the Fed eased policy. The inversion\nlasted through December.\nThe story around the cycle peak in March\n2001 was a bit different. The Fed maintained a\ntarget for the funds rate of 6.5 percent starting in\nmid-May 2000. After May, the 10-year Treasury\nrate fell a bit and the yield curve inverted. The\ninversion reached a maximum of 116 basis points\nin December. Policy in 2000 was dominated by\nconcern over the threat of inflation rather than\nactual inflation. The FOMC began to cut the funds\nrate target in January 2001, ahead of the cycle\npeak in March. The inversion ended in April as\nthe Fed cut the funds rate target aggressively.\nWhile it is true that an inversion preceded the\ncycle peak, it is also true that the FOMC began to\ncut rates before the cycle peak and indeed cut\naggressively because inflation was controlled.\nNow that I’ve reviewed a few episodes, let’s\ntry to generalize a bit. Using weekly average data\nto tie down timing relationships accurately, the\nlast date on which the yield curve is inverted by\nat least 100 basis points can be considered the\ndate on which the inversion ebbs and starts to\ntail off. We’ll call this date the “ebb date.” One\ninteresting pattern across yield curve inversions\nis that the long rate typically rises, although sometimes only slightly, in the three months prior to\nthe start of the inversion and then falls in the\nthree months prior to the ebb date. It is not obvious that the long rate would be falling as the\ninversion is declining, but this pattern held in\nmany of the inversions that preceded or coincided\nwith recessions—specifically the inversions that\nstarted in 1968, 1973, 1978, 1982, 1989, and 2000.\nThese cases fit the scenario whereby monetary\npolicy initially tightens enough to lift all interest\nrates, including long-term rates, but a weakening\neconomy and market anticipations of Fed easing\nsubsequently lead to declines in long-term rates.\nThe inversion ebbs because the Fed sees the\nweakening economy and brings the funds rate\ndown, and the funds rate declines more quickly\nthan does the long rate.\nIt is also worth noting that in all six of these\nclassic instances where an inversion of the yield\ncurve preceded a recession, the real federal funds\n3\n\n\fFINANCIAL MARKETS\n\nrate—measured as the difference between the\nfederal funds rate and core PCE inflation—\nexceeded 4 percent and sometimes by a wide\nmargin. These were episodes of substantial policy\nrestraint, motivated by inflation or the threat of\ninflation.\nThere are three false alarm cases where no\nrecession ensued—the inversions that began in\n1966, 1995, and 1998. In none of these cases did\nthe inversion reach 100 basis points using monthly\naverage data. In the false alarm cases, the real\nfederal funds rate was at or somewhat below 3\npercent.\nThe anomaly among the inversions, in that it\nis neither one of the classic cases nor a false alarm,\nis the inversion that started in October 1980. The\nebb date of this inversion, in September 1981,\noccurred in rather unusual circumstances. The\neconomy had gone back into recession in July\n1981 and the 10-year rate was near its post-war\nhigh of about 15½ percent at the height of the\nFed’s struggle to bring inflation down. Although\nby September 1981 the fed funds rate had come\ndown from its peak earlier in the year, the policy\noutlook was extremely uncertain because the\ninflation outlook was so uncertain. As it turned\nout, the economy weakened rapidly as the recession took hold and both long and short rates\ndeclined after September 1981. The inversion\ndisappeared as short rates declined more quickly\nthan long rates, but then reappeared for a few\nmonths in 1982.\nAnalyzing the current situation in light of\nthese patterns, using weekly average data, the\nspread between the 10-year Treasury and the\nfederal funds rate never became negative this past\nwinter, though it came close to zero in January\nand February. The real federal funds rate has\nremained below 3 percent in all of 2006. Thus,\nthe recent relatively flat yield curve has much\nmore in common with the cases where yield curve\ninversions were not followed by a recession.\nOne lesson from these episodes is that the\nyield curve must be combined with additional\ninformation in order for a reliable recession signal\nto emerge. In particular, the term spread should\nbe considered jointly with the level of the real\n4\n\nshort-term interest rate when gauging whether\nrecession is likely.\nAs a recession predictor, yield-curve inversions do not outperform other simple rules of\nthumb, such as troughs in the unemployment\nrate. Even though the unemployment rate is\nwidely known as a lagging economic indicator, a\nsimple predictive rule is that a rise from a trough\nlevel in the unemployment rate by at least 0.3\npercentage points lasting at least three months\noccurs prior to every cycle peak. For example,\nby August 2000, the unemployment rate had\nrisen 0.3 percentage points above an April 2000\ntrough rate of 3.8 percent. The recession then\nbegan seven months later in March 2001. Nevertheless, the eight correct signals from the unemployment rate are accompanied by three false\nalarms—with the latest in February 1986. This\nratio of hits to misses is similar to the ratio for\nyield curve inversions. Undoubtedly, we could\nfind many other recession signals that would\nmatch the record of inverted yield curves. That\nall these supposed signals are of limited value is\nindicated by the fact that forecasters do not have\na stellar record of forecasting recessions. If the\nsignals were clear, forecasting would be easy. It\nis not.\nI haven’t attempted a citation count to determine when inversion aversion reached its peak\nintensity, but the discussion was certainly active\nfrom late last fall to early this year. Perhaps what\ntriggered this discussion was that, while the FOMC\nwas raising the target fed funds rate starting in\nJune 2004, the 10-year rate traded most of the time\nin a range from 4 to 4.5 percent. Last fall, as the\ntarget funds continued to rise but the 10-year\nrate did not, it appeared only a matter of time\nuntil the inversion would occur. In fact, using\nmonthly average data, we have not had an inversion through April 2006.\nThe key to understanding this situation is\nthat increases in the target funds rate were well\npredicted in June 2004, when the increases began\nfrom the unusually low federal funds rate of 1 percent. In June 2004, the market correctly gauged\nthat the Fed would raise the funds rate steadily\nand gradually for the next year and a half. Not\n\n\fInversion\n\nuntil the November 2005 FOMC meeting did the\ntarget funds rate exceed the rate that had been\nexpected in June 2004. With the funds rate rising\non the expected track, there was no reason for the\n10-year bond rate to depart in any major way from\nits level in June 2004. The increase in the bond\nyield since November 2005 is consistent with the\nidea that the funds rate has now increased somewhat more than the market anticipated earlier.\nWhy did rates behave so much the same as\nexpected in June 2004? The most important reason is that the economy came in so close to what\nhad been forecast. Going as far back as January\n2004, the Blue Chip forecasters maintained very\nsteady and accurate forecasts of 2005 GDP growth,\nwhich came in at 3.5 percent. The main surprise\nwas in the inflation rate. In turn, that surprise\nwas a consequence of energy prices, which have\nincreased far beyond levels predicted in June\n2004 but even today have not much affected core\ninflation. What has happened to raise the expected\npath for the target federal funds rate from expectations in place late last year, and therefore has\nalso affected longer-term rates, is the persistence\nof energy price increases. In January 2005, the\nBlue Chip consensus for CPI inflation for 2006\nwas 2.3 percent. As of the May 2006 Blue Chip\nrelease, that consensus is now up to 3.1 percent;\nmuch of this increase took place after Hurricane\nKatrina.\nUnless we experience significant departures\nfrom the expected course for the economy, the\nrecent rise in the 10-year Treasury yield from\nabout 4.6 percent in February to about 5.15 percent today has done much to diminish the likelihood of a substantial inversion in the yield curve\nin the near future.\n\nRECENT BEHAVIOR OF LONGTERM RATES AND THE TERM\nPREMIUM\nI’ve emphasized the importance of interest\nrate expectations for shaping the yield curve and\nbelieve that the rate expectations story explains\n\nmost of what we’ve observed. But there are no\ndoubt other forces at work. It appears that the\nterm premium in long rates fell as the funds rate\ntarget increased. One likely reason that the term\npremium fell in the first year and a half of this\ntightening cycle is that the market understood\nthe path that short-term interest rates would take\nin the tightening cycle that began in late June\n2004. That predictability reduced the risk of\nholding longer-term bonds.\nMarket commentary has attributed much of\nthe recent increase in long rates to a restoration\nof a more-normal term premium for holding longterm debt. But policymakers should not view the\nterm premium as a single component of long-term\ninterest rates. Instead, the term premium consists\nof compensation for the risk that real interest rates\nwill turn out to be higher than expected in the\nfuture and separate compensation for the risk\nthat inflation will turn out to be higher than currently expected. Naturally, if the term premium\nincreases because of changes in bearing real\ninterest rate risk, as a policymaker I am more\ncomfortable with that than if the term premium\nincreases because of market concerns about the\nrisk of inflation. Yields on Treasury inflationindexed securities, combined with factor models\nof the term structure of interest rates, suggest that\nthe compensation for bearing real interest-risk\ndropped between June 2004 and late 2005,\nalthough it has rebounded somewhat since then.\nBecause some of these factor models suggested\nthat the term premium had dipped nearly to zero\nby late 2005, some rebound was likely.\nAmong the international factors cited as\ninfluences on U.S. interest rates in the past few\nyears is the global saving glut. Unusually high\nsaving might hold down the level of real interest\nrates, but there is no reason why there should be\nan effect on the shape of the term structure. In\nany event, it appears that real interest rates are\nreturning to a more normal level in the United\nStates. The 10-year indexed bond had a rate of\nabout 1.6 percent in the fall of 2004; that rate is\nnow up to about 2.4 percent.\n5\n\n\fFINANCIAL MARKETS\n\nFORWARD RATES\nAlthough the yield curve is an imperfect\nrecession predictor, the term structure of interest\nrates provides very useful glimpses of what shortterm interest rates are likely to be in the future.\nA forward interest rate far enough into the future,\nsay nine years ahead, provides information\nabout the trend rate of inflation markets expect.\nMeasures of expected inflation in the short run,\nsay in the next two years or so, reflect energy\nprice shocks, for example, that will not influence\nthe long-run trend rate of inflation. Similarly, no\none can forecast the state of the business cycle\nnine years into the future, so the implied far forward rate reflects neutral business cycle conditions. For this reason, a clear shift up or down of\nthe implied far forward rate suggests that either\nthe trend level of expected inflation has changed\nor the market’s inference of the trend real rate of\nreturn has been altered. In principle, one could\nuse data on stripped inflation-indexed bonds to\ninfer the implied forward real rate, but trading in\nthis market is somewhat thin. Nevertheless, the\nimplied far forward real rate is not expected to\nundergo sudden changes. Hence we can interpret,\nas a good approximation, changes in the implied\nfar forward nominal rate as a combination of\nchanges in long-term inflation expectations and\nin the term premium.\nPrice data from stripped Treasury bond coupons\nshow that the implied far forward one-year rate\nnine years in the future has fallen since the Fed\ninitiated its tightening cycle in June 2004. In that\ntime span the implied forward rate has fallen\nfrom about 61/8 percent to about 5½ percent. Thus,\nthe signal from the Treasury bond market is that\nthe Fed’s measured but steady pace of removing\npolicy accommodation has been sufficient to\nkeep long-term inflation expectations and risk\npremia well-contained.\n\nCONCLUDING COMMENTS\nI must say that I’ve been a bit puzzled by the\ninversion/recession talk that began last fall. As\n6\n\nalready noted, the spread between the 10-year\nbond and the fed funds never became negative\nlast fall and still isn’t. Yet, inversions associated\nwith recessions have been quite large. Using\nmonthly average data, the 1969 inversion reached\n250 basis points; the 1974 inversion exceeded\n500 basis points; the 1980 and 1981 inversions\nexceeded 600 basis points. Milder inversions\nseem to have been associated with milder recessions. The 1989 inversion reached 125 basis\npoints and the 2000 inversion reached 116 basis\npoints. We never got close to any of these last\nfall. Finally, looking back at 1980-82 experience\nmakes clear that simply counting presumed patterns in the data, without guidance from economic theory, is not a wise strategy. The early\n1980s were so different from today’s conditions\nin so many respects that the experience of twin\nrecessions in a high inflation era has little bearing on understanding the term structure today.\nThe term structure of interest rates provides\na window into investor interest rate expectations.\nIt is always worthwhile for policymakers to consider those expectations but not wise to take them\nat face value without further analysis. Interestrate expectations reflect investor understanding\nof how rates will evolve, which is why an inverted\nyield curve has often preceded business cycle\npeaks. But the market’s rate expectations also\ndepend importantly on the market’s read of what\nthe FOMC will do. If the market’s expectation\ndoes not match the FOMC’s own expectation, then\npolicymakers need to do some soul searching.\nThere are two possibilities: either the market\nmay have a better understanding of where the\nFOMC is likely to take policy than the FOMC\ndoes, or the market may be misreading the FOMC’s\nintentions.\nArguably, the market was ahead of the FOMC\nin 2000; the peak for the 10-year rate was 6.66\npercent in January, and by December the rate\nwas down to 5.24 percent. As evidence of the\neconomy’s weakening accumulated, the FOMC\nfirst cut the fed funds rate target in January 2001.\nConversely, after the FOMC lowered the funds\nrate target to 1 percent in June 2003, the market\nseemed primed to expect that the Committee\n\n\fInversion\n\nwould soon be raising the rate. To better align\nmarket expectations with its own, in its August\n2003 meeting the FOMC introduced language in\nits statement indicating that “the Committee\nbelieves that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period.”\nAt least as of today, the market’s concerns\nlast fall that the yield curve would invert and\nsignal a recession seem to have evaporated. There\nis no obvious misalignment of market interest\nrate expectations and the likely course of policy\ngiven information available today. What I believe\nwill happen is that FOMC policy decisions and\nmarket expectations will evolve as newly arriving\ndata either change, or affirm, the current outlook\nfor the economy. The policy statement following\nthe FOMC’s meeting of May 10 indicated the\nCommittee’s view that economic growth was on\na solid, but moderating, track and that inflation\nwas contained, but still a risk.\nThe Committee also emphasized that future\npolicy would depend on how arriving information affected the economic outlook. I myself place\ngreat emphasis on this point. Experience indicates\nthat economic forecasts are not especially accurate, and that means that monetary policy actions\nshould depend on how the outlook changes with\nnew information rather than be decided in\nadvance based on the forecast.\nI hope I’ve provoked you sufficiently that\nyou’ll ask some questions. Fire away.\n\n7\n\n\f"

VI\n“Redefining Investment Strategy Education”\nUniversity of Dayton\nDayton, Ohio\nMarch 30, 2006\n\nI\n\n’m very pleased to be with you today to\ndiscuss the role of the Federal Reserve\nbanks in the Federal Reserve System. The\nFederal Reserve Banks are evolving, along\nwith the rest of the financial system. As with\nother financial institutions, evolution is driven\nby major developments in technology, globalization, terrorism risks and legislation.\nI’ll discuss some of the details of financial\nevolution, but will first take up a topic that is\nrarely discussed, and one I feel passionate about.\nThe Federal Reserve System has a mixed publicprivate structure. However, the most important\nof the Fed’s responsibilities have to be managed\nfrom a public-interest perspective and not from a\nprofit-making perspective. Although the Fed has\npublic responsibilities, that does not mean that\nFed operations all have to be managed and conducted from Washington. Indeed, I’ll be making\nthe argument that the Fed’s mixed public-private\ngovernance structure has been highly effective\nin serving the public interest precisely because\nnot everything is run by a federal agency. The 12\nregional Reserve Banks play a key role in the\nFederal Reserve and have a lot to do with the\nSystem’s fine record of performance.\nBefore proceeding, I want to emphasize that\nthe views I express here are mine and do not\nnecessarily reflect official positions of the Federal\nReserve System. I thank my colleagues at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for their comments. Alan J. Stamborski provided special\nassistance. However, I retain full responsibility\nfor errors.\n\nRESPONSIBILITIES AND\nGOVERNANCE OF THE FEDERAL\nRESERVE SYSTEM\nMonetary policy is the most visible of the\nFed’s responsibilities. As the nation’s central\nbank, the Federal Reserve regulates the creation\nof money and of liquidity more generally. The\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is the\nFed’s monetary-policy body; it consists of the\nseven members of the Board of Governors and\nthe 12 Reserve Bank presidents, five of whom\nare voting members at any given time.\nThe Fed implements its monetary policy by\nsetting a target federal funds interest rate. The\nprimary goal of policy is to maintain an inflation\nrate that is low and stable—price stability. Price\nstability in turn creates an economic environment\nthat fosters maximum sustainable economic\ngrowth and sustained high employment. In an\nenvironment of price stability, the Fed can respond\nflexibly to economic disturbances—an excellent\nexample is 9/11—that might otherwise lead to\nrecession. Not all recessions can be avoided, but\nprice stability does seem to have contributed to a\nmore stable economy over the past decade or so.\nThe Fed’s second important responsibility is\nto regulate and supervise various kinds of financial institutions. These include state-chartered\nbanks that have chosen to become Fed member\nbanks, all bank-holding companies and all international banks that operate in the United States.\nThe Fed’s mission in this regard is to ensure a\n1\n\n\fFEDERAL RESERVE\n\nsafe and sound, as well as competitive, banking\nsystem in this country.\nA third important responsibility is provision\nof financial services to depository institutions\nand the federal government. The Fed is the Bank\nfor bankers. The Fed circulates currency, clears\nchecks and provides several forms of electronic\npayment. The Fed lends funds to banks through\nits discount window. This work isn’t ordinarily\nthe stuff of headlines except in dramatic cases\nsuch as the 9/11 terrorist attacks, when the Fed\nnipped in the bud the potential for a liquidity\ncrisis. The Fed lent huge sums to banks financially\nstressed by the breakdown in the payments system and closure of normal market trading. No\npurely private firm would have the resources to\nprovide emergency assistance on such a grand\nscale. The Fed’s response to 9/11 provides an\nexcellent example of how we work with the private sector to protect the normal functioning of\nprivate markets.\nAs the Bank to the U.S. government, the Fed\nprocesses government checks, money orders and\nsavings bonds, and collects a significant portion\nof federal tax deposits. The Fed provides software\nand other services that permit the Treasury to\nmanage its funds efficiently.\nAs this overview indicates, the Federal\nReserve Banks, with oversight by the Federal\nReserve Board of Governors in Washington, have\na mix of public and private responsibilities.\nMonetary policy and bank regulation are clearly\npublic responsibilities. Financial services to the\nbanks and the Treasury have mixed public-private\naspects, particularly given that a number of purely\nprivate firms compete with the Fed.\nAt the center of the Federal Reserve System\nis the Board of Governors. Members of the Board\nare appointed by the President of the United\nStates with the advice and consent of the Senate\nfor terms of office of 14 years. The Board is headquartered in Washington, is a federal agency and\nis clearly politically accountable. However, the\nstructure of the System is designed to keep the\nFed independent of partisan politics. The Board\nof Governors is not funded by annual appropriations from Congress; rather, the Board is funded\n2\n\nby the 12 quasi-private Reserve Banks from\nincome on the portfolio of government securities\nused to conduct market transactions. Therefore,\nthe Fed’s budget isn’t directly controlled by the\nlegislative arm of government.\nWhile the Board of Governors is a federal\nagency, each Reserve Bank is a corporation, with\na charter granted by the federal government under\nthe Federal Reserve Act. Each Reserve Bank has\nits own board of directors and its own stockholders, who are the member banks. After covering expenses and a statutory 6 percent dividend\npaid to the member banks on the capital they\nprovide, the Federal Reserve Banks return their\nprofits to the U.S. government.\nReserve Bank directors are leading citizens\nactive in the Bank’s Federal Reserve district.\nEach board has nine members, six elected by the\nmember banks in the district and three appointed\nby the Board of Governors. Reserve Bank presidents are appointed by the boards of directors\nwith the approval of the Board of Governors. All\ndirectors and officers are explicitly nonpolitical—\nthey cannot hold elective office or participate\nactively in partisan political campaigns as, for\nexample, campaign managers or fundraisers for\ncandidates. Thus, the top leadership of the\nReserve Banks is removed from politics, further\ncontributing to the Fed’s independence.\nThe Federal Reserve Banks, then, are the\nquasi-private part of the Federal Reserve System.\nThe Banks draw on private sector knowledge\nand expertise in pursuing the Fed’s mission. The\nstructure of the boards and oversight from the\nBoard of Governors ensure that private sector\nrepresentation will serve public purposes. The\nSystem is politically accountable but separated\nfrom day-to-day political pressures. This structure serves public purposes more efficiently and\neffectively than would a purely federal agency.\nThat private-sector influence is also important\nin the Fed’s analysis of the economy and monetary policymaking. Each Federal Reserve District\nnot only serves the people within its geographical borders but also brings regional perspectives\nand information to bear on national issues. It is\nimportant to distinguish regional perspectives\n\n\fThe Role of Federal Reserve Banks in the Federal Reserve System\n\nfrom regional interests. Today, the Fed’s regional\nstructure does not serve regional interests per se\nbut instead brings information and regional perspectives to bear on national responsibilities.\nBecause the United States is a fully integrated\nnational economy, monetary policy decisions\naffect the entire country and there is no possibility\nof conducting separate regional monetary policies.\nI believe that it is critical to the Fed’s success\nthat monetary policy decisions are a consensus\noutcome reflecting views from Washington—the\nGovernors—and from around the country—the\nReserve Bank presidents.\nThe Fed System opened its doors in 1914, or\n125 years after the U.S. Constitution became the\nlaw of the land. You might think that every country would have a central bank from day one, and\nCongress did charter the First Bank of the United\nStates in 1791. But banking was a controversial\nsubject in the early days; Thomas Jefferson, for\nexample, argued against chartering the bank, saying the Constitution did not empower Congress\nto create a central bank.\nCongress refused to renew The First Bank’s\ncharter after 20 years because of the public outcry\nover its concentration of money and power. But\nthe need for a central bank did not disappear,\nand a few years later Congress chartered the\nSecond Bank of the United States. It was even\nlarger than the first and, hence, more powerful.\nAgain, there was opposition from some wellknown leaders, including President Andrew\nJackson. His attacks on the Bank’s power struck\na popular chord with farmers, small businesses,\nsmall banks and many politicians; all of them\nperceived the Bank to be a giant obstacle in their\npath to success. The Bank was shut down when\nits charter expired in 1836. Between 1836 and\n1914, when the Federal Reserve began its operations, the United States struggled with an unsatisfactory banking system lacking in central\nauthority and direction.\nAn important difference between the Federal\nReserve today and the First and Second Banks\nwas the perceived political links of the earlier\nBanks. In the minds of many, the early Banks\nwere seen as a political arm of the powerful peo-\n\nple in the federal government. You don’t often\nhear such comments today, and with good reason.\nAs I’ve emphasized, the Federal Reserve System\nwas set up to be independent of day-to-day pressures from the federal government, but to be\nclearly accountable to Congress. The governance\nstructure of the Federal Reserve, designed to keep\nthe Fed out of politics, has been successful in\ndoing so and has contributed importantly to\nsound monetary policy.\n\nFINANCIAL EVOLUTION\nWith rapid change in the nation’s and world’s\nfinancial system, the Federal Reserve has had to\nchange, too. The Fed’s public-private structure\nhas helped the institution to adapt and change\nsuccessfully.\nHere are just three among many changes in\nthe Federal Reserve System that you might not\nbe aware of:\n• The Reserve Banks are becoming a network\nof specialists, just as many others in corporate America are doing. In the days before\ncomputers and interstate banking, each of\nthe 12 Federal Reserve Banks around the\ncountry provided almost all services and\nproducts to the commercial banks in its\ndistrict. While some products were similar,\nmany services and their prices varied by\ndistrict. With today’s nationwide and large\nregional banks, differences in Fed services\nand procedures cause problems for the\nmany commercial banks that operate across\nFederal Reserve District boundaries. Thus,\nReserve Banks have largely standardized\ntheir offerings. At the same time, Reserve\nBanks are carving out specialties so that,\ntogether, they can gain efficiencies. Certain\nReserve Banks are responsible for developing and delivering particular products and\nservices. Others are marketing them. One of\nthe St. Louis Fed’s specialties, for example,\nis to develop new software applications\nfor the U.S. Treasury, which is increasing\n3\n\n\fFEDERAL RESERVE\n\nits use of electronic receipts and payments\nto reduce costs and improve services.\n• The Fed is cutting by more than half the\nnumber of Reserve Bank sites around the\ncountry that process checks. The Fed is\ncontracting its paper-processing facilities\nbecause people are writing fewer checks\nin favor of using credit cards, debit cards\nand other forms of electronic payment.\nCheck-processing has been a huge business for the Fed, which has traditionally\nprocessed about one-third of all checks\nwritten in this country. The Fed has been\nencouraging this transition because an\nelectronic payments system is cheaper,\nmore reliable and more secure than a paperbased one. All of these benefits are important to the Fed because a safe and efficient\npayments system is one of the Fed’s key\nresponsibilities.\n• A third major change involves the increasingly open and public way the Fed conducts monetary policy. The FOMC is not\nthe secretive group it once was. Not until\n1994 did the FOMC release a press statement following a policy action. The markets\nemployed a small army of Fed watchers to\ndetermine whether the Fed’s open market\noperations indicated a change in the committee’s policy stance. Today, the FOMC is\nquite open with its actions. Policy decisions are announced shortly after they are\nmade, at a standard 2:15 p.m. Eastern time\nafter the FOMC meeting concludes. At that\ntime, the committee also issues a policy\nstatement that outlines the rationale for the\npolicy decision. Fed officials speak to the\ngeneral public and testify before Congress\noften about the reasons for policy decisions\nin an effort to help people understand the\nrole of the Fed and why it does what it does.\nAs a result of this transparency, the markets\nare more in synch with FOMC decisions;\nthe best evidence of this fact is the enormous decline in market volatility when\nFOMC policy decisions become known\ncompared to the earlier era.\n4\n\nNow, let’s move on to some of the more specific changes that are occurring in the Fed’s three\nmain areas of work.\nIn supervision and regulation, technology is\nchanging the practice of bank examination. The\nFed used to rely on examiner on-site visits to\nbanks to make sure that loans were properly\ndocumented, that banks had lined up enough\nsound collateral before issuing loans, that there\nwas no red-lining going on, and so forth. Today,\nexaminers still make those visits, but much of\nthe monitoring of the books is handled off-site,\nthanks to computerized information systems. And\nthe examiners are much more forward-looking.\nThey go beyond the record-keeping of current\nand past performance to look for problems that\nmight be on the horizon so that they can be headed\noff. Examiners are looking ahead by focusing on\nrisk management—such things as internal risk\ncontrols and portfolio concentrations.\nAdding to the challenge is the ever-increasing\nsize and sophistication of major banks today.\nThe largest banks now have revenue that dwarfs\nthe GDP of some countries.\nObviously, being a bank examiner is more\nchallenging today than it was even 10 or 20 years\nago. As banking becomes increasingly complicated, bank examiners must keep up through\nextensive training and specialization. Already,\nFed examiners increasingly specialize in particular aspects of overseeing large, complex banking\norganizations.\nMoreover, because there are three primary\nfederal banking regulators—besides the Fed, the\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency and\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation—the\nFed needs to work cooperatively with other agencies. Some regulatory issues also involve the\nOffice of Thrift Supervision, the Securities and\nExchange Commission and the Commodities\nFutures Trading Commission. The Fed also coordinates its bank examinations with state banking\ncommissions. Clearly, the task of banking supervision and regulation involves multiple levels of\ncomplexity. The Reserve Banks’ regional presence\nand extensive contacts with state regulators and\nthe private sector, including the banking industry,\n\n\fThe Role of Federal Reserve Banks in the Federal Reserve System\n\nstrengthen supervision by encouraging communication that might not otherwise exist.\nSimilarly, dramatic changes are taking place\nin another area of Fed responsibility—financial\nservices to banks. The Fed does still fly and truck\nboxes of checks all over the country to settle\naccounts. But the Fed is also encouraging banks\nto transport digital images of checks along fiber\noptic networks. This innovation was made possible by the Check Clearing for the 21st Century\nAct, better known as Check 21. Congress enacted\nthis legislation in 2003 with the support of the\nFed. The new technology permitted by Check 21\nspeeds up funds settlements while reducing processing costs and boosting security.\nThe Fed is also keeping tabs on other developments in electronic forms of payment, such as\nsmart cards and debit cards. The Fed has helped\npioneer some electronic payments systems itself,\nsuch as the automated clearing house. But the\nFed’s main role in this regard should be overseeing standards for these new products to ensure\nthat the payments system is reliable and accessible to all.\nAnother change in financial services involves\nusing subcontractors in the handling of currency.\nWhen the St. Louis Fed shut down its checkprocessing operations in Little Rock and\nLouisville, the Bank decided that it no longer\nmade sense to provide currency services the old\nway. It wasn’t economical to maintain large buildings and staff primarily for storing and circulating\ncurrency for local commercial banks. The solution was to outsource this service through cash\ndepots set up by armored carriers. This arrangement, though painful for our employees who have\nlost their jobs, has served our customers well\nand is creating substantial savings for taxpayers.\nAnd, I’m proud to say, other Reserve Banks are\nfollowing the St. Louis Fed model in establishing\ncash depots.\nMonetary policy is another area of innovation. Almost all press coverage of monetary policy\nfocuses on the most recent policy decision and\nspeculation about future policy decisions. Such\ndiscussion has been a staple of press coverage\nfor decades.\n\nFed innovation has strengthened monetary\npolicy decisionmaking. The Fed’s large staff of\nprofessional economists at the Board of Governors\nand the Reserve Banks has made important strides\nin economic modeling and policy analysis.\nAnother aspect of policy practice today is that\nthe Fed gathers much information beyond the\nstandard statistical releases, which report such\nimportant data as monthly employment and\nunemployment. One part of this process is quite\nformal, and it yields the Beige Book, published\nshortly before every FOMC meeting. The Beige\nBook is a collection of anecdotal information\ngathered by Fed economists in each district over\nthe weeks prior to an FOMC meeting. Economists\ncall a long list of companies to ask about what is\nhappening in their markets and how their markets\nmight change in the near future. These nuggets\nof information are summarized and made available to both FOMC members and the general\npublic. Confidential information from individual\nfirms is not disclosed; this practice assures Beige\nBook contacts that they can speak candidly.\nI, along with other Reserve Bank presidents,\nalso make calls to business leaders shortly before\nevery FOMC meeting. The St. Louis Fed and\nother Fed Banks have meetings with diverse\ngroups throughout the year to add to the store of\ninsights.\nBecause anecdotal information can be so\nhelpful, the Fed is putting more effort into gathering it. At the St. Louis Fed, we’ve created what\nwe call our Branching Out initiative. We have\ntransformed our Branches from purely operating\nunits to the much broader role of providing a\nmore visible intellectual presence in our branch\ncities. We added community affairs staff and\neconomic education staff to each Branch to boost\npublic understanding of monetary policy and of\nthe economy in general. We work with high\nschools on economic education and many groups\nin our communities on financial literacy so that\npeople will be better able to handle their financial\naffairs without, for example, falling prey to predatory lenders. We send our economists around the\nEighth District to make public presentations, and\n5\n\n\fFEDERAL RESERVE\n\nwe offer more programs about more topics for\nmore people than ever before.\nOur effort stems from our recognition that\nwe need a strong base of local information and\nlocal understanding of the economy. We need\nlocal insight into who’s hiring, who’s firing, who’s\ninvesting in new equipment and buildings,\nwhether home sales are going up or down,\nwhether local businesses are expanding and\nmuch more. I use this information in thinking\nabout my role as a member of the FOMC.\nAs for the FOMC meetings themselves, the\nmystique created by the media is a tad overblown.\nThe responsibility is great, the surroundings are\nintimidating—we meet in a 56-foot-long boardroom with a half-ton chandelier hanging over\nour heads. The brainpower assembled in the\nroom is impressive. But, other than the real-time\nanecdotal information we’ve collected, we have\nvery little information that anyone else couldn’t\ngather. If you read the minutes of the meetings,\nand especially if you read the verbatim meeting\ntranscript that is released with a five-year lag, you\nwill see we aren’t all on the same page all the\ntime. We debate. We discuss the data. We listen\nto one another’s anecdotes about how the economy is doing. We even chuckle over amusing\nquips. Then, after reviewing expert staff analysis\nand all the information and wisdom we can\nmuster, we reach a consensus monetary policy\ndecision. The Fed chairman, of course, leads the\ndiscussion and defines the consensus, but when\nany of us believes sufficiently strongly that\nanother policy course would be better, we enter\na dissent. And when the FOMC meeting is over,\nwe adjourn and have a lunch of soup, cold cuts\nand salads, just as we are about to do today.\nBut, before we eat, I’d be delighted to take a\nfew questions. I will ask you, however, to confine your questions to the subject matter of the\nspeech. The FOMC has a long-standing practice\nof not discussing monetary policy and related\nissues the week before and the week of an FOMC\nmeeting. So, while after a speech I ordinarily\ntake questions on any and all subjects, today is\ndifferent because we had an FOMC meeting only\ntwo days ago.\n6\n\n\f"

        "content": "Recent Developments in Housing Markets:\nA National and Local Perspective\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nMarch 8, 2006\n\nH\n\nousing is an important sector of the\neconomy, in terms of share of GDP,\nsize of the capital stock and as a\nkey area of national policy. My purpose this morning is to review some important\nhousing facts and to provide a longer-run perspective to aid in interpreting the facts.\nBefore proceeding, I want to emphasize that\nthe views I express here are mine and do not\nnecessarily reflect official positions of the Federal\nReserve System. I thank my colleagues at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for their comments. Anthony Pennington-Cross, senior economist, and Kevin Kliesen, associate economist,\nprovided special assistance. I retain full responsibility for errors.\n\nHOUSING FUNDAMENTALS:\nA NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE\nMention the word “housing” and several\nnotions probably come to mind. The issue most\noften raised in recent years is whether there is a\nhousing price bubble. Other issues include affordability, development and financing—particularly\nwith respect to low-income households or those\nindividuals just entering the labor force and\nstarting a career and/or a family.\nWhile national housing policy involves a set\nof critical issues, today I’ll approach the topic of\nhousing from a different perspective—housing’s\nrecent contribution to the national and local\neconomies and likely prospects for this year. I’ll\nconcentrate on single-family housing, by which\nI’ll mean detached housing. Such housing is by\n\nfar the largest component of the nation’s housing\nstock. In 2005, privately-owned, single-family\nhousing units completed totaled nearly 85 percent\nof all privately-owned housing completions.\nMost of the remaining 15 percent was comprised\nof multi-unit structures containing five or more\nunits. However, I’ll make a few comments about\nhousing as a whole, in part because some important data are reported for all housing and in part\nbecause of the substitutability between singlefamily houses and condominiums, apartments\nand town houses.\nA house is a tangible economic asset that\nprovides a flow of services. Think of this service\nas a shelter from the elements. In my own case,\nthe shelter is for me, my wife, our dog and lots of\nstuff connected with our lifestyle. The stuff is in\nthe basement and garage, which constitute a significant share of the total enclosed space.\nBecause houses are assets traded in a market,\nthe quantity of houses built and sold, and the\nprices at which they are valued, are determined\nby the fundamentals of supply and demand. There\nare two distinct, but closely related, markets each\nwith their own supply and demand functions.\nOne market is for the housing stock—existing\nhouses. The second is for housing production—\nnew houses.\nVarious asset markets in the economy are\nsimilar in many respects, but also have unique\nfeatures depending on characteristics of the assets.\nHouses have long lives—usually thought of as\nabout 50 years on average—whereas automobiles\nhave much shorter useful lives. Houses, unlike\naircraft, are immobile. Houses, unlike blocks of\ncommon stock, are indivisible, except for some\n1\n\n\fECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\n\nFigure 1\nMetropolitan Area Comparisons—Real Appreciation\n\nNOTE: Data for charts are from OFHEO. The real house price index is the nominal HPI deflated by the CPI less shelter.\n2001-Q1 is normalized to 100.\n\nlimited possibility of division into apartments.\nLocation is extremely important to the value of\nhouses, whereas location matters little for agricultural land of given productivity.\nThe enormous importance of local conditions\nis nicely illustrated by recent experience. Data\nfrom the Office of Federal Enterprise Housing\nOversight—OFHEO—indicate that house prices\nrose by 12.95 percent in the United States as a\nwhole over the four quarters ending the fourth\nquarter of last year. Arizona, however, had a price\ngain over the same period of 34.90 percent while\nMichigan had a gain of only 3.76 percent. Over\nthe past five years, the District of Columbia led\nthe list with a gain of 127 percent, whereas\nIndiana’s gain was 20 percent. Disparities are\n2\n\nmuch greater when we examine data by metropolitan statistical area. Over the past four quarters,\nPhoenix leads the list with a price gain of 39.67\npercent; the bottom of the list is occupied by\nBurlington, North Carolina, at –1.16 percent.\nBy way of comparison, Missouri over the\npast four quarters and past five years came in at\n7.06 percent and 34.77 percent, respectively,\nwhereas the United States as a whole came in at\n12.95 and 57.68 percent, respectively. The St.\nLouis metropolitan area came in at 7.98 percent\nand 39.58 percent, respectively, for the past four\nquarters and past five years.\nEconomists point to several factors that\naffect the demand for and the supply of housing\nservices. From the demand side, these include\n\n\fRecent Developments in Housing Markets: A National and Local Perspective\n\nFigure 2\nEighth District—Real Appreciation\n\nthe interest rate used to amortize the debt, employment of the owner and the family’s after-tax\nincome, property taxes, and net wealth. Viewed\nfrom the supply side—the builder’s point of\nview—things like location, construction costs,\navailability of developable land, its topography\nand land-use regulations all come into play. As\nis true in all asset markets to a greater or lesser\nextent, expectations of future prices can affect\nboth supply and demand. Of these demand and\nsupply factors, only the interest rate is truly\ncommon across the country as a whole.\nAn important feature of housing markets is\nthat the stock of houses is very large relative to\nthe annual flow of new building net of houses\ndemolished or destroyed. In the United States,\nthere are roughly 75 million single-family houses\n\nand a total of about 124 million housing units of\nall types, including mobile homes. Data are somewhat sketchy, but we know that a significant number of housing units are demolished or destroyed\neach year. In recent years, total housing production has been running about 2 million units per\nyear but the net addition to the stock is about 1¼\nmillion units per year. This net annual flow of\nabout 1¼ million units per year is very small relative to the total stock of about 124 million units.\nFactors that determine the price of existing\nhouses are, therefore, central to understanding\nthe price of new houses and the pace of new\nconstruction.\nA morass of national statistics is available;\nI’ve put together a table (at end of text) summarizing the recent behavior of several key indicators\n3\n\n\fECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\n\nof the U.S. single-family housing sector. On a\nnational scale, fundamentals of housing demand\nare more easily measured than those affecting\nsupply, so let’s look at some of these. They are\nlisted under the table’s third section, “Financial\n& Other.”\nThe conventional mortgage interest rate rose\nmodestly last year, but it still remains quite low\ncompared with the 1990s, when it averaged 8\npercent. Since housing is a real asset, what matters is the real interest rate. The real rate is often\nmeasured as the market rate less the rate of inflation. Although I did not list the real rate in the\ntable, you can readily see that in 2005 it averaged\nabout 3.25 percent—derived by subtracting the\nlast year’s 3 percent inflation rate from last year’s\naverage mortgage interest rate of 6.2 percent.\nSimilar to the nominal rate, real interest rates\nover the last two years have been quite low compared with the 1990s—and even stretching into\n2001. Low rates have been a key factor behind\nthe recent strength in housing construction at\nthe national level.\nAnother, essentially equivalent, way of looking at the effects of low interest rates is to focus\non capital values. The price of an asset rises when\nthe interest rate, or capitalization rate, falls. Most\nare familiar with this fact for a bond—a fixed\nstream of interest payments commands a higher\nprice when interest rates fall. Low interest rates\nhave had much to do with rising house values;\nthe higher values have made new construction\nprofitable, and builders have responded by\nincreasing the rate of building.\nBut other influences besides interest rates\naffect housing demand. One useful composite\nmeasure is the housing affordability index constructed by the National Association of Realtors.\nThe index is based on key factors including house\nprices, interest rates and income. Last year, the\nmodest rise in interest rates and slower growth\nof real household after-tax income were key contributors to a significant decline in the index.\nNevertheless, the housing sector continued to\nsteam ahead. In 2005, nominal residential fixed\ninvestment as a share of nominal GDP rose to a\nlittle more than 6 percent, its highest share in 50\n4\n\nyears. The growth of residential fixed investment\ncontributed 0.4 percentage points of the economy’s\n3.5 percent growth in real GDP. Remarkably, 2005\nwas the 10th consecutive year that residential\nhousing expenditures have contributed positively\nto overall growth.\n\nU.S. HOUSING FACTS AND\nFIGURES\nLast year was another banner year for the\nU.S. housing sector, with single-family starts\nand completions reaching a record-high number\nfor the fifth straight year. The table shows that in\n2005, single-family housing starts rose 7 percent.\nThis gain was modestly more than the previous\nyear’s gain of about 6.5 percent. Housing completions, which measure the gross addition to the\nnation’s housing stock, rose about 6.75 percent.\nThe pace of construction of new, single-family\nhomes has been pretty rapid since 2002: Starts\nincreased by an average of nearly 8 percent per\nyear, while completions increased by about 7\npercent. As seen in the table, the percentage\nincreases in both starts and completions are significantly larger than their average annual rates\nof increases seen during the 1990s.\nThe surge in starts and completions reflects,\nto a large extent, a marked increase in the demand\nfor new and previously sold single-family homes.\nAlthough the growth of new and existing home\nsales slowed in 2005, both growth rates remained\npositive and the level of sales—as with housing\nstarts and completions—rose to record high levels\nlast year.\nEventually, growth of housing as a percentage\nof GDP will end—otherwise, GDP will be comprised solely of housing. Increases in the inventory of new, unsold homes over the last couple\nof years, as shown in the table, suggest that the\nslowing may already be underway. In 2005, new\nsingle-family homes for sale rose 21 percent to\n521,000 units, besting the previous year’s 14 percent jump. The simple economics of supply and\ndemand suggests that to reduce inventory—or at\na minimum to reduce growth in inventory—the\n\n\fRecent Developments in Housing Markets: A National and Local Perspective\n\nhousing industry may need to either curtail building activity or to cut prices.\nHistorically, average market prices of houses\nrarely decline on a year-to-year basis. Since 1964,\nthe Census Bureau’s median sales price of new,\nsingle-family home prices has declined only\ntwice—in 1970 and 1991. Even in real terms,\ndeclines in new, single-family homes are relatively rare: Since 1964, the real median price of\nnew, single-family homes has declined in only\nfive years, and not once since 1992.1 The same\npattern generally holds for previously sold house\nprices.\nLast year, average U.S. home prices rose again\nbut, as the table indicates, by widely varying\nrates depending on what measure is used. Earlier,\nI emphasized that house price increases vary\nenormously across different metropolitan areas,\nand now I’ll emphasize the variability depending\non what measure is examined. Prices of new\nhomes, as seen by two Census Bureau measures—\nthe median sales price, and a quality-adjusted\nprice, which calculates the price of a home of\nsimilar quality across time—rose by less than 5\npercent. Prices of previously sold homes rose\nmuch faster. Two of the most popular measures\nof previously sold home prices are those reported\nby the OFHEO, the regulator of Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac, and the National Association of\nRealtors. Last year’s relatively small increase in\nthe prices of new homes may reflect last year’s\nsurge in unsold homes. The various indexes have\ntheir advantages and disadvantages, depending\non coverage and method of construction.\nRapid increases in house prices over the past\nfew years have elicited much commentary, pro\nand con, about a price bubble. In a market economy, prices adjust to supply and demand conditions. Given that houses are assets with a long\nlife, demand and supply depend importantly on\nexpectations about the future—expectations\n\nabout price appreciation, building costs and regulations, household income, interest rates and\nso forth. At various times throughout history, as\nthe 1990s telecom boom recently demonstrated,\nexpectations of future prices can become detached\nfrom their fundamentals. In practice, there is no\nperfect definition of a price bubble; so, identifying a bubble in real-time is inherently a judgmental exercise. Indeed, given that bubbles always\nburst—if there is no burst, then there was no\nbubble—clear advance evidence of a bubble can\nnever exist. If the evidence were clear, then everyone would know about the bubble and forthcoming burst, but then the buying that created the\nbubble would not occur in the first place. So, if\nyou have an academic interest in house prices, I\nrecommend that you wait a few years. If you\nhave a direct financial interest, I can’t help\nmuch—you’re on your own!\nHousing experts employ several approaches\nto attempt to determine the reasonableness of\nhouse prices. One links the house price to a\nmeasure of household income or the price that\nconsumers would have to pay to rent the house.2\nOne measure of the latter is the owners’ equivalent rent component of the consumer price index.\nSince 2001, the OFHEO and National Association\nof Realtors measures of house prices have risen\n55 and 49 percent, respectively, while rents have\nonly risen 16 percent. These observations indicate that the price-to-rent ratio has risen noticeably and might be read as suggesting that house\nprices are excessive.\nHowever, a recent study by the Organisation\nfor Economic Co-operation and Development\nsuggests that U.S. house prices are not particularly unreasonable based on housing fundamentals.3 Economists at the New York Fed, using a\nsimilar analysis, have come to the same conclusion. Researchers at the St. Louis Fed also reached\na similar conclusion based on an analysis that\nused a price-to-income measure.4 The conven-\n\n1\n\nThe real price is the nominal (current-dollar) price deflated by the chain-price index for personal consumption expenditures.\n\n2\n\nKreiner and Wei (2004).\n\n3\n\nGirouard et al. (2006).\n\n4\n\nSee McCarthy and Peach (2004) and Guidolin and La Jeunesse (2005).\n\n5\n\n\fECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\n\ntional view, which I subscribe to, is that a housing price bubble does not exist on a national\naverage basis, but there may be pockets of the\ncountry where prices have risen beyond levels\nthat can be justified by economic fundamentals.\nLet me also emphasize that outsize price\nincreases are not themselves a clear guide to\noverpricing. An economically stagnant area,\nwhere prices have changed little, may still have\nprices that are too high given declining income\nand economic activity in the region.\nFrom a longer-term perspective, there is some\nconcern that recent declines in the share of households in the prime home-buying age cohorts\ncould eventually weaken house prices. As seen\nin the bottom section of the table, relative to the\ntotal population of households the shares of\nhouseholds in the 25-to-29 and 30-to-34 age\ncohorts have been declining in recent years and\nare significantly below their 1990-to-1999 average.\nThe implications of the decline for the near-term\noutlook are probably not too significant. At some\npoint, declining shares of households in the age\ngroups that commonly fit the first-time house\nbuyer profile might become more important.\n\nHOUSING FUNDAMENTALS\nFROM A LOCAL PERSPECTIVE\nBecause houses are not transportable, and\nbecause commuting distances are necessarily\nlimited, housing markets are segmented. Particular markets routinely experience quite different\nrates of price change and new construction\nbecause local economic conditions can vary\ntremendously and because features of the local\neconomy, such as building regulations, can differ\nsubstantially. Sometimes particular areas experience consistently strong or weak performance\nover many years; sometimes area performance is\nsubject to sharp reversals. Looking over the map,\nexperience varies all over the map!\nIn terms of the demand for housing, it is natural to conclude that households with higher\nincomes will want bigger and better housing, all\nother things being equal. Empirical results sup6\n\nport this view. However, in economists’ technical\nlingo, housing is an “inferior good,” which simply\nmeans that as a household’s income increases it\nwill consume more housing but the increase will\nbe smaller than the increase in income. Food, for\nexample, is a much more extreme example of an\ninferior good. The share of income devoted to\nfood falls rapidly as income rises.\nFrom a local perspective, then, we can expect\nthat locations where incomes are rising will\nexperience an increasing demand for housing,\nbut not at a dollar for dollar rate. As with so many\naspects of the economics of housing, however,\nthe situation can be complicated and uncertain.\nOf the metropolitan-area price increases last year,\n10 of the top 20 were in Florida. The increases\nmay far outrun increases in local income because\nthey are driven importantly by buyers from other\nareas investing in vacation properties or future\nretirement homes, for example. In some resort\ncommunities, people note that full-time residents\nworking in resort facilities cannot afford to live\nin their own towns. Thus, analysis relating house\nprices to local income can go far astray, because\nin some cases the relevant income concept covers\nthe class of high-income families for the entire\ncountry, or even the hemisphere. Thus, it is difficult to find accurate measures of economically\njustified house prices.\nAnother economic aspect crucial to examining local housing conditions is the central tenet\nthat people and capital will, all else equal, move\nto locations where the standards of living are\nhigher. If a household sees that it can expect to\nearn a higher after-tax real income in San Jose\nthan it can in St. Louis, the family will pack up\nand head west. But of course, all else is not equal,\nso the household will also consider other factors,\nsuch as commuting time or population density.\nNevertheless, we tend to observe that places with\nincreasing income also experience increases in\nemployment and population. Naturally, higher\nincome and economic growth in San Jose than in\nSt. Louis increases the demand for housing in\nSan Jose relative to the demand in St. Louis.\nBut does higher income and greater population always imply higher house prices? Not\n\n\fRecent Developments in Housing Markets: A National and Local Perspective\n\nautomatically. The outcome depends on how\nprice-sensitive builders and developers are and\nhow much land is available. For example, consider a metropolitan area that is growing rapidly.\nDevelopers and builders anticipate future growth,\nwhich leads to many new profitable developments and redevelopments. But developers need\nto be paid for the cost of construction plus the\ncost of buying the land. In locations where undeveloped land is scarce, perhaps because of natural or man-made impediments, the acquisition\ncost of the land will be higher and will rise more\nas demand for new houses increases. Clearly,\ncities surrounded by mountains or large bodies\nof water restrict development to certain areas.\nSome cities are encumbered by regulations or\npolitical concerns that hamstring developers,\nwhich increase the cost of building or renovating.\nThe greater the impediments to development,\nthe larger will be the effect of rising demand on\nprices of existing houses.\nThe basic economics of housing at the local\nlevel thus tells us that in locations where development is relatively unrestricted, we should generally see lower average prices than in locations\nwith many restrictions. An increase in demand\nin the former, then, would not be expected to\nraise prices as much as in the latter. In general,\nwe can characterize the Midwest as having plenty\nof developable land and the coastal regions as\nhaving a scarcity of developable land. Therefore,\nwe should expect to see higher and potentially\nincreasing house prices on the coasts relative to\nthe Midwest. And that is generally what we do see.\n\nREGIONAL HOUSE PRICE\nDEVELOPMENTS\nAs an example, let’s compare real house\nprice appreciation for the Boston, Los Angeles,\nWashington, D.C., and St. Louis metropolitan\nareas between the first quarter of 2000 and the\n\nfourth quarter of 2005.5 Using the repeat sales\nprice index reported by OFHEO, we can see that\nSt. Louis has the lowest appreciation. Over the\nfive-year period, real prices increased by 61 percent in Boston, 112 percent in Los Angeles, 100\npercent in Washington, D.C., and 26 percent in\nSt. Louis. These numbers imply a quarterly real\nappreciation rate of approximately 1 percent in\nSt. Louis, less than a third as much as in Los\nAngeles and Washington, D.C.\nWe can examine the same issue at a somewhat\nmore aggregated level, using Census regions. The\nPacific region, which includes California and\nArizona, experienced the largest appreciation,\nwhile those regions that comprise significant\nportions of the Eighth Federal Reserve District\nlagged well behind. From the first quarter of 2000\nthrough the fourth quarter of 2005, the Pacific\nregion’s real appreciation was 82 percent, while\nthe East and West South Central regions experienced a real appreciation of less than 17 percent.6\nRapid house-price appreciation on the coasts\ndoes not come without a cost, or at least a risk.\nFor example, from the late 1980s to the mid 1990s,\nreal house prices declined by 30 percent in\nBoston, by 36 percent in Los Angeles, by 20 percent in Washington, DC, but by only 11 percent\nin St. Louis. In fact, since 1982, St. Louis has not\nhad a nominal decline in house prices. By contrast, it took Boston and Los Angeles approximately 10 years for their nominal prices to recover\nenough to restore prices to a breakeven level.\n\nA LOCAL PERSPECTIVE\nThere is also substantial variation in the\nappreciation of real house prices for metropolitan\nareas in the Eighth Federal Reserve District. For\nexample, from the first quarter of 2000 through\nthe fourth quarter of 2005, Springfield, Missouri,\nLittle Rock, Arkansas, and Louisville, Kentucky,\n\n5\n\nThe real price is calculated as the nominal price deflated by the CPI less shelter.\n\n6\n\nThese are the East South Central (Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi and Tennessee) and West South Central (Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma\nand Texas) regions.\n\n7\n\n\fECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\n\nTable 1\n\nappreciated by 14, 14, and 11 percent, respectively. These increases compare with a 26 percent\nincrease for St. Louis, but gains of less than 8\npercent for Jefferson City, Missouri, and Memphis,\nTennessee. As a result, if St. Louis has experienced\na modest appreciation compared to the coastal\nregions, then other metropolitan areas in the\nEighth District have experienced even less real\nappreciation.\n\nHOUSING PROSPECTS FOR 2006\nI’ll close with a few comments about the\nnational prospects for housing this year. Fore8\n\ncasting the near-term prospects for the U.S. housing sector has always been difficult because the\nhousing industry fluctuates a lot, and the fluctuations depend on changes in income, interest\nrates and other conditions that are themselves\ndifficult to forecast. Since 2002, forecasters have\nsignificantly underestimated the growth of real\nresidential fixed investment in the GDP accounts—\nthe main indicator of the strength of the U.S.\nhousing sector. For instance, in December 2004,\nthe consensus of the Blue Chip forecasters was\nthat real residential fixed investment would\ndecline by about 3.25 percent in 2005. Instead,\nthis investment rose by about 7.5 percent.7 Currently, forecasters are once again expecting hous-\n\n\fRecent Developments in Housing Markets: A National and Local Perspective\n\ning activity to modestly detract from real GDP\ngrowth in 2006. As noted in the minutes of the\nFOMC meeting held on January 31, 2006, policymakers are expecting some weakening in housing\nconstruction. To some extent, growth nationally\nwill be influenced by the pace of the ongoing\nrebuilding activity in the Gulf Coast areas ravaged\nby Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma last year.\nNationally, recent surveys of consumers—\nsuch as the well-known University of Michigan\nconsumer sentiment survey—suggest a marked\nincrease in reticence by consumers to purchase a\nhome. My hunch, though, is that housing activity\nwill stabilize and remain at a high level this year.\nI base this forecast on the belief that the FOMC\nwill keep underlying inflation low and stable,\nand that the growth of real household income\nwill recover nicely due to the waning influence\nof last year’s spike in energy prices. Continued\nhealthy job growth will also help keep housing\nconditions at a high level.\nThat said, some slowing in the growth of\naverage home prices nationally seems a reasonable\nexpectation at this juncture. Accordingly, the\nmarginal contribution to the pace of consumer\nspending stemming from the wealth effect—that\nis, from households extracting a portion of their\nhome equity to spend on goods and services—is\nnot likely to be a significant concern. The reason\nis that other economywide developments—especially income and employment growth—typically\nexert a much greater influence on the consumer’s\npocketbook and spending habits than does the\nstate of the housing industry.\n\nFallis, George; Hosios, Arthur J. and Jump, Gregory V.\n“Housing Allowances, Non-profit Housing, and\nCost-Effective Program Choices.” Journal of Housing\nEconomics, 1995, 4(2): 136-152.\nGirouard, Nathalie; Kennedy, Mike, van den Noord,\nPaul, and Andre, Christophe. “Recent House Price\nDevelopments: The Role of Fundamentals.”\nEconomics Department Working Papers No. 475,\nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and\nDevelopment, January 2006.\nGreen, K.

        "content": "Fed Communications\nSt. Louis Forum\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nFebruary 24, 2006\n\nF\n\nederal Reserve communications are\nmuch in the news recently, in part\nbecause the Fed’s main policy body,\nthe Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) has discussed communications issues\non several occasions in recent years. I’ve spoken\nseveral times on various aspects of communications policy and today want to extend my views,\nwhich are developing further every time I take\nup the subject.\nBefore proceeding, I want to emphasize that\nthe views I express here are mine and do not\nnecessarily reflect official positions of the Federal\nReserve System. I thank my colleagues at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis—especially\nBob Rasche, director of Research at the St. Louis\nFed—for their comments, but I retain full responsibility for errors.\n\nTRANSPARENCY:\nWHAT DOES IT MEAN?\nFed communications issues are often discussed under the general term “transparency.”\nWhat, literally, does transparency mean? The idea\nis that we could throw open the curtains and allow\nthe public to look in through clear windows. If\nthe Fed were to throw open the curtains, what\nwould the public observe?\nOf course, what the public would observe\nwould be different from what now takes place.\nTelevising FOMC meetings on C-SPAN would\ndramatically change the nature of the meetings.\nCertainly, what we mean by transparency cannot\nmean that all Federal Reserve deliberations are\npublic in real time. Transparency must mean dis-\n\nclosing as much as possible without damaging\nthe integrity of policy deliberations. That integrity\nis essential both to be sure that all issues are\nfully debated and to ensure that information\nobtained under pledge of confidentiality remains\nconfidential.\nBut there is another aspect to transparency\nthat is incompletely understood. Let me illustrate\nby reading several passages from the FOMC\ntranscript. The transcript of FOMC meetings is\nreleased to the public with a five-year lag and is\navailable on the Federal Reserve Board of\nGovernors’ web site. All the quotes are my own—\nit would not be fair to pick on others!\n“My overall assessment is that Asia is primarily\na relative demand shock rather than an aggregate demand shock for the United States.”\n(Transcript of FOMC meeting of March 31,\n1998, p. 54.)\n“Money growth, whether we use M2 or a narrower measure—I prefer MZM because I think\nit avoids the problem with sweeps…”\n(Transcript of FOMC meeting of August 18,\n1998, p. 50.)\n“I have a question about the outlook for investment, which is driven importantly, as it should\nbe, by acceleration considerations.”\n(Transcript of FOMC meeting of May 18,\n1999, p. 18.)\n\nWhat do you make of passages such as the\nones I just read? These passages are all taken out\nof context, but my guess is that the material surrounding these passages would not help much\nin understanding them, unless the reader knows\na lot of economics. Much of the FOMC delibera1\n\n\fMONETARY POLICY AND INFLATION\n\ntion consists of fairly technical discussions.\nWithout an advanced degree in economics, or\nextensive policy experience, much of this material is simply incomprehensible. Thus, although\npolicy experts can understand undigested material, the message that they would convey to the\ngeneral public would likely not be timely and\nmight not closely match, in emphasis and tone,\nthe consensus message the FOMC would want to\nconvey.\nMoreover, a certain amount of communication during an FOMC meeting is nonverbal. For\npeople who have come to know each other pretty\nwell over the course of many meetings, some references in a particular meeting have meaning only\nin the context of discussions in prior meetings or\noutside the formal FOMC meeting—during academic conferences for example.\nThe thrust of my argument is that the word\n“transparency” is misleading with respect to\nFederal Reserve communications challenges.\nInstead, the Fed needs a conscious communications strategy rather than a strategy of simply\n“opening up.” The purpose of a conscious strategy\nis not to hide anything but rather to have a clear\ntransmission of information. Successful communication requires that the FOMC distill principal\nmessages or themes from its deliberations and\nthe vast amount of material considered.\nAs an aside, I note that the FOMC transcripts\nare little discussed in the press. The general\nassumption is that they are too old to be newsworthy, but I think they also require a substantial background in economics and the history of\nmonetary policy to interpret correctly. Thus, even\nif the transcript were released promptly after a\nmeeting—which wouldn’t be constructive\nbecause doing so would change the nature of the\nCommittee’s deliberations—I doubt that the transcript would be a very satisfactory communications vehicle.\n\nFED COMMUNICATIONS GOALS\nAny strategy requires a clear conception of\nthe goals. For Fed communications strategies\n2\n\nthere are a number of possible goals; I will emphasize two.\nThe Federal Reserve, as an agency created by\nCongress, clearly has a responsibility to be politically accountable. The Fed needs to be responsive\nto questions and concerns from the Congress and,\nindeed, from the public at large. The Fed needs\nto be as clear as possible as to the goals of monetary policy and the standards to be applied to\njudge the degree of success in meeting the goals.\nThe Employment Act of 1946 sets the goals in\ngeneral terms as maximum employment and purchasing power. The Federal Reserve, in congressional testimony, Fed documents and speeches,\nprovides its interpretation of these goals.\nA second, somewhat different, goal of communications strategy is to make monetary policy\nmore effective. This is a goal of great importance\nfor achieving the congressional mandate provided\nto the Federal Reserve. To explain the importance\nof clear communications to effective policy I need\nto develop the argument starting with a theoretical framework.\n\nTHEORETICAL FRAMEWORK\nThe Federal Reserve relies heavily on economic theory developed over the span of many\ndecades. The theoretical framework is complicated in its technical form and implementation\nbut quite straight forward in its bare-bones\nabstract framework. The key element is the interaction between the Fed’s policy stance and the\nresponse of the economy to changes in the policy\nstance.\nAt each of its meetings, the FOMC sets the\nintended, or target, federal funds rate. The federal\nfunds rate is the interest rate on interbank borrowing and lending. Most fed funds transactions are\nfor one day—overnight loans in market parlance.\nIf the federal funds rate in the market is tending\nabove the target rate, the Open Market Desk at\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York supplies\nadditional funds to the market through purchases\nof Treasury securities, or transactions with similar\neffect. If the rate in the market is trading below\n\n\fFed Communications\n\nthe intended rate, the Desk absorbs funds from\nthe market by selling Treasury securities or equivalent transactions. These open market operations\nadjust the supply of bank reserves so that the\nmarket rate remains close to the intended rate.\nThe FOMC sets the intended rate so as to\nachieve as closely as possible the goals of low\nand stable inflation and maximum sustainable\neconomic growth. To understand how the FOMC\ndecides on the appropriate target funds rate, we\nneed to fill in details about how policy actions\naffect the economy.\nThe only interest rate affected directly by\nFed open market operations is the federal funds\nrate. The market determines longer-term interest\nrates, such as Treasury bond rates of all maturities,\nand mortgage rates. These rates depend critically\non expectations about the future. In particular, the\nmarket’s expectation of a one-week rate depends\non the expected overnight federal funds rate over\nthe next seven days. In general, the rate on any\nbond depends on expected short rates over the\nhorizon of the bond. Thus, the ten-year Treasury\nbond rate depends on expectations of short-term\ninterest rates over the ten-year horizon.\nMarket expectations about future interest rates\ndepend on the interaction of two interrelated\nsources of influence. One, obviously, concerns\nFederal Reserve decisions on the intended federal\nfunds rate. Also important are expectations as to\nthe demands for and supplies of funds in the private market. For example, with a simultaneous\ninvestment and housing boom, credit demands\nwill be high and interest rates will tend to be bid\nup. In pursuing its policy goals the FOMC will\nbe adjusting the federal funds rate as needed to\nkeep the inflation rate low and stable. Thus, the\nmarket forms expectations about the underlying\nstate of the economy that will bear on Fed\ndecisions.\nThe Federal Reserve is constantly evaluating\nthe situation in the markets and trying to adjust\nthe intended federal funds rate to produce a satisfactory equilibrium in the economy. When we\nput the Federal Reserve’s and the market’s decisions and expectations together, we have a\nmacroeconomic equilibrium.\n\nFULL RATIONAL EXPECTATIONS\nMACROECONOMIC EQUILIBRIUM\nThe interaction between the Federal Reserve\nand the markets may be confusing at first sight,\nand indeed was confusing to economists for generations until conceptual breakthroughs in the\n1960s and 1970s clarified the issue. Market\nbehavior depends on expectations as to what the\nFederal Reserve is going to do, and what the\nFederal Reserve is going to do depends on what\nthe market and the economy are anticipated to do.\nThe full rational expectations macroeconomic\nequilibrium occurs when the market behaves as\nthe Federal Reserve expects and the Federal\nReserve behaves as the market expects. In both\ncases we assume that the expectations are fully\nrational, by which we mean that the expectations\nare fully informed on the basis of all available\ninformation.\nThe paradigm of a full rational expectations\nmacroeconomic equilibrium sets the framework\nfor communications strategy. From the Federal\nReserve’s point of view, policy effectiveness will\nbe enhanced when the market has a complete and\naccurate understanding of the Federal Reserve’s\ngoals and policy processes. Thus, to obtain good\npolicy outcomes it is in the Fed’s interest to provide as complete information as possible to the\nmarket.\nThe abstraction of a full rational expectations\nmacroeconomic equilibrium provides a powerful starting point for analysis of communications\nissues. Nevertheless, it is obvious that in reality\ninformation is incomplete, in part because the\nfuture is unknowable with precision. Moreover\nat any given time some individuals inevitably\nhave more information and more processing\npower than others.\n\nAsymmetric Information\nA feature of many market environments is\nthat some agents in the market have more information than others do. In the monetary policy\ncontext, the Federal Reserve has the largest and\nmost extensive economic information gathering\n3\n\n\fMONETARY POLICY AND INFLATION\n\nsystem in the world. The Fed not only has a large\nstaff but also has access to considerable confidential information from individual firms. To\nsome extent this confidential information can be\ndisclosed in summary form without identifying\nindividual firms, but nevertheless the Fed’s timely\naccess to this information and knowledge of the\nfirms involved does give the Fed an advantage\nover the market in general. However, the information asymmetry is not totally one-sided. Individual\nfirms have enormous specialized market information that the Fed does not have. For example,\nlarge retail firms have day-by-day and even\nhour-by-hour information on the scale of retail\ntransactions in the economy; large banks and\ncredit card companies have information on dayby-day economic activity as they observe flows\nof transactions on their own books. The relevant\neconomy-wide reports constructed by government\nstatistical agencies come out with a lag measured\nin weeks to a month or more. These formal statistical reports are the primary source of Federal\nReserve information, and they are available to\neveryone in the market. Although there certainly\nis an issue of asymmetric information, my own\nview is that asymmetric information is not a major\nissue for Fed communications policy.\n\nPolicy Decisions Versus Policy\nAn extremely important distinction in the\npolicy literature is that between policy decisions\nand policies. A policy is the systematic behavior\nof the policy agency in determining individual\npolicy actions. Thus, how satisfactory a policy is\ncannot be judged from any single policy action.\nIt is the sequence of policy actions and their relation to the observable economic environment\nthat define a policy. In principle, there should be\na policy response rule, or regularity, or formula,\nor recipe, or whatever you want call it, that guides\nor determines the individual policy actions. In\nthe absence of such a regularity, policy actions\nwould be random and capricious. Good policy\n1\n\n4\n\naims to be systematic—certainly not random and\ncapricious.\nThe difficulty is that in the monetary policy\narena no one has yet been able to derive a thorough\nand complete statement of what the policy rule\nis or should be.1 The reason for this situation is\nthat policymakers must respond to a flow of\ninformation that differs in certain respects from\nprior experience. In principle, in a rational\nexpectations equilibrium, the flow of new information triggers policy actions that are highly\npredictable in the market place. That is, as new\nand unpredicted information arises, the Fed’s\nand the market’s response to the information\nshould be highly predictable.\nThis conception of monetary policy creates a\ncommunications challenge because many market\nparticipants seem not to understand the framework very well. What market participants want\nto know more than anything else is what the Fed’s\nnext policy action is going to be. But, under most\ncircumstances the FOMC cannot predict its next\npolicy action because the Committee cannot predict the new information that will drive the policy\naction. Thus, an important communications\nchallenge is for the Fed to explain the essential\ndifference between policy and policy actions and\nwhy this distinction is critical to the effectiveness of monetary policy.\n\nFed Disturbances\nRational expectations models are designed\nso that the Fed policy action is a predictable\nfunction of information as it arrives. These models\ndo not have a constructive place for a random\ncomponent to Fed policy. That is, in an abstract\nmodel in which the Fed policy rule is specified\nwith precision up to a random term, the smaller\nis the variance of the random term the more\neffective the policy will be. Intuitively, it makes\nsense that in the monetary policy context added\nuncertainty from unpredictable policy should\n\nI discussed this issue at some length in a speech in October 2005: “The Fed’s Monetary Policy Rule,” published in The Federal Reserve Bank\nof St. Louis Review, January/February 2006, 88, pp. 1-12.\n\n\fFed Communications\n\nnot be expected to be constructive for the economy as a whole.\nAs an aside, note that there are policy environments in which a random component to a\npolicy is an essential feature for policy success.\nTransportation of large sums of cash in an\narmored truck is an example. The transportation\nschedule and route should be randomized as\nmuch as possible to reduce the probability of\ntheft. To my knowledge, in models of macroeconomic policy no one has created a positive case\nfor randomness.\nIt is sometimes argued that policy communications should be vague to retain policy flexibility.\nMy own view is that communications should be\nclear about what is known and what is not. It is\npossible to be perfectly clear about why flexibility\nis necessary—why policy actions ordinarily cannot be specified long in advance. The reason, as I\nhave already argued, is that policy actions ought\nto be responsive to new information that cannot\nitself be predicted.\n\nCOMMUNICATIONS CHALLENGES\nThe discussion so far has left implicit a number of communications challenges, which I will\nnow take up more explicitly.\nWhere the Fed has specialized information\nthat it can disclose without compromising confidentially or the integrity of the policy process,\nthere is a strong argument for the Fed to make\nsuch disclosure. In fact, for many years the Fed\nhas published the Beige Book several weeks before\neach FOMC meeting. The Beige Book is a compendium of anecdotal reports summarized district by district across the country. This anecdotal\ninformation supplements the formal statistical\ninformation and is an important input to the policy\nprocess. In other cases the Federal Reserve may\nobtain specialized information through its own\nresearch. Results of Federal Reserve research are\nusually made available quite promptly in the\nform of working papers on Federal Reserve web\nsites.\n\nAt the conclusion of each FOMC meeting the\nCommittee releases a brief policy statement.\nPolicy statements also appear in speeches and\ntestimony of FOMC members. This public information is not always perfectly clear. Part of the\ndifficulty lies in the inherent uncertainties in the\neconomy and uncertainties faced by Committee\nmembers. It is also natural for different Committee\nmembers to have somewhat different views and\nfor those views to evolve over time. From this\nplethora of information it may be difficult for the\nmarket to distill clear messages. For these reasons,\nthe summary policy statement at the conclusion\nof each FOMC meeting and the FOMC minutes\nof meetings play a critically important role.\nMy own view on the policy statement, stated\non a number of occasions in the past, is that the\npolicy statement needs to be put together from\nrelatively few standard elements. The way I\nhave put this point is that the English language\nis incredibly rich, often with multiple meanings\nfor a given word. The various meanings can be\nlooked up in a good dictionary. However, there is\nno dictionary in which we can look up the meaning of a paragraph. In the past, market participants\nhave sometimes come to somewhat different\ninterpretations of FOMC policy statements. This\nfact indicates to me that the Committee has not\ncommunicated with as much clarity as desirable.\nI do not pretend that the goal is easy to reach but\nbelieve that progress will require greater standardization over time in the structure of the statement\nand in the options from which the statement is\nput together.\nThere is a natural tendency to try to write in\nan interesting and literate fashion. One way to\ndo so is to use synonyms to avoid repetition. The\npractice can be tricky, however. Suppose one\npolicy statement describes the outlook as “solid”\nand the next as “robust.” Is robust a shade higher\ngrowth than solid? How much higher? Rhetorical\nflourishes make for more interesting writing but\ndo not necessarily enhance clarity when it comes\nto policy statements. Examples of this sort abound.\nWhat is the difference between “moderate growth”\nand “modest growth?”\n5\n\n\fMONETARY POLICY AND INFLATION\n\nEach policy statement is read next to the preceding one. The market looks closely at changes\nin the adjectives used, the word order and every\nother aspect of a statement. Sometimes I think\nthat a series of statements could evolve in such a\nway that the meaning would be relatively clear,\ngiven the evolution, even though the most recent\nstatement might be quite confusing if considered\non its own.\nFor these reasons, and others, I believe that\nclarity in FOMC statements could be improved\nby making them more stylized. A stylized statement may be dull, but the market will search for\nmeaning whenever the statement changes. If we\nwant changes to have clear meaning, we need to\nform the statement from stock phrases that have\nbeen explained before.\nI earlier emphasized that, in the rational\nexpectations equilibrium framework, random\npolicy disturbances do not serve a constructive\npurpose. Avoiding random disturbances is not as\neasy as it might seem, given that communication\nis difficult and misunderstandings or incomplete\nunderstanding is relatively easy. There are, however, some specific things that could be done.\nAlthough I’ve emphasized statements, it is\nalso true that the market searches for meaning in\nthe policy actions themselves. An increase in the\nintended rate of 25 basis points between scheduled meetings has a very different meaning than\nthe same size increase at a scheduled meeting.\nTo reduce uncertainty over the meaning of intermeeting policy actions, the FOMC could adopt\nan explicit policy of making all policy adjustments only at scheduled meetings unless there\nwere a compelling circumstance to act between\nmeetings. The compelling circumstance ordinarily could be easily explained; indeed, the event\ntriggering a policy response would probably be\nhighly visible and the policy response occasion\nno market surprise. An example would be the\npolicy action following the 9/11 attacks. A standard procedure of confining policy actions to\nscheduled meetings would avoid market specu2\n\n6\n\nlation about the reasons for surprise policy adjustments when they occur, and speculation that such\na surprise might occur. Given that there have\nbeen only five intermeeting policy actions since\n1994, this change would formalize what is now\ncustomary practice.\nAnother explicit understanding could be\nthat all policy adjustments will be in increments\nof 25 basis points, unless compelling reasons\nargue for larger moves. The possibility that market expectations of future rate changes might not\nmatch the FOMC’s expectations is nicely illustrated by experience in the spring of 2004. At\nthat time the market understood that the FOMC\nwould be raising the funds rate target from the 1\npercent level that had prevailed since June 2003,\nand many in the market were concerned that the\npace of rate increases might be rapid, as they had\nbeen in 1994. After its meeting of May 4, 2004,\nthe Committee issued a policy statement that\nreferred to a “measured pace” of policy actions\nin an attempt to better align market expectations\nwith its own expectations.2 This concern would\nnot have been present if the FOMC had adopted\na policy of confining adjustments to 25 basis\npoints in the absence of a compelling reason to\nact more forcefully. The measured pace language\ndid exactly what was intended, as press coverage\nafter the meeting noted.\nConfining policy actions to 25 basis points as\na normal matter is pretty close to standard practice. Of the 47 policy actions from 1994 to date,\n33 have been 25-basis-points changes, 13 have\nbeen 50-basis-points changes and only one has\nbeen a 75-basis-points change. There have been\nno changes larger than 75 basis points.\nI emphasized earlier the importance of the\ndistinction between a policy and a policy action.\nIn its communications, I believe that the FOMC\nshould work harder to explain how individual\npolicy actions fit into a comprehensive and systematic policy. When the market understands\nwhy the FOMC acts as it does, the market will be\nable to observe arriving information and judge\n\nThe full sentence in the policy statement was: “At this juncture, with inflation low and resource use slack, the Committee believes that policy\naccommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.”\n\n\fFed Communications\n\nhow the FOMC is likely to respond to the same\ninformation. Appropriate market responses to\ninformation will accelerate the economy’s\nresponse to the information, improving the efficiency of those responses. And, of course, FOMC\npolicy actions will not be a surprise under these\ncircumstances.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE:\nMEASURABLE SUCCESS\nWith my colleague Bob Rasche, I’ve been able\nto study the effectiveness of FOMC communications. I’ve presented the results in some detail3;\nhere I’ll just report the bottom line. Over the past\ndecade, the market has been able to predict FOMC\npolicy adjustments with considerable accuracy.\nThat fact indicates that policy has been systematic enough, and communications effective\nenough, that we’ve made major progress toward\nachieving the goal of a full rational expectations\nmacroeconomic equilibrium. Relative to the\nprogress already made, my suggestions are minor\nrefinements. But that is the point we have reached,\nand there is every reason to pursue further gains.\n\n3\n\nIn my view, part of the reason the economy\nhas been so stable—indeed, increasingly stable—\nover the past two decades or so is that monetary\npolicy has become much more predictable.\nGreater predictability is a consequence of FOMC\nsuccess in adjusting the stance of monetary policy\nin a much more rule-like way and the Committee’s\nsuccess in enhancing its communications with\nthe market and general public. I’ve suggested a\ngeneral framework for understanding communications issues—the full rational expectations\nmacroeconomic equilibrium. Perfecting that\nequilibrium by making policy adjustments\nincreasingly regular and by reducing aspects of\npolicy that appear random to the market is a\nworthy goal.\nAs I have argued, there are some further steps\nalong this road that the FOMC might consider. I\nwould welcome suggestions from market participants and academic experts.

I cannot report\na story about how Junior Achievement (JA)\ngot me off to a good start, but I do have a\npersonal story—from my oldest son, Will. When\nI accepted this speaking invitation, I asked Will\nto reflect on his JA experience, and here is the\nparagraph he sent me.\nI was involved in Junior Achievement when I\nwas in 8th grade. Most entrepreneurial-minded\nkids I knew gained their business experiences\non paper routes, painting houses or the like.\nBut I was drawn to JA’s concept of teaching the\nbasics of business and figuring out how to\nmass-produce something. Little did I know\nwhere it would lead me. In my JA group, we\nassembled wooden coat pegs on boards and\npainted them up nicely. I quickly learned that\nbuilding a single coat-rack widget is not so\nhard, but leading a handful of people to make\n50, with quality, is much harder. And that getting all of them sold for a profit is even harder\nyet. I can’t say exactly which of the skills I\nlearned at JA helped me end up running the\nWindows business at Microsoft. I was a big\ndreamer back then, but even I would not have\ndreamt that I would someday be leading a team\nof 3,000 professionals that create software that\nis used in 169 countries around the world and\npowers 200,000,000 new PCs sold every year.\nJA, thanks for the jump-start!\n\nWill is a senior vice president for Microsoft’s\nWindows client business. Needless to say, I am\nimmensely proud of him. I don’t know the list,\nbut will bet that numerous other JA alumni are\nin very responsible positions today.\n1\n\nI find computers a bit mysterious, and I know\nthat many think that monetary policy is even\nmore mysterious. Federal Reserve officials used\nto delight in adding to the mystery, but today\nadvances in macroeconomic theory have made\nclear the importance of central bank transparency\nto an effective monetary policy.\nSince coming to the St. Louis Fed in 1998, I\nhave spoken often on the subject of the predictability of Federal Reserve policy, emphasizing\nthat predictability enhances the effectiveness of\npolicy.1 Predictability has many dimensions, but\none is certainly that the market cannot predict\nwhat the Fed is going to do without a deep understanding of what the Fed is trying to do.\nThe Fed has stated for many years that a key\nmonetary policy objective is low and stable\ninflation. I believe that adding formality to that\nobjective can clarify what the Fed does and why.\nThat is my topic today.\nBefore proceeding, I want to emphasize that\nthe views I express here are mine and do not\nnecessarily reflect official positions of the Federal\nReserve System. I thank my colleagues at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for their comments; Daniel L. Thornton, vice president in the\nResearch Division, provided special assistance.\nI take full responsibility for errors.\n\nTHE FRAMEWORK\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nhas the responsibility to determine monetary\npolicy. The Committee implements policy by\n\nSee Poole (1999) for the first of a series of speeches on this topic.\n\n1\n\n\fMONETARY POLICY AND INFLATION\n\nsetting a target for the federal funds rate. Policy\npredictability does not mean that the public or\nthe markets can successfully forecast the target\nfederal funds rate next week, next month, or next\nyear. The target rate is based on policymakers’\ncurrent information and best estimate of future\neconomic events; the key observation is that\nincoming information may depart from the best\nestimate and indicate that the target funds rate\nneeds to be changed to achieve policy objectives.\nWhat we must mean by perfectly predictable is\nthat the public and the markets are not surprised\nby the Fed’s response to the latest economic\ninformation, understanding that the information\nitself is not predictable.\nAlthough new information creates a steady\nstream of mostly minor surprises, the FOMC ought\nto be clear about what it is trying to accomplish.\nAt present, most members of the Committee\nwould probably be pretty close together on how\nto state the inflation goal. A benefit of greater\nformality in defining the inflation goal is that\nindividual FOMC members would have a clearer\nidea as to what the inflation objective is.\nTo illustrate this point, I have often said that\nmy preferred target rate of inflation is “zero,\nproperly measured.” That is, allowing as best we\ncan for measurement bias, which might be in the\nneighborhood of half a percent per year for broad\nmeasures of consumer prices, I favor literally zero\ninflation. Given measurement bias in price\nindices, I might state my goal as inflation between\n0.5 and 1.5 percent as measured by the price index\nfor personal consumption expenditures (the PCE\nprice index). Others prefer a somewhat higher\nrate of inflation, perhaps in the range of 1 to 2\npercent as measured by the PCE price index. Still\nothers might favor a different target range, with a\ndifferent midpoint and/or a wider or narrower\nrange. If the FOMC decides to discuss inflation\ntargeting, all dimensions of specifying a target\nwill be considered carefully.\nWhy does precision on a target range matter?\nConsider a situation in which the actual rate of\ninflation is 1.5 percent. Those favoring a target\nrange of 1 to 2 percent would say that the policy\nstance is just right; inflation is in the exact center\n2\n\nof the target range. I, given my preferred target\nrange, would argue for a somewhat more restrictive stance, to move the inflation rate down toward\nthe center of my preferred range. The difference\nbetween these two target ranges is small, and yet\nthat difference might be enough to call for a somewhat different policy stance.\nObviously, the Fed cannot simultaneously\npursue two different inflation goals, and therefore\nthere is every reason for the Committee to agree\non a common objective. An agreed-upon common\nobjective is much more important than the small\ndifference between my own preferred objective\nand the range of objectives I believe are favored\nby others.\nIf the FOMC were to decide on a common\nobjective, then the Committee could communicate\nit to the general public. Discussion of the formal,\nnumeric objective and what it means would help\nmarkets to better understand monetary policy and\nwould make policy more predictable. However,\nmany details matter and an inflation target will\nnot be a source of increased clarity unless the\ndetails are specified appropriately. So, let’s talk\nabout those important details. To simplify the\nlanguage, I’ll refer to a publicly announced, specific numerical target range for inflation as a\n“formal” inflation target or objective.\n\nWHAT IS INFLATION?\nIf the FOMC is going to adopt a formal inflation\nobjective, we need to agree on what “inflation” is.\nHowever inflation is measured, it is important to\ndistinguish between “high frequency” inflation,\nwhich central banks have little control over, and\n“low frequency” inflation, which central banks\ncan control. High-frequency inflation is the rate\nof change in the price level over relatively short\ntime periods—months, quarters, or perhaps even\na year. Low-frequency inflation is an economywide, systemic process that is affected by past,\npresent, and expected future economic events.\nCentral banks accept responsibility for lowfrequency inflation because such inflation\ndepends critically on past and, especially,\n\n\fInflation Targeting\n\nexpected future monetary policy. When I advocate\nthat the Fed establish a formal inflation objective,\nI am speaking of the low-frequency inflation rate.\nAs a practical matter, low-frequency inflation can\nbe thought of as the average inflation rate over a\nperiod of a few years.\n\nSETTING THE TARGET RATE OF\nINFLATION\nThe Employment Act of 1946 sets objectives\nfor monetary policy—indeed, objectives for all\neconomic policy.2 The Act declares that it is the\n“responsibility of the Federal Government...to\npromote maximum employment, production, and\npurchasing power.” These objectives are reflected\nin the FOMC’s twin objectives of “price stability”\nand “maximum sustainable economic growth.”\nAlthough useful, these phrases are somewhat\nvague. For example, in the late 1970s and early\n1980s, the Fed pursued the goal of price stability\nby reducing inflation from double-digit rates; from\nthe mid-1980s into the early 1990s, the goal was\nto bring inflation down from the 4 percent neighborhood. Over the past decade or so, the goal has\ncome to mean keeping the inflation rate low.\nBut what inflation rate constitutes price stability? Rather than a numerical definition, former\nChairman Greenspan preferred a conceptual\ndefinition, suggesting that “price stability is best\nthought of as an environment in which inflation\nis so low and stable over time that it does not\nmaterially enter into the decisions of households\nand firms.”3 But does Greenspan’s definition\nrequire zero inflation?\nBecause measuring the price level is a daunting\ntask, zero true inflation and zero measured inflation may differ. Prices of individual goods and\nservices change over time, but if some prices are\n\nfalling and others are rising, then the average of\nall prices, or the price level, can remain constant.\nNevertheless, defining a price index when prices\nare changing at different rates involves measurement issues that are complicated at both conceptual and practical levels. For a variety of technical\nreasons that I won’t discuss, the best we can do\nis to approximate the theoretical construct of the\nprice level. Experts believe that price indices, such\nas the consumer price index (CPI) and the PCE\nprice index, have an upward bias. That is, if the\nprice level were truly unchanged, the price index\nwould show a low rate of inflation.\nWhen asked during the July 1996 FOMC meeting what level of inflation does not cause distortions to economic decisionmaking, Chairman\nGreenspan responded, “zero, if inflation is properly measured.”4 Greenspan’s view that the theoretically correct definition of price stability is zero\ninflation stems from his belief that economic\ngrowth is maximized when the price level is\nunchanged on average over time.5 While I believe\nthat there is a virtual consensus that the economy\nfunctions best when the theoretically correct measure of inflation is “low,” not everyone agrees with\nGreenspan that true price stability—a zero rate\nof inflation properly measured—is the best target\nfor the Fed. For a variety of reasons, some economists believe that the economy functions best\nwhen inflation correctly measured is “low” but\nnot zero.\nWhile the goal of price stability is specific in\nboth the Federal Reserve Act and the Employment\nAct of 1946, some suggest that the FOMC lacks\nthe authority to establish a numerical inflation\nobjective. They claim that only Congress has this\nauthority. That Congress has the power to establish the goals of economic policy is indisputable;\nhowever, it does not follow that the FOMC does\nnot have the authority to adopt a formal inflation\n\n2\n\nSee Santoni (1986) for a discussion of the creation of the Act.\n\n3\n\nGreenspan (2002, p. 6).\n\n4\n\nTranscript of the FOMC meeting held on July 2-3, 1996, p. 51.\n\n5\n\nFor completeness, I note that Friedman (1969) argued that the optimal rate of inflation was negative. Specifically, he suggested that economic\nwelfare was maximized when the nominal interest rate was zero. This requires that the inflation rate is equal to negative of the real interest rate.\n\n3\n\n\fMONETARY POLICY AND INFLATION\n\nobjective as part of implementing its broad congressional mandate. It is common practice for\nCongress to establish objectives and guidelines\nand leave it up to the agency responsible for\nmeeting those objectives to fill in the details.\nThe real question is this: Should the FOMC\nannounce what its inflation objective is? Answering this question is simple in principle. If announcing a specific, numerical inflation objective\nenhances the efficacy of monetary policy, then the\nanswer is yes. If doing so reduces the efficacy of\nmonetary policy, the answer is no. I believe the\nanswer is yes for a variety of reasons.\n\nTHE CASE FOR AN INFLATION\nTARGET\nI have already pointed out that a formal\ninflation goal should improve the coherence of\ninternal Fed deliberations by focusing attention\non how to achieve an agreed goal rather than on\nthe goal itself. Adopting and achieving a formal\ninflation objective should reduce risks for individuals and businesses when making long-term\ndecisions.\nBecause the benefits of price stability are\nindirect and diffuse, they are difficult to quantify.\nOne area where the benefits of price stability are\nmost apparent is the long-term bond market. It is\nnot surprising that the 10-year Treasury bond\nyield has generally drifted down with actual and\nexpected inflation since the late 1970s. The reduction in long-term bond yields reflects market\nparticipants’ expectations of lower inflation and\ntheir increased confidence about the long-term\ninflation rate. Moreover, the volatility of the market’s expected rate of inflation, measured by the\nspread between nominal and inflation-indexed\n10-year Treasury bond yields, has trended down\nsince the late 1990s, suggesting an increased\nconfidence in the Fed’s resolve to keep inflation\nlow. I anticipate that the adoption of a formal\ninflation objective would result in some, probably\nmodest, further reduction in the level and variability of nominal long-term bond yields.\n4\n\nAdopting a formal inflation objective, and\nsuccess in achieving that objective, will also\nenhance policymakers’ ability to pursue other\npolicy objectives, such as conducting countercyclical monetary policy. I suspect that some of\nthose who oppose a specific inflation objective are\nconcerned that doing so will cause policymakers\nto become what Mervyn King, Governor of the\nBank of England, has colorfully termed “inflation\nnutters.” King (1997) is referring to policymakers\nwho aim to stabilize inflation, whatever the costs.\nI believe that just the opposite has happened.\nThe debate is fundamentally about the relationship between the low-inflation objective and\nthe high-employment objective. Even before\nBritish economist A.W. Phillips published\nresearch in 1958 that gave rise to what quickly\ncame to be called the Phillips curve, many economists believed that there was a negative relationship between inflation and unemployment—i.e.,\nlower inflation resulted in higher unemployment.\nSome preferred to think of causation as going the\nother way around—that higher unemployment\nresulted in lower inflation.\nThe inflation-unemployment trade-off was\nthought to be permanent. Society could have a\npermanently lower average unemployment rate\nby accepting a higher average rate of inflation. In\nthe late 1960s, Milton Friedman (1968) and\nEdmund Phelps (1967) challenged the idea of a\npermanent trade-off by making the theoretical\nargument that the Phillips curve must be vertical\nin the long run in a world where economic agents\nare rational. Subsequent evidence confirmed the\nFriedman-Phelps view, and few economists today\nbelieve that there is any long-run trade-off.\nA vertical long-run Phillips curve does not\nimply that one long-run inflation rate is as good as\nany other. Rather, the dynamics of the FriedmanPhelps theory imply that inflation would accelerate continuously were policymakers to pursue\na policy of keeping the unemployment rate permanently below its natural, or equilibrium, rate.\nThis equilibrium rate came to be called the\nNAIRU—the nonaccelerating inflation rate of\nunemployment.\n\n\fInflation Targeting\n\nThe Friedman-Phelps theory demonstrates\nwhy a policy of keeping the unemployment rate\npermanently below its natural rate is futile. It does\nnot tell us the inflation rate that maximizes social\nwelfare, which I will call the optimal inflation\nrate. Economic theory demonstrates why inflation\nis costly, and worldwide experience demonstrates\nthat “high” inflation and “slow” economic growth\nappear to be inexorably linked. Everyone acknowledges that, beyond some rate, inflation reduces\neconomic growth. The goals of price stability and\nmaximum sustainable economic growth are not\nsubstitutes, as implied by the original Phillips\ncurve, but complements. Monetary policymakers\ncan make their greatest contribution to achieving\nmaximum sustainable economic growth by achieving and maintaining low and stable inflation.\nThat inflation and economic growth are\ncomplements does not imply that policymakers\nshould not engage in countercyclical monetary\npolicy when circumstances warrant. For example,\nwith inflation well contained at the end of the\nlong 1990s expansion, the FOMC began reducing\nits target for the federal funds rate in January 2001,\nsomewhat in advance of the onset of the 2001\nrecession. The funds rate target was reduced still\nfurther in 2002 and 2003 as incoming data revealed\nthat the economy was responding somewhat more\nslowly than expected and that actual and expected\ninflation remained well contained. The funds rate\ntarget was eventually reduced to 1 percent and\nremained there for slightly more than a year.\nThose who suggest that adopting a formal\ninflation objective will cause policymakers to\nbecome inflation nutters and, somehow, limit the\nFed’s ability to pursue other policy objectives\nshould examine actual experience. Not only did\nthe Fed’s commitment to price stability not prevent\nit from engaging in countercyclical monetary\npolicy—it facilitated it.6 Such an aggressive countercyclical monetary policy as pursued starting\nin early 2001 would have been unthinkable were\n\nit not for the fact that the credibility established\nover the years since Paul Volcker dramatically\naltered the course of monetary policy in October\n1979.7\nI believe that having a formal inflation objective will further enhance the Fed’s credibility and,\nconsequently, its ability to engage in countercyclical monetary policy. The reason is simple.\nThe more open and precise the Fed is about its\nlong-run inflation objective, the more confident\nthe public will be that the Fed will meet that\nobjective. The objective, and the accompanying\nobligation to explain situations in which the\nobjective is not achieved, should increase the\nFed’s credibility.\nBecause it will be much easier for the public\nto determine whether the FOMC is pursuing its\ninflation objective if that objective is known with\nprecision, adopting a formal objective for inflation also will enhance the Fed’s accountability.\nHaving a formal objective makes the Congress’s\nand the public’s job easier, thereby enhancing\naccountability. If the FOMC misses its inflation\nobjective, it will have to say why the objective\nwas missed. By the same token, the FOMC will\nhave to explain why it failed to respond to a particular event when inflation appeared to be wellcontained within the objective. In essence, having\na specific inflation objective will help the public\nbetter understand what I have elsewhere called\n“the Fed’s monetary policy rule.”8\n\nSPECIFYING THE TARGET\nThat there are differences of opinion about\nthe optimal inflation rate is not a reason for having\na fuzzy objective. If there are important differences\nof opinion within the FOMC on the appropriate\ntarget, which I doubt, the Committee ought to\nresolve those differences and not permit them to\nbe a source of uncertainty.\n\n6\n\nFor evidence on how inflation interfered with countercyclical policy in the past, see Poole (2002).\n\n7\n\nFor those interested in understanding the issues that led up to and succeeded this event, see Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (2005).\n\n8\n\nPoole (2006).\n\n5\n\n\fMONETARY POLICY AND INFLATION\n\nFigure 1A\nCPI and Core CPI 3-Year Moving Averages\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n1960\n\n1965\n\n1970\n\n1975\n\n1980\n\n–2\n\nBecause the target should apply to lowfrequency inflation, the target needs to be stated\nin terms of either a range or a point target with\nan understood range of fluctuation around the\npoint target. The choice is more a matter of the\nmost effective way of communicating the target\nand what it means than a matter of substance.\nA specific target range, such as 1 to 2 percent\nannual change in a particular price index, has the\nadvantage of focusing attention on low-frequency\ninflation. Even here, there could be special circumstances, which the Fed should explain should\nthey occur, that would justify departure from the\ntarget. The way the range is expressed interacts\nwith the period over which inflation is averaged.\nA narrower range would be appropriate for a\ntarget expressed as a three-year average than for\na year-over-year target.\nTo understand what such a target means,\nsuppose states were to abolish sales taxes and\nraise income taxes to offset the revenue loss. The\neffect of this change in tax structure would be to\n6\n\n1985\n\n1990\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\nCPI for All Urban Consumers: All Items\nCPI for All Urban Consumers: All Items Less Food & Energy\nDifference\n\nreduce measured prices. Such a tax change would\nbe a one-time effect—the price level would change\nwhen the new tax law took effect but there would\nnot be continuing pressure over time tending to\nlower prices. Suppose the one-shot price level\nchange took measured inflation outside the target\nrange. With a formal inflation target, the FOMC\nwould have the responsibility of explaining why\na monetary policy response to this target miss\nwould be unnecessary and perhaps harmful.\nA formal inflation target needs to refer to a\nparticular price index. That there is no price index\nthat adequately reflects the economy’s true rate\nof inflation is yet another reason given for not\nadopting a specific inflation objective. My own\njudgment is that the PCE price index measures\nconsumer prices reasonably well and has some\nadvantages, which can be explained, over the CPI.\nMoreover, the FOMC could reasonably maintain\na rate of increase in this index in a range of, say\n1 to 2 percent, on a two-year moving average basis\nunder most circumstances.\n\n\fInflation Targeting\n\nFigure 1B\nPCE and Core PCE 3-Year Moving Averages\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n1960\n\n1965\n\n1970\n\n1975\n\n1980\n\n–2\n\nOver time, refinements in the price index or\nintroduction of better indices may lead to substitution of another index for the PCE index or justify\na change in the target range. The FOMC would\nthen have to explain why it was adjusting the\nobjective or index used to evaluate the objective.\nThe formal target provides a valuable vehicle for\nexplaining an important issue in the conduct of\nmonetary policy. Experience with inflation targeting in industrial economies suggests that issues\nof this sort have not been important. The markets\nare already well informed about such issues—\nand are becoming increasingly so. Conducting\nthis conversation with the markets will improve\nthe clarity of monetary policy and therefore its\neffectiveness.\nOver the past decade or so the Fed has gravitated to the position of placing primary emphasis\non the core rate of inflation, as measured by the\nPCE price index excluding food and energy. The\nreason is not that food and energy are unimportant—these are obviously two very important\n\n1985\n\n1990\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\nPCE: Chain-type Price Index\nPCE Less Food and Energy: Chain-type Price Index\nDifference\n\ncategories of goods. Rather, experience indicates\nthat food and energy prices are subject to large\nshort-run disturbances that are beyond the ability\nof monetary policy to control without policy\nresponses having adverse consequences for general\neconomic stability. If we examine total and core\nprice inflation over three years, say, most experience is that the averages are quite close. That is,\nfood and energy prices display substantial shortrun variability that yields large changes in the\nshort-run rate of inflation in overall price indices\nwithout affecting longer-run inflation. (See the\ncharts in Figure 1, which track the CPI and PCE\nindices from 1960 through 2005.)\n\nHOW MUCH DIFFERENCE\nWOULD A FORMAL INFLATION\nTARGET MAKE?\nThere is a large and growing literature comparing the performance of inflation-targeting\n7\n\n\fMONETARY POLICY AND INFLATION\n\ncountries with their non-inflation-targeting\ncounterparts, especially the United States. This\nliterature finds few statistically significant differences between countries that have established\ninflation targets and those that have not. This\nfinding has led some analysts to argue, “if it isn’t\nbroke, don’t fix it.” There are a number of reasons\nwhy such findings are not too surprising: The\nbenefits from price stability are diffuse and difficult to measure; the industrialized economies\nare highly interconnected, so that some of the\nbenefits to countries that have inflation targets\nspill over to those that do not; the growth rate\neffect is small, so it will take a long time before\none can distinguish a statistically significant\ngrowth-rate effect. Finally, many of the countries\nthat adopted an inflation target had a history of\ninflation. Adopting a target was a manifestation\nof a societal commitment to bring down and keep\ndown the rate of inflation.\nGiven that the United States pursued a successful anti-inflation policy after 1979 without a\nformal target, and established a high degree of\nmonetary credibility, there is no reason to expect\nto observe measurable effects from adopting a\ntarget now. Nevertheless, I cannot help reflecting\non other cases in which low inflation prevailed\nbut did not last. Consider U.S. policy errors of\nthe type that occurred in the mid-to-late 1920s\nand in Japan in the late 1980s. In both of these\ninstances, policymakers failed to respond to deflation. I believe that a formal inflation target would\nhave focused attention on the policy mistake\nleading to deflation and would have increased\npublic pressure on the central banks to respond\nmore forcefully.\nSimilarly, the Fed failed to tighten policy\nappropriately in the late 1960s as inflation began\nits ascent. In the early 1960s, as today, the Fed\nenjoyed a high degree of market confidence and\ninflation expectations were low. At that time,\nonly a small minority of economists thought that\nmonetary policy was “broken” in any important\nway, and thus the case for “fixing it” was minimal.\nWould a formal inflation target in 1960 have been\nan ironclad guarantee that the Great Inflation\n8\n\nwould never have happened? Surely not. Would it\nhave helped? I believe that the answer is surely yes.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nInflation targeting is an approach to monetary\npolicy adopted by many countries, in most cases\nin the context of a societal effort to address undesirably high inflation. The United States, fortunately, is not dealing with an inflation problem\nat this time. The case for adopting an inflation\ntarget is that it should help to avoid inflation in\nthe future and should increase the effectiveness\nof monetary policy in a low-inflation environment.\nThe increase in policy effectiveness should\narise from two consequences of a formal system\nof inflation targeting. The first consequence is that\nthe market will likely hold inflation expectations\nmore firmly. The second, and probably more\nimportant, consequence is that the inflationtargeting framework provides a vehicle, or structure, within which the FOMC can better explain\nits monetary policy actions and the policy risks\nit must face. Inflation targeting should increase\naccountability not so much by keeping score of\ntarget hits and misses but rather by encouraging\na much deeper understanding of how monetary\npolicy decisions are made. That understanding\ndepends on continuing FOMC communications\nwith the markets and the public and FOMC willingness to listen as well as talk.\n\nREFERENCES\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. “Reflections on\nMonetary Policy 25 Years After October 1978:\nProceedings of a Special Conference.” Federal\nReserve Bank of St. Louis Review, March/April\n2005, 87(2, Part 2).\nFriedman, Milton “The Role of Monetary Policy.”\nAmerican Economic Review, March 1968, 58(1),\npp. 1-17.\nFriedman, Milton. “The Optimum Quantity of\nMoney,” in The Optimum Quantity of Money and\n\n\fInflation Targeting\n\nOther Essays.
