        "content": "Market Bailouts and the “Fed Put”\nCato Institute\nWashington, D.C.\nNovember 30, 2007\n\nF\n\nederal Reserve policy actions starting\nthis past August to temper strains in\nfinancial markets have generated considerable commentary, some of which\nreflect concerns that policy action in such circumstances creates moral hazard. The issue is\nextremely important, and, given that it is so\ncurrent, this is a good time to reflect in general\non the Fed’s reactions to financial market developments. The concern over moral hazard is that\nmonetary policy action to alleviate financial\ndistress may complicate policy in the future, by\nencouraging risky investing in the securities markets. There are so few instances of market turmoil\nsimilar to the current situation that I’ll broaden\nthe analysis to include significant stock market\ndeclines. Doing so gives us a substantial sample\nto discuss. Thus, my topic is whether Federal\nReserve policy responses to financial market\ndevelopments should be regarded as “bailing out”\nmarket participants and creating moral hazard\nby doing so.\nTo begin to explore the moral hazard issue,\nconsider an extreme case, which I offer as a provocation to promote careful analysis and not as an\nexample directly relevant to today’s circumstances. Fact: The U.S. stock market between its\npeak in 1929 and its trough in 1932 declined by\n85 percent. Question 1: If the Fed had followed a\nmore expansionary policy in 1930-32, sufficient\nto avoid the Great Depression, would the stock\nmarket have declined so much? Question 2:\nAssuming that a more expansionary monetary\n1\n\npolicy would have supported the stock market to\nsome degree in 1930-32, would it be accurate to\nsay that the Fed had “bailed out” equity investors\nand created moral hazard by doing so? I note that\na more expansionary monetary policy in 1930-32\nwould, presumably, have supported not only the\nstock market but also the bond and mortgage\nmarkets and the banking system—by reducing\nthe number of defaults created by business and\nhousehold bankruptcies in subsequent years.\nNow apply these questions to the current situation. Did the Fed “bail out” the markets with\nits policy adjustments starting in August of this\nyear? Have we observed an example of what some\nobservers have come to call the “Fed put,” typically named after the chairman in office, such as\nthe “Greenspan put” or the “Bernanke put”?1\nWhy has no one, at least not recently to my knowledge, argued that a more expansionary Fed policy\nin 1930-32 would have “bailed out” the stock\nmarket at that time and, by implication, have\nbeen unwise?\nI can state my conclusion compactly: There\nis a sense in which a Fed put does exist. However,\nthose who believe that the Fed put reflects unwise\nmonetary policy misunderstand the responsibilities of a central bank. The basic argument is very\nsimple: A monetary policy that stabilizes the price\nlevel and the real economy cannot create moral\nhazard because there is no hazard, moral or otherwise. Nor does monetary policy action designed\nto prevent a financial upset from cascading into\nfinancial crisis create moral hazard. Finally, the\n\nA put option contract provides that the buyer of the contract can sell an item, such as 100 shares of common stock of a particular company,\nfor a certain price—the strike price—for a certain period. The contract protects the buyer from declines in the stock price beyond the strike\nprice. The “Fed put” terminology implies that Fed policy adjustments, by analogy with a put option, will prevent stock price declines beyond\nsome point.\n\n1\n\n\fMONETARY POLICY AND INFLATION\n\nnotion that the Fed responds to stock market\ndeclines per se, independent of the relationship\nof such declines to achievement of the Fed’s dual\nmandate in the Federal Reserve Act, is not supported by evidence from decades of monetary\nhistory.\nBefore proceeding, I want to emphasize that\nthe views I express here are mine and do not\nnecessarily reflect official positions of the Federal\nReserve System. I appreciate comments and\nresearch assistance provided by my colleagues at\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. However,\nI retain full responsibility for errors.\nMy approach will be to start by discussing\nbailouts and moral hazard in general. I will then\nexamine the record of stock market declines and\nFed policy adjustments and analyze how monetary policy changes the nature of risks in financial\nand goods markets. Finally, I will argue that the\nways in which monetary policy alters risks in\nthe markets yield benefits for the economy and\ndo not create moral hazard.\n\nUNDERSTANDING BAILOUTS\nA traditional bailout involves governmental\nassistance to a particular firm, group of firms, or\ngroup of individuals. For ease of exposition, I’ll\nconcentrate on bailouts of firms but the same\nissues apply to bailouts of households. There\nmay be occasions when a government infusion\nof capital to save a firm is justified, such as a\nbailout of a major defense contractor during\nwartime. However, most economists believe that\nbailouts are rarely justified and only in compelling\ncircumstances should the government bail out\nindividuals or firms.2\nAn important reason for opposition to bailouts\nis that it is essentially impossible for a bailout not\nto set a precedent for the future. A bailout creates\nwhat is known in the economics and insurance\nliterature as (aforementioned) “moral hazard” by\n2\n\n2\n\ncreating a presumption that in the future the\ngovernment may again rescue a failing firm. That\npresumption encourages a firm and its investors\nto be less careful than they otherwise would be\nabout taking risks. If a firm expects a bailout, it\nbelieves that government help will cover losses\nwhile the firm’s owners can enjoy the gains, if any,\nfrom risky strategies. When the government is\nexpected to absorb losses, bailouts unavoidably\nincrease inappropriate risk taking, which increases\nthe likelihood of losses in the future.\nA standard problem in writing and administering insurance contracts is that the buyer of\ninsurance has less incentive, by virtue of being\ninsured, to control risk. Almost everyone has had\nthe experience, far from uplifting, of talking with\nsomeone who says, “don’t worry—it’s insured.”\nThe very existence of insurance may change the\nbehavior of the insured person. Insurance companies try to deal with moral hazard in a variety\nof ways, such as by writing contracts with substantial deductibles or loss sharing. Such contract\nprovisions provide an incentive for the insured\nto control risk.\nGovernment guarantee programs also generally require some loss sharing, but there are many\ngovernment programs and practices that do not\nadequately control moral hazard. Perhaps the\nmost dangerous practice is the ex post bailout,\nwhere a firm is rescued outside of any regular or\nstanding program. Such a bailout can change the\nrules of the competitive game in unpredictable\nways. No one can know whether a bailout will\nbe repeated or not. Those who control risks and\nactually bear losses will justifiably believe that a\ntaxpayer-funded bailout of another firm is unfair.\nThe Federal Reserve has no funds and no\nauthority to provide capital or guarantees to firms\nto provide a bailout in the traditional sense. The\nFed cannot even bail out banks. The Fed can\nmake loans to banks, but only loans that are fully\nsecured by good collateral and only to banks that\n\nOf course, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is obligated to protect depositors from loss on covered deposits and it is sometimes true that the cheapest way to handle a failed bank is to merge it with another bank, with the FDIC providing a capital infusion. To the\nextent that there is a safety net for uninsured depositors, a bank bailout does raise moral hazard issues. I do not mean to imply that “too big\nto fail” is not an important issue for federal policy.\n\n\fMarket Bailouts and the “Fed Put”\n\nare well capitalized. The Fed can lend to weak\nbanks requiring emergency assistance to prevent\nimmediate collapse, but again only to those with\nadequate collateral. The Fed works cooperatively\nwith the FDIC and other bank regulators to close\na bank in distress or to find a willing buyer.\nCreditors sometimes bail out debtors to a\ndegree, by restructuring obligations to extend the\nrepayment period or to reduce the interest rate.\nRestructuring a mortgage is often in the interest\nof the borrower, who may be able to avoid foreclosure. Restructuring may make sense for the\nlender to avoid the costs of bankruptcy and to\nobtain the maximum possible return from a failing\nloan. Nevertheless, lenders obviously must be\ncareful not to make terms too easy for a borrower\nlest other borrowers ask for similar terms or future\nborrowers fail to service their obligations. A bailout of this sort is fundamentally different from a\ngovernment bailout because the lender suffers\nthe loss and not the taxpayer. Losses motivate\nlenders to be more disciplined in their future\ndecisions.\nWhy do we use the term “moral hazard”?\nUsing the insurance example, the hazard to the\ninsurance company arises from behavior induced\nby insurance that may be adverse to the interests\nof the insurer. The “moral” in “moral hazard”\nrefers to behavior the insured knows is adverse\nto the insurer’s interest—behavior the insured\nwould not engage in were he to suffer the full\nconsequences of the behavior. Insurance companies try to maintain practices designed to encourage appropriate behavior. If an insurance company\nprovides a premium discount for a driver who\nsubmits no insurance claims over a certain num-\n\nber of years and the discount in fact encourages\nsafer driving, then that effect is not “moral hazard.” From the perspective of the insurer, the\npolicy changes behavior in a desirable rather than\na harmful way. This point is a critical one in the\ncontext of monetary policy, to which I now turn.\n\nTHE FED PUT\nThe “Fed put” argument is usually stated in\nterms of monetary policy reactions to stock market declines. Consider Figure 1, which plots the\nnatural log of the S&P 500 index and identifies\nall stock market declines of 10 percent or more\nsince 1950.3 The figure also shows a measure of\nthe Federal Reserve’s policy rate.4 The policy rate\nin the figure is the discount rate before October 1,\n1982, and the federal funds target rate thereafter.\nShaded areas show recessions as defined by the\nNational Bureau of Economic Research.\nThe figure shows 21 stock market declines of\n10 percent or more. Within three months of these\nstock market peaks, the Fed held the policy rate\nconstant, or increased it, on 12 occasions. There\nwas a Fed rate cut within three months on nine\noccasions,5 but for five of these nine rate cuts the\nFed acted before the stock market peak; its policy\nactions could not have been motivated by stock\nmarket declines. Fed rate cuts did follow the\nstock market peak in late September 1976; the\nfirst rate cut came nine weeks later.6 Another case\noccurred after the market peak in July 1998; a\nFed rate cut in late September was a response to\nthe situation in the money markets following the\nnear collapse of Long-Term Capital Management\n\n3\n\nThe S&P 500 series is the weekly close (Friday close unless Friday is a holiday). Each market peak was defined this way: Under criterion 1,\nthe peak exceeded the previous peak and the market declined by 10 percent or more following the peak. Under criterion 2, the peak, followed\nby a decline of at least 10 percent, did not exceed the previous peak but a recovery of at least 10 percent had occurred between the two peaks.\n\n4\n\nThe policy rate in the figure is the Fed’s discount rate before October 1982 and the FOMC’s federal funds target rate thereafter. Other measures are available for certain parts of the period before 1982, but using them would create several discontinuities in the policy rate series.\nSee Rudebusch (1995, Table 3a) for a federal funds target rate series for 1974-79.\n\n5\n\nOne of the nine was the market peak in November 1968. As the figure makes clear, the rate cut preceding this market peak was small and\ntemporary. Subsequently, the Fed raised rates and the cuts did not begin until the end of the 1969-70 recession, at which point stock prices\nstarted to rise.\n\n6\n\nRudebusch (1995, Table 3a) identifies two cuts totaling 25 basis points in the FOMC’s target federal funds rate in July 1976 and two more\ntotaling another 25 basis points in October. By this measure, therefore, Fed rate cuts began before the September 1976 stock market peak.\n\n3\n\n\fMONETARY POLICY AND INFLATION\n\nFigure 1\nDeclines Greater Than 10 Percent in the S&P 500 and Fed Policy Rate\nLN (S&P 500)\n\nFed Policy Rate\n16\n\n8\n\n14\n7\n12\n6\n10\nLN (S&P 500)\n(left axis)\n\n5\n\n8\n6\n\n4\n4\n3\n\nPolicy Rate\n(right axis)\n\n2\n0\nJan-06\n\nJan-04\n\nJan-02\n\nJan-00\n\nJan-98\n\nJan-96\n\nJan-94\n\nJan-92\n\nJan-90\n\nJan-88\n\nJan-86\n\nJan-84\n\nJan-82\n\nJan-80\n\nJan-78\n\nJan-76\n\nJan-74\n\nJan-72\n\nJan-70\n\nJan-68\n\nJan-66\n\nJan-64\n\nJan-62\n\nJan-60\n\nJan-58\n\nJan-56\n\nJan-54\n\nJan-52\n\nJan-50\n\n2\n\nR\n\n(LTCM) and not a response to the stock market\nper se.7\nThe market peak in March 2000 ushered in\nthe great bear market that ended in October 2002.\nThe initial decline was sharp, but the market\nrecovered to reach another peak in early\nSeptember 2000 that was only slightly lower than\nthe March 2000 peak. During the course of the\nbear market, there were several peaks, each\nlower than the one preceding, following significant recoveries. During this period, the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC) cut the policy\nrate in 10 steps from 6.5 percent to 1.75 percent\nin December 2001 and in two more steps to 1\npercent in June 2003. The policy rate cuts were\nnot closely related to the stock market declines\nafter the local peaks and declines that continued\nuntil the market hit bottom in October 2002.\n7\n\n4\n\nBecause the “put” language became current\nduring the Greenspan era, let’s examine stock\nmarket declines of 5 percent or more that did not\nreach the 10 percent threshold. Using the 5 percent\ncriterion, there was a market peak in September\n1989, and the Fed did cut its policy rate following that peak. However, the Fed had started to cut\nrates in June 1989. Another market peak meeting\nthe 5 percent criterion occurred in late January\n1994, when the policy rate was 3 percent. There\nwas another such peak in August 1994. The Fed\nproceeded to raise the policy rate several times\nin 1994, starting in February, and it reached 6\npercent in January 1995.\nAnother market peak meeting the 5 percent\ncriterion occurred in June 1996. The FOMC had\ncut the policy rate to 5.25 percent in January 1996,\nand the policy rate remained there until the FOMC\n\nThe transcripts of FOMC meetings in 1998 provide excellent insight into the Committee’s motivation in dealing with the LTCM situation. Of\ncourse, motivation is not the end of the matter; well-intentioned actions can have unintended adverse effects. The 1998 and 1999 transcripts\nshow that the Committee was well aware of the potential for inflationary consequences of policy easing in response to the LTCM situation.\nTranscripts are available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/transcripts/.\n\n\fMarket Bailouts and the “Fed Put”\n\nraised it in March 1997. This increase occurred\nshortly after another stock market peak meeting\nthe 5 percent criterion earlier the same month.\nTwo more peaks meeting the 5 percent criterion—\none in August 1997 and one in December 1997—\noccurred while the FOMC was holding the policy\nrate constant at 5.5 percent.\nThis history makes clear that it just is not true\nthat the FOMC has eased policy in systematic\nfashion at the time of stock market declines, with\nthe exception of the period following the 1987\nstock market crash. Even this experience, however,\nreinforces the argument that the FOMC’s primary\nconcern is with its macroeconomic objectives and\nnot with the stock market itself. Policy easing\noccurs at times of recession, although sometimes\nis delayed because of concern over inflation. The\nFed eased policy ahead of the 1990-91 recession\nand ahead of the 2001 recession. The Fed has also\neased policy in response to turmoil in the credit\nmarkets, as in the fall of 1998 and starting in\nAugust of 2007. Clearly, though, on numerous\noccasions the Fed has held its policy rate constant, or raised it, as stock prices declined.\n\nEFFECTS OF FED STABILIZATION\nPOLICY ON FINANCIAL MARKETS\nAlthough there is no evidence that the Fed\nresponds to the stock market per se, there is an\nelement of truth to the argument that Fed policy\ncan limit downside risk in the stock market. The\nsame Fed policy that succeeds in stabilizing the\nprice level and the real economy should tend to\nstabilize financial markets as well. Thus, the element of truth in the “Fed put” view reflects\nexpected and desirable outcomes from successful\nmonetary policy. General economic stability, by\nwhich I mean both stability of the price level and\nof the real economy, does change the nature of\nrisks in the financial markets and, therefore,\nchanges investor strategies.\nConsider the second of Graham and Dodd’s\n“Four Principles for the Selection of Issues of\nthe Fixed-Income Type”:\n\nThe rule that a sound investment must be able\nto withstand adversity seems self-evident\nenough to be termed a truism. Any bond or\npreferred stock can do well when conditions\nare favorable; it is only under the acid test of\ndepression that the advantages of strong over\nweak issues become manifest and vitally\nimportant. For this reason prudent investors\nhave always favored the obligations of oldestablished enterprises which have demonstrated their ability to come through bad times\nas well as good.” (Graham and Dodd, 1951,\np. 289)\n\nWith regard to inflation risk, Graham and\nDodd say that “[t]hese wide movements of the\ngeneral price level…seem to carry the lesson that\nthe long-term trend is toward inflation, punctuated by equally troublesome periods of deflation.\nInvestment policy must accommodate itself, as\nfar as it can, to both possibilities” (Graham and\nDodd, 1951, p. 8).\nHow many investors today measure the value\nof a bond by the likelihood that it will continue\nto pay interest “under the acid test of depression”?\nHow many investors today maintain portfolios\nrobust against the possibility of inflation of the\nmagnitude experienced in the 1970s or deflation\nof the magnitude experienced in the early 1930s?\nThe answer, I believe, is “not many.”\nThe fact that few investors worry about\nextreme economic instability is a benefit of\nsound monetary policy and not a cost; changes\nin investor practice are conducive to higher productivity growth. The same is true for changes in\nhousehold and firm behavior reflecting the greatly\nreduced risk of economic depression or even\nsevere recession of the magnitude of 1981-82. If\nwe did not believe that economic stability is good\nfor the economy and for society, why would a\nstable price level and high employment be monetary policy goals? Just as a deductible changes\nbehavior of insurance policyholders, so also does\neconomic stability change investor behavior.\nEconomists have long argued that price stability improves economic efficiency, in part because\nbusinesses and individuals can make decisions\nunder the assumption that they do not need to\n5\n\n\fMONETARY POLICY AND INFLATION\n\npursue strategies designed to cope with a changing price level. Inflation and deflation distort\nrelative prices; such distortion leads to misallocations of resources. With greatly reduced risk of\nprice level instability, investors concentrate on\nrisks relating to changes in demands, technology,\nand relative prices. Better evaluation of these\nrisks promotes more efficient allocation of capital\nand fosters higher economic growth.\nMonetary policy success in stabilizing the\ngeneral level of prices does not eliminate risks\nfor the economy. The real effects of inflation or\ndeflation, should either occur in the future, will\nbe magnified precisely because the economy\ntoday has adjusted relatively completely to an\nenvironment of price stability. One of the reasons\nthe Great Inflation was so costly was that economic agents in 1965 did not anticipate the inflation. Decisions and institutions that had been\nsensible and efficient in an environment of price\nstability became unprofitable as inflation rose\nafter 1965.\nWhen events threaten to create inflation or\ndeflation, the Fed ought to act to maintain price\nstability. It is true that Fed actions in such circumstances “bail out” investors who would lose large\nsums should inflation or deflation take hold. But\n“bail out” is a completely inappropriate term to\nuse in this context, for it implies costs of the sort\ndiscussed earlier when the government provides\ncapital to support firms that would otherwise go\nbankrupt. The central bank is supposed to stabilize the price level; the economy is better off when\npeople act on a justified belief that the central\nbank will be successful.\nExactly the same argument applies to central\nbank actions in response to events or shocks that\nmight drive the economy into recession, or into\nan unsustainable boom. Provided that the central\nbank does not sacrifice long-run price stability, it\ncan and should respond to new information\nindicating an increased risk of recession. There\nis no conflict between the goals of price stability\nand high employment. Price stability and expectations of price stability permit the central bank\nto respond constructively to shocks that threaten\n6\n\nto destabilize the real economy. Those who still\nbelieve that there is a trade-off between inflation\nand unemployment should reflect on the facts\nthat the Great Depression was a consequence of\ndeflation and the recessions of 1969, 1973-75,\n1980, and 1981-82 were consequences of the\nGreat Inflation.\nWith respect to financial instability, the central bank has the responsibility to do what it can\nto alleviate market turmoil. When there is a widespread increase in risk aversion and a flight to\nsafe assets, the central bank ought to provide\nextra liquidity to prevent bank runs from bringing\ndown the banking system. Provision of extra\ncentral bank liquidity does “bail out” firms that\nhad not maintained sufficient liquidity themselves. Here again, though, the term “bail out,”\nwith its pejorative connotations, is completely\ninappropriate. In a fractional reserve banking\nsystem, it is simply impossible for owners of\nbank liabilities to convert all their liquid claims\nto cash, but the effort to do so will drive down\naggregate demand. The same argument applies\nto liquid claims issued by non-bank financial\nfirms. Widespread bank failures will destroy the\nclaims of prudent investors, as well as of the\nimprudent.\nFor a fractional reserve banking system to\nwork, a central bank must stand ready to be the\nultimate source of liquidity for solvent banks, and\nbanks in turn take the credit risk of providing\nliquidity to solvent non-bank firms. By “solvent,”\nwhat I mean in this context is that a firm’s assets\nvalued at a normal level of economic activity\ncover the firm’s liabilities, leaving a reasonable\nlevel of net worth. The firm’s capital can absorb\nlosses occasioned by normal business risks. We\ncan argue about what “normal business risks”\nshould be covered; but, in my view, economic\ndepression, hyperinflation, and financial implosion are not included.\nThe stock market responds to changing expectations concerning corporate profits, which\ndepend in part on the state of the real economy.\nSlow economic growth or outright recession tends\nto reduce profits and the level of stock prices. It\n\n\fMarket Bailouts and the “Fed Put”\n\nis desirable that investors’ expectations of profits\nreflect knowledge that the central bank will\nrespond constructively to new information about\nthe likely course of the real economy. And I use\nthe word “knowledge” deliberately and not just\nthe word “expectation” to emphasize the importance of a high degree of market confidence in the\ncentral bank. When there is a high degree of confidence in the central bank, everyone should\nbelieve that the central bank will respond to\nevents that might otherwise drive the economy\ninto recession. In this sense, a “Fed put” should\nexist. A central bank is supposed to do what it\ncan to maintain employment at a high level.\nOf course, at the current state of knowledge,\nthe central bank cannot prevent all recessions.\nA central bank may be unable to prevent some\nrecessions because it has incomplete knowledge\nof how businesses, households, and markets\nbehave. In other cases, a central bank has no way\nof forecasting certain events that may drive the\neconomy into recession.\nA central bank can do its best to respond\nappropriately to events like the stock market\ncrash of 1987 and the terrorist attacks of 9/11.\nWhen such a shock occurs, market participants\nmay be unsure about the appropriate response,\nand the central bank may also be unsure. Nevertheless, market participants have good reason to\nbelieve that the central bank will respond as the\nappropriate response becomes clear. Confidence\nin the central bank in this sense helps to stabilize\nmarkets.\nI have emphasized the importance of Fed\nstabilization policy for the financial markets. The\nsame arguments hold with equal force for markets\nfor goods and for productive inputs. Decisions\non the allocations of capital and labor are more\nefficient in an environment of general economic\nstability. Long-lived capital projects require confidence in monetary stability. Of course, other\naspects of government policy are equally important, such as the rule of law and the tax and regulatory environments.\n8\n\nDOES FED POLICY SUCCESS\nBREED FINANCIAL MARKET\nINSTABILITY?\nSome have argued, Hyman Minsky most\nprominently,8 that monetary policy success\nbreeds greater financial instability by encouraging investors to assume more risk, especially\nthrough greater leverage. Perhaps this contention\nis at the heart of the argument that recent Fed\npolicy actions in response to the subprime mortgage mess will only increase financial risks in\nthe future.\nIt is hard to figure out how to test the Minsky\nproposition, but my instinct is that it is not correct. As vexing as the current market situation is,\nit is important to remember that in the early 1980s\nthe unwinding of the Great Inflation led to failure\nof many industrial firms, farmers, banks, and\neventually a large part of the savings and loan\nindustry. The financial turmoil of 1998 seems\nmild by comparison with the early 1980s; of\ncourse, we do not yet know the full extent of the\ncurrent turmoil in housing and housing finance.\nIf an empirical test would be inconclusive,\nwhich I think it probably would be, our only\nrecourse is to argue from a somewhat abstract\nperspective. We do have good reason to believe,\nboth from theory and experience, that price level\ninstability increases financial instability. Large\nchanges in the inflation rate, up or down, are\nalways unanticipated. Thus, inflation creates\nunanticipated changes in the real value of bonds\nand other contracts stated in nominal terms. The\ngains and losses tend to be capricious, and losses\ncan be large enough to bankrupt those on the\nwrong side of the unanticipated change in inflation. The same problem arises when economic\nactivity changes in an unanticipated fashion—\nbankruptcies rise during recessions.\nWhen the price level is reasonably stable\nand economic activity is growing reasonably\nsmoothly, macroeconomic risks are reduced.\n\nA convenient bibliography of Minsky’s work and of work about his ideas can be found at http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/profiles/minsky.htm.\n\n7\n\n\fMONETARY POLICY AND INFLATION\n\nHowever, microeconomic risks do not disappear.\nThe hedge fund is a good example of a firm\ndesigned to exploit microeconomic risks. The\nbasic idea of the hedge fund is to take positions\nbased on relative calculations of various sorts. In\na particular industry, a hedge fund might take a\nlong position in what it believes to be stronger\nfirms and a short position in weaker firms. Concentration on microeconomic issues is exactly\nwhat is supposed to happen with reduction of\nmacroeconomic risks. High leverage does increase\nrisk, but does so in the context of both macroeconomic and microeconomic uncertainty.\nSince the end of the Great Inflation, most\nbouts of financial instability have been associated\nwith innovation and not with excesses created\nby economic stability. Innovations of all sorts\nencourage experimentation; some of the experiments turn out badly until engineering and management practices adapt to the innovations. As\nthe use of steam engines spread in many different\napplications in the nineteenth century, boiler\nexplosions were common. Railroad bridges fell\ndown. The new technology of the Internet led\nto the dot-com bubble. We have seen the same\nprocess with financial innovation—portfolio\ninsurance failed in the stock market crash of\n1987 and highly mathematical trading strategies\nfailed LTCM. Certain underwriting and securitization strategies for subprime mortgages are in\nthe process of failing today, at enormous cost not\nonly to investors but also to homeowners facing\nforeclosure. I do not believe that the failure of\nany of these financial innovations was related to\nthe more stable price level and more stable economy of the past quarter century compared with\nthe previous quarter century.\nSome financial strategies will go the way of\nthe steam automobile; others will be refined and\nbecome as common and routinely successful as\nthe personal computer. Who today does not\naccept the basic idea of portfolio analysis, in\nwhich individual securities are not studied in\nisolation but in the context of their covariances\nwith other securities?\n8\n\nCONCLUDING COMMENTS\nIn the Employment Act of 1946, Congress\ncharged the Fed with promoting “maximum\nemployment, production, and purchasing power.”\nNot that long before the Employment Act a different view prevailed. David Cannadine, in his\nMellon: An American Life, wrote recently about\nAndrew Mellon’s attitudes during the early part\nof the Great Depression:\nMellon constantly lectured the president on\nthe importance of letting things be. The secretary belonged (as Hoover would recall) to the\n“leave it alone, liquidationist school,” and his\nformula was “liquidate labor, liquidate stocks,\nliquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate.”\n(Cannadine, 2006, p. 445)\n\nThat view is long gone. Macroeconomists\ntoday do not believe that policies to stabilize the\nprice level and aggregate economic activity create\na hazard. Federal Reserve policy that yields\ngreater stability has not and will not protect from\nloss those who invest in failed strategies, financial or otherwise. Investors and entrepreneurs\nhave as much incentive as they ever had to manage risk appropriately. What they do not have to\ndeal with is macroeconomic risk of the magnitude\nexperienced all too often in the past.\nIn the present situation, many investors in\nsubprime paper will take heavy losses and there\nis no monetary policy that could avoid those\nlosses. Clearly, recent Fed policy actions have\nnot protected investors in subprime paper. The\npolicy objective is not to prevent losses but to\nrestore normal market processes. The issue is not\nwhether subprime paper will trade at 70 cents\non the dollar, or 30 cents, but that the paper in\nfact can trade at some market price determined\nby usual market processes. Since August, such\npaper has traded hardly at all. An active financial\nmarket is central to the process of economic\ngrowth, and it is that growth, not prices in financial markets per se, that the Fed cares about.\nOne of the most reliable and predictable features of the Fed’s monetary policy is action to\nprevent systemic financial collapse. If this regularity of policy is what is meant by the “Fed put,”\n\n\fMarket Bailouts and the “Fed Put”\n\nthen so be it, but the term seems to me to be\nextremely misleading. The Fed does not have\nthe desire or tools to prevent widespread losses\nin a particular sector but should not sit by while\na financial upset becomes a financial calamity\naffecting the entire economy. Whether further cuts\nin the federal funds rate target will alleviate\nfinancial turmoil, or risk adding to it, is always\nan appropriate topic for the FOMC to discuss.\nBut one thing should be clear: The Fed does not\nhave the power to keep the stock market at the\n“proper” level, both because what is proper is\nnever clear and because the Fed does not have\npolicy instruments it can adjust to have predictable effects on stock prices.\nFrom time to time, to be sure, Fed action to\nstabilize the economy—to cushion recession or\ndeal with a systemic financial crisis—will have\nthe effect of pushing up stock prices. That effect\nis part of the transmission mechanism through\nwhich monetary policy affects the economy.\nHowever, it is a fundamental misreading of monetary policy to believe that the stock market per\nse is an objective of policy. It is also a mistake to\nbelieve that a policy action that is desirable to\nhelp stabilize the economy should not be taken\nbecause it will also tend to increase stock prices.\nIt makes no sense to let the economy suffer from\ncontinuing declines in stock prices for the purpose\nof “teaching stock market speculators a lesson.”\n“Teaching a lesson” is eerily reminiscent of\nMellon’s liquidationist view. Nor should the central bank attempt to protect investors from their\nunwise decisions. Doing so would only divert\npolicy from its central responsibility to maintain\nprice stability and high employment.\nThe Fed would create moral hazard if it were\nto attempt to pump up the stock market whenever\nit fell, regardless of whether or not such policy\nactions served the fundamental objectives of\n\nmonetary policy. I have observed no evidence to\nsuggest that the Fed has pursued such a course.\nThat financial markets are more stable because\nmarket participants expect the Fed to be successful in achieving its policy objectives is a desirable\nand expected outcome of good monetary policy.\nThere is no moral hazard when largely predictable\npolicy responses to new information have effects\non financial markets.\nThat the monetary policy principles I have\ndiscussed here are unclear to many in the financial markets is unfortunate. Macroeconomic stabilization does not raise moral hazard issues\nbecause a stable economy provides no guarantee\nthat individual firms and households will be\nprotected from failure. Improved public understanding of this point will not only help the Fed\nto do its job more effectively but also will help\nprivate sector firms to understand better how to\nmanage risk.\n\nREFERENCES\nCannadine, David.

        "content": "Market Healing\nMarquette University\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin\nNovember 7, 2007\n\nA\n\nnyone who has followed the news at\nall since early August is well aware\nof disorder in financial markets. This\nepisode is not yet complete. The\nfinancial turmoil of 2007 will join previous\nmarket upsets analyzed with such great insight\nby the economic historian, Charles Kindleberger.\nHis book, Manias, Panics, and Crashes, is an\nindispensable resource describing such episodes\nover the past several hundred years.\nAlthough we know a lot about market upsets,\nrelatively little work has been done on recoveries\nfrom them. This topic is clearly an important one\ntoday—the current episode of market turmoil is\nnot yet completed and therefore is not yet just a\nmatter for economic historians. Policymakers are\nwatching closely and considering what additional\npolicy measures, if any, would assist the market\nhealing process.\nWhen arriving information triggers a financial\nmarket trauma, we know that the trauma reflects,\ntypically, a flight to quality as investors react to\nnew information suggesting that certain assets\nmay be worth less than previously thought.\nMarket turmoil subsides over time as stabilizing\nmarket forces take hold, typically as investors\nsearch for bargains among assets with depressed\nprices. Policy responses can assist the healing\nprocess, but it is important that policy actions\nharness market forces and not further disrupt\nthem. Over the longer run, lessons from market\nturmoil may suggest reforms to laws and regulations to reduce the probability of recurrence.\nI will discuss the recent troubles in the subprime mortgage market and evidence of market\n1\n\nhealing. My discussion of the subprime mortgage\nmarket will be brief as that topic was the subject\nof a speech of mine this past July.1 The history of\nmarket upsets is valuable in understanding the\ncurrent situation; I’ll discuss two such situations—\nthe 1987 stock market crash and the one initiated\nby the 1998 Russian default—to illustrate issues\nimportant to understanding the current market\nupset. I’ll finish by offering some thoughts on\nhow the healing process works and the role of\nthe central bank.\nBefore proceeding, I want to emphasize that\nthe views I express here are mine and do not\nnecessarily reflect official positions of the Federal\nReserve System. I thank my colleagues at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for their comments, especially Daniel L. Thornton, vice president in the Research Division, who provided\nspecial assistance. However, I retain full responsibility for errors.\n\nTHE FINANCIAL TURMOIL OF\n2007\nBy 2006 a variety of indicators were suggesting that the housing boom was subsiding. It was\nnot yet clear, however, that the boom was a bubble that would be bursting. Sales of new singlefamily homes—which had increased rapidly\nduring the previous five years—began to decline\nfollowing the sales peak in July 2005, and the\ndecline continued throughout 2006. By the end\nof 2006, housing starts had dropped to a threeyear low. Perhaps more ominously, during 2006\n\nSee Poole (2007) for a much more complete discussion of the subprime mortgage market.\n\n1\n\n\fFINANCIAL MARKETS\n\nthe mortgage foreclosure rate began to increase,\ngoing above 0.5 percent for the first time in the\nnearly 35-year history of the series. Contributing\nto the problem, residential property values began\nto decline in many regions of the United States\nand, according to the most recently available\ndata, the decline is continuing. According to the\nCase-Shiller 10-city home price index, the first\nmonth showing a 12-month decline was January\n2007, and that was the first such decline in more\nthan a decade.2\nBy early 2007, evidence of difficulties in the\nsubprime mortgage market began to emerge.\nBetween December 2006 and August 2007 scores\nof mortgage companies ceased operations, either\nthrough bankruptcy or suspension of current\nactivity. Other mortgage companies reported\nlarge losses and suspended their subprime mortgage lending. In June 2007, Bear Stearns pledged\nup to $3.2 billion to bail out a hedge fund that\nmade bad bets in the subprime mortgage market.\nA month later, Bear Stearns announced that two\nof its hedge funds that invested heavily in securities backed by subprime mortgages had lost over\n90 percent of their value. Both funds declared\nbankruptcy on August 1.\nAccording to a Treasury department annual\nsurvey, which was released in March 2007, on\nJune 30, 2006, foreigners held nearly $1 trillion\nin asset-backed securities. Precise data are unavailable, but a rough guess is that as of mid-2006 foreign holdings of securities backed by subprime\nmortgages were $100 to 150 billion. Consequently,\nproblems in the U.S. subprime mortgage market\nspread financial disorder worldwide. On July 30,\nthe European Central Bank (ECB) announced\nthat it was providing liquidity support for IKB\nDeutsche Industriebank, a large German bank,\nwhich had made substantial investments in U.S.\nmortgage-backed securities.\nDespite all the bad news, broad financial\nmarkets were initially little affected. Although\nthe volume of trading in asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) peaked in late June and began\n2\n\n2\n\nto decline, rates on such paper had increased\nonly a few basis points before August 9. But on\nAugust 9, American International Group—one of\nthe largest mortgage lenders in the United States—\nannounced that mortgage defaults were spreading\nbeyond the subprime market. This news added\nto concerns stemming from a July 24 announcement by Countrywide Financial Corporation—\nthe largest U.S. originator of mortgages in 2006—\nthat subprime mortgage problems had spread to its\nportfolio of prime mortgages. Between August 8\nand September 13 the rate on ABCP increased by\n84 basis points. While ABCP rates had declined\nto early August levels by late September, the volume of outstanding ABCP continued to decline.\nA short digression is in order at this point.\nCommercial paper is a short-term corporate IOU.\nThere are three main types of commercial paper—\nissues by non-financial firms, issues by financial\nfirms such as auto-finance companies and assetbacked paper. The assets backing ABCP may be\nsubprime mortgages, credit card receivables, auto\nloans or other similar assets. The maturity of\ncommercial paper ranges from one to 120 days.\nIn 2006, for example, 90 percent of the outstanding\npaper had maturities of 40 days or less and only\n5 percent had maturities of 81 days or more. At\nthe end of 2006, paper issued by non-financial\nfirms was 9.3 percent of the total, by financial\nfirms 37.9 percent of the total, and ABCP was\n53.8 percent of the total.\nThe market turmoil began as investors started\nto flee ABCP. It is normal practice for investors\nin commercial paper to roll over their investment\nin whole or in part, depending on their own need\nfor funds, but in August investors who might\nhave routinely rolled over their investment in\nABCP began asking for redemption as the paper\nmatured. Moreover, investors tended to flee all\ntypes of commercial paper and not just paper\nbacked by subprime mortgages. Their unwillingness to roll over maturing paper put tremendous\npressure on issuers to find funds to redeem maturing issues. Many issuers turned to commercial\n\nThe Case-Shiller 20-city index is also declining but that series goes back only to 2000.\n\n\fMarket Healing\n\nbanks, drawing on backup lines of credit. Investors\nhad to do something with the funds on maturing\nCP, and they tended to buy short-term Treasury\nsecurities. Thus, the flight to quality drove up\nthe rates on CP and drove down the rates on\nTreasury issues.\nTwo figures can help to display the scale of\nthe market disruption. Figure 1 shows the federal\nfunds rate and the Treasury bill rate. Vertical lines\nmark some of the key events. The extent of credit\nmarket volatility is evident. Figure 2 shows what\nhappened to the volume of commercial paper\noutstanding. The scale of the contraction is obvious, as commercial-paper issuers had to redeem\nscores of billions of dollars worth.\nOn August 9, both the European Central Bank\nand the Federal Reserve injected large amounts of\nliquidity into the financial market. On August 9,\nthe ECB injected €95 billion and the Fed injected\n$24 billion; subsequently, the two central banks\nengaged in further large injections of funds.\nThe Fed’s injections of funds were designed\nto keep the federal funds rate near the target rate\nset by the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC), the Fed’s main monetary policy body.\nHowever, given the volatile market situation, the\nOpen Market Desk tended, appropriately, to provide funds generously. The funds rate traded high\nrelative to the FOMC’s target of 5.25 percent on\nthe 9th but declined sharply on the 10th.\nAnother indicator of market turmoil was the\nrate on short-term Treasury bills. These rates\ndeclined in the flight to quality. The 1-month Tbill rate declined by 44 basis points on August 15\nand by another 105 basis points on August 16.\nOn August 17, the Fed announced a 50-basispoint cut in the discount rate.\nMarket turmoil originated in the market for\nsecurities backed by subprime mortgages but then\nspread to five important market segments beyond\nthe asset-backed securities market. The first was\nthe commercial-paper market more generally.\nThe volume of ABCP outstanding—much of\nwhich was mortgage backed—peaked in the week\nending August 8. By mid-October, the outstanding\nvolume had declined by $281 billion, or nearly\n25 percent.\n\nThe impact on financial and non-financial\ncommercial paper was less severe but significant.\nThe volume of non-financial commercial paper\noutstanding declined by nearly 15 percent, while\nthe volume of financial paper declined by about\n5 percent from early August to mid-October.\nDespite the impact on the volumes of non-financial and financial commercial paper outstanding,\nthe impact on the rates of these securities was\nrelatively modest. Rates on both types of CP\nremained near their pre-August 9 level until early\nSeptember and then began drifting lower. These\nrates declined by about 25 basis points following\nthe FOMC’s 50-basis-point cut in the federal funds\nrate target on September 18.\nAnother indication of market turmoil was\nthat rates on certificates of deposit (CDs) and\nEurodollar deposits rose sharply on August 9 on\nnews that the subprime problems were spreading\nto the broader mortgage market. CD and Eurodollar rates rose because both of these assets are\nused by banks and other depository institutions\nto support their loan portfolios. Banks’ need for\nliquidity drove these rates higher. Both rates\ndeclined when the FOMC reduced its target for\nthe federal funds rate on September 18, but the\nspread of these rates over the funds rate target\ndid not return to its pre-crisis level.\nThe financial turmoil spilled over to rates on\nbank deposits in foreign countries. That spread\noccurred partly because of the close relationship\nbetween CD and Eurodollar deposit rates and similar assets in other countries and partly because\nmany international investors held securities\nbacked by U.S. subprime paper. Deposit rates in\nCanada, the United Kingdom and the Euro area\nwere affected similarly to the CD and Eurodollar\nrates in the United States. Danish and Japanese\nrates changed little on average, but became much\nmore volatile.\nThe flight to quality had a dramatic effect on\nrates in the U.S. Treasuries market. T-bill rates\ndeclined relative to rates on assets with default\nrisk. The flight to quality is most evident at the\nshorter end of the yield curve. The flight to quality at the longer-end of the yield curve occurred\nearlier. The spread between corporate AAA bonds\n3\n\n\fFINANCIAL MARKETS\n\nFigure 1\nFigures\n\nSubprime Crisis: Funds Rate and Funds Rate Target\n\nFigure 2\nTotal Outstanding Commercial Paper (s.a.)\n\n4\n\n\fMarket Healing\n\nand BBB bonds over the 10-year Treasury yield\nwidened significantly in mid-July. The AAA\nspread had been about 60 basis points and the\nBBB spread about 120 basis points, but the two\nspreads widened to about 75 and 165 basis points,\nrespectively, and have fluctuated in a wide range\naround these levels since then.\nThe disorder also showed up in the federal\nfunds market, as is evident in Figure 1. The funds\nrate spiked above the FOMC’s target of 5.25 percent on August 9 and then fell below the target\nthe following day. Given the market disruption,\nthe Fed’s Open Market Desk supplied reserves\nliberally, and the funds rate remained below the\ntarget until September 14, the Friday before the\nFOMC reduced the target from 5.25 to 4.75 percent on September 18. The funds rate has traded\naround the target since then, but in a wider band\nand is more volatile than it was before August 9.\nI can summarize key features of the market\nupset this way. The turmoil began with disclosure\nof large losses on securities backed by subprime\nmortgages. Commercial-paper investors began to\nflee asset-backed commercial paper, putting their\nfunds instead into safe assets, especially Treasury\nsecurities. Companies that had relied on funding\ntheir assets by issuing commercial paper were\nstressed to come up with funds to redeem maturing paper. They turned to a combination of asset\nsales, which put downward pressure on certain\nasset prices, and to bank loans, which put pressure on banks to find the funds to fulfill their\ncommitments to provide backup credit to commercial-paper issuers. The flight to quality was\nso intense that many investors initially turned\naway from all commercial paper, whether backed\nby subprime mortgage assets or not.\n\nROLE OF THE FED\nThe Fed’s objective is to promote maximum\nsustainable economic growth by fostering price\nstability and minimizing, to the extent possible,\nfluctuations in employment. The Fed can contribute to these objectives by helping financial\nmarkets to operate in an orderly and efficient\n\nmanner. The Fed promotes financial-market efficiency through various regulatory measures and\nby providing the markets with ample liquidity in\ntimes of stress.\nMost of the time, financial markets are highly\nefficient. The Fed’s role is to conduct monetary\npolicy effectively in pursuit of the objectives of\nprice and employment stability. The Fed tries to\nconduct open market operations with as much\nregularity and predictability as possible, to provide a stable base for markets to trade a wide\nrange of financial assets efficiently.\nOn occasion, however, events disrupt normal market processes and special Fed action is\nhelpful. The major role for the Fed here is to see\nthat there is adequate liquidity in times of uncertainty and to provide additional short-term liquidity when there is a legitimate need for it. There\nare numerous instances when the Fed has provided extra liquidity. The most dramatic example\nis the attack on the World Trade Center, when the\nFed injected as much as $140 billion for a few\ndays to support financial market transactions. A\nmuch less well-known example is that the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York advanced the Bank of\nNew York $22.6 billion overnight on November 21,\n1985, because of a computer software failure at\nthe Bank of New York. The liquidity supplied in\nAugust 2007 through open market operations and\nthe discount window is just the latest example\nof the Fed supplying short-term liquidity to support financial markets in unusual circumstances.\nThere are times when providing additional\nliquidity is either unnecessary or inadequate. A\ndramatic example of such a time is the stock\nmarket crash on “black Monday,” October 19,\n1987. Before the markets opened on October 20,\nthe Fed announced that, “The Federal Reserve,\nconsistent with its responsibilities as the Nation’s\ncentral bank, affirmed today its readiness to\nserve as a source of liquidity to support the economic and financial system.” The Fed made clear\nthat depository institutions could avail themselves\nof the discount window as needed, even though\ndoing so might not meet all the usual administrative requirements then in effect.\n5\n\n\fFINANCIAL MARKETS\n\nIt was important for the Fed to make clear to\nbanks that discount window funds were available.\nHowever, few banks actually borrowed. Before\nthe crash, borrowing during the week ending\nOctober 15 averaged $1.147 billion; for the week\nending October 22, average borrowing was only\n$219 million higher. Liquidity turned out not to\nbe an issue.\nConcerns that the stock market crash might\nspread to the economy more generally and affect\neconomic growth prompted the FOMC to reduce\nits target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis\npoints on November 4, 1987. The FOMC cut the\ntarget fed funds rate despite the fact that inflation\nwas running at an unacceptably high rate of over\n4 percent. The FOMC reduced the target by an\nadditional 30 basis points by February 11, 1988.3\nOnce the crisis had passed, the FOMC began raising the target fed funds rate. By May 1988 the target was only slightly below its pre-crash level.\nWith the economic crisis past, the FOMC was able\nto resume its effort to stabilize the price level. By\nlate June 1988 the funds rate target was above its\npre-crash level.\nAnother market upset occurred when Russia\ndefaulted on its sovereign debt on August 17, 1998.\nIn and of itself, this event posed no specific liquidity problems for the U.S. economy. The picture\nbegan to change when, on August 26, it was disclosed that George Soros’ Quantum Fund lost $2\nbillion in Russian markets. The following day the\nspread between AAA rated corporate bonds and\nthe 10-year Treasury yield increased 10 basis\npoints. The spread continued to widen as news\nof fallout from the Russian default intensified. The\nspread widened to 99 basis points on September 2,\nwhen Long Term Capital Management (LTCM)\nannounced that market developments had wiped\nout about half of its capital, which was minimal\nto begin with. While hedge funds can lose capital\nfor a variety of reasons, it was well-known that\nhedge funds that invested heavily in emerging\nmarkets, especially Russia, suffered large losses.\n3\n\n6\n\nThe spread rose further to 114 basis points on\nSeptember 23, when the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York helped organize a rescue package for\nLTCM. By that time, LTCM’s equity had declined\nby nearly 90 percent. The rescue package consisted of a capital infusion by several investment\nbanks. In return, the participating banks got a 90\npercent share in the fund and a promise that a\nsupervisory board would be established.\nIn 1998, the economy was experiencing\nstrong growth and inflation was well contained.\nIn this environment, concerns that the effects of\nthe Russian default might spread to the real economy prompted the FOMC to reduce the funds\nrate target by 75 basis points, in three steps of 25\nbasis points each, between September 29 and\nNovember 17.\nIn 1999, as economic growth remained strong\nand inflation pressures began to rise, the FOMC\nbegan reversing its actions. By mid-November\n1999 the fed funds rate target had reached its\npre-Russian default level. By the spring of 2000,\nthe funds rate target was 6.5 percent—100 basis\npoints higher than before the Russian default.\n\nLOOKING AHEAD\nThe 1987 and 1998 episodes, and others,\nprovide the best picture we have of how the current market turmoil is likely to be resolved. Each\nepisode of financial turmoil has its individual\ncharacteristics but they also have common features.\nAs we think through the current situation, it\nis useful to separate the issues of distress in the\nhousing market from financial turmoil beyond\nhousing. The woes in the housing market may\ncontinue for some time. Home prices are declining.\nSales of single-family houses have been declining\nand the inventory of single-family houses for sale\nhas been rising. No one should feel much confidence in a forecast as to when the housing market\nwill stabilize; the conventional view among\nhousing experts and economic forecasters seems\nto be around the middle of 2008.\n\nDuring this period, the FOMC sometimes changed the intended fed funds rate by amounts other than in multiples of 25 basis points. There\nwere actually two changes, one of 18.75 basis points on January 27 and another of 12.5 basis points change on February 11. I have added\nthese together and rounded off in the text.\n\n\fMarket Healing\n\nOn the financial side, new subprime mortgages are much less readily available than in the\npast. Lenders have taken steps to avoid the lending practices that generated the crisis in the subprime mortgage market, and we can be confident\nthat underwriting practices have improved in all\nsegments of the mortgage market. However, it will\ntake several years to resolve the problems with\noutstanding subprime mortgages and securities\nbacked by such mortgages. Loan delinquency\nrates, which have been trending up since mid2006, are likely to continue to rise. Many homeowners will lose their homes to foreclosure, and\ninvestors will have to write down the value of\ntheir assets backed by subprime mortgages.\nWhat creates generalized financial turmoil\nout of a market problem is that investors flee\nriskier assets of all types, with little regard to\nwhether the assets are connected to the original\nproblem or not. However, a flight to quality typically does not last very long. Investors start to\nmake the relevant distinctions as they search for\ngood assets trading at distressed prices.\nThat process is certainly observable today.\nBroader financial markets are showing signs that\nthe financial market upset is beginning to resolve\nitself. Rates on short-term T-bills have risen and\nare at more normal levels relative to the federal\nfunds rate. Rates on many types of riskier assets\nhave declined. There appears to be only a modest\neffect on rates in the conforming mortgage market.\nThe Freddie Mac index for the conventional 30year mortgage rate was 156 basis points above\nthe 10-year Treasury rate in June; at the end of\nOctober, the spread was about 30 basis points\nhigher. Although the spread is a bit higher, the\nabsolute level of the conforming mortgage rate in\nOctober was roughly 25 basis points below its\nJune level. However, the rate on prime jumbo\nmortgages—mortgages whose size is above the\nconforming mortgage limit of $417,000—was\nabout 100 basis points higher than the rate on\nconforming mortgages from mid-August to midSeptember. The normal spread is about 25 basis\npoints. A sign of progress in market healing is\n4\n\nthat the jumbo spread is currently about 60 basis\npoints.\nThe implications of the market upset for the\nmacroeconomy are not clear. Residential investment, which accounts for about 5 percent of GDP,\nwill continue to be a negative for economic\ngrowth. Consequently, the decline in residential\ninvestment, per se, will have a modest effect on\neconomic growth going forward.\nAt issue is the potential effect of the housing\ndecline on consumer expenditures. The loss of\nwealth associated with the decline in housing\nprices, as well as the fact that mortgage payments\nwill absorb a larger portion of disposable income\nfor some consumers, might cause consumption—\nthe largest component of GDP—to grow at a significantly slower rate. While the effect of a change\nin wealth on consumer expenditures has been\nnotoriously difficult to identify empirically,\nsome recent evidence suggests that changes in\nhousing wealth do affect consumption.4\n\nTHE HEALING PROCESS\nWhat is the process by which financial markets return to normal functioning? I have already\nemphasized that the most fundamental aspect is\nthat investors quickly begin drawing distinctions\nbetween assets with prices depressed for good\nreason and those depressed due to a generalized\nflight to quality. It does make sense for securities\nbacked by subprime mortgages to trade at low\nprices, because the default rate on subprime\nmortgages is high and perhaps rising. Even here,\nhowever, not all subprime mortgages were created\nequal. Some firms originating these mortgages\nhad much better underwriting practices than\nothers. It is logical that investors will now distinguish between securities backed by subprime\nmortgages originated by solid underwriters and\nthose by Sam’s Corner Mortgage Company.\nExperience certainly suggests that central\nbank rate reductions help spur the healing process.\nWhy should that be so?\n\nFor example, see Bostic, Gabriel and Painter (2005) and Catte, Girouard, Price and Andre (2004).\n\n7\n\n\fFINANCIAL MARKETS\n\nOne thing that happens is that cuts in the\npolicy rate—the federal funds target rate in the\nUnited States—serve to reduce the absolute level\nof rates on riskier securities even though spreads\nmay remain higher than before. In the United\nStates, comparing the July 2007 average with the\naverage for the week ending November 2, the\nAAA corporate bond rate fell from 5.65 percent\nto 5.15 percent and the BBB corporate bond rate\nfell from 6.34 percent to 6.09 percent. The same\npoint applies to rates on many other risky assets.\nSpreads against Treasuries are higher but the\nabsolute level of yields has returned to preturmoil levels, or below in some cases.\nAnother thing that happens as a consequence\nof central bank action is an improvement in confidence. Stock market volatility might serve as a\ngood measure of confidence. The stock market\nhas been quite volatile since its peak on July 19.\nBy August 15, the S&P 500 stock index had\ndeclined by 8.3 percent from its peak. Stocks\nsurged on September 18 following the FOMC’s\naction reducing the fed funds rate target by 50\nbasis points. Subsequently, other news led to\nsharp stock declines.\nDespite market volatility, Fed actions have\ndemonstrated to market participants throughout\nthe economy—those in non-financial firms as\nwell as those in financial firms—that the Fed will\nnot be an idle bystander. The Fed needs to be\ncareful to do what is necessary, but not more.\nExcessive rate reductions would run the risk of\nincreasing inflation in the future and inducing\nfurther market volatility as the market came to\nfear future rate increases to deal with rising inflation. Market confidence that the Fed has it about\nright and is prepared to take appropriate further\naction helps in the healing process.\nLet me also offer a conjecture. A cut in the\nfederal funds target rate changes the nature of\nnear-term risks facing market participants who\ntake positions in risky securities. I have emphasized that the willingness of market participants\nto take risks is essential to the healing process\nthat restores normal trading in risky assets. When\nthe Fed cuts its target for the federal funds rate,\nmarket participants know that the FOMC’s deci8\n\nsion at its next meeting will be either to leave\nthe rate unchanged or to cut further. Barring\nunusual circumstances, the FOMC would not\nconsider a rate increase just after cutting its fed\nfunds rate target. This approach to policy is\nappropriate when market conditions are fragile\nbecause market participants must be confident\nthat they can take positions without the risk that\nthe Fed might raise rates, which would reduce\nasset values, in the near term. Investors can then\nconcentrate on determining the fundamental\nvalue of risky assets and can work on deals to\nbuy such assets from holders forced to sell by\ntheir own impaired liquidity and capital positions. As investors accumulate profits from these\ntrades, others are attracted and normal market\nfunctioning resumes.\nAs markets return to normal, Fed policy can\nalso return to its normal focus on the long-run\nneeds of the economy. In June 1999, for example,\nthe Fed started to undo the rate cuts introduced\nin the fall of 1998. It is impossible to determine\nin advance what the schedule should be for the\nreturn to normal monetary policymaking. In current circumstances, it could be that the downdraft from the housing industry will spread to\nother sectors, which might require that recent\nrate cuts not be reversed or even that additional\nrate cuts would be in order. Conversely, as markets heal, the policy situation may return to one\nresembling that of a few months ago in June,\nbefore subprime problems began to have significant market impact.\nAlthough I am unable to forecast the future\ncourse of the FOMC’s target for the federal funds\nrate, I am confident that normal market functioning will return to the financial markets. Recent\nweeks show clear progress. There could be setbacks along the way, but the inherent efficiency\nof U.S. financial markets will ultimately dominate the outcome.\n\nREFERENCES\nBostic, R.; Gabriel, S. and Painter, G. “Housing Wealth,\nFinancial Wealth, and Consumption: New Evidence\n\n\fMarket Healing\n\nfrom Micro Data.” University of Southern California\nWorking Paper, 2005.\nCatte, P.; Girouard N.; Price, R. and Andre, C.\n“Housing Markets, Wealth, and the Business\nCycle.” OECD Economics Department Working\nPaper 394, 2004.\nPoole, W. “Reputation and the Non-Prime Mortgage\nMarket.” Presented to the St. Louis Association of\nReal Estate Professionals, St. Louis, MO, July 20,\n2007. http://www.stlouisfed.org/news/speeches/\n2007/07_20_07.html.\n\n9\n\n\f"

        "content": "Real Estate in the U.S. Economy\nIndustrial Asset Management Council (IAMC) Convention\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nOctober 9, 2007\n\nM\n\ny aim today is to review the basic\nfacts on the size and cyclicality\nof the real estate sector of the U.S.\neconomy. Especially given the\nserious problems evident today in the residential\nside of this sector, it is important to maintain a\nlonger-run perspective on this important industry. Real estate exhibits regularities over the\nbusiness cycle; studying this history may help\nus to better understand the current situation.\nFinally, I will discuss some of the current problems in the industry and lessons that may benefit\nfuture policymakers, consumers and businesses.\nBefore proceeding, I want to emphasize that\nthe views I express here are mine and do not\nnecessarily reflect official positions of the Federal\nReserve System. I appreciate comments provided\nby my colleagues at the Federal Reserve Bank of\nSt. Louis. Kevin L. Kliesen, economist in the\nResearch Division, provided special assistance.\nHowever, I take full responsibility for errors.\n\nDEFINING REAL ESTATE AND ITS\nECONOMIC EFFECTS\nReal estate comprises many important aspects\nof economic activity, both direct and indirect\neffects on the level and composition of real gross\ndomestic product (GDP). There are many ways\nto define the real estate sector. I will concentrate\nmostly on private construction activity as it flows\ninto the GDP accounts. This definition encompasses construction activity to serve both the\nbusiness and household sectors. However, because\na household’s residence is usually the largest single asset it owns, I’ll also briefly discuss recent\n\ntrends in the value of household real estate\nwealth, and place this wealth in the context of\nhousehold financial wealth.\nBesides new construction, real estate is a\nlong-lived asset and therefore has important balance sheet effects. For example, a permanent\nincrease in household net worth arising from\nincreases in real house prices likely spurs some\nincrease in household expenditures on goods and\nservices. Economists generally agree that there is\na wealth effect on household behavior, but there\nis much less agreement on its magnitude.\nAn increase in demand for housing structures,\nall else equal, leads to an increase in housing\nstarts and thus new construction—known in the\nnational accounts as residential fixed investment.\nCurrently, residential fixed investment comprises\na little less than 5 percent of GDP. There are a\nmyriad of direct and indirect effects associated\nwith real estate that spill over into other aspects\nof the economy, such as the demand for lumber,\nlabor and other commodities used in the construction of structures or in remodeling activity.\nBeyond the residential sector, there is a sizable nonresidential component in the real estate\neconomy. The determinants of new construction\nof nonresidential structures are quite different\nfrom the determinants of residential structures\ninvestment. Because a commercial or industrial\nstructure is a long-lived asset, firms will only\nundertake this investment if its rate of return is\nat least equal to its opportunity cost—that is, the\nrate of return on the next best use of its financial\ncapital.\nMany public policies affect real estate. Fiscal\npolicy affects the real estate economy through\n1\n\n\fECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\n\npolicies that change the cost of capital and the\nreturn on capital. These types of effects range\nfrom land use regulations—zoning restrictions\nand the like—to changes in property tax rates,\ndepreciation rules or temporary tax credits\ndesigned to spur commercial or industrial construction activity. Revisions in the tax code, as\nthe 1986 Tax Reform Act showed, can result in\ndramatic changes in incentives to build structures.\nOther innovations, such as those in the mortgage\nfinancing area, can also produce dramatic effects.\nOn the residential side, as we have witnessed\nover the past few years, changes in public policies\nand financial market innovations that allow a\nlarger percentage of the population to purchase\ntheir own home have greatly enhanced residential\nreal estate activity.\nEconometric models can estimate approximate effects on the overall economy from changes\nin real estate activity. Still, economists know that\nour knowledge is incomplete. It is no secret that\nthe downturn in residential real estate activity is\nmore severe than most forecasters expected only\na few months ago.\n\nTRENDS IN RESIDENTIAL\nHOUSING WEALTH\nAccording to the flow of funds data published\nby the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, household real estate assets totaled about\n$20.6 trillion dollars at the end of 2006. Thus, with\nmortgage liabilities totaling about $9.8 trillion,\nhousehold net real estate wealth—which I’ll\nsimply call net housing wealth from now on—\ntotaled a little less than $11 trillion at the end of\n2006.1 If we benchmark net housing wealth to\nGDP, as Figure 1 in your handout shows, we can\nsee that it fluctuates over time—rising for\nextended periods and falling for shorter periods.\nIndeed, net housing wealth as a share of GDP fell\n\nfrom 78 percent in 1987 to 60 percent a decade\nlater. This share rose to an all-time high of nearly\n85 percent in 2005, and then slipped slightly in\n2006.\nA useful perspective arises from expressing\naggregate data in real, or inflation-adjusted, per\ncapita terms. Figure 2 shows per capita real net\nhousing wealth, which has risen rather sharply\nover the past decade.2 After remaining at about\n$25,000 per person from 1991 to 1997, real per\ncapita net housing wealth rose by more than 60\npercent to $41,600 in 2005. Although significant,\nhousehold real net housing wealth is still only\nabout half of the level of tangible financial assets\nheld by households. At the end of 2006, as seen\nin Figure 3, real household financial assets totaled\nabout $37 trillion, or nearly $186,000 per person.\nBy contrast, the value of household real estate\nassets totaled nearly $18 trillion at the end of\n2006, or about $78,500 per person.3\n\nREAL ESTATE IN THE GDP\nReal GDP is the broadest measure of final\ngoods and services produced within the geographic boundaries of a country in a particular\nperiod. Figure 4 shows expenditure shares of the\nmajor components of GDP since 1950. The structures share, roughly 10 percent, has remained\nfairly constant for the past 25 years. Moreover,\nmany other goods and services are tied in part to\nthe production of structures in some fashion,\nsuch as furniture, utilities and roads.\nFigure 5 plots private fixed investment in\nnonresidential structures and residential structures as a percentage of total private fixed investment. Expenditures on residential structures are\nusually larger than on nonresidential structures.\nCurrently, residential fixed investment comprises\nabout 30 percent of total private fixed investment,\nwith nonresidential structures comprising about\n\n1\n\nNominal flow of funds data for the household sector are taken from Table B.100 (Balance Sheet of the Household and Nonprofit Sector).\n\n2\n\nReal per capita household real estate assets are divided by the civilian noninstitutional population, ages 16 and over.\n\n3\n\nThe values in Figure 3 are measured in gross, rather than net terms. From 1995 to 2006, real household liabilities increased by about 111 percent.\n\n2\n\n\fReal Estate in the U.S. Economy\n\nFigure 1\nNominal Household Net Real Estate Assets as a Percent of GDP\n100\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\n1952 1958 1964 1970 1976 1982 1988 1994 2000 2006\nSOURCE: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and author’s calculations.\n\nFigure 2\nReal Per Capita Net Household Real Estate Assets\n\n$2000 Dollars\n50,000\n40,000\n30,000\n20,000\n10,000\n0\n1952 1958 1964 1970 1976 1982 1988 1994 2000 2006\nSOURCE: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and author’s calculations.\n\n3\n\n\fECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\n\nFigure 3\nReal Per Capita Gross Household Financial and Real Estate Assets\n$2000 Dollars\n200,000\n175,000\n150,000\nFinancial\nHousing\n125,000\n100,000\n75,000\n50,000\n25,000\n0\n1952 1958 1964 1970 1976 1982 1988 1994 2000 2006\n\nSOURCE: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and author’s calculations.\n\nFigure 4\nReal GDP Shares by Major Type of Product\n\nPercent\n70\nServices\n\n60\n50\n40\n\nGoods\n\n30\n20\n10\n0\n1950 1957\n\nStructures\n\n1964 1971 1978 1985 1992 1999 2006\n\nSOURCE: Bureau of Economic Analysis and author’s calculations.

The table lists the value of construction\nput into place, as published by the U.S. Bureau\nof the Census. These are the key source data that\nfeed into national income and product accounts\nfor fixed investment in residential and nonresidential structures. Through August 2007, construction spending has totaled a bit less than\n$1.2 trillion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate,\nwith private construction outlays comprising a\nlittle more than three-quarters of the total and\npublic construction outlays the remaining onequarter. The table also shows how these expenditure shares have changed over the past decade,\nin five-year increments.\nIn general, there has been a modest upward\nshift in the share of residential and public con-\n\nstruction at the expense of nonresidential construction. If we dig a little deeper, we find shifts\nin construction shares similar to the structural\nchanges that are occurring in the economy. For\nexample, since 1997 there have been modest\nincreases in the share of construction outlays\ndevoted to lodging, health care, communications\nand power, with modest declines seen in commercial and office construction, amusement and\nrecreation, and manufacturing.\nWe can gain additional insight by examining\nthe share of payroll employment and after-tax\ncorporate profits of the construction industry\nrelative to other large, private industries. Table 2\nshows the seven largest industries, ranked by their\nemployment share through August 2007. These\nseven industries comprise about 70 percent of\ntotal payroll employment. In 2007, the number\nof jobs in the construction industry totaled 7.7\nmillion. Although construction was the seventh\nlargest employer, the industry comprises only\nabout 5.5 percent of total nonfarm payroll jobs.\n\n4\n\nI have calculated shares from nominal data. Comparisons of dollar magnitudes over time are best made from inflation-adjusted, or real,\nmagnitudes.\n\n5\n\nReal values calculated with chain-type price weights are not additive, which means that dividing one real series by another to obtain shares\nis not advisable, especially the further away one gets from the base year.\n\n5\n\n\fECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\n\nTable 1\nTotal Construction Put Into Place\n\nNOTE: 2007 values are year-to-date averages of monthly figures.\nSOURCE: Bureau of the Census and author’s calculations.\n\nIn fact, construction’s share was about half that\nof manufacturing’s and about 60 percent smaller\nthan the largest sector, education and health services. While construction’s share of total nonfarm\npayroll employment has increased slightly since\n1998, the two largest industries, which are in the\nservices sector, have seen their shares increase\nby larger amounts.\nIn our market economy, profits are an important signaling mechanism for the allocation of\neconomic resources. Strong profits signal rising\nreturns in an industry and tend to attract additional capital. Table 3 also shows the seven largest\n\nindustries by their domestic corporate profit share\nsince 1998.6 These seven industries comprised\nabout 75 percent of total corporate domestic\nprofits in 2006.7 By profit share, the construction\nindustry is the sixth largest domestic industry.\nHowever, like most of the other six major industries, the construction industry has seen its share\nof corporate domestic profits fall since 1998. By\ncontrast, profit shares have risen strongly for the\nfinance and insurance industry and, since 2002,\nfor the information industry. From 1998 to the\npeak year of 2005, construction industry aftertax profits rose by about 19 percent per year on\n\n6\n\nCorporate profit data are based on the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS), which are only available since 1998. Prior\nto 1998, they are based on the old Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system, and thus are not strictly comparable.\n\n7\n\nIn 2006 (the latest data available), domestic profits comprised 81 percent of total after-tax corporate profits. The profit share of foreign firms\nlocated in the United States totaled 19 percent of total after-tax profits.\n\n6\n\n\fReal Estate in the U.S. Economy\n\nTable 2\nTop 7 Private Industries by Employment Shares, 1998 to 2007, Ranked by 2007 Shares\n\nSOURCE: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Employment Statistics survey.\n\nTable 3\nTop 7 Industries by Domestic Corporate Profit Shares, 1998 to 2006, Ranked by 2006 Shares\n\nSOURCE: Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\naverage, but they fell by 21 percent in 2006 and\nwill surely fall again in 2007.\n\nTHE CYCLICALITY OF REAL\nESTATE\nOne of the most significant changes in the\nU.S. economy over the past quarter century has\nbeen the marked reduction in economic volatility.\nFollowing the terminology of the Great Depression\nand the Great Inflation, this period of increased\nstability has been termed “The Great Moderation.”\n\nThe Great Moderation—this period of relatively stable GDP growth—has been accompanied\nby a lower average level and reduced volatility\nof long-term interest rates. The more stable financial environment makes it easier for firms and\nhouseholds to plan for the future.\nThe Great Moderation has also made the job\nof forecasters somewhat easier. Forecast errors for\nreal GDP growth and inflation have been smaller\nthan before. While no single factor can explain\nthis decline in volatility, economists have pointed\nto several factors, such as better monetary policy,\nstructural changes in the economy, such as just7\n\n\fECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\n\nin-time production, and a rising share of employment in the less volatile services industries.\nOver the past 25 years, U.S. business expansions have become longer and recessions less\nsevere. The current economic expansion, which\nbegan in November 2001, is nearly six years old.\nOn average, post-World War II expansions lasted\nonly a little more than four years. Despite the\nlonger expansions and milder recessions, it is\nstill the case that fluctuations in investment\nspending by households and businesses account\nfor a large share of GDP fluctuations over the\nbusiness cycle.8\nTo understand typical experience since the\nKorean War, consider Figure 6. Each line shows\nthe average contribution to real GDP growth (in\npercentage points) eight quarters before and after\neach cycle peak from 1953 to 2001. There are\nthree lines representing the contribution to real\nGDP growth from residential fixed investment\n(housing), nonresidential structures (commercial\nand industrial), and business equipment and\nsoftware investment. These are the major components of private fixed investment.\nResidential investment typically turns down—\nthat is, contributes negatively to real GDP growth—\nwell before the other two investment components.\nThe figure shows that, on average, housing peaks\nabout three quarters before a recession starts.\nSecond, of the three investment components,\nhousing makes the largest negative contribution\nto growth during the recession, and on average\nthis negative contribution occurs concurrent with\nthe business cycle peak. Housing’s contribution\nto growth then becomes progressively less negative and, on average, turns positive three quarters\nafter the onset of the recession.\nFor recent business cycles, however, the timing of real estate’s contribution to real GDP growth\nboth before the onset of the recession and during\nthe recession is considerably different from earlier experience.9 For instance, in the 2001 recession, housing declined prior to the business\n8\n\nSee Zarnowitz (1999).\n\n9\n\nSee Leamer (2007).\n\n8\n\ncycle peak in March 2001, registering its largest\nnegative contribution to real GDP growth in the\nsecond and third quarters of 2000. In contrast with\nthe typical pattern, however, housing was then a\nnet positive contributor to real GDP growth over\nthe first three quarters of 2001.\nThe contribution of business structures\ninvestment to GDP growth typically hits its zenith\none quarter before the recession starts, but it does\nnot begin to contribute negatively to real GDP\ngrowth until two quarters after the recession\nstarts. Investment in business structures does\nnot begin to contribute positively to real GDP\ngrowth until nearly two years after a recession\nstarts. The lag reflects the long lead times associated with large projects, such as office buildings.\nFinally, the contribution from business\ninvestment in equipment and software exhibits\ncharacteristics of the other two components.\nLike residential investment, equipment and software spending makes its largest contribution to\nreal GDP growth three quarters before the recession starts, but then turns sharply negative one\nquarter into the recession. In Figure 6, the largest\naverage contribution from equipment and software spending occurs one quarter into the recession, about 0.75 percentage points; it remains at\nabout that level for another quarter. But like business investment in structures, equipment and\nsoftware investment does not begin to make a\npositive contribution to real GDP growth, on average, until nearly two years after the cycle peak,\nby which time the recovery is well under way.\nFigure 6 makes clear that housing both leads\nthe economy into recession and out of recession.\nMoreover, while housing’s drag on the economy\nduring the recession is larger than the other two\ninvestment components, its recovery is also larger:\nA year and a half after the recession starts, housing’s average contribution to real GDP growth is\n1 percentage point—more than double the sum\nof the other two components.\n\n\fReal Estate in the U.S. Economy\n\nFigure 6\nAverage Contribution to GDP Growth: Components of Private Fixed Investment\nPercentage points\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n-0.5\n-1\n-1.5\n-8\n\n-7\n\n-6\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nQuarters around peak\nEquip. & Soft.\n\nNonres.

Since its peak in 2005:Q4, real\nresidential fixed investment expenditures have\ndeclined by 19 percent. Over the same interval,\nreal business investment in structures has\nincreased by 21 percent. If you plot these two\nseries on a chart, they would look like scissors:\none line going up and one line going down—and\ntheir slopes would be quite steep.10 Indeed their\nslopes suggest that the current rates of change are\nnot sustainable. Housing will not continue to fall\nat double-digit rates, and outlays for business\nstructures will not continue to increase at doubledigit rates.\n\nUnfortunately, recent events suggest that\nhousing will remain weak for several more quarters; stabilization may not begin until well into\n2008. Probably the most important statistics in\nthis regard are the number of unsold new homes\nstill on the market relative to their current sales\nrate and the recent trends in house prices. Figure 7\nshows that the inventory-to-sales ratio of unsold\nnew and existing single-family homes has risen\nsharply since early 2005. The current level of\ninventories relative to sales is about double the\naverage levels from 1999 to 2005.\nSome potential homebuyers are no doubt\ndelaying purchase because they expect house\nprices to fall. As seen in Figure 8, prices have\ndecelerated sharply nationwide. According to\nthe price index published by the Office of Federal\nHousing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), through\nthe second quarter of 2007 prices are still a bit\nabove year earlier levels.11 However, another\n\n10\n\nPart of the strength in structures investment reflects increased drilling and mining activity in the energy sector. This is undoubtedly a\nresponse to higher energy prices. However, this component is only about 15 percent of total structures outlays.\n\n11\n\nThe OFHEO index plotted in Figure 8 is for purchases only; that is, it excludes house prices valued for refinancing activity.\n\n9\n\n\fECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\n\nFigure 7\nInventory to Sales Ratio: New and Existing Single-Family Homes\n12.0\nAug.\n\n10.0\nNew\n\nExisting\n\n8.0\nAug.\n\n6.0\n4.0\n2.0\n1999\n\n2001\n\n2003\n\n2005\n\n2007\n\nFigure 8\nU.S. House Price Indexes\nPercent change from four-quarters earlier\n\n20\nOFHEO\n\nS&P/Case-Shiller\n\n15\n10\n5\n0\n-5\n1998\n\n2000\n\n2002\n\n2004\n\nNOTE: Data are through 2007:Q2.\n\n10\n\n2006\n\n\fReal Estate in the U.S. Economy\n\nmeasure of national house prices—the S&P/CaseShiller price index (SPCSI)—actually declined 3\npercent in the second quarter from a year earlier.\nA subset of this measure, indexes based on house\nprices in the 10- and 20-largest U.S. markets,\nsuggests that prices have declined even more in\nthe third quarter. In July 2007, the 10-city composite has declined 4.5 percent from 12 months\nearlier and the 20-city composite has declined\nabout 4 percent.\nA decline in home prices on a national average basis is relatively rare. In fact, using OFHEO\ndata, there has been no such decline over four\nquarters since the inception of the purchases\nonly OFHEO index in 1991 or since 1975 using\nOFHEO’s total index, which includes refinancings.\nIt appears that we are in uncharted territory, and,\ngiven that fact, a forecast of house prices must be\nregarded as highly uncertain.\nAccording to the latest Blue Chip survey, the\nConsensus expectation is for the S&P/Case Shiller\nhouse price index in December 2007 to be 5.6\npercent below that from a year earlier and for the\nindex to fall an additional 3.9 percent in 2008.\nThe Blue Chip consensus forecast also projects\nthat real residential fixed investment will decline\n15 percent this year and by another 7.6 percent\nin 2008.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nThe financial market turmoil that began in\nAugust hit hard an already struggling housing\nmarket. Financial markets appear to be stabilizing,\nbut they have not returned to normal and are\nstill fragile. Most forecasters have reduced their\nexpectations for GDP growth and believe that\ndownside risks have risen. However, the employment report for September, the latest available at\nthis time, does not suggest that the downside risk\nis occurring. As an aside, the substantial upward\nrevisions to data released in the August report\nremind us that it is a mistake to place too much\nweight on any one report.\nAlthough this episode of financial turmoil is\nstill unfolding, my preliminary judgment is that\n\nthere are no new lessons. Weak underwriting\npractices put far too many borrowers into unsuitable mortgages. As borrowers default, they suffer\nthe consequences of foreclosure and loss of whatever equity they had in their homes. It is painful\nto have to move, especially under such forced\ncircumstances. Investors are suffering heavy\nlosses. There is no new lesson here: Sound mortgage underwriting should always be based on\nanalysis of the borrower’s capacity to repay and\nnot on the assumption that a bad loan can be\nrecovered through foreclosure without loss\nbecause of rising property values.\nThe other aspect of the current financial turmoil that reaffirms an old lesson is that it is risky\nto finance long-term assets with short-term liabilities. Consider a portfolio of any sort of longterm assets or assets carrying substantial credit\nrisk, such as securities collateralized with subprime mortgages. Financing such a portfolio with\ncommercial paper makes the firm vulnerable to\nthe risk that holders of the commercial paper\nwill refuse to roll over maturing issues. Over the\npast few months, firms that structured their portfolios this way found themselves faced with\nexactly this problem. No manufacturing firm\nwould ever finance a portfolio of fixed assets with\ncommercial paper; once market sentiment became\ndistrustful of subprime assets, these assets lost\nvalue and became no more marketable than\ninvestments in factory buildings.\nThe Federal Reserve has neither the power\nnor the desire to bail out bad investments. We do\nhave the responsibility to do what we can to\nmaintain normal financial market processes.\nWhat that means, in my view, is that we want to\nsee restoration of active trading in assets of all\nsorts and in all risk classes. It is for the market to\njudge whether securities backed by subprime\nmortgages are worth 20 cents on the dollar, or 50\ncents, or 100 cents. Obviously, the market will\njudge different subprime assets differently, based\non careful analysis of the underlying mortgages.\nThat process will take time, as it is expensive to\nconduct the analysis that good mortgage underwriting would have conducted in the first place.\nAlthough there is a substantial distance to go,\n11\n\n\fECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\n\nrestoration of normal spreads and trading activity\nappears to be under way, and we can be confident\nthat in time the market will straighten out the\nproblems. We do not know, however, how much\ntime will be required for us to be able to say that\nthe current episode is over.\nThank you. I’d be delighted to take your\nquestions.\n\nREFERENCES\nLeamer, Edward E. “Housing and the Business\nCycle.” Presented at a Symposium Sponsored by\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson\nHole, Wyoming, August 30–September 1, 2007.\nZarnowitz, Victor. “Theory and History Behind\nBusiness Cycles: Are the 1990s the Onset of a\nGolden Age.” Journal of Economic Perspectives,\nSpring 1999, 13(2), pp. 69-90.\n\n12\n\n\f"

        "content": "Thinking Like a Central Banker\nMarket News International\nNew York, New York\nSeptember 28, 2007\nPublished in the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, January/February 2008, 90(1), pp. 1-7\n\nE\n\nveryone looks at the world through\nlenses colored by his or her own experiences and background. Over my nine\nplus years at the Fed, I have been struck\nby misunderstandings of why the Fed acts as it\ndoes—misunderstandings from vantage points\nthat are quite different from that of a Fed official.\nThose with Fed experience do know things that\nothers do not. Some of what we know is confidential, but such information is in most cases\ndisclosed with a lag. There are few permanent\nsecrets. Still, there is a central-banker way of\nthinking that can be described and analyzed;\ndoing so may help others to avoid mistakes in\nassessing Fed policy. That is my topic in these\nremarks.\nObviously, all I can do is to describe how\none particular central banker with the initials\nW.P. thinks about what he does. And my perspective is that from a particular central bank, the\nFederal Reserve. My Fed colleagues might put\nthings differently and might believe that I am off\nbase with some of my comments. Nevertheless, I\nthink the effort is worthwhile, for the degree of\nsuccess of monetary policy is positively correlated with how completely the market understands the Fed. My disclaimer is that the views I\nexpress here are mine. These views not only do\nnot necessarily reflect official positions of the\nFederal Reserve System but also may not reflect\nthe views of anyone else at the Fed, past or present. I thank my colleagues at the Federal Reserve\nBank of St. Louis for their comments, but I retain\nfull responsibility for errors.\n\nASSESSING THE ECONOMY\nAn area where Fed practice and market practice are essentially identical is in assessing the\nstate of the economy and the outlook. Private\nsector and Fed forecasters use similar methods\nand rely on the same statistical information.\nObviously, there are professional differences of\nopinion and of approaches, but these do not create\na divide between Fed and private forecasts. As I\nhave often put it, economists inside and outside\nthe Fed studied at the same universities under\nthe same professors and read the same journal\narticles. There is substantial movement of economists into and out of the Federal Reserve System.\nFed economists attend many university seminars,\nand academic economists attend Fed seminars.\nDisagreements about forecasts are similar inside\nand outside of the Fed.\nThere is a difference in the informal or anecdotal information available inside and outside\nthe Fed. The Fed has a large network of business\ncontacts and relies on them to augment the forecasting effort. However, some private forecasters\nhave access to data and information the Fed does\nnot. Large financial firms in particular have access\nto data, such as credit card activity and prospective borrowing by major clients, that the Fed does\nnot have. Retail firms have extremely current\ninformation on sales and orders. Of course, the\nFed may obtain some of this information through\nits business contacts, but private companies often\nmake much more systematic use of their own\ninternal business information than the Fed does.\nForecasters continually provide updates based\non the flow of current information, both statisti1\n\n\fMONETARY POLICY AND INFLATION\n\ncal and informal. In this regard, Fed and market\npractice is essentially identical.\nThere is, however, a difference between the\nFed and the market in the use of forecast information. Traders and portfolio managers base their\ntrades on the current flow of information, which\nneeds to be updated throughout the trading day.\nFed policymakers, on the other hand, do not continuously adjust the stance of policy in the same\nway managers adjust portfolio holdings. For this\nreason, my own practice is not to worry much as\nto whether I have correctly absorbed the import\nof each day’s, or each hour’s, data. I know that\nsome information will be irrelevant to my policy\nposition because it will be superseded by new\ninformation by the time of the next FOMC meeting. For example, I do not need hour-by-hour\ninformation on security prices. When I get to\nthe next FOMC meeting, I’ll have the latest data,\ncharts of how security prices have behaved\nsince the previous meeting, and analyses of price\nbehavior over a much longer period—indeed, for\nas far back in time as I find helpful. Given that\nthe FOMC does not adjust policy continuously,\nupdating my forecast with every data release\nwould not be an efficient use of my time.\nA consequence of the fact that FOMC meetings occur at six-week intervals, on average, is\nthat when I give a speech and take questions I may\nnot be completely up to date on the implications\nof the latest data. In my speeches and discussions\nof policy with various audiences, I try to concentrate on longer-run issues and general principles.\nI emphasize that I will be studying all the data\nand anecdotal information in the days leading\nup to an FOMC meeting. Thus, I ordinarily do\nnot give detailed answers to questions on the\nprecise implications of the latest data for the\neconomic outlook. In many cases, I just haven’t\nstudied the implications thoroughly, although I\ncertainly do so by the time the FOMC next meets.\n\nDEALING WITH RISK\nA private firm, especially a financial firm,\nmust have robust policies to address risk. To an\n2\n\neconomist, risk is a two-sided concept. Outcomes\nmay be above or below prior expectations. The\npossibility of an outcome far below expectation\ndeserves special attention, for such an outcome\nmay force a firm into bankruptcy. A financial firm\nmodels risk quantitatively, to the extent possible,\nand then examines with great care the extent to\nwhich formal models may miss key risks, perhaps\nbecause they were not observed during the sample period used to fit a model or because the economic environment may be changing. A central\nbank has a similar task. Quantification of risks to\nthe economy should be taken as far as possible\nand then careful thought applied to risks beyond\nthose that can be captured in models.\nOne important difference between a financial\nfirm and the central bank is that a firm has a much\nwider array of strategies available to mitigate risk\nthan does a central bank. A financial firm can\nmake careful calculations of the extent of duration\nmismatch between assets and liabilities and can\nadjust its positions continuously to control the\nextent of mismatch. A financial firm can deal in\nmany derivatives markets to control risk. A financial firm has wide latitude in choosing how much\nrisk to accept.\nA central bank pretty much has to accept\npolicy risks to the economy arising from the\neconomy’s institutional structure and market\nenvironment. Market sentiment, bullish or bearish, can change quickly. Analytically, the central\nbank can explore implications of various possible\nscenarios and can engage in special information\ncollection to try to understand as quickly as possible what is happening in the economy. Beyond\nthat, what a central bank can do is to adopt from\ntime to time a somewhat asymmetric policy\nstance in an effort to control risk, especially by\nguarding against particularly costly possible outcomes. When inflation risk is the dominant concern, policy should lean on the restrictive side\nand policymakers should be more ready to tighten\nthan to ease policy. Conversely, when deflation\nand/or recession risk predominates, policy should\nbe asymmetric toward policy ease. However,\nthere is always the danger of leaning in one\ndirection too far or too long; policymakers must\n\n\fThinking Like a Central Banker\n\nbe prepared to reverse course and should try not\nto allow the stance of policy to drift too far from\na baseline approach.\nIt is worth emphasizing that the central bank,\nas the dominant player in the money market, is\nin a different situation than is a competitive firm.\nThe central bank’s strategy in mitigating risk\nmust work through the markets and by shaping\naccurate market expectations about future central\nbank behavior.\nThe list of possible risks facing private firms\nand central banks is a long one. A risk that is\noften incompletely understood by those outside\nmanagement is reputational risk. The issue is\nmuch more than simple embarrassment. Trust is\nan essential capital asset for a financial firm, and\nfor a central bank. A damaged reputation can send\ncustomers fleeing to competitors. For a central\nbank, a damaged reputation can lead market\nparticipants to question the bank’s policy consistency, its motivations, and even its veracity. For\nthese reasons, successful private sector firms and\ncentral banks both invest heavily in programs\nand procedures to ensure fair dealing and high\nethical standards. With regard to reputational risk,\nthe issues inside and outside the central bank\nare essentially identical. Financial firms and\ncentral banks understand each other very well\non this dimension of managing risk.\n\nASSESSING ODDS ON FED\nPOLICY ACTION\nMarket participants are constantly assessing\nthe odds on Fed policy actions at upcoming\nFOMC meetings. These assessments register\ndirectly in market prices, especially in the federal\nfunds futures and options markets and the similar\nmarkets in eurodollars. There is an important\npolicy purpose for the Fed to study these market\nexpectations. Understanding how the flow of new\ninformation affects market expectations can be\nuseful to policymakers. For example, suppose I\ninterpret a surprise change in employment to be\nan anomaly in the data but I observe a large market\nreaction to the data release. In that case, I would\n\nreexamine my interpretation, and if I still believe\nI am correct I might comment during the Q&A\nsession after a speech that my own personal take\non the data differs from the market view. My\naim would be to prompt market participants to\nreexamine their interpretation of the data.\nConsider another example of the importance\nof tracking market expectations. When I examine\nthe federal funds futures market, a large discrepancy between market expectations and my “best\nguess” of the FOMC’s future actions might suggest\nto me the possibility of a Fed communications\nfailure. The ideal situation is one in which the\nmarket and the Fed have read available information the same way. I am only one participant in\nthe FOMC process, but I try not to contribute to\nmarket misunderstanding of monetary policy.\nThe market is collating information from all FOMC\nparticipants, paying especially close attention,\nof course, to the Chairman’s views.\nI also follow market data carefully as part of\nongoing research on how market expectations\nare formed. This research, conducted with economists in the St. Louis Fed’s Research Division,\nhelps me to understand monetary policy at a\ndeeper level. My perspective in this research is\nessentially the same as similar research conducted\nin universities and by active market participants.\n\nOBJECTIVES\nPrivate firms have the goal of profit maximization, whereas the central bank is pursuing the\nmacroeconomic goals of price stability, employment stability at a high level, and financial market\nstability. The private sector and monetary policy\ngoals are quite different, but that fact does not, in\nmy view, define an important difference in\napproach.\nPolicymakers think in terms of a loss function\nthat depends on departures of outcomes from\ndesired outcomes. Policy goals are quantifiable\nand, as with profits, come with short and long\nhorizons. As already discussed, private firms\nand central banks must understand and control\nrisks to the extent possible.\n3\n\n\fMONETARY POLICY AND INFLATION\n\nPrivate firm and central bank governing and\ndisciplining processes are, of course, quite different. Nevertheless, analytical approaches to achieving goals are quite similar. I do not believe that\ndifferences of objectives and governing processes\ndefine an essential difference between the two\ntypes of organizations. Thus, in this respect those\nin the private sector and in the central bank\nunderstand and relate to each other easily.\n\nPRICE MAKERS VERSUS PRICE\nTAKERS\nWhat is a critically important difference\nbetween a central bank and a private financial\nfirm is that the central bank, in the short run\nanyway, sets a policy interest rate and importantly influences longer-term interest rates\nthrough effects on market expectations. The central bank is a price maker in the interbank funds\nmarket. Private financial firms are essentially\nprice takers in that market and in the government securities market.\nA typical trader or portfolio manager can\nplan security purchases and sales with little or\nno regard to any effects on market prices or the\nbehavior of other firms. Of course, this statement\nis not precisely true for very large portfolios, but\nthe difference in market impact between a central\nbank and a large private portfolio is enormous.\nThe fact that a central bank is a price maker\nmakes its strategy fundamentally different from\nthat of a portfolio manager. To achieve policy\ngoals, the central bank must think of its policy\nactions as following a predictable policy rule that\nthe private sector can observe. A portfolio manager responds to the flow of new information\npartly as it affects probabilities of future central\nbank action.\nI pointed out earlier that both market participants and policymakers try to understand the\nimplications of the flow of information for policy\nactions. Now I want to emphasize the important\npoint that policymakers have the task of designing systematic policy responses to new information. The design should advance achievement\n4\n\nof policy goals, such as price stability. There are\nmany dimensions to policy design. A simple\nexample is that the Federal Reserve now adjusts\nits target for the federal funds rate in multiples of\n25 basis points. That may seem a trivial example,\nbut in the past the Fed sometimes adjusted its\nfunds rate target by smaller amounts. Another\nexample is disclosure of the policy decision\npromptly after the decision. That practice started\nonly in 1994 and ever since the FOMC has almost\nconstantly grappled with disclosure issues.\nI could point to many other dimensions of\ndefining a policy rule, or response function\n(Poole, 2005). My point is not to elaborate on the\nnature of the policy rule but instead to emphasize\nhow different that responsibility is from that of a\nportfolio manager. Policymakers should shape\ntheir policy actions by conscious decisions about\nhow to guide market thinking not just in the context of a particular policy action but also in the\nfuture for policy actions in general. Put another\nway, when economic conditions recur, policy\nresponses to the same set of conditions should\nalso recur. If that were not the case, then policy\nactions could be interpreted only as random,\nunpredictable responses to changes in economic\nconditions. It simply cannot be good policy for\npolicy actions to be essentially random.\nThe market interprets every policy action\nand every policy statement in the context of past\nactions and statements. What is a surprise and\nwhat is expected depends on past practice. The\nimplication of this obvious point is that every\npolicy action needs to be based on an understanding of how the action will be regarded in the\nfuture. Policy actions set precedents, and policymakers must be careful about those precedents.\nOtherwise, what appears to be a policy success\ntoday could be the seed of a policy problem in\nthe future.\nModern macroeconomics emphasizes the\nimportance of policy predictability for good policy\noutcomes (Taylor, 1984). The difference in perspective from standard practice 30 years ago is\nprofound and incompletely recognized by many\njournalists and commentators. Even in the early\nGreenspan years, many thought that monetary\n\n\fThinking Like a Central Banker\n\npolicy worked by creating surprises. That perspective was natural because policy surprises had\nvisible effects on security prices.\nTheoretical developments in macroeconomics\nin the 1970s emphasized that policy surprises\nwere undesirable. Efficient planning in the private\nsector requires that expectations about government policies be accurate, or as accurate as the\ninherent uncertainty of the economic environment permits. Policymakers ought not to add to\ninherent economic uncertainty. It is desirable that,\nto the maximum possible extent, the economy\nbe characterized by an expectational equilibrium\nin which the market behaves as policymakers\nexpect and the central bank behaves as the market\nexpects. There are certainly times, however, when\npolicy surprises are unavoidable.\nSo, much of my own thinking is driven by an\neffort to help define a policy that will increase\npolicy predictability over time. In my speeches\nand ensuing Q&A, I try to emphasize general\npolicy principles rather than the current policy\nsituation. What is important is not the policy\naction at the next FOMC meeting, which is typically what people want to know, but the policy\nregularity that will extend across many FOMC\nmeetings, which is what people should want to\nknow.\n\nAVOIDING POLICY DISTURBANCES\nAn important corollary to the task of defining\na policy rule is that the central bank ought not to\nbe a source of random disturbances. All of us are\nwell aware of the potential for saying things\ninadvertently that will create market misunderstanding of likely future Fed policy actions. Or,\nmore precisely, what needs to be understood is\nhow and why various possible economic conditions would justify particular appropriate policy\nresponses. One way to avoid misinformation is\nto avoid providing any information. Put another\nway, if my mouth is not open, I cannot put my\nfoot into it.\nIn my view, however, it is important to try to\nconvey correct information. I do not believe that\n\nI would be doing my job if fear of providing misinformation led me to provide no information.\nFor this reason, I have maintained an active speaking schedule.\nI do follow some general practices designed\nto reduce missteps. I try to schedule speeches,\nand certainly press interviews, for times when\nthe markets are closed. That allows the market to\ndigest what I say overnight. Another practice is\nthat I never predict the outcome of future FOMC\nmeetings. Given that I am only one participant in\nthose meetings and that the Chairman’s opinion\ncarries great weight, predicting the outcome\nwould be foolish. That is obvious, but what is\nless obvious is that I do my best to avoid being\ncommittal even in my own mind about the policy\nimplications of recent data. Clearly, I could draw\nconclusions from available data that would create\na certain presumption about the policy decision\nor at least about my policy position. I am very\ncautious about drawing firm implications about\npolicy from the data.\nI emphasize that my policy position will\ndepend on all the information available at the\ntime of the FOMC meeting, on the staff analysis,\nand on the debate during the meeting. That\ndescription of my attitude is literally correct. I\nnoted earlier that I often do not focus on the data\narriving day by day because I know that new data\nwill supersede existing data and that I will benefit\nfrom my own intensive preparation before each\nmeeting. I rely on the expert staff analysis prepared for each FOMC meeting. Given the complexity and dynamic nature of the issues, I find\nit best not to form a settled policy position well\nin advance of the meeting.\nMoreover, what policy purpose would be\nserved by my discussing publicly every twist and\nturn of my analysis between FOMC meetings?\nMarket effects from doing so would not serve a\nconstructive policy purpose—indeed, they would\nviolate one of the important findings in macroeconomics that policy should not create random\ndisturbances.\n5\n\n\fMONETARY POLICY AND INFLATION\n\nBASICS OF POLICY STRATEGY\nI have emphasized the importance of the\ncentral banker perspective in conveying a policy\nstrategy. I will conclude by sketching the appropriate strategy as I see it.\nFirst, the central bank should be clear as to\nits goals. The most fundamental goal is maximum\npossible sustainable economic growth, which in\nmy mind motivates the dual mandate in the law\nfor the Federal Reserve to strive for price stability\nand high employment. Price stability, which is\nuniquely a central bank responsibility, contributes\ngreatly to the goal of maximum sustainable growth.\nPrice stability is not in conflict with high employment but contributes to it.\nI personally believe, and have so stated on\nnumerous occasions, that the inflation goal should\nbe quantified. I know that many disagree on this\npoint. In today’s economy, I believe that a quantified inflation goal is not critically important but\nquantification might be of great importance in\nthe future. I ask this question: If the Fed had had\na specific inflation goal in 1965, would that commitment have helped to avoid the Great Inflation?\nI think the answer to the question is “yes.” If that\nis the correct answer, then the United States might\nhave avoided a very costly 15-year period of inflation, or the period might have been shorter.\nA central bank cannot fix the level of\nemployment or its rate of growth, or the average\nrate of unemployment. However, the central bank\ncan contribute to employment stability. Avoiding,\nor at least cushioning, recessions is an important\ngoal. This goal should not be viewed as in conflict\nwith price stability. The most serious employment\ndisaster in U.S. history was the Great Depression,\nwhich was a consequence of monetary policy mistakes that led to ongoing serious deflation. Similarly, the period of the Great Inflation saw four\nrecessions in 14 years. Price stability is an essential precondition for overall economic stability.\nWe have tentative signs that the financial\nmarkets are beginning to recover from the recent\nupset, but financial fragility is obviously still an\nissue. If the upset were to deepen in a sustained\nway, it might have serious consequences for\n6\n\nemployment stability. As of today, we just do not\nknow what the consequences may be. My best\nguess is that the inherent resilience of the U.S.\neconomy along with future policy actions, should\nthey be desirable, will keep the economy on a\ntrack of moderate average growth and gradually\ndeclining inflation over the next few years.\nSimilar bouts of financial market instability\nin the nineteenth century on up to the financial\npanic of 1907 led Congress to pass the Federal\nReserve Act in 1912. A fundamental responsibility\nof the central bank is to contribute to orderly and\nefficient functioning of financial markets. The\nfinancial market upset of 2007 will join the history of upsets including those in 1970, 1984, 1987,\nand 1998. Each upset has different specifics but\nall of them have common characteristics, including especially a flight to safe assets.\nI believe that part of the policy strategy ought\nto be to convey as clearly as possible to the market\nwhat the central bank is doing and why. A policy\nstrategy that is a mystery to the markets will not\nserve the central bank well. Of course, the market\nwill observe what the central bank does and infer\nmany aspects of the strategy from those observations. Nevertheless, central bank strategy always\nrelies in part on judgments about incoming information, such as whether a particular data release\nhas anomalous features and should be discounted.\nThe strategy of a central bank should be institutionalized and enduring. The strategy should not\nchange just because the official roster changes. The\nstrategy should evolve as economic knowledge\nimproves and as economic conditions change.\nI hope these remarks are useful. They do, in\nany event, explain something about how I have\napproached my responsibilities.\n\nREFERENCES\nPoole, William. “The Fed’s Monetary Policy Rule.”\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review,\nJanuary/February 2006, 88(1), pp. 1-12;\nhttp://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/\n06/01/Poole.pdf.\n\n\fThinking Like a Central Banker\n\nTaylor, John B. “An Appeal for Rationality in the\nPolicy Activism Debate.” Federal Reserve Bank of\nSt. Louis Review, December 1984, 66(10), pp. 151-63;\nhttp://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/\n84/conf/taylor.pdf.\n\n7\n\n\f"

        "content": "Jobs and Trade\nEuropean Economics and Financial Centre (EEFC) Conference\nLondon, England\nSeptember 6, 2007\n\nI\n\nnternational trade has long been a divisive\nissue, both in the United States and in\nother countries around the world. While\nmany, including the vast majority of economists, support free trade on the ground that it\nimproves an economy’s overall well-being, those\nwho disagree hold that it accomplishes precisely\nthe opposite: On this opposing view, trade\ndestroys jobs and lowers wages, especially among\nthe most vulnerable members of society. On its\nface, the job destruction issue cannot be correct\nfor the U.S. economy, which has clearly generated jobs to replace those lost because of imports.\nThe U.S. economy is fully employed, with an\nunemployment rate below 5 percent.\nRecent evidence suggests that the job destruction view is held by a substantial number of people. A poll taken at the end of last year by the Pew\nResearch Center for the People and the Press\nfound that, among Americans, 48 percent believed\nthat free-trade agreements led to job losses in the\nUnited States, while only 12 percent thought that\nfree-trade agreements created jobs. The poll also\nfound that 44 percent of respondents believe that\nfree trade lowers wages for American workers,\nwhile 11 percent believe it raises wages (Pew\nResearch Center for the People and the Press,\n2006). A Financial Times-Harris poll released in\nJuly of this year found similar opinions among\nmany Europeans. More than 50 percent of those\npolled in Great Britain, France, Italy and Spain\nfelt that globalization has had a negative effect\non their countries. Less than a third responded\nthat globalization has had a positive effect.\n\nPerhaps sensing a rising tide of disapproval\namong Americans, the U. S. Congress has responded\nwith a number of measures leaning toward economic isolation. In its first three months, the 110th\nCongress introduced more than a dozen pieces\nof legislation restricting trade with China\n(Aldonas et al., 2007). Since April of this year,\nboth the House of Representatives and the\nSenate have convened numerous hearings to\nexamine the economic implications of trade, especially as it relates to China.1 Congress has also\nfailed to renew the policy of trade promotion\nauthority, also known as fast-track authority,\nwhich permits the president to negotiate trade\nagreements that the Congress can either approve\nor reject, but not amend. That authority expired\non July 1 of this year.\nMy purpose today is to review some of the\nideas surrounding the debate over trade and the\nlabor market and provide an evaluation in light\nof the recent evidence on the performance of the\nU.S. economy.\nBefore proceeding, I want to emphasize that\nthe views I express here are mine and do not\nnecessarily reflect official positions of the Federal\nReserve System. I thank my colleagues at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for their comments, especially Christopher H. Wheeler,\nresearch officer, who provided special assistance.\nHowever, I retain full responsibility for errors.\n\nTHEORETICAL BACKGROUND\nThe basic principle underlying international\ntrade is this: When countries specialize in the\n\n1 The U.S. Senate held a hearing entitled “Is ‘Free Trade’ Working?” on April 18, 2007 and “U.S. Trade Relations with China” on July 25, 2007.\nThe House held a “Hearing on Legislation Related to Trade with China” on Aug. 2, 2007.\n\n1\n\n\fINTERNATIONAL TRADE AND FINANCE\n\nproduction of the goods and services they produce particularly well and trade for those they\nproduce relatively less efficiently, all countries\ncan be made better off, at least in aggregate.\nInterestingly, while most find the idea of comparative advantage and gains from trade obvious\nin the case of individuals—we are, after all, much\nbetter off specializing and trading than we would\nbe if we had to produce everything for ourselves—\nmany remain skeptical of trade’s benefits for\ncountries. This basic principle, however, applies\nto nations just as it does to individual households\nas producers and consumers.\nConsumers and workers also stand to gain\nfrom trade through increased competition. Recent\nresearch has demonstrated that, by increasing\ncompetition among producers, trade forces an\neconomy’s inefficient firms out of the market,\nthus spurring a reallocation of labor from lessproductive to more-productive employers\n(Bernard et al., 2007). Evidence of this productivity effect is also apparent in cross-country\nstudies that find that economic growth is strongly\ntied to openness to trade (Edwards, 1998).\nTrade theory also asserts, however, that within\nany given country, the gains from trade may be\nunevenly distributed. To be sure, the vast majority of individuals undoubtedly gain for the reasons\nI have just described. Yet, there will be some\nworkers who experience labor market disruptions as their jobs are eliminated due to rising\nimports or the offshoring of production facilities.\nThese individuals clearly suffer, and their losses\nin terms of job opportunities, income and morale\ncan be both substantial and long-lived.\nFor developed, capital-abundant countries\nlike the United States and the United Kingdom,\nstandard trade theory suggests that trade with\nthe developing world will have its greatest negative effect on the less-skilled because developing\neconomies such as China and India are relatively\nabundant in that type of labor. The United States,\nfor example, imports large quantities of apparel,\nfurniture and toys from China, while exporting\nsignificant quantities of civilian aircraft and\nsemi-conductors (U.S. Census Bureau, Foreign\nTrade Statistics). One of the possible labor market\n2\n\noutcomes of trade liberalization, then, is a widening of the earnings distribution in the developed\nworld. Many are rightly concerned about this\npossibility. Within recent decades, both the\nUnited States and Great Britain have seen the\nextent of inequality in their wage distributions\nincrease sharply.\nFormal trade theory does not, however,\nposit what so many in the world’s developed\neconomies seem to believe: that trade leads to\nnet job losses and lower average wages. This concern has long been raised with imports, but it has\nbeen magnified by the perceived rise in recent\nyears of offshore production, which Thomas\nFriedman describes with so many compelling\nanecdotes in his recent book, The World Is Flat.\nSome of the most recent concerns, in fact, hold\nthat the developed world’s high-wage jobs, such\nas those in business services, are now at risk of\nbeing shipped overseas.\nAre trade and offshoring destroying American\njobs and reducing wages in the United States?\nLet me begin with a brief overview of the state of\nthe U.S. labor market.\n\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE\nU.S. LABOR MARKET\nOverall, most indicators suggest that the U.S.\nlabor market is strong. Following a period of\nsluggish growth between June 2000 and August\n2003, a period that saw payroll employment in\nthe United States fall by more than 2 million, the\nU.S. economy has since created, on average,\n167,000 net new jobs per month. This figure\ntranslates into an average growth rate in the number of non-farm jobs in the U.S. of approximately\n1.6 percent per year, which is not substantially\ndifferent from the average sustained during the\nsecond half of the twentieth century. The current\nunemployment rate is below 5 percent, compared\nto an average of 6 percent over the past quarter\ncentury.\nJust looking at 2007, the numbers have not\nbeen quite as robust, but they are far from slow.\nBetween January and July of this year, the U.S.\n\n\fJobs and Trade\n\neconomy has averaged a job creation rate of\n132,000 jobs per month, or about 1.2 percent at\nan annual rate. Given that the unemployment\nrate has hovered around 4.5 percent since January,\nand has remained below 5 percent for much of\nthe last two years, the economy seems to be operating near full employment. Rather than being a\nsign of a weakening economy, the recent slowdown in the rate of job creation is almost certainly\nrelated to a slowing of labor force growth as the\nbaby-boom generation reaches retirement age.\nRecent figures on earnings are also positive.\nWithin the last 12 months, average hourly earnings in the private, non-farm sector have increased\nby nearly 4 percent in nominal terms and 1.7\npercent after accounting for inflation. This development is particularly encouraging following a\nfour-year period in which average real hourly\ncompensation showed essentially no growth.\n\nEVIDENCE ON TRADE AND JOB\nGROWTH\nThe evidence clearly points to a largely favorable labor market. Given that, over the past four\nyears, U.S. trade volumes have steadily increased,\nwith the sum of imports and exports rising from\n24.7 percent of GDP in the third quarter of 2003\nto 29 percent in the second quarter of this year,\nthe data do not support the claim that trade is\ndestroying American jobs. More precisely, U.S.\nemployment is high, despite significant job\nlosses in industries impacted by imports. Employment security is high, even though job security\nin industries affected by imports is not. In a\nstrong aggregate job market, displaced workers\nsoon find new jobs.\nA casual reading of the evidence indicates\nthat the business cycle is far more important\nthan trade in determining the rate at which the\nU.S. labor market is gaining or losing jobs. To\nexamine trends in both international trade and\nU.S. employment growth since 1995, consider\nthree periods: (i) 1995 to 1999, (ii) 2000 to 2003,\nand (iii) 2004 to the present. The first and third\nperiods are meant to represent times when both\n\nthe U.S. labor market and the economy as a\nwhole were expanding. The middle period, of\ncourse, reflects the recession and sluggish job\nmarket following the recession.\nOne of the most salient features of the data\nfrom these three periods is the strong positive\nassociation between the rate of job growth and\nthe rate of import growth. The highest rates were\nseen during the latter half of the 1990s, when\nemployment growth averaged 241,000 jobs per\nmonth, an annual rate of 2.4 percent, and the\nreal value of imports of goods and services grew\nat an average annual rate of 10.4 percent. Since\nJanuary of 2004, those rates have been somewhat\nslower, with the labor market creating 182,000\njobs per month and imports rising at an average\nannual rate of 7.2 percent.\nCompare these figures with those from our\nperiod of slow growth. Between 2000 and 2003,\nthe U.S. economy lost 5,000 jobs per month, on\naverage, and imports expanded at an annual rate\nof 4.4 percent. Such evidence, I contend, provides\nlittle support to the notion that rising imports\nhave come at the expense of U.S. jobs.\nAdditional evidence, based on more detailed\nempirical analyses, demonstrates a similar point.\nA 2004 study by Martin Baily and Robert Lawrence\nfinds that, while the U.S. was losing many manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2003, the share\nof imports in U.S. domestic spending on goods\nactually decreased from 31.8 percent to 31.4 percent (Baily and Lawrence, 2004).\nA study by economists at the Federal Reserve\nBank of New York finds that data on gross job\ndestruction show little evidence that rising trade\nlowers U.S. employment. Although the rate of\njob destruction increased during the 2001 recession, just as it typically does during economic\ndownturns, that rate has since fallen to levels\nbelow those sustained during the rapidly expanding labor market of the 1990s (Groshen et al.,\n2005).\nNone of these findings is intended to imply\nthat trade and offshore production have not had\nany negative influence on U.S. employment. The\nsame New York Fed study estimates that, over\nthe past two decades, job losses from the increas3\n\n\fINTERNATIONAL TRADE AND FINANCE\n\ningly negative net export balance might have\namounted to as much as 2.4 percent of total U.S.\nemployment in the year 2003, when the labor\nmarket was near its most recent bottom (Groshen\net al., 2005). This estimate, of course, is based\npurely on a simple calculation of how many\nAmerican jobs are represented by the U.S. net\nexport balance in goods and services. As the\nauthors of that study stress, looking at the estimated job loss by itself does not account for any\nof the likely benefits of trade, such as improved\nefficiency and higher real incomes for U.S.\nworkers, both of which may boost domestic\nemployment. In spite of this omission, their numbers still suggest that trade-related job destruction\nis minor in the context of the total U.S. labor\nmarket.\nSome may still argue that the business cycle\ndoes not fully account for the loss of manufacturing employment. After all, even though U.S.\nemployment has increased by nearly 2 million\nover the past year, the economy has lost 175,000\nmanufacturing jobs. Is it possible that trade and\noffshoring have caused these losses?\nA recent paper by the economist Ed Leamer\n(Leamer, 2007) suggests that the answer is largely\n“no.” To arrive at this conclusion, Leamer compares changes in domestic demand for goods to\nthe domestic growth of productivity and the rise\nof manufacturing imports in order to explain\nchanges in U.S. manufacturing employment. All\nelse held constant, a rise in domestic demand\nshould increase employment, whereas rising\nproductivity growth and imports should both\ndecrease it. Between 1970 and 2005, the productivity effect on durable manufacturing employment was roughly 11 times larger than the effect\nassociated with rising imports. In the non-durables\nsector, the ratio was even larger: The estimated\nproductivity effect on employment was 30 times\nthat of the effect from trade. The loss of manufacturing jobs, which has been occurring in the\nUnited States for decades, seems to have its roots\nin the growth of productivity rather than in the\nrise of imports.\nIs there any evidence that trade has harmed\nU.S. workers by destroying high-paying jobs?\n4\n\nThat is, as trade volumes have increased, have\nwe seen the distribution of jobs shift toward lower\npaying positions? If we look at some recent figures\ndescribing the growth of jobs within certain industries and occupations in the United States, we\nfind little support for this contention. Since 2004,\nthe fastest growing broad occupational category,\nboth in percentage terms as well as absolute number of jobs, was business and financial operations,\nwhich includes accountants, auditors and financial analysts. This occupation grew by more than\n13 percent between May 2004 and 2006, adding\nnearly 700,000 jobs. Sizable job gains were also\nregistered in computer and mathematical science\noccupations; healthcare practitioners; education\ntraining and library service; life, physical, and\nsocial sciences; and legal services, which collectively added nearly 1 million jobs over this same\nperiod. Median hourly earnings in each of these\noccupational groups exceed the overall U.S.\nmedian. Evidently, in a time of rising international trade, there has been strong employment\ngrowth at the upper end of the pay scale.\nCertain low-wage jobs have also shown\ngrowth. The number of jobs in food preparation,\nsuch as cooks and waiters, as well as those in\nsales, which includes cashiers and other retail\nestablishment employees, expanded by more\nthan 1.1 million between 2004 and 2006. Median\nearnings in these sectors of the American economy are below the national median. Of course,\nthe growth of these types of jobs may be related\nto the overall strength of the U.S. economy. Indeed,\nthe extent to which retail establishments and\nrestaurants are able to expand their payrolls\nlikely depends directly on overall personal\nincome growth. One of the reasons we have seen\ngrowth in low-wage sectors, then, may be the\nstrong growth of jobs in high-wage sectors.\nData covering industries over the past 12\nmonths demonstrate a similar pattern. Since\nJuly of last year, the U.S. economy has added\nnearly 1.9 million jobs, with the largest gains\ncoming in two high-wage sectors—education\nand health services, and professional and business services—and one low-wage sector—leisure\nand hospitality. Together, these three industries\n\n\fJobs and Trade\n\naccounted for nearly 70 percent of the jobs created\nover the 12 months ending July 2007.\n\nEVIDENCE ON TRADE,\nPRODUCTIVITY, AND WAGES\nWhile job growth is clearly a fundamental\nmeasure of labor-market performance, many\neconomists would underscore the growth of productivity as an even stronger gauge of an economy’s well-being. Indeed, it is largely through\nproductivity growth—the rise in the quantity of\noutput produced per unit of input used—that\nincomes and living standards improve over time.\nTrade turns out to be a significant driver of\nproductivity growth. In part, this connection is\nthe result of the fact that developed nations like\nthe United States import goods produced by relatively low-productivity sectors, such as apparel,\ntextiles and furniture, and export goods and services in relatively high-productivity sectors, including professional and business services and aircraft.\nThis pattern leads to a reallocation of labor from\nlow- to high-productivity work as employment\ndecreases in industries comparatively disadvantaged and expands in industries comparatively\nadvantaged. Evidence of this process is apparent\nin both the employment trends I have already\ndiscussed, especially the growth of professional\nand business service employment, as well as from\nresearch on plant-level dynamics. A recent study\nhas shown that, as industries in the United States\nhave seen greater import penetration from less\ndeveloped economies, producers within those\nindustries are more likely to switch to the production of more capital-intensive products. That\nis, they exit low-productivity sectors and enter\nhigh-productivity ones (Bernard et al., 2006).\nThe reallocation of labor from low- to highproductivity firms also takes place within industries. Thus, even though rising imports may\nproduce employment losses within an industry,\nsay primary or fabricated metals, workers in that\nsector tend, over time, to become concentrated\namong the most productive producers.\n\nThis process has been particularly striking\namong exporters. Although the vast majority of\nthe firms engaged in export activity in the United\nStates tend to be small in terms of total employment, more than 70 percent of the value of U.S.\nexports to the rest of the world is accounted for\nby relatively large ventures, namely those with\nmore than 500 employees (U.S. Census Bureau,\n2007). These large firms tend to be characterized\nby significant capital intensity and high levels of\nproductivity and pay higher wages, on average,\nthan their smaller counterparts. The dominant\nposition of these large producers has developed\nover time as a direct result of the reallocation of\nresources from less-efficient organizations to\nmore-efficient ones. Moreover, estimates suggest\nthat this process has delivered enormous productivity benefits to the U.S. economy. A recent\nstudy has estimated that productive reallocation\nmay account for as much as 40 percent of the\ngrowth in total factor productivity among U.S.\nmanufacturers during the 1980s and early 1990s\n(Bernard and Jensen, 2004).\n\nPOLICIES TO ADDRESS TRADE’S\nLOSERS\nAlthough their numbers are relatively small\ncompared to the size of the U.S. economy, many\nworkers have been displaced by trade. Estimates\nsuggest that, between 2000 and 2003, as many as\n300,000 service jobs (Garner, 2004) and another\n314,000 manufacturing jobs (Baily and Lawrence,\n2004) may have been lost due to trade. These\nindividuals, in many instances, experience significant losses. Studies have shown, for example,\nthat re-employment rates tend to be lower among\nworkers displaced by trade than those who are\nunemployed for other reasons (Kletzer, 2005).\nStudies also show that, among those who do\neventually find new jobs, about two-thirds earn\nless on their new job than on the job they lost\n(Kletzer, 2005).\nRather than place further limitations on\ntrade, which would surely hamper economic\ngrowth, policymakers should make sure that\n5\n\n\fINTERNATIONAL TRADE AND FINANCE\n\nworkers who are displaced by trade receive the\nassistance they need in order to find new work.\nThe United States enacted its Trade Adjustment\nAssistance program in 1962 to offer workers who\nhave been displaced by trade both income assistance and training in an effort to help them make\nthe transition to a new line of work. Certain\nworkers may, instead, opt for Alternative Trade\nAdjustment Assistance, which provides wage\ninsurance for workers who move on to jobs that\npay less than what they had received before being\ndisplaced. The United States also has two additional programs aimed at helping unemployed\nworkers find jobs: unemployment insurance (UI),\nwhich provides income support, and the Workforce Investment Act, which helps workers pay\nfor training.\nSuch programs are certainly constructive,\nbut more could probably be done to assist those\nwho have lost a job. Trade Adjustment Assistance\ncurrently covers workers who lose jobs due to\nimports of goods, but offers no coverage for\nworkers displaced by imports of services. Given\nthat the majority of the American workforce is\nemployed in services, and recent trends suggest\nthat future trade-related worker displacements\nmay come increasingly from the service sector,\nthe program should probably be expanded. There\nhave also been criticisms leveled at the operation\nof the program based on its high rate of denial,\nwhich stands at roughly a third of all applicants,\nand its rather modest size when compared to the\nvolume of trade in which the U.S. is engaged\n(Mastel, 2006). In 2004, for example, the federal\ngovernment allocated 1.3 billion dollars to the\nprogram. Although large in an absolute sense,\nthis figure is small when compared to the $1.5\ntrillion of imports and $23.6 billion collected in\ntariff revenue in that year.\nIn addition, as Chairman Bernanke noted in\nremarks three years ago, the program is confounded by the difficulty of identifying workers\nwho have been displaced by trade as opposed to\nsome other reason (Bernanke, 2004). It is also\nnot clear why workers who have been displaced\nby trade should receive greater assistance than\n6\n\nthose who have been displaced by, say, technological change. Improving programs that help all\ndisplaced workers move on to new jobs may\nhelp to persuade Americans that free trade is\nworthwhile.\nI would also like to stress two other policies\nthat are crucial to the well-being of the American\nlabor force. First, economies must continue to\npromote education at all levels, including expanding opportunities for post-secondary education.\nNot only are highly educated individuals better\nprepared to succeed in an information technology\ndominated workplace, they also experience lower\nrates of job displacement, shorter durations of\nunemployment and greater wage growth over\ntime (Bureau of Labor Statistics). Second, policymakers should continue to pursue macroeconomic\nstrategies that ensure full employment and price\nstability. As my comments earlier have indicated,\nfor countries like the United States and the\nUnited Kingdom, the employment situation is\nlargely determined by the state of the domestic\nmacroeconomy.\n\nCONCLUSION\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, many developing nations feared that opening their economies\nto trade with the more developed world would\nmake them worse off (Freeman, 1995). Yet, by\nliberalizing their trade policies, many developing\neconomies, including South Korea, Taiwan and\nChina, have experienced long periods of rapid\neconomic growth (Krueger, 2004).\nWithin recent years, a significant anti-trade\nsentiment seems to have emerged in the developed world. As policymakers, it is incumbent\nupon us to maintain a commitment to free and\nopen trade, while helping those who experience\nlosses from it find new opportunities. In doing\nso, we hope to ensure continued increases in our\nstandard of living and persuade greater numbers\nof people that trade can be beneficial for everyone.\n\n\fJobs and Trade\n\nREFERENCES\nAldonas, Grant D.; Lawrence, Robert Z. and\nSlaughter, Matthew J. “Succeeding in the Global\nEconomy: A New Policy Agenda for the American\nWorker.” Financial Services Forum Policy Research,\n2007.\nAutor, David H.; Katz, Lawrence F. and Kearney,\nMelissa S. “Trends in U.S. Wage Inequality: ReAssessing the Revisionists.” NBER Working Paper\n11627, 2005.\nBaily, Martin Neil and Lawrence, Robert Z. “What\nHappened to the Great U.S. Job Machine?

        "content": "Protecting Exports\nSouthern Governors’ Association Meeting\nSession on Regional Economic Trends\nBiloxi, Mississippi\nAugust 25, 2007\n\nW\n\nhen the invitation to speak at\nthis meeting arrived, I jumped at\nthe opportunity to accept. I am a\ngreat believer in federalism in\ngeneral. Moreover, among major national policy\ninstitutions, the Federal Reserve is probably\nbetter designed to keep in close touch with the\nstates than any other federal institution. The Fed\nhas regional roots serving a national purpose.\nI’ll not talk about monetary policy today but\ninstead about an issue of great concern to me—\nthe exports side of international trade. U.S. policy\ntoward exports is primarily a matter of export\npromotion through financing arrangements—\nsuch as the Export-Import Bank, support for trade\nfairs and negotiations of various sorts. We need a\nbroader view of exports, which is why I have\nchosen my title “Protecting Exports.” In particular, we need a deeper understanding of the critical\nimportance of foreign economic growth for U.S.\nexports and of the relationship between U.S.\nimports and U.S. exports.\nBefore proceeding, I want to emphasize that\nthe views I express here are mine and do not\nnecessarily reflect official positions of the Federal\nReserve System. I thank my colleagues at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for their comments, particularly Cletus C. Coughlin, vice\npresident and deputy director of Research, who\n1\n\nprovided special assistance. However, I retain\nfull responsibility for errors.\n\nSOME EXPORT FACTS\nInternational trade is playing an increasing\nrole in the U.S. economy. Since 1970, exports as\na share of gross domestic product (GDP) have\nabout doubled, from a bit less than 6 percent to\n11 percent in 2006. These exports consist of both\ngoods, such as industrial equipment and consumer goods, and services, such as insurance\nand financial services. For 2006, exports of goods\nwere 70 percent of total exports and exports of\nservices were 30 percent. This split has held relatively constant since the late 1980s.\nUnderlying the increase in U.S. trading\nactivity is the behavior of numerous firms.1 I\nshould stress that the discussion that follows\ndeals only with trade in goods. The number of\nfirms involved in international trade in goods is\nincreasing rapidly, and they are shipping more\nproducts to more foreign destinations than in the\npast. Exporting firms experienced relatively rapid\nemployment growth and were a major force in\nU.S. job creation. These firms exhibit a number\nof characteristics, such as relatively higher productivity and larger size, which likely contribute\n\nSee Bernard, Jensen, and Schott (2005) and Bernard, Jensen, Redding, and Schott (forthcoming). For reasons of data availability, I am restricting some of my statements to the SGA states and, thus, do not include Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands even though their governors\nare members of the Southern Governors’ Association. Nonetheless, I am confident that my general comments apply to all members of the\nSouthern Governors’ Association. Also, the export data I will be using, which are the best available, allocate exports to states based on the\nstate from which goods began their journey to the port or some other point of exit from the United States. The transportation origin of exports\nis not necessarily identical to the location where the goods were produced. Thus, despite the inclination to think that exports from a specific\nstate were produced in that state, that is not necessarily the case. Certain goods produced in one state may be counted as exports from some\nother state.\n\n1\n\n\fINTERNATIONAL TRADE AND FINANCE\n\nto their export success. Moreover, exporters tend\nto be more innovative and pay higher wages\nthan their domestic counterparts.\nData on international trade and trade-related\nemployment for the 16 member states of the\nSouthern Governors’ Association indicate that\nthere are many linkages between exporting firms\nand other firms. Firms throughout the South are\nincreasingly involved in international trade, and,\nduring recent years, exports from the South have\nincreased more rapidly than from the United\nStates as a whole. In price-adjusted terms, exports\nfrom the member states as a share of gross state\nproduct increased from 5.8 percent in 1990 to\n10.7 percent in 2006, an increase of 4.9 percentage points. Meanwhile, U.S. exports as a share of\nGDP increased from 7.8 percent to 11.4 percent,\nan increase of 3.6 percentage points. This growth\nin exports has been very beneficial to states\nthroughout the South.\nIn 2006, export shipments of merchandise\nfrom the member states totaled $385.6 billion, an\nincrease of 54.8 percent over its 2002 value. In\n2006, these exports were shipped throughout the\nworld. Not surprisingly, the two largest markets\nare Mexico ($73 billion) and Canada ($62 billion).\nIn addition to the sizes of these markets, proximity as well as the relatively free trade environment\nstemming from the North American Free Trade\nAgreement contributed to the large export shares\nof these markets. Other top export markets are\nChina, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom.\nAs you well know, exports provide numerous\nemployment opportunities. Even if we restrict our\nfocus to jobs associated with exports from the\nmanufacturing sector, it is easy to see the importance of exports. Using data for 2003, the most\nrecent available, estimates by the International\nTrade Administration indicate that slightly more\nthan 1.7 million jobs in Southern states were\nrelated to exports.2\nOf these 1.7 million jobs, 739,000 were\ndirectly in manufacturing and 983,000 were in\n\nfirms serving manufacturing firms, which suggests the importance of linkages across various\ntypes of firms. While a number of small and\nmedium-sized enterprises are exporters, numerous small and medium-sized enterprises also\nprovide goods and services to exporters, many of\nwhom are multinational corporations. These\nlinkages can create business opportunities and\nenhance the productivity of small and mediumsized enterprises.\n\nGROWTH MARKETS ABROAD\nAs foreign economies grow, the purchasing\npower of their residents increases. To tap into\nrising purchasing power abroad, U.S. firms must\nprovide goods and services desired by these\npotential consumers. A sensible export strategy\nis to focus attention on foreign countries that are\ngrowing the most rapidly.\nU.S. export growth to a country and the\ngrowth of that foreign country are closely related.\nWhen we examine export growth from 2002-2006\nand the top 50 U.S. export destinations in 2006,\nwe find a high correlation (0.63 for the United\nStates as a whole and 0.51 for Southern States)\nbetween export growth and income growth\nabroad. Southern states’ exports to China and\nIndia grew rapidly between 2002 and 2006, by a\nfactor of nearly three to both China and India.\nNumerous examples can be provided of how\ngrowth abroad is providing opportunities for\nfirms based in the South. Consider an example\nfrom Arkansas. A Springdale, Arkansas, company,\nJV Manufacturing, is providing technology for\nhydraulic compactors that smash refuse before it\nis taken to a landfill.3 Currently, these compactors\nare being used in Huaibei, China. Plans are in the\nworks to export the technology to other regions\nof China. This example involving growth and\ntrash suggests a plethora of other opportunities.\nUndoubtedly, given China’s environmental problems, U.S. firms with environmentally friendly\n\n2\n\nSee www.ita.doc.gov/td/industry/OTEA/jobs/Reports/2003/jobs_by_percentciv_totals.html.\n\n3\n\nSee Morasch (2006).\n\n2\n\n\fProtecting Exports\n\ntechnology, as well as firms involved in clean-up\noperations, should prosper.\nThe consequences of economic growth are\nbeing felt by PowerCurbers Inc., a manufacturer\nof equipment used in making concrete curbs and\npaving.4 This firm, based in Salisbury, North\nCarolina, is experiencing large increases in\ndemand, especially from buyers in China, India\nand Vietnam. Investment in the infrastructure\nneeded for transportation services is a critical\nfactor for economic growth.\nEconomic growth in conjunction with a freetrade agreement has provided a number of export\nopportunities for Southern firms in Chile. For\nexample, Wikoff Color Corporation, located in\nFort Mill, South Carolina, recently signed a contract in Chile to provide inks and coatings used\nin the production of scratch-off lottery tickets\nand prepaid phone cards.5 Meanwhile, Impex,\nlocated in Paducah, Kentucky, has experienced\nlarge increases in conveyor systems used in mining in Chile.6\nAnother consequence of economic growth is\nincreased demand for food products. Increases\nin income from low levels invariably lead to\nincreased demand for animal protein. Chicken,\npork and beef are all exported from Arkansas to\nChina.7 Tyson Foods exported the majority of\nfrozen chicken cuts, which is the leading food\nexport from Arkansas to China. We could multiply these examples many times over.\nWhat these examples illustrate is that economic growth provides export opportunities and\nthat these export opportunities come in numerous areas. The key role that income growth plays\nin international trade also suggests that, from a\nnational perspective, exports and imports are\nlinked. One linkage is as follows: Foreign income\ngrowth affects U.S. exports, which help to determine U.S. income and, therefore, imports. Consequently, changes that affect exports will affect\n4\n\nSee Tannenbaum (2006).\n\n5\n\nSee www.buyusa.gov/southcarolina/wikoffcolor.html.\n\n6\n\nSee Tompkins (2005).\n\n7\n\nSee Smith (2007).\n\nimports and vice versa. Thus, actions that limit\nU.S. imports will also tend to reduce U.S. exports\nbecause they depress income growth abroad.\nFew people seem to understand that raising\nimport barriers will tend to reduce export opportunities. Countries with high trade barriers and\nrelatively low levels of imports will also have\nrelatively low levels of exports.\n\nTRADE WAR DANGERS\nLet’s look more closely at the finding that\nexporting firms have relatively higher productivity than non-exporting firms do. Research suggests the conclusion that higher productivity is a\nrequirement for, rather than a consequence of,\nengaging in international trade. A possible reason\nfor the requirement of high productivity is that\nthe high entry costs of becoming an exporter can\nonly be borne profitably by the most efficient\nfirms.\nInterestingly, research has shown that after\nfirms enter export markets they do experience\nfaster growth of employment and output than\nnon-exporters do. Reduced barriers will induce\nmore firms to export. Increased exports in turn\nwould generate an increased demand for labor\nand, therefore, higher wages. Low-productivity\nnon-exporting firms would be forced to exit the\nindustry and both capital and labor would be\nreallocated from the less productive non-export\nfirms to the more productive exporting firms,\nincreasing average productivity and average\nwages.\nThe productivity facts relating to exporting\nfirms suggest an important role for trade liberalization in improving the aggregate productivity\nof the economy. Productivity gains stemming\nfrom trade liberalization allow for increases in\noutput and income. Recent research indicates\n\n3\n\n\fINTERNATIONAL TRADE AND FINANCE\n\nthat the payoff to the United States of liberalization of trade and international investment has\nbeen quite large.8 Based on several different statistical approaches, the estimated payoff ranged\nfrom 7.3 percent to 13.2 percent of U.S. GDP in\n2003. Using 2006 dollars, these estimates suggest\na higher per capita income in the United States\nranging from $3,000 to $5,434. These are not\nsmall effects.\nThe preceding reasoning, supported by\nempirical estimates, implies that negotiations\nthat reduce trade barriers can be very beneficial.9\nConversely, legislation that imposes trade barriers\nwill likely be harmful. To my disappointment, as\nI survey the current state of trade negotiations\nand numerous legislative proposals, I am troubled\nthat the direction of trade policy in the immediate\nfuture may not be the right one. Let me give you\na few of the many reasons that create my concern.\nFirst, fast-track negotiating authority expired\non June 30. This authority allows the president\nto negotiate trade agreements that Congress can\neither accept or reject, but cannot amend or filibuster. The lack of fast-track authority matters\nbecause trading partners are extremely reluctant\nto negotiate with the United States when experience indicates, unfortunately, that agreements\nmay be substantially altered during the legislative process.\nSecond, the Doha Development Agenda multilateral trade negotiations appear to be on the\nverge of collapse. A collapse of the Doha round\nwould raise doubts about the future effectiveness\nof the World Trade Organization, which is the\nkey international organization for negotiating,\nimplementing and enforcing multilateral trade\nagreements.\nThird, many in the United States seem to\nfavor a more confrontational approach with the\nChinese, despite the fact that China is a huge\nmarket with rapid growth in purchases of U.S.\n\ngoods.10 Frankly, I do not understand the strategy\nof attacking a very large, rapidly growing customer. China is an increasingly frequent target\nfor anti-dumping actions. In international trade\nlaw, “dumping” is said to occur when a firm sells\na product at a higher price in its home market\nthan the price it charges when it exports the same\nproduct to another country. If U.S. manufacturers\ncan establish that they are being harmed by dumping on this definition, then duties (i.e., import\ntaxes) are imposed to counteract the extent of\nthe dumping. The illogic of antidumping laws is\nclear: Would we prefer that U.S. consumers pay\nhigher prices than charged abroad? Would U.S.\nconsumers be harmed in the most extreme possible “dumping” scenario in which they received\ngoods from abroad for free?\nCurrently, the Chinese share of anti-dumping\nactions is nearly double its share of U.S. imports.\nMoreover, in March 2007, the Commerce Department began applying anti-subsidy laws to China.\nThis action reversed 23 years of policy and led\nto filings that China has illegally subsidized\nexports of tires, paper bags, steel pipes and steel\nnails. These legal actions are anti-consumer.\nThe U.S. is also pursuing complaints against\nChina within the World Trade Organization. The\nU.S. trade representative has initiated four cases\nagainst China, which is more than against any\nother country at this time. The charges include\nillegally high Chinese tariffs on automobile parts\nimported from the United States. U.S. pressure\nto reduce barriers for U.S. exports should ideally\nencourage a more open world trading system;\nhowever, the prospects for successful negotiations\ndim when, simultaneously, the United States is\nimposing import barriers.\nSome U.S. legislative proposals seem to be\nbased on a presumption that trade retaliation is\nan effective strategy; however, economic history\nsuggests otherwise. Rather than passive compli-\n\n8\n\nSee Bradford, Grieco, and Hufbauer (2006).\n\n9\n\nBradford, Grieco, and Hufbauer (2006) conservatively estimate that global free trade would produce higher per capita income ranging from\n$1,540 to $2,069 using 2003 dollars or from $1,679 to $2,255 using 2006 dollars.\n\n10\n\nSee Weisman (2007).\n\n4\n\n\fProtecting Exports\n\nance with trade restrictions, the targeted country\ntends to retaliate. Successive rounds of retaliation\ncan spiral into a trade war. Actually, the process\nshould be called “an anti-trade war.” Restriction\nof a country’s exports forces it to reorient its\neconomy toward alternative suppliers and markets. Such a reorientation is facilitated by the\nfact that a trade retaliation policy tends to expand\nthe role of government in the targeted country. In\nthe present case, U.S. interests are likely best\nserved by an increasing role for individual consumers and firms in a more market-oriented\nChinese economy.\nA tragic episode from economic history provides additional reasons for my concerns about\nthe future course of trade policy. The Great\nDepression was a global catastrophe. Most\nresearchers agree that the Smoot-Hawley tariffs\nof 1930 precipitated retaliation and likely worsened the effects of the Great Depression by contributing to the collapse of trade throughout the\nworld in the early 1930s. An all-out trade war\nseems unlikely today, but a series of smaller barriers inflicting economic costs on a trading partner\nhas the possibility of inflicting harm far beyond\nthe original target. I am very uncomfortable with\nthe numerous actions and proposed legislation\nthat not only are unlikely to affect the large U.S.\ntrade deficit but also are increasing the chances\nof escalating trade frictions. Escalating trade frictions have the potential to hinder international\ntrade and economic prosperity both here and\nabroad.\nThere is a role, of course, for protecting U.S.\nconsumers from unsafe products, but this role\nshould not depend on whether goods are produced in the United States or abroad. A key principle is that identical standards that address\ngenuine safety issues be applied to a good regardless of where it is produced. One unfortunate\npossibility is that product safety issues become\npart of a trade war. For example, recently the\nUnited States suspended some Chinese seafood\nimports after finding traces of cancer-causing\n11\n\nchemicals. Shortly thereafter, the Chinese suspended imports of chicken feet, pig ears and\nother animal products from seven U.S. companies.11 The Chinese justification for their action\nwas that the products contained bacteria as well\nas residues of drugs and pesticides. There is no\nreason why the two countries should not work\ncooperatively on a food inspection program to\nserve their common interests in high-quality food.\n\nCONCLUDING COMMENTS\nThe U.S. economy is fully employed; the\nunemployment rate has been below 5 percent\nsince December 2005, compared to an average\nrate of 6 percent over the past quarter century.\nGiven that the United States does not have a\nhigh unemployment rate, we need to focus less\non creating more jobs and more on creating better\njobs. Better jobs require more productive workers\nand pay higher wages.\nGrowth in U.S. exports in coming years will\nplay a critical role in creating better jobs. U.S.\nexporting firms on average enjoy higher productivity than those that sell only into the U.S.\ninternal market. Because export opportunities\nare especially great to countries abroad that are\ngrowing rapidly, we need to encourage that\ngrowth, or at least not interfere with it. Imports\ninto the United States from high-growth countries help to encourage growth abroad. We have\na common interest with all the countries of the\nworld in promoting trade liberalization. Increasing liberalization is central to creating better jobs\naround the world, including here at home. In\nour approaches to trade issues, we need to shift\nattention from protecting workers against imports\nto protecting exports. That will be the key to a\nmore prosperous future.\n\nREFERENCES\nBernard, Andrew B.; Jensen, J.

        "content": "U.S. Export Opportunities\nArkansas Minority Business Development Roundtable\nLittle Rock, Arkansas\nAugust 17, 2007\n\nI\n\nn discussions about international trade,\nwe hear a lot more about imports than\nabout exports, which is why I have chosen\nto discuss exports. My focus will be on\nthe opportunities provided by a trading environment that is free of unnecessary governmentally\nimposed barriers. Such an environment is ideal\nnot only for providing opportunities for U.S.\nexporters but also for maximizing economic\nprospects throughout the United States. In light\nof the recent news of unsafe products that have\nbeen imported from China—melamine-laced pet\nfood, lead-tainted toys, antifreeze-tainted counterfeit toothpaste, antibiotic-tainted fish and treadseparating tires to name a few—I want to stress\nthat there is a role for government in protecting\nU.S. consumers from unsafe products. My concern is that certain groups will attempt to use concerns over safety and job loss to restrict imports\nand thereby pursue an agenda of economic isolation in an increasingly globalized world.\nMy key points can be made rather succinctly.\nFirst, limiting imports into the United States tends\nto also reduce exports. Second, economic growth\nabroad provides export opportunities for U.S.\nfirms. The benefits of expanding exports are not\nrestricted solely to exporters. Third, the citizens\nof Arkansas have gained much from international\ntrade, and the benefits will increase in the future\nprovided we can maintain an open trading environment. Fourth, trade disputes are a natural\nconsequence of a dynamic international environment. It is easy for retaliatory trade measures to\nescalate and derail the desirable movement to a\nmore open trading environment. It is in the best\ninterests of all the countries of the world to\navoid trade wars.\n\nBefore proceeding, I want to emphasize that\nthe views I express here are mine and do not\nnecessarily reflect official positions of the Federal\nReserve System. I thank my colleagues at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for their comments, particularly Cletus C. Coughlin, vice\npresident and deputy director of research, who\nprovided special assistance. However, I retain\nfull responsibility for errors.\n\nSOME FACTS ABOUT U.S.\nEXPORTS\nInternational trade is playing an increasing\nrole in the U.S. economy. Since 1970, exports as\na share of gross domestic product (GDP) have\nabout doubled, from a bit less than 6 percent to\n11 percent in 2006 (see Figure 1). These exports\nconsist of both goods, such as industrial equipment and consumer goods, and services, such as\ninsurance and financial services. For 2006, exports\nof goods were 70 percent of total exports and\nexports of services were 30 percent. This split\nhas held relatively constant since the late 1980s.\nSome additional insight into the increasing\nrole of international trade can be gleaned by\nadjusting exports and GDP for the impact of price\nchanges. Beginning in the early 1970s until the\nearly 1980s, export prices tended to rise at a much\nfaster rate than the overall price level as measured\nby the GDP deflator (see Figure 2). Primarily\nbecause of relatively rapid productivity growth,\nfor roughly the next 20 years, export prices\nincreased very little, especially relative to prices\ngenerally. Price-adjusted, or real, exports increased\nrapidly during the late 1980s and the 1990s rela1\n\n\fINTERNATIONAL TRADE AND FINANCE\n\nFigure 1\nNominal Exports as a Percent of GDP, 1947 to 2006\n15\n\nEX/GDP\n\nPercent\n\n10\n\n2004\n\n1998\n\n2001\n\n1995\n\n1992\n\n1986\n\n1989\n\n1983\n\n1980\n\n1977\n\n1974\n\n1971\n\n1968\n\n1965\n\n1962\n\n1959\n\n1956\n\n1953\n\n1950\n\n0\n\n1947\n\n5\n\nSOURCE: BEA, Haver Analytics.\n\nFigure 2\nExports Price Index and GDP Deflator, 1947 to 2006 (2000 = 100)\n(2000=100)\n\n130\n\nGDP Deflator\n\n70\n\nSOURCE: BEA, Haver Analytics.\n\n2\n\n2004\n\n2001\n\n1998\n\n1995\n\n1992\n\n1989\n\n1986\n\n1983\n\n1980\n\n1977\n\n1974\n\n1971\n\n1968\n\n1965\n\n1956\n\n1953\n\n1950\n\n1947\n\n10\n\n1962\n\nExports Price Index\n\n40\n\n1959\n\nIndex\n\n100\n\n\fU.S. Export Opportunities\n\nFigure 3\nReal Exports as a Percent of GDP, 1947 to 2006\n15\n\nEX/GDP\n\n2004\n\n1998\n\n2001\n\n1995\n\n1989\n\n1992\n\n1986\n\n1983\n\n1980\n\n1977\n\n1974\n\n1971\n\n1968\n\n1962\n\n1965\n\n1959\n\n1953\n\n1956\n\n0\n\n1950\n\n5\n\n1947\n\nPercent\n\n10\n\nSOURCE: BEA, Haver Analytics.\n\ntive to real GDP (see Figure 3). After the recession\nearly in this decade, the rapid increase in real\nexports relative to real GDP resumed.\nUnderlying the increases in U.S. trading\nactivity is the behavior of numerous firms.\nAlthough I will confine my discussion to trade\nin goods, trade in services is important and a\nworthy topic for a future speech.\nIn recent years, researchers have generated a\nnumber of facts about exporting firms.1 The number of firms involved in international trade in\ngoods is increasing rapidly, and they are shipping\nmore products to more foreign destinations than\nin the past. Exporting firms experienced relatively\nrapid employment growth and were a major force\nin U.S. job creation.\nDespite rapid growth in recent years, plants\nand firms directly involved in exporting represent\na small percentage of the total number of U.S.\nplants and firms. In 2000, for example, of the 5.5\nmillion firms operating in the United States,\nroughly 4 percent were exporters. These firms,\nalthough relatively small in number, employ over\none-third of the U.S. workforce. Furthermore, a\n1\n\nsubset of these firms does the bulk of the trading.\nFor example, in 2000, the top 10 percent of\nexporting firms accounted for 96 percent of total\nU.S. exports. These firms exhibit a number of\ncharacteristics, such as relatively higher productivity and larger size, which likely contribute to\ntheir export success. Moreover, exporters tend to\nbe more innovative and pay higher wages than\ntheir domestic counterparts.\nNot surprisingly, goods-producing firms\naccount for the majority of exports (and imports)\nby value, although increasing numbers of firms\nin wholesale and retail trade are engaging in international trade. Table 1 highlights some features\nof the distribution of exporting firms across 10\nmanufacturing industries, ranked in terms of\nindustry employment as a share of total manufacturing in 2002. Across all industries, firms’\nforeign shipments represent only a small share\nof total shipments, as they never exceed 21 percent. In manufacturing as a whole, only 18 percent\nof firms were exporters in 2002, with exports\naccounting for 14 percent of total shipments.\n\nSee Bernard, Jensen, and Schott (2005) and Bernard, Jensen, Redding, and Schott (forthcoming).\n\n3\n\n\fINTERNATIONAL TRADE AND FINANCE\n\nTable 1\nFirms That Trade\n\nSOURCE: Source: Bernard et al., “Firms in International Trade,” from the 2002 Census of Manufacturers.\nNAICS=North American Industry Classification System.\n\nWhile my preceding comments refer to firms\nthat are trading goods, I would like to highlight\nthe linkages between firms directly engaged in\ninternational trade and those that are linked to\nsuch firms. While a number of small and mediumsized enterprises are exporters, numerous small\nand medium-sized enterprises are also linked\nvia outsourcing, technology transfer and training\nof local suppliers to multinational corporations.\nThese linkages can create business opportunities\nand enhance the productivity of small and\nmedium-sized enterprises.\nData on international trade and trade-related\nemployment for Arkansas indicate that there are\nundoubtedly many linkages between exporting\nfirms and other firms. Before discussing exports\nfrom Arkansas, I need to provide a note of caution.\nThe export data I will be using, which are the\nbest available, allocate exports to states based on\nthe state from which goods began their journey\n4\n\nto the port or some other point of exit from the\nUnited States. The transportation origin of exports\nis not necessarily identical to the location where\nthe goods were produced. Thus, despite the inclination to think that exports from Arkansas were\nproduced in Arkansas, that is not necessarily the\ncase. Certain goods produced in Arkansas may\nbe counted as exports from some other state.\nKeeping this note of caution in mind, the\nextent of Arkansas’s involvement in international\ntrade appears somewhat lower than that of the\nnation as a whole; however, Figure 4 indicates\nthat firms in Arkansas are increasingly involved\nin international trade and that the increase during\nrecent years has tended to mirror that of the United\nStates as a whole. In price-adjusted terms, exports\nfrom Arkansas as a share of gross state product\nincreased from 2.4 percent in 1990 to 6.1 percent\nin 2006, an increase of 3.7 percentage points.\nMeanwhile, U.S. exports as a share of GDP\n\n\fU.S. Export Opportunities\n\nFigure 4\nAR State Exports and U.S. Exports as a Percent of Real GSP, 1990-2006\n15\n\n10\nP ercent\n\nU.S.\n\n5\n\n2 00 5\n\n2 00 2\n\n1 99 9\n\n1 99 6\n\n1 99 3\n\n1 99 0\n\n0\n\nAR\n\nSOURCE: WISER Trade, BEA, and Haver Analytics.\n\nincreased from 7.8 percent to 11.4 percent, an\nincrease of 3.6 percentage points. These growth\nrates are significant and, if projected forward,\nshow that exports will become increasingly important for the Arkansas and national economies.\nIn 2006, Arkansas’ export shipments of merchandise totaled $4.3 billion, an increase of 52\npercent over its 2002 value.2 In 2006, these\nexports were shipped to 159 foreign destinations.\nFigure 5 provides a summary view of these destinations and the magnitude of exports. The two\nlargest markets are Canada ($1.1 billion) and\nMexico ($528 million). In addition to the sizes of\nthese markets, proximity as well as the relatively\nfree trade environment stemming from the North\nAmerican Free Trade Agreement contributed to\nthe large export shares of these markets. Other top\nexport markets are France, the United Kingdom,\nChina, Portugal, Japan, South Korea, Germany,\nand Russia.\nTurning to specific industries, Figure 6 provides a view of the export shares of specific indus2\n\ntries. Transportation equipment is the largest\nexport category, accounting for 28 percent, or\n$1.2 billion, of Arkansas’ merchandise exports\nin 2006. Other leading export categories were\nchemical manufactures, machinery manufactures,\nprocessed foods and primary metal manufactures.\nWith regard to employment related to manufactured goods exports, Arkansas’ involvement\nis also slightly below the nation as a whole. Using\ndata for 2003, the most recent available, estimates\nby the International Trade Administration indicate that 43,100 jobs in Arkansas were related\nto exports. Of these jobs, 18,400 were in the\nmanufacturing sector, while 24,700 were in nonmanufacturing sectors. These data show the\nimportance of linkages across various types of\nfirms. Manufacturing-related export employment\nas a share of private sector employment in\nArkansas was 4.3 percent, slightly below the\nnational average of 4.5 percent. Thus, slightly\nmore than one of every 25 jobs in Arkansas was\nlinked to manufactured exports.\n\nFor a summary of Arkansas’ international involvement, see www.ita.doc.gov/td/industry/otea/state%5Freports/arkansas.html.\n\n5\n\n\fINTERNATIONAL TRADE AND FINANCE\n\nFigure 5\nGlobal Pattern of Arkansas 2006 Exports ($ USD)\n\nSOURCE: TradeStatsExpress.

These firms\naccounted for 19 percent of Arkansas’ merchandise exports in 2005.\n\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF FOREIGN\nINCOME GROWTH FOR\nEXPORTS\nIncreases in international trade depend on\nincome growth and changes in the costs of international trade. Some trade costs reflect barriers\nimposed by governments and some are the result\nof nature. A tariff, which is a tax imposed on\nimported goods, is an example of the former,\nwhile transportation cost is an example of the\nlatter. When two researchers examined the relative importance of income growth, reductions in\ngovernment barriers to trade and declines in transportation costs, they found that income growth\nwas the most important of these three factors\nstimulating trade worldwide, with reductions in\ntrade barriers a distant second and declines in\ntransportation costs an even more distant third.3\nThis ranking, though, reflects experience over two\nparticular periods in the latter half of the 20th\ncentury—the analysis uses the average trade of\n1958-1960 and 1986-1988. We should not forget\nthat trade barriers were critically important in\ndepressing trade at certain times in the past, especially during the Great Depression, and could\nbe so again should the United States become\ninvolved in trade wars.\nAs foreign economies grow, the purchasing\npower of its residents increases. To tap into rising\npurchasing power abroad, U.S. firms must provide goods and services desired by these potential\nconsumers. A sensible export strategy is to focus\n3\n\nSee Baier and Bergstrand (2001).\n\n4\n\nSee Morasch (2006).\n\n5\n\nSee Smith (2007).\n\nattention on foreign countries that are growing\nthe most rapidly.\nU.S. export growth to a country and the\ngrowth of that foreign country are closely related.\nWhen we examine export growth from 2002 to\n2006 and the top 50 U.S. export destinations in\n2006, we find that the simple correlation between\nexport growth and income growth is 0.63. Given\nthis high correlation, it is not surprising that U.S.\nexports to China and India, two rapidly growing\ncountries, increased at a rapid pace between 2002\nand 2006. U.S. exports to each of these countries\nincreased by a factor of roughly 2.5, which is\nsubstantially greater than the 1.5 factor by which\noverall U.S. exports increased. As with the United\nStates as a whole, Arkansas’ exports to China\nand India grew rapidly between 2002 and 2006.\nIn fact, Arkansas’ exports increased more rapidly\nthan for the total United States—by a factor of 4\nto China and by a factor of 7.3 to India. Arkansas’\ntotal exports to all destinations abroad increased\nby a factor of 1.5.\nConsider an example of how China’s growing\neconomy is providing opportunities for firms\nbased in Arkansas. An inevitable consequence of\neconomic growth is trash. A Springdale, Arkansas\ncompany, JV Manufacturing, is providing technology for hydraulic compactors that smash the\nrefuse before it is taken to a landfill.4 Currently,\nthese compactors are being used in Huaibei,\nChina. Plans are in the works to export the technology to other regions of China.\nAnother consequence of economic growth is\nincreased demand for food products. Increases\nin income from low levels invariably lead to\nincreased demand for animal protein. Chicken,\npork and beef are all exported from Arkansas to\nChina.5 Tyson Foods exported the majority of\nfrozen chicken cuts, which is the leading food\nexport from Arkansas to China.\nThe key role that income growth plays in\ninternational trade suggests that, from a national\n\n7\n\n\fINTERNATIONAL TRADE AND FINANCE\n\nperspective, exports and imports are linked. One\nlinkage is as follows: Foreign income growth\naffects U.S. exports, which help to determine U.S.\nincome and, therefore, imports. Consequently,\nchanges that affect exports will affect imports and\nvice versa. Thus, actions that limit U.S. imports\nwill also tend to reduce U.S. exports because they\ndepress income growth abroad. Few people seem\nto understand that raising import barriers will\ntend to reduce export opportunities. Countries\nwith high trade barriers and relatively low levels\nof imports will also have relatively low levels of\nexports.\n\nTHE CURRENT POLITICAL\nECONOMY OF INTERNATIONAL\nTRADE\nEarlier in my presentation I discussed some\nkey findings concerning firms that export. I’ll\nreturn to one of these findings and then use it as\na foundation for a brief discussion of trade policy.\nLet’s look more closely at the finding that exporting firms have relatively higher productivity\nthan non-exporting firms do.\nResearch shows that the higher productivity\nof exporting firms relative to non-trading firms\nexists even before they enter export markets.\nFurthermore, the productivity of exporting firms\nafter they enter export markets does not grow more\nrapidly than the productivity of non-exporting\nfirms. The conclusion is that higher productivity\nis a requirement for, rather than a consequence\nof, engaging in international trade. A possible\nreason for the requirement of high productivity\nis that high entry costs of becoming an exporter\ncan only be borne profitably by the most efficient\nfirms.\nInterestingly, research has shown that after\nfirms enter export markets they do experience\nfaster growth of employment and output than\nnon-exporters do. A reduction in trade barriers\n\nwould increase profit opportunities from exporting to a specific destination and would reduce\nthe initial productivity level necessary to enter\nthe export market. Reduced barriers will induce\nmore firms to export. Increased exports in turn\nwould generate an increased demand for labor\nand, therefore, higher wages. Low-productivity\nnon-exporting firms would be forced to exit the\nindustry, and both capital and labor would be\nreallocated from the less productive non-export\nfirms to the more productive exporting firms,\nincreasing average productivity. Because the\nreallocation of productive factors is found to\noccur both within and across industries, this\nprocess creates aggregate productivity gains.\nThe productivity facts relating to exporting\nfirms suggest an important role for trade liberalization in improving the aggregate productivity\nof the economy. Productivity gains stemming\nfrom trade liberalization allow for increases in\noutput and income. Recent research indicates\nthat the payoff to the United States of liberalization of trade and international investment has\nbeen quite large.6 Based on several different statistical approaches, the estimated payoff ranged\nfrom 7.3 percent to 13.2 percent of U.S. GDP in\n2003. Using 2006 dollars, these estimates suggest\na higher per capita income in the United States\nranging from $3,000 to $5,436. These are not\nsmall effects.\nThe preceding reasoning, supported by\nempirical estimates, implies that negotiations\nthat reduce trade barriers can be very beneficial.7\nConversely, legislation that imposes trade barriers\nwill likely be harmful. To my disappointment, as\nI survey the current state of trade negotiations\nand numerous legislative proposals, I am troubled\nthat the direction of trade policy in the immediate future may not be the right one. Let me give\nyou four examples that create my concern.\nFirst, fast-track negotiating authority expired\non June 30. This authority allows the president\nto negotiate trade agreements that Congress can\n\n6\n\nSee Bradford, Grieco, and Hufbauer (2006).\n\n7\n\nBradford, Grieco, and Hufbauer (2006) conservatively estimate that global free trade would produce higher per capita income ranging from\n$1,540 to $2,069 using 2003 dollars or from $1,635 to $2,255 using 2006 dollars.\n\n8\n\n\fU.S. Export Opportunities\n\neither accept or reject, but cannot amend or filibuster. The lack of fast-track authority matters\nbecause trading partners are extremely reluctant\nto negotiate with the United States when experience indicates, unfortunately, that agreements\nmay be substantially altered during the legislative\nprocess.\nSecond, the Doha Development Agenda\nmultilateral trade negotiations are on the verge\nof collapse. A collapse of the Doha round would\nraise doubts about the future effectiveness of\nthe World Trade Organization, which is the key\ninternational organization for negotiating,\nimplementing and enforcing multilateral trade\nagreements.\nThird, many in the United States seem to\nfavor a more confrontational approach with the\nChinese.8 China is an increasingly frequent target\nfor anti-dumping actions. In international trade\nlaw, “dumping” is said to occur when a firm sells\na product at a higher price in its home market\nthan the price it charges when it exports the same\nproduct to another country. If U.S. manufacturers\ncan establish that they are being harmed by dumping on this definition, then duties (i.e., import\ntaxes) are imposed to counteract the calculated\nextent of the dumping. The illogic of anti-dumping laws is clear: Would we prefer that U.S. consumers pay higher prices than charged abroad?\nWould U.S. consumers be harmed in the most\nextreme possible “dumping” scenario in which\nthey received goods from abroad for free?\nCurrently, the Chinese share of anti-dumping\nactions is nearly double its share of U.S. imports.\nMoreover, in March 2007, the Commerce Department began applying anti-subsidy laws to China.\nThis action reversed 23 years of policy and led\nto filings that China has illegally subsidized\nexports of tires, paper bags, steel pipes and steel\nnails. These legal actions are anti-consumer.\nThe U.S. is also pursuing complaints against\nChina within the World Trade Organization. The\nU.S. trade representative has initiated four cases\nagainst China, which is more than against any\nother country at this time. The charges include\n8\n\nillegally high Chinese tariffs on automobile parts\nimported from the United States. U.S. pressure\nto reduce barriers for U.S. exports should ideally\nencourage a more open world trading system;\nhowever, the prospects for successful negotiations\ndim when, simultaneously, the United States is\nitself imposing import barriers.\nSome U.S. legislative proposals seem to be\nbased on a presumption that trade retaliation is\nan effective strategy; however, economic history\nsuggests otherwise. Rather than passive compliance with trade restrictions, the targeted country\ntends to retaliate. Successive rounds of retaliation\ncan spiral into a trade war. Actually, the process\nshould be called “an anti-trade war.” Restriction\nof a country’s exports forces it to reorient its economy toward alternative suppliers and markets.\nSuch a reorientation is facilitated by the fact that\na trade retaliation policy tends to expand the\nrole of government in the targeted country. In the\npresent case, U.S. interests are likely best served\nby an increasing role for individual consumers\nand firms in a more market-oriented Chinese\neconomy.\nA tragic episode from economic history provides additional reasons for my concerns about\nthe future course of trade policy. The Great\nDepression was a global catastrophe. Most\nresearchers agree that the Smoot-Hawley tariffs\nof 1930 precipitated retaliation and likely worsened the effects of the Great Depression by contributing to the collapse of trade throughout the\nworld in the early 1930s. An all-out trade war\nseems unlikely today but a series of smaller barriers inflicting economic costs on a trading partner\nhas the possibility of inflicting harm far beyond\nthe original target. I am very uncomfortable with\nthe numerous actions and proposed legislation\nthat not only are unlikely to affect the large U.S.\ntrade deficit but also are increasing the chances\nof escalating trade frictions.\nThere is a role, of course, for protecting U.S.\nconsumers from unsafe products but this role\nshould not depend on whether goods are produced in the United States or abroad. A key\n\nSee Weisman (2007).\n\n9\n\n\fINTERNATIONAL TRADE AND FINANCE\n\nprinciple is that identical standards that address\ngenuine safety issues be applied to a good regardless of where it is produced. One unfortunate\npossibility is that product safety issues become\npart of a trade war. For example, recently the\nUnited States suspended some Chinese seafood\nimports after finding traces of cancer-causing\nchemicals. Shortly thereafter, the Chinese suspended imports of chicken feet, pig ears and other\nanimal products from seven U.S. companies, one\nof which was Tyson Foods.9 The Chinese justification for their action was that the products contained bacteria as well as residues of drugs and\npesticides. There is no reason why the two countries should not work cooperatively on a food\ninspection program to serve their common interests in high-quality food.\nSomewhat ironically, the recent problems\ninvolving defective Chinese goods, produced for\nChinese as well as foreign consumers, highlight\nan important fact. Rather than being overtaken by\nproduction sourced in China, it is clear that in\nnumerous industries U.S. firms are substantially\nahead of Chinese firms. Moreover, significant\nparts of the services sector as well as high-tech\nmanufacturing have yet to appear in China.\nUndoubtedly, given China’s environmental problems, U.S. firms with environmentally friendly\ntechnology as well as firms involved in clean-up\noperations should prosper. Assuming a trading\nenvironment relatively free of barriers, U.S. firms\nwill have an opportunity to use their advantages\nto serve the Chinese market.\n\nCONCLUDING COMMENTS\nU.S. exporters are formidable competitors in\ninternational markets and can become even more\nformidable competitors in an international trading\nenvironment as free as possible of governmentally\nimposed barriers. The increasing involvement in\nmarkets globally serves the best interests of U.S.\nresidents, both as consumers and as workers. In\nterms of income, the payoffs from prior liberal9\n\nSee Irvin (2007).\n\n10\n\nizations of trade and investment flows have been\nquite large. I am certain that actions hindering\nentry of U.S. innovators and entrepreneurs in\nglobal markets will ultimately prove harmful to\neconomic well-being in Arkansas and the United\nStates generally. Thus, we should all be concerned\nabout the current lack of progress in liberalizing\ntrade flows and the increasing threat of legislation tending toward economic isolation. Such\nactions, if they occur, will depress exports in the\nfuture from Arkansas and the United States as a\nwhole. More importantly, governmental actions\nthat depress exports will ultimately harm U.S.\nincome prospects by inhibiting productivity and\nincome growth.\n\nREFERENCES\nBaier, Scott L. and Bergstrand, Jeffrey H. “The Growth\nof World Trade: Tariffs, Transport Costs, and Income\nSimilarity.” Journal of International Economics,\nFebruary 2001, 53(1), pp. 1-27.\nBernard, Andrew B.; Jensen, J.

        "content": "Milton and Money Stock Control\nMilton Friedman Luncheon\nCo-sponsored by the Department of Economics, University of Missouri,\nthe Economic and Policy Analysis Research Center, and the Show-Me Institute\nUniversity of Missouri–Columbia\nColumbia, Missouri\nJuly 31, 2007\n\nW\n\ne are here today on Milton\nFriedman’s birthday to remember\nhim and his enormous contributions. Those of us who studied\nunder him are extraordinarily fortunate. Most of\nus were able to maintain contact with him for\nthe years between our studies and his death.\nIf Milton were here today there is nothing he\nwould enjoy more than a lively seminar on some\naspect of economics. A lively seminar is what I\nintend to offer. I’m pretty sure that what I’m going\nto say would have provoked him and that I would\nhave learned a lot from hearing him comment on\nmy analysis.\nOf the monetary economics battles Milton\nfought in the 1960s and 1970s, his policy prescription for steady money growth at a low rate is the\nonly important issue where he failed to carry the\nprofession. Mainstream macroeconomics accepts\nhis view that the long-run Phillips curve is vertical, that we need to focus on real, rather than\nnominal, interest rates, that low inflation is central\nto economic stability and that fiscal policy has\nlittle to do with short-run fluctuations in employment and output. But few economists still support\nmoney growth targeting.\nAlthough Milton’s money-growth policy\nprescription did not win out, I believe that his\nanalysis justifying this prescription has had much\nmore influence than many realize. I’ll review his\ncase for this recommendation and then discuss\nhow this case relates to current central bank\npractice.\n\nBefore proceeding, I want to emphasize that\nthe views I express here are mine and do not\nnecessarily reflect official positions of the Federal\nReserve System. I thank my colleagues at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for their comments, but I retain full responsibility for errors.\n\nTHE CASE FOR MONEY STOCK\nCONTROL\nAs a card-carrying monetarist, I argued the\nsteady money growth case vigorously in years\npast, and it is still my conviction that a central\nbank ignores money growth at its peril. Milton\nand his co-authors, especially Anna Schwartz,\nprovided ample evidence that variations in money\ngrowth were highly correlated with the business\ncycle, and he argued that steady money growth\nwould reduce the amplitude and frequency of\nrecessions. He also argued that sustained inflation would be impossible without sustained\nmoney growth in excess of the economy’s longrun real rate of growth.\nMilton favored steady money growth because\nhe did not believe that central bankers were wise\nenough to improve on the outcomes that would\nflow from steady money growth. With evidence\nfrom the Greenspan era, Milton changed his view\na bit, but was not convinced that Greenspan’s\nsuccess in adjusting the stance of monetary policy\nwas likely to be replicated by future Fed chairmen.\nThe case for controlling the money stock also\nrested on the dangers of controlling interest rates.\n1\n\n\fMONETARY POLICY AND INFLATION\n\nA policy interest rate held too low set in motion\na cumulative process of larger and larger inflationary disequilibrium; with a pegged nominal\nrate of interest, rising inflation and inflation\nexpectations would lower the real rate of interest.\nThat was the opposite of what would be needed\nto quell inflationary fires. The process was symmetrical; with ongoing deflation, a monetary\npolicy holding a nominal interest rate steady\nwould promote deflation and a rising real rate of\ninterest. An adjustable interest-rate peg does not\nchange the analysis in any fundamental way;\ngiven that inflation expectations may be changing,\nthe issue remains whether interest-rate adjustments are adequate to move the real rate of interest in the appropriate direction. Steady money\ngrowth, on the other hand, was inherently stabilizing as the real rate of interest would tend to rise\nduring an inflation and fall during a deflation.\nMilton also argued for steady money growth\non political grounds. A commitment to steady\nmoney growth would reflect a rule of law rather\nthan of men. He did not trust the legislature to\nrun monetary policy in a nonpolitical way, nor\ndid he trust “unaccountable bureaucrats,” as he\nmight put it, appointed for long terms to conduct\na discretionary monetary policy. His view was\nshaped by the Fed’s poor performance in the early\nyears of the Great Depression and by the fact that\nat that time pressure from Congress, when it was\nin session, did push the Fed a bit in the correct\ndirection.\nThis background is all familiar ground; I\nreview it to introduce my comments on current\ncentral bank practice.\n\nCONSEQUENCES OF\nCONTROLLING THE FEDERAL\nFUNDS RATE\nEverything Milton argued about money stock\ncontrol is true, but the effect of inflation expectations on the practice of monetary policy itself\nwas, I believe, a missing element in the analysis.\nThe economy functions differently when inflation\nexpectations are firmly anchored. If a central\n2\n\nbank allows expectations to become unanchored,\nthen interest-rate control becomes a dangerous\nand potentially destabilizing policy. But should\nthe practice of monetary policy depend on how\nwell inflation expectations are anchored? I do\nnot recall Milton discussing this question, perhaps because he believed that the best way to\nmaintain well-anchored expectations over time\nwas for the central bank to commit to steady and\nlow money growth under all circumstances.\nHow does a central bank anchor inflation\nexpectations? One approach would be for the\ncentral bank to commit to low and steady money\ngrowth come what may. A problem with this\napproach is that it may not appear credible to\nthe markets when financial instability and/or\nrecession occurs. If a policy of steady money\ngrowth has exceptions, can the exceptions be\ndefined in such a way to retain anchored inflation expectations?\nA necessary and sufficient condition for\nanchoring is that the central bank act vigorously\nto resist inflation or deflation whenever it becomes\nevident and particularly when inflation expectations change, up or down, in an unwelcome way.\nIf the central bank is willing to push as hard as it\ntakes, regardless of short-run consequences to\nunemployment and especially to the bond and\nstock markets, then market participants will\ndevelop firm views on the likely rate of inflation\nin the future. The Fed must convince market\nparticipants who bet against it that they will\nregret their bets.\nIt is highly desirable that the central bank\nbehave in a rule-like way, both for the political\nobjective of the rule of law rather than the rule of\nmen and because predictable policy promotes\nmore efficient decisions in the private sector. To\nthe maximum possible extent, we desire an equilibrium in which the markets behave as the central\nbank expects and the central bank behaves as the\nmarkets expect. Central bank behavior to anchor\nexpectations of low and stable inflation is the\nsingle most important aspect of policy predictability. I believe that the Fed has come a long way in\nthat direction though, obviously, there are certainly opportunities for the Fed to refine its policy\n\n\fMilton and Money Stock Control\n\nrule. In this context, by “rule” I simply mean that\nthe Fed’s policy actions are systematic and highly\npredictable responses to new information.\nSteady money growth would also be highly\npredictable, but I believe that the Fed’s actual\nadjustments of its federal funds rate target have\nyielded superior outcomes since 1982 to what\nwe would have observed under steady money\ngrowth. I also believe that advances in knowledge\npermit us to say with some confidence that these\ngains are not just an accident of Alan Greenspan’s\nspecial skills and intuition.\nSo, the Fed has pushed hard at certain times,\nand kept its federal funds target unchanged at\nother times, with the result that inflation expectations are now quite well anchored and policy\nadjustments are not themselves disturbances to\nthe market. With inflation expectations anchored,\nchanges in the nominal federal funds rate reliably\nmove the real federal funds rate in the same direction and by roughly the same amount. Data from\ntrading in indexed Treasury bonds, and from\nsurveys, allow the Fed to monitor changes in\ninflation expectations continuously. Such monitoring helps tremendously to provide assurance\nthat the Fed is not falling behind in its policy\nadjustments.\nI noted that an attractive part of the case for\nsteady money growth was that market-driven\nchanges in interest rates would be inherently\nstabilizing. Interestingly, and I think surprisingly,\nwe now see the same process at work with longerterm bond yields. The Fed adjusts its federal\nfunds rate target in a discretionary, though highly\npredictable, fashion, but significant changes in\nlong rates do occur. Those of you who follow the\nmarkets closely could point to many cases in\nrecent years in which long rates have helped to\nstabilize the economy while the Fed remained\non the sidelines, holding the federal funds rate\ntarget unchanged.\nWe are witnessing this phenomenon currently.\nPutting aside what is happening to the markets\nas I speak—something I obviously could not\nincorporate in my written text—the decline in\nlong Treasury rates last week surely helped to\nstabilize markets relative to a situation in which\n\nthose interest rates were held fixed by monetary\npolicy. If the Fed had been pegging long rates, the\nflight to quality last week would have required\nthe Fed to take funds out of the market. That\nwould have been a destabilizing response to\nmarket fears concerning housing and the subprime mortgage market. Nor would the Fed have\nbeen in a good place if it had to make a decision\nas to just how far it should adjust a pegged long\ninterest rate. This is the kind of judgment best\nleft to the market.\nWhat our analysis missed a generation ago\nwas that the typical model with only one interest rate could not possibly allow for stabilizing\nmarket responses in long rates when the central\nbank set the short rate. Of course, macro econometric models did have both short and long\nrates, but the structure of the models did not permit analysis of the sort I am discussing because\nthe typical term structure equation made the\nlong rate a distributed lag on the short rate. The\nmodel’s short rate, in turn, was determined by\nmonetary policymakers setting it directly or by\nthe money market under a policy determining\nmoney growth.\nOnce we allow expectations to uncouple the\ncurrent long rate from the current short rate, the\nsituation changes dramatically. The market can\nrespond to incoming information in a stabilizing\nway without the central bank having to respond.\nLong bond rates can change, and change substantially, while the federal funds rate target remains\nconstant.\nEventually, of course, if changed conditions\npersist, the central bank will have to adjust the\npolicy rate in the direction required by the new\ninformation. In the absence of such eventual\npolicy adjustment, the destabilizing effects of a\nconstant interest rate emphasized in the earlier\nliterature will appear.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\nConsider where this analysis leaves us.\nAssume inflation expectations are well anchored.\nThe central bank can hold its policy rate relatively\n3\n\n\fMONETARY POLICY AND INFLATION\n\nsteady and rely on market adjustments in long\nrates to do much of the stabilization work. When\nnew information arrives, most of the time the\ncentral bank can wait for market responses and\nthe passage of time to clarify what is happening.\nThe current situation is a perfect illustration.\nThe Fed doesn’t know and market participants\ndo not know either, the full implications of last\nweek’s stock market declines and increases in\nrisk spreads. Market reactions last week may be\noverdone, or perhaps not. We just do not know.\nIn a situation like the terrorist attacks of 9/11,\nthe Fed knew enough to believe that a quick policy response would be helpful and unlikely to\nitself be destabilizing.\nA typical market upset, such as last week’s,\nis not at all like 9/11. Most of these upsets stabilize on their own, but some do not. I’m not saying\nthat the Fed should ignore what happened last\nweek—we need to understand what is happening.\nHowever, it is important that the Fed not permit\nuncertainty over policy to add to the existing\nuncertainty. The market understands, I believe,\nthat the Fed will act in due time, if and when\nevidence accumulates that action would be appropriate. That is why trading in the federal funds\nfutures market reflects changed odds from two\nweeks ago on a policy adjustment later this year.\nIf last week’s events do not turn out to change\nthe probable course of economic growth and\ninflation, then the fed funds futures market will\nreverse course and the expected policy easing\nwill disappear. Or, if evidence accumulates that\nthe inflation picture remains benign but the outlook for the economy next year appears likely to\nbe significantly weaker than the current best\nguess, then the market will deepen its conviction\nthat the Fed will be cutting its fed funds target.\nThe regularity of Fed behavior I espouse is\nthat the Fed should respond to market upsets\nonly when it has become clear that they threaten\nto undermine achievement of fundamental objectives of price stability and high employment, or\nwhen financial-market developments threaten\nmarket processes themselves. The Fed should not\ntry to substitute its judgments for the market’s\njudgment on appropriate security prices. The\n4\n\nright question to ask is not whether Fed action in\nresponse to any current market upset would be\ndesirable but rather whether it is possible to\ndefine a systematic response to market upsets in\ngeneral that would be helpful. The answer I give\nis that effects on the economy can rarely be understood without passage of time and more information. Occasionally, there is contemporaneous\nevidence of damage to market mechanisms that\nmight justify quick Fed action.\nThe key point is that, in these situations, the\nmarket is making judgments on security prices,\nstabilizing the economy without the Fed having\nto lead the way. This is exactly the process envisioned a generation ago by the monetarist advocates of steady money growth. This is what Milton\ntaught us about markets, and he was right.\nWhen inflation expectations are firmly\nanchored, an important reason for the Fed to let\nmarkets take the lead is that overactive Fed\nresponses to market developments set precedents\nthat tend to destabilize markets in the future. If\nthe market believes that the Fed is always primed\nto adjust policy, then market participants will\nspend more time trying to second-guess the Fed\nthan trying to understand what is happening to\nbusiness and household behavior. As I emphasized earlier, a good market equilibrium requires\nthat the Fed behave as the market expects. When\nthere are widely varying interpretations in the\nmarket about what is happening, it is impossible\nfor the Fed to behave as the market expects\nbecause there is no unified view in the market\nabout what is happening. At any given time, it\nmay be impossible for the market to come to a\nunified view about what is happening, simply\nbecause of incomplete knowledge and different\nprofessional judgments by those best informed.\nStill, there need be little or no uncertainly about\nFed behavior the day before an FOMC meeting.\nFed actions at future meetings months ahead\nwill remain uncertain, to both the market and\nthe FOMC itself, because the future information\nset is uncertain.\nIn the meantime, the central tendency of\nmarket views on what is happening will control\nthe long bond rate and security prices more gen-\n\n\fMilton and Money Stock Control\n\nerally. Differences in market views as to what is\nhappening will determine who is long and who\nis short in the market. Eventually, as new information clarifies the situation, the variance of\nviews around the central tendency will fall and\nmore normal market conditions will reemerge.\nAs for the politics of monetary policy, I\nbelieve there is extremely wide support for a\ntotally apolitical Fed. There is a consensus on\nthe desirability of low inflation and that the Fed\nshould do what it can to stabilize the unemployment rate at the lowest rate consistent with sustained non-inflationary economic growth. The\nmarket and most political leaders believe that\nthe Fed is apolitical. The market trusts us, and\nwe, in turn, work hard to retain this trust. When\nI say “we” I really mean the Fed as an institution.\nFed officials, staff and Reserve bank directors\nhave a deep understanding of the importance of\napolitical monetary policy. This understanding\ngoes far toward making Fed actions reflect a rule\nof law rather than a rule of the individuals making\nthe decisions. The closest analogy, perhaps, is\nthat we work as fiduciaries. I do not deny that it\nwould be desirable for the Federal Reserve Act\nto be clearer about the objectives the Fed should\npursue. Still, the Fed as an institution has gone a\nlong way to make its policy actions rule-like in\ntheir regularity. If the institution is strong and\nincorruptible, as I believe it is, then we probably\nhave as much assurance in a democratic society\nas we are likely to get.\nAlthough Milton did not prevail in his quest\nto have the Fed maintain a constant money growth\nrate, he did prevail in his insistence that policy\nbe apolitical and rely to the maximum possible\nextent on market judgments. He lost a battle but\ntruly did win the war.\n\n5\n\n\f"

I applaud\nthe work of the Center in promoting events\nand communication about international economic\nand financial interdependence.\nBecause tonight’s festivities celebrate Greece,\nI thought that I might say a few words about the\nremarkable turnaround of Greece’s economic\nperformance, a success that is closely linked to\nentry into the European Monetary Union at the\nstart of 2001.\nAs usual, I want to emphasize that the views\nI express here are mine and do not necessarily\nreflect official positions of the Federal Reserve\nSystem. I thank my colleagues at the Federal\nReserve Bank of St. Louis for their comments.\nChristopher J. Neely, assistant vice president in\nthe Research Division, provided special assistance.\nI retain full responsibility for errors.\nI know that this event is not the occasion for\na formal lecture, but once you give a lawyer’s son\nand former professor turned central banker a\nsoapbox, you have accepted a certain risk. I promise not to present a lecture, but cannot resist a few\nremarks.

During this\nperiod, Greek monetary and fiscal policy left\n1\n\nmuch to be desired: Inflation and interest rates\nboth topped 20 percent. High inflation typically\ndamages economic growth. Greece was no exception. Its real GDP growth averaged 0.7 percent\nannual rate between 1980 and 1994.\nHigh interest rates compounded the government’s fiscal problems by raising borrowing costs\non its very substantial debt. Annual government\nbudget deficits often exceeded 10 percent of output. Annual peacetime budget deficits in excess\nof 10 percent of GDP are large for any country.\nAs a result of many years of these large deficits,\nthe Greek gross public sector debt stood at about\n88 percent of GDP by 1995. In 1995, the GDPweighted average ratio of debt to GDP in the\nEuropean Union was 73 percent; other counties\nwith high ratios were Belgium at 135 percent,\nItaly at 122 percent and the Netherlands at 90\npercent.1\nIn 1992, the Maastricht Treaty set forth the\nmechanisms by which member states would transition to a single European currency, the euro.\nSpecifically, the treaty laid down so-called convergence criteria to which all countries had to\nconform before joining the European Monetary\nUnion, the EMU. The criteria required that every\nmember state have inflation and interest rates\nsimilar to those of the best performing members,\nsound public finances, a period of exchange rate\nstability and appropriate legislation with respect\nto its central bank.\n\nThe following countries were members of the EU in 1995: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy,\nLuxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The paragraph cites debt-to-GDP data from the OECD. Eurostat,\nhowever, reports a much higher estimate of Greece’s 1995 debt-to-GDP ratio, 109 percent. The OECD number is much lower because the OECD\nreports large upward revisions to Greek GDP that Eurostat has not yet accepted.\n\n1\n\n\fINTERNATIONAL TRADE AND FINANCE\n\nWhile Greece expressed interest in monetary\nunion even before the Maastricht Treaty was\nsigned, the country was plainly unable to meet the\nconvergence criteria in the early 1990s. As already\nnoted, inflation and interest rates exceeded 20\npercent and public finances were in terrible shape.\nSome observers even suggested that by the early\n1990s Greece had the largest imbalances of any\nindustrial country (Hochreiter and Tavlas, 2004).\nIn the mid-1990s, there was no guarantee\nthat Greece would succeed in meeting the convergence criteria, despite a general desire to integrate more closely with Europe and to achieve\nbetter economic performance.\nAlthough Greece had begun reducing inflation\nin the early 1990s, in 1995 the governor of the\nBank of Greece, Lucas Papademos, took a serious\nstep toward economic reform by introducing the\n“Hard Drachma Policy.” This monetary policy\nprogram, which entailed annual targets for inflation and exchange rates, made rapid progress\nagainst inflation, reducing it from over 10 percent\nin 1995 to less than 5 percent by the start of 1998.\nYet, despite the fact that Greece could not\nimmediately meet the convergence criteria,\nGreece’s socialist prime minister, Costas Simitas,\nmade complying with them a political priority.\nJoining the monetary union would help integrate\nGreece’s economy with those of the other members. It would lower the costs of international\ntrade for consumers and businesses, facilitate\ninternational price comparisons, and raise living\nstandards. The policy package included a number\nof complementary structural reforms to Greek\nenergy and telecommunications markets.\nThe Greek public largely supported these\ngovernment reforms. As one might expect, support was strongest among the business community, but moderate socialists also supported the\nplan. Farmers and left-wing activists constituted\nthe main opponents, fearing job losses from\nincreased competition and capital mobility.\nSome observers, including many economists,\nalso expressed the traditional concern about\nmonetary unions: that they require a “one size\nfits all” monetary policy among the members.\nThis concern seemed especially pressing for a\n2\n\nsmall country, like Greece, trying to join a monetary union of larger and wealthier countries.\nFiscal policy—government taxes and spending—is often considered another tool of macroeconomic management. The EMU, however,\nadopted the “Stability and Growth Pact,” a 1997\ntreaty that was designed to ensure that governments would continue to behave in ways consistent with the stability of the euro. The pact\neffectively limits government deficits to 3 percent\nof GDP, which restricts countercyclical fiscal\npolicy. Thus, euro skeptics were concerned that\nthe EMU would handcuff both monetary and fiscal\npolicy, fostering unstable economic conditions.\nEven Governor Papademos (Wall Street\nJournal Europe, February 12, 2001) admitted to\nsome concern on this point: “I’m a little bit concerned that in the course of the year that if there’s\na severe shock or an unanticipated domestic\ndevelopment, it may not be possible for fiscal\npolicy to be implemented with the required degree\nof prudence.” The requirement of restrictive fiscal\nand monetary policies to join the monetary union\ndrew the most direct criticism. Labor unions, in\nparticular, fought the new policies with strikes\nand political rallies.\nThe national airline, Olympic Airways,\nbecame a focal point of the struggle as the government sought to cut costs and turn it into a profitmaking enterprise. Employees at the firm\nresponded with frequent work stoppages. In 1998,\nGreece’s foreign minister, Theodoros Pangalos,\neven joked that “no logical person” would ride\nOlympic Airways, given the poor service (Laredo\nMorning Times, May 1, 1998).\nCriticism of Greece’s entry to the monetary\nunion came from outside the country as well.\nEarly in 2000, the German Chambers of Industry\nand Commerce urged the German government to\nblock Greece’s entry to EMU, citing Greece’s\nextremely large public debt. These groups were\nconcerned that Greece’s large public debt might\ncreate pressure to inflate the euro.\nThe economic reforms of the 1990s were\nultimately successful in bringing Greece into\ncompliance with the convergence criteria. On\nJanuary 1, 2001, Greece officially became a mem-\n\n\fGreece and the Euro\n\nber of the euro zone. As with previous members,\nthe drachma-denominated notes and the euro\nnotes circulated side by side for two months,\nuntil the euro became the sole currency on\nMarch 1, 2001.\nThe Greek economy has flourished since it\nentered the euro zone in 2001. Inflation has\naveraged 3.3 percent, compared with the 19902000 average of 10.4 percent. GDP growth has\naveraged 4.4 percent, compared with 2.2 percent\nin the prior period. Unemployment has fallen\nfrom its 1999 peak of 12.3 percent to 8.6 percent\nby the end of 2006. While this jobless figure is\nhigher than anyone wants, it is likely to decline\nfurther in the environment of price stability that\nthe European Central Bank fosters.\nIn September 2004, the Greek government\nreleased revised national accounts that showed\nthat Greece had actually entered the euro zone\nwith a budget deficit that exceeded the limit of\n3 percent of GDP set forth by the Stability and\nGrowth Pact guidelines. These revisions have\ncaused some consternation among the member\nstates. Still, it cannot be argued that entry into\nthe EMU was a mistake. The Greek economy is\nnot performing just marginally better, but enormously better.\nEuropean countries continue to see benefits\nfrom adopting the euro. The 10 countries that\nentered the European Union in 2004 have all\n\nexpressed their intention to join the full monetary\nunion within ten years. Slovenia, which joined\nthe euro zone on January 1 of this year, was the\nfirst of these new members.\nI was fortunate to study under Milton\nFriedman, and I remember well one of his favorite\nsayings: The proof of the pudding is in the eating.\nFor Greece, the EMU pudding has been very\ntasty indeed.\n\nREFERENCES\nHochreiter, E. and Tavlas, G.

        "content": "Energy and the U.S. Macro Economy\nWilmington Club\nWilmington, Delaware\nJuly 24, 2007\n\nI\n\nam sure that over the past several years\neveryone in the audience has experienced\n“sticker shock” as the price of a gallon of\ngasoline at your weekly fill-up rose from\naround $1.40 to $2 and now to around $3. More\nabstractly, you have read newspaper reports that\nthe price of a barrel of crude oil rose from about\n$25 per barrel to $50 and, most recently, to the\nneighborhood of $75.\nAlthough economists are a bit nervous about\nthis situation, the U.S. economy has performed\nwell despite the oil price increases. We are nervous because those of us of a certain age remember\nwell how different the situation was in the 1970s.\nAs oil prices rose in 1973-74, the overall rate of\ninflation reached 11 percent over the four quarters\nof 1974, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures. The PCE price\nindex, by the way, is somewhat broader than the\nmore familiar Consumer Price Index. The recession that occurred at the same time took the\nunemployment rate to 9 percent in May 1975.\nThen it happened again. With large oil price\nincreases in 1978-79, the PCE price index rose\nby 10 percent over the four quarters of 1979. There\nwas a recession in 1980 and a more serious recession during 1981-82 that took the unemployment\nrate to almost 11 percent at the end of 1982.\nOil price increases over the past several years\nare, in percentage terms, roughly comparable to\nthe 1970s’ episodes, but overall inflation has\nremained relatively contained. Unemployment\nhas drifted down and is currently about 41/2 percent. This unemployment rate is at or perhaps\neven a bit below estimates of the full-employment\nrate of unemployment.\n\nWhat is different this time? That is my topic\nthis evening.\nBefore proceeding, I want to emphasize that\nthe views I express here are mine and do not\nnecessarily reflect official positions of the Federal\nReserve System. I thank my colleagues at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for their comments. Robert H. Rasche, senior vice president\nand director of research, provided special assistance. I retain full responsibility for errors.\n\nSOME ENERGY FACTS\nWhile petroleum price developments are\nmost prominent in everyone’s mind, they reflect\nonly part of the energy story. About 40 percent of\nenergy consumption in the U.S. economy is\nderived from petroleum-based products. Coal\nand coal derivatives are the source of about 23\npercent of U.S. energy consumption; natural gas\nabout 22 percent and the nuclear and renewable\nenergy sources the remaining 15 percent. These\nsources of energy consumption have been remarkably stable over the past 20 years, as shown in\nFigure 1. Figure 2 shows the prices of three primary energy sources as index numbers with\n1982-84 = 1.0. Figure 3 shows the prices of two\nconsumer energy products, electricity and gasoline, again as index numbers relative to the same\nbase period. These figures are drawn from annual\naverage data and therefore do not show price\nvolatility over the course of a year.\nFrom these figures, you can see that price\ntrends for the various energy sources have been\nbroadly similar, except for recent years. The stability of the fraction of energy consumption from\n1\n\n\fECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\n\ndifferent sources is not surprising given that, until\nrecently, price trends for these energy goods were\nbroadly similar which means that the relative\nprices of energy sources haven’t changed much.\nIndeed, from the mid-1980s through about 2002,\nthe relative prices of these energy sources were\nalmost constant. From 1980 to 2000, primary\nenergy prices generally trended slightly downward, while the prices of the two retail energy\nproducts shown in Figure 3 were roughly constant.\nIt is only in the past few years that there has\nbeen a major change in the relative prices. Crude\noil prices have risen most rapidly in the recent\npast, roughly doubling since 2000. Natural gas\nprices and retail gasoline prices have gone up\nabout 70 percent over the same period. However,\nthe price of coal has gone up only 40 percent, and\nthe price of electricity only 30 percent. The latter\nreflects the large percentage of coal-fired generation capacity and regulation of retail electricity\nprices that slows the adjustment of prices at the\nretail level to increases in input costs.\nThe positive trend in crude oil and natural\ngas prices started well before the disruptions to\nproduction with the 2005 hurricanes in the Gulf\nof Mexico, domestic refinery outages and the\nheightened geopolitical risk in the Middle East.\nThese supply-side events caused price spikes in\nthe last couple of years, but the pattern of price\nmovements since Y2K reflects strong world\ndemand for energy as well as supply shocks. Given\nrelatively low short-run elasticities of demand\nfor the various sources of energy, the fractions of\ntotal energy consumption have not yet responded\nstrongly to the recent price increases. If these\nrelative price changes persist, we should expect\nthe fraction of energy consumption from coal to\nrise and the fraction from petroleum and natural\ngas to fall.\nThe recent increases in nominal energy prices\nnotwithstanding, energy in the United States\nremains quite inexpensive. This fact, surprising\nas it may seem, can be seen in Figures 4 and 5\nwhere the real prices of various energy products\nare shown. By “real price” we mean the price of\na good in terms of other goods. Figures 4 and 5\nshow the nominal prices from Figures 2 and 3\n2\n\ndivided by the personal consumption price index\nfor all items except food and energy (the so-called\n“core PCE price index”) on a base of 1982-84 = 1.0.\nThe real price of natural gas reached a high for\nthe past 30 years in 2005 with the hurricanerelated production disruptions. In 2006, real\nnatural gas prices declined, but remained higher\nthan anytime in the 1973-2004 period. The real\nprice of crude trended down from 1982 through\n1998, but increases beginning in 1999 brought the\nreal price to just 9 percent above 1982-84 levels\nand roughly 20 percent below its 1981 peak.\nIn contrast, the real price of coal fell steadily\nfrom 1976 to 2003 and has since risen only\nslightly. In 2006, the real price of coal was less\nthan half of its 1982-84 value. The real retail price\nof gasoline has increased continuously since\n2003, but in 2006 exceeded the average price of\n1982-84 by only 12 percent. The relative price in\n2006 is roughly 10 percent below its historical\nhigh reached in 1981. The real price of electricity\nfell by about 35 percent from the early 1980s until\n1999, leveled off, and has increased about 12 percent since 2003. Nevertheless electricity remains\n23 percent cheaper in real terms than it was on\naverage during 1982-84.\nAs painful as recent energy price increases\nhave been, this historical perspective helps us\nto understand why the economy has been able to\nabsorb the price increases with little effect on\nthe aggregate economy. Perhaps the most direct\nway to understand the impact of energy prices\non consumers is to examine the fraction of household budgets devoted to energy.\nAfter 1981, the share of consumer expenditures on energy out of nominal disposable personal income trended downward, from a high of\nover 8 percent to about 4.1 percent in 1998 (see\nFigure 6). Disposable personal income, by the\nway, is essentially all household income including transfers such as Social Security benefits less\ndirect taxes, which are mostly income taxes. Real\ndisposable personal income is the nominal or\ndollar amount adjusted for changes in the general\nprice level.\nWith the increase in energy prices documented\nin Figures 2 and 3, the energy share of disposable\n\n\fEnergy and the U.S. Macro Economy\n\nFigure 1\nofoU.S.\nEnergy\n.

This increase simply\nreturns the share to about its 1985 level. It is\nimportant to recognize, however, that the increase\nin energy prices, though of limited impact in the\naggregate, has forced difficult choices on lowerincome households for whom the burden has\nbeen much higher as a proportion of income.\nThe recent price increases are having the\nexpected negative impact on the quantity of energy\nconsumed, relative to total goods and services\nconsumed, but the total amount spent on energy\nhas nevertheless increased. The increase in the\nenergy share of nominal disposable personal\nincome reflects the inelastic short-run demand\nfor energy by consumers. Put another way, as\nenergy prices have surged, the quantity of energy\nconsumed has grown more slowly than real disposable personal income but not slowly enough,\ngiven the price increases, to prevent the amount\nspent on energy from rising significantly.\nTo understand the impact of energy price\nincreases on households, we need to compare\nwhat actually happened with a baseline scenario.\nWe’ll compare 2006 with 2002. A reasonable\nbaseline scenario assumes that the relative price\nof energy is unchanged—that is, that the nominal\nprice of energy rises by the same percentage as\nconsumer prices excluding energy actually rose.\nSecond, let’s assume that the quantity of energy\nconsumed had increased by the same percentage\nthat real disposable personal income actually\nrose. With these assumptions, the percentage of\ndisposable income spent on energy in 2006 would\nhave matched the percentage in 2002, which was\n4.2 percent.\nWith these assumptions, in 2006 the baseline\nspending on energy in nominal dollars would\nhave been $400 billion. Actual spending on\nenergy, at $550 billion, was $150 billion higher.\nHad the quantity of energy consumed increased\nbetween 2002 and 2006 at the same rate real disposable personal income increased, spending\non energy in 2006 would have been higher by\nanother $47 billion. Thus, between 2002 and 2006,\nconsumers’ responses to energy price increases\nheld down the increase in the quantity of energy\n6\n\nconsumed to 1.4 percent compared to the increase\nin real disposable personal income of 10 percent.\nI would not claim that an extra $150 billion\nincrease in consumer spending on energy is a\nsmall number. However, we need to put that number in perspective. The extra spending on energy\nin 2006 was 1.6 percent of disposable personal\nincome. By way of comparison, consider some\nother spending increases between 2002 and 2006.\nAs a percentage of disposable personal income,\nconsumer spending on furniture and household\nequipment rose from 4.1 to 4.2, spending on recreation from 3.8 to 4.0, spending on food from 12.8\nto 13.4 and spending on medical care from 15.4\nto 16.7. Indeed, between 2002 and 2006, spending\non alcoholic beverages rose by $40 billion, from\n1.5 to 1.6 percent of disposable personal income.\nFrom these numbers, I conclude that the\nimpact of energy price increases on consumers\nhas been far less than headlines would lead\nreaders and TV viewers to believe. I suppose we\ncould argue that medical care and energy spending increases are driving people to drink, but, in\nthe process, U.S. consumers have been able to\nincrease their spending share on furniture and\nrecreation as well. It must be that consumers are\nnot so hard-pressed after all, except for those in\nthe lowest income groups. The impact has been\nreal, but the magnitude small enough that price\nincreases have not disrupted the normal processes\nof economic growth.\n\nEFFECTS OF ENERGY PRICE\nINCREASES ON THE ECONOMY\nI’ve emphasized that energy price increases\nhave not had serious adverse impacts on the\nU.S. economy. The effects on consumers as a\nwhole have not been all that large; the economy\nhas grown nicely since 2002, and the labor market is currently very close to full employment.\nBut economists do have concerns, in good part\nbecause of lingering bad memories of previous\nperiods of sharply rising energy prices.\nThe energy shocks of 1973 and 1979-80 were\nprincipally supply-side disturbances to energy\n\n\fEnergy and the U.S. Macro Economy\n\nmarkets: the OPEC oil embargo and the Iranian\nhostage crisis, compounded by the presence of\nprice controls in the United States. The impact\nof those shocks is certainly burned into my memory, and likely into the memory of everyone who\nlived through experiences of long lines at gasoline\nstations that sometimes actually ran out of fuel;\nmandatory reductions in thermostat settings at\nbusiness and government offices; and year-round\ndaylight saving time. In addition, both of these\nshocks were followed by recession.\nOver the past four years, we have seen none\nof the macroeconomic complications of the early\nenergy price shocks. An important part of the\ndifference this time is that the recent trend in\nrelative energy prices has been driven by rapidly\nincreasing world demand for energy. Figure 7\nshows energy consumption in four major economic areas: the United States, Europe, Japan\nand China plus India.1 The latest data available\nare for 2004. Between 2002 and 2004, primary\nworld energy consumption increased 9 percent.\nHowever, energy consumption in the United\nStates grew only 2.5 percent, in the EU-15 4.2\npercent and in Japan 2.9 percent. In contrast, during this period primary energy consumption in\nChina and India is estimated to have grown 33.0\npercent. The increase in primary energy consumption in the latter two countries is estimated at 51\npercent of the total world increase in energy consumption. Clearly, rapid development of populous\nemerging market economies is the major source\nof large increases in world energy demand. This\nshift in the world demand for energy is the underlying source of the price trends that are documented in Figures 2 to 5.\nHowever, energy markets work! The real price\nincreases have provoked a response in production\nsufficient to accommodate the higher demand.\nWorld production of primary energy increased\n9.1 percent from 2002 through 2004. The price\nmechanism in world energy markets is alive and\nfunctioning well to increase total production\n1\n\nand to allocate available supply among the existing and emerging sources of demand.\nFaced with these higher energy prices, consumers and businesses in the United States have\nreacted in the manner predicted by basic economic\nanalysis. As I discussed above, consumers have\nreduced their consumption of more expensive\nenergy relative to total consumption expenditures.\nYet they have been able to maintain strong overall demand for consumption goods. Real personal\nconsumption expenditures in the United States\ngrew at an average annual rate of 3.5 percent from\n2002 through 2006, and this strong growth in\nconsumer demand has made a major contribution\nto the continued growth of our economy five years\ninto an economic expansion.\nThe business sector of the U.S. economy has\nalso reacted to higher energy prices over time.\nEnergy use per dollar of real GDP is shown in\nFigure 8. Energy use shows a consistent negative\ntrend reaching a value in 2006 of 8.75 or only 48.6\npercent of the 1970 value of 17.99. This downward\ntrend is the result of efficiency improvements\nand structural changes in the economy that have\nshifted production toward less energy intensive\nindustries. In Figure 9 it can be seen that in 2006\nconsumption of energy in the industrial sector—\nthe sector consuming the most energy in our\neconomy—is at roughly the same absolute level\nas it was in the early 1970s. Industrial firms have\nmaintained this level of energy consumption even\nthough industrial production in manufacturing\nin 2006 is three times larger than it was in 1970.\nThe transportation sector is the second largest\nconsumer of energy in the U.S. economy. Energy\nusage in this sector has trended upward steadily.\nThe increase is driven by the growing number of\nvehicle miles and the failure of improvements in\nthe average fuel efficiency of the fleet of domestic\nmotor vehicles to offset increases in total vehicle\nmiles. Figure 10 shows fuel efficiency of various\ntypes of vehicles in the United States. Fuel efficiency of our truck fleet has been relatively constant since the late 1960s. Although substantial\n\nEurope is defined here as the EU-15: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands,\nPortugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.\n\n7\n\n\fECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\n\nFigure 7\nWorldEnergy\ny Consumption\nFigure 7:World\nEnergConsumption\n140\n120\n\nBillion BTU\n\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n\nU nited S tates\n\nE U -15\n\nJ apan\n\n20\n04\n\n20\n02\n\n20\n00\n\n19\n98\n\n19\n96\n\n19\n94\n\n19\n92\n\n19\n90\n\n19\n88\n\n19\n86\n\n19\n84\n\n19\n82\n\n19\n80\n\n0\n\nC hina and India\n\n25\n\n20\n\n17. 99 in 1970\n\n15\n\n10\n8. 75 in 2006\n\n5\n\n0\n\n19\n49\n19\n52\n19\n55\n19\n58\n19\n61\n19\n64\n19\n67\n19\n70\n19\n73\n19\n76\n19\n79\n19\n82\n19\n85\n19\n88\n19\n91\n19\n94\n19\n97\n20\n00\n20\n03\n20\n06\n\nThousand Btu per Chained (2000) Dollar\n\nFigure 8\nFigureEnergy\n8: EneConsumption\nptioDollar\nllar oGDP\nrgy Consumper\nn per D\nf Real\nofoReal\nGDP\n\n8\n\n\fEnergy and the U.S. Macro Economy\n\nFigure 9\nnergy Consumption\nFigure 9 : EEnergy\ny End-UsSector\ne Sector\nConsumptionbybEnd-Use\n40, 000, 000\n\n35, 000, 000\n\n25, 000, 000\n\n20, 000, 000\n\n15, 000, 000\n\n10, 000, 000\n\n5, 000, 000\n\n19\n49\n19\n52\n19\n55\n19\n58\n19\n61\n19\n64\n19\n67\n19\n70\n19\n73\n19\n76\n19\n79\n19\n82\n19\n85\n19\n88\n19\n91\n19\n94\n19\n97\n20\n00\n20\n03\n20\n06\n\n0\n\nIndustrial\n\nT ransportation\n\nR esidential\n\nC ommercial\n\nFigure 10\n: MotoVehicle\nFigure 10Motor\nle FRates\nuel Rates\nr VehicFuel\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n19\n49\n19\n52\n19\n55\n19\n58\n19\n61\n19\n64\n19\n67\n19\n70\n19\n73\n19\n76\n19\n79\n19\n82\n19\n85\n19\n88\n19\n91\n19\n94\n19\n97\n20\n00\n20\n03\n\nMiles per Gallon\n\nBillion Btu\n\n30, 000, 000\n\nP assenger C ars\n\nV ans, P ickup T rucks, and S U V 's\n\nT rucks\n\n9\n\n\fECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\n\nFigure 11\nFigure 11: Crude Oil and Natural Gas Rotary Rigs\nCrude Oil and Natural Gas Rotary Rigs in Operation\nin Operation\n4, 500\n4, 000\n\nP eak: 3, 970 rigs in 1981\n\nNumber of Rigs\n\n3, 500\n3, 000\n2, 500\n2, 000\n1, 500\n1, 000\n500\n\n19\n49\n19\n52\n19\n55\n19\n58\n19\n61\n19\n64\n19\n67\n19\n70\n19\n73\n19\n76\n19\n79\n19\n82\n19\n85\n19\n88\n19\n91\n19\n94\n19\n97\n20\n00\n20\n03\n20\n06\n\n0\n\nincreases in the fuel efficiency of passenger cars\nhave been realized since the mid-1970s, the fuel\nefficiency of vans, pickup trucks and SUVs basically flattened out or declined a bit after the\nearly 1990s. Overall fuel efficiency has tended to\ndecline as consumers increased the share of light\ntrucks and reduced the share of passenger cars.\nVery recently, it appears that households are\nadjusting their preferences for types of vehicles\nin light of the increased real price of gasoline.\nThe percentage of light trucks, which includes\nvans and SUVs, in total light vehicle sales peaked\nin late 2004 at 57.5 percent and by mid-2007 had\ndeclined to 51 percent.\nResidential consumption of energy leveled\noff from the mid-1970s through the mid-1980s\nbut has trended up for the past 20 years. However,\nrelative to the stock of housing in the United\nStates, residential energy consumption has been\nessentially flat since the early 1980s.\nBusiness activity is also reflecting the upward\ntrend in relative energy prices. Domestic drilling\nfor oil and natural gas, as measured by rigs in\noperation (Figure 11) has increased in the past\nseveral years, after many years of a flat level of\nactivity. Part of the increase reflects the interaction\n10\n\nof new technologies and the economic incentives\nto exploit previously untapped and uneconomic\nresources. An example is the Fayetteville shale\nformation in Arkansas. Development of this\nresource requires horizontal drilling techniques\nand fracturing of the shale formations to release\nnatural gas.\nA second type of investment currently underway is the construction of electricity generating\nfacilities with lower emissions. Major construction activities are underway in Kentucky and\nIllinois. These projects will utilize local coal\nresources that have been underutilized in recent\nyears because of the availability of cheap, lower\nsulfur western coal. Major investments in coal\ngenerating plants have also been announced for\nTexas. In the longer run, “clean coal” technology\nin which coal is first converted to gas before\nburning may be introduced on a large scale.\nFinally, there is a tremendous amount of\ninvestment activity in the area of alternative, nonfossil, fuels. These include numerous installations to produce ethanol from corn and factories\nto produce biodiesel fuels. Auto manufacturers\nare investing in new engine “flexfuel” technologies that will allow motor vehicles to run on dif-\n\n\fEnergy and the U.S. Macro Economy\n\nferent mixtures of fossil and non-fossil fuels. It\nremains to be seen whether these technologies\nwill prove economically viable.\n\nCONCLUDING COMMENTS\nEnergy is an essential good, along with food,\nwater, medical care and a number of other goods.\nHowever, the importance of recent energy developments is less than their high visibility leads many\nto believe. There are certainly strains from the\nhigh price of energy; however, there is no energy\ncrisis, and households and firms are adjusting in\na sensible way to price increases.\nWorld energy demands are likely to continue\nto grow rapidly, as economic growth in China and\nIndia has developed substantial momentum. We\nshould hope that growth will take hold in Africa\nand in Middle Eastern countries. If it does, rapid\neconomic development in those areas will add\nfurther to growth in world energy demand.\nWhether higher growth in the world economy\nwill continue to push energy prices up will\ndepend on developments in energy supply. There\nare many promising technologies that in time\ncould make important contributions to energy\nsupplies. Moreover, technology can be of enormous assistance in tempering growth in demand.\nTo harness this technology, we need to rely primarily on market forces. Market adjustments have\nbeen the hero in preventing energy price increases\nover the past four years from disrupting economic\ngrowth, as happened in the 1970s. In my judgment,\nmarkets will continue to handle energy problems\nwell, and the future for the U.S. economy is bright.\n\n11\n\n\f"

        "content": "Reputation and the Non-Prime Mortgage Market\nSt. Louis Association of Real Estate Professionals\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nJuly 20, 2007\n\nM\n\ny topic this morning is the nonprime mortgage market, which\nhas been in the news on almost a\ndaily basis. Non-prime mortgages\nare the common denominator in such diverse\nrecent developments as rising household foreclosure rates and collapsing hedge funds. You\nalso may have read some of the news coverage\nof Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke’s\ntestimony on this topic before Congress earlier\nthis week (Bernanke, 2007a).\nDevelopments in the non-prime mortgage\nmarket matter to the Federal Reserve for three\nmain reasons. First, the non-prime mortgage\nmarket—with 2006 originations of about one\ntrillion dollars1—clearly is large enough to affect\naggregate homebuilding activity and consumer\nspending. Second, the Fed also supervises some\nbanks and most financially oriented holding companies; consistent with those responsibilities, the\nFed is monitoring the performance of non-prime\nmortgage loans carefully for signs of further credit\ndeterioration. Congress has granted the Federal\nReserve the authority to define unfair and deceptive acts and practices under several important\nfederal consumer-protection statutes. We take this\nresponsibility seriously, and we are gathering\ninformation now to determine what else we should\ndo to modify disclosure and other regulations.\nMost of the news, and most of the problems,\nrelate to the highest risk part of the non-prime\nmortgage market—the subprime market. There\nhave also been some problems in the so-called\n“Alt-A” market, which lies between prime and\n1\n\nsubprime. What I am calling the non-prime market\ncovers subprime and Alt-A. There are, of course,\na variety of non-prime markets, in auto loans and\nelsewhere. To streamline the exposition, I will\ndrop the modifier “mortgage,” and you can assume\nI am discussing the mortgage market unless I make\nspecific mention of some other market.\nSome of the problems we’re seeing in the\nnon-prime market may have been inevitable given\nthe breakneck innovation and growth of recent\nyears, followed by a significant cooling of housingmarket activity. Yet it is important that we learn\nthe correct lessons from these problems. In a future\nhousing-market slowdown, we want to avoid\nrepetition of recent problems. We also want to\npreserve appropriate access to credit by those\nwith impaired credit standing. The subprime\nmarket in particular is an immature market—a\nbaby market in age, though not in size—and we\nwant to remember the adage about not discarding\nthe baby with the bathwater.\nMy premise today is that a lasting improvement in the functioning of the non-prime market\nis most likely if we correct the fundamental problems that seem to be causing the greatest difficulties, rather than attacking mere symptoms of the\nproblem. To preview my conclusion briefly, I\nbelieve the fundamental problems in the nonprime mortgage market amenable to improvement\nstem from inadequate incentives among some of\nthe parties operating in the market to create and\nmaintain strong reputations for quality and fairdealing. A solid reputation is a valuable asset for\nthe individual firm, for the economy and society\n\nNon-prime mortgage originations during 2006 consisted of approximately $600 billion of subprime and about $400 billion of Alt-A mortgages.\nThese terms are defined below.\n\n1\n\n\fFINANCIAL MARKETS\n\nas a whole. This point is not a new one. “My word\nis my bond” has been the motto of the London\nStock Exchange since 1801.\nEvery long-lived business depends on trust\nin the marketplace. The firm benefits from a\ndurable business franchise, which is why building trust is important to the firm. The economy\nis more efficient because market disciplines will\ntend to reduce shortsighted, opportunistic and\nultimately wasteful business practices. A betterfunctioning market will require lenders who are\nbetter informed about borrowers’ capacity to service debt and borrowers who are better informed\nabout the commitments they are making. When\nlenders and borrowers alike understand their\ncommitments and risks, sub-optimal outcomes\nsuch as mortgage write-downs and foreclosures\nare less likely. Society benefits from a more efficient use of its scarce resources.\nI’ll begin by describing the current non-prime\nmarket and providing some basic background on\nthe sector. Next comes a discussion of the role of\nmortgage brokers and realtors and the reputations\nthey establish. I’ll finish with a few comments on\nthe Federal Reserve’s oversight role in the nonprime market, including a summary of what initiatives and actions we’re undertaking.\nBefore proceeding, I want to emphasize that\nthe views I express here are mine and do not\nnecessarily reflect official positions of the Federal\nReserve System. I thank my colleagues at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for their comments. William R. Emmons, senior economist in\nthe Banking Supervision and Regulation Division,\nand Rajdeep Sengupta, economist in the Research\nDivision, provided special assistance. I retain\nfull responsibility for errors.\n\nTHE NON-PRIME MORTGAGE\nMARKET: SUBPRIME AND ALT-A\nSECTORS\nMarket convention is evolving toward a differentiation between prime and non-prime mortgages, and further to subprime and Alt-A sectors\nof the non-prime market. Analysts face problems\n2\n\nin gathering accurate information about the nonprime mortgage markets. I won’t dwell on those\nhere, but my text, which is available on the St.\nLouis Fed web site, describes these difficulties\nin greater detail.\nAccording to the federal banking and thrift\nregulatory agencies, subprime mortgages are\nthose made to borrowers who display, among\nother characteristics, (i) a previous record of\ndelinquency, foreclosure or bankruptcy, (ii) a low\ncredit score, and/or (iii) a ratio of debt service to\nincome of 50 percent or greater (Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency, et al., 2007). An\nAlt-A mortgage—short for “alternative-A” and\nalso known as “A minus”—is one made to a borrower who might be of prime credit quality but\nwho does not qualify for a prime loan because\nthere is something missing or irregular in the loan\napplication. The borrower’s credit record may be\nincomplete or slightly impaired, or the borrower\nmay be purchasing the property as an investment\nrather than to live in it (Chomsisengphet and\nPennington-Cross, 2006). An application file is\ndeemed incomplete when it is missing certain\ninformation, as, for example, when the borrower\nis unwilling or unable to document income or\nassets to the lender’s satisfaction. An irregular\napplication might be one where the borrower\ndoes not have a large enough downpayment to\nsatisfy the lender’s standard underwriting criteria for prime credit. Alternatively, the borrower’s\ncredit history may be short, perhaps because the\nborrower is young. Thus, the non-prime mortgage\nsector consists of mortgages that entail a borrowing household with a B, C or D credit grade, a\nnon-standard or incomplete loan application or\ncredit history, or all of these.\nNon-prime mortgages carry interest rates\nnotably higher than those on prime mortgages.\nFor a non-prime fixed-rate mortgage (FRM), the\nspread over a prime FRM could be several percentage points, depending on the borrower and\nthe loan. For a non-prime adjustable-rate mortgage\n(ARM), the initial rate could be one-half to one\npercentage point above a comparable prime ARM\ninitial interest rate, while the fully implemented\nmargin of a non-prime ARM could be two or\n\n\fReputation and the Non-Prime Mortgage Market\n\nthree percentage points higher than the margin\non a prime ARM, itself likely to be as much as\nthree percentage points.2\nHigher rates are one, but not the only, important distinguishing characteristic of non-prime\nloans. High rates are necessary for lenders to make\nan adequate return on investment when facing\nrelatively high underwriting costs and prospectively high delinquency and default rates. Charging high rates, therefore, reflects cost- and\nrisk-based pricing and can be perfectly consistent\nwith competitive markets. It is important to understand that high rates on non-prime mortgages do\nnot, per se, indicate either a lack of competition\nor predatory behavior by lenders.\nThere are several other notable differences\nbetween prime and non-prime loans. Prime mortgages are more likely to include a fixed interest\nrate for the life of the loan as well as automatic\nfunding of, and disbursement from, an escrow\naccount used to pay the homeowner’s taxes and\ninsurance obligations. During most periods, a\nlarger fraction of prime mortgage loans are for\nhome purchase than for refinancing, in contrast\nto the non-prime sector, where refinancing is a\nmore common loan purpose. Non-prime loans\ntypically charge higher up-front fees, are more\nlikely to include prepayment penalties, may\naccept limited or no documentation of the borrower’s income or assets, and may be used by\ninvestors rather than by owner-occupiers. Some\nof these practices in the non-prime market have\nbeen responsible for high default rates and it is no\ndoubt true that lenders are much more cautious\ntoday than a few years ago in accepting limited\ndocumentation.\nAnother distinguishing feature of the nonprime sector is product innovation. In contrast\nto the traditional 30-year, fixed-rate, amortizing\nmortgage that dominates the prime sector, the sub-\n\nprime and Alt-A sectors include a wide variety\nof adjustable and hybrid interest-rate structures,\ntogether with a range of principal-amortization\noptions.3 Of particular note is the recent popularity of so-called “negatively amortizing” mortgages,\nsuch as the “pay-option ARM.” The federal banking and thrift supervisory agencies issued guidance in 2006 that described these complex\nmortgages and provided direction to supervisors\nand lenders on how best to offer and manage\nthese loans (Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency, et al., 2006).\n\nEVOLUTION OF THE NON-PRIME\nMORTGAGE MARKET\nIn the prime mortgage market, securitization\nbegan around 1970. Packaging mortgages into\nsecurities was an important innovation, as it permitted development of a secondary market in\nmortgages and allowed banks and other mortgage\noriginators to control portfolio risk by selling\nmortgages into the capital market. In the nonprime market, securitization began in earnest only\nin the mid-1990s. In part because securitization\nexpertise and distribution networks existed\nalready for prime mortgages, the growth of nonprime securitization has been even more rapid\nthan early developments in the prime sector. It\ntook about 35 years for three quarters of prime\nmortgage originations to be securitized, but a\ncomparable share may be reached in half the\ntime in the non-prime market (Chomsisengphet\nand Pennington-Cross, 2006).\nAlong with an increased volume of creditrelated information about households and\nimprovements in credit-risk analysis by lenders,\nsecuritization probably is the key factor that supported the burgeoning growth of the non-prime\n\n2\n\nAn ARM margin is the amount by which the borrower’s interest rate exceeds the index rate, such as one-year LIBOR.\n\n3\n\nA so-called hybrid mortgage commences with a fixed rate for a few years and then converts to an adjustable rate for the duration of the mortgage\nterm. For example, a 2/28 hybrid has a fixed rate for two years, after which the rate begins to adjust every six or 12 months with reference to\nan index rate, such as six-month LIBOR or the one-year Treasury yield. A subprime 2/28 mortgage might carry a 550 basis-point margin, which\nmeans that, after the initial two-year “teaser” rate has expired, the fully indexed mortgage rate will be the index rate plus 550 basis points.\nThere may be contractual limits on how quickly the mortgage rate may adjust toward the fully indexed rate, as well as limits on how much\nthe mortgage rate may change during the life of the loan.\n\n3\n\n\fFINANCIAL MARKETS\n\nmortgage market since the mid-1990s. By opening\nlocal non-prime mortgage markets to national\nand global capital markets, the flow of capital to\nthe sector surged as never before. Rising house\nprices also played an important role, as borrowers\nand lenders came to expect healthy gains in the\nequity that borrowers had in their houses, supporting more aggressive loan-to-value ratios in\nunderwriting both first- and second-lien mortgages. Finally, household incomes have grown\nrelatively rapidly in comparison to the cost of\nborrowing—especially during the early part of\nthis decade, when economic recovery preceded\nthe gradual upward movement of market interest\nrates.\nOne aspect of recent developments was odd\nand has turned out to be the source of much difficulty in the non-prime market. The steep yield\ncurve during much of the 2002-04 period reflected\ninvestor expectations that short-term interest rates\nwould be rising, which they in fact did. Yet, many\nmortgage-market participants apparently did not\nanticipate this increase. Of course, I would not\nexpect average homeowners to be able to read\nthe yield curve, but I find it odd that apparently\nsophisticated investors in non-prime mortgagebacked securities now claim surprise that many\nnon-prime ARM borrowers are facing payment\nshock because of the increase in short-term interest\nrates over the past few years. Apparently driven\nby the prospects of high fee income and substantial spreads on non-prime ARMs, mortgage originators persuaded many relatively unsophisticated\nborrowers to take out these mortgages; then,\ninvestors willingly purchased them when they\nwere securitized. Many of these mortgages are\nnow in default, some of the lenders are bankrupt,\nand the mortgage-backed securities are trading at\ndeep discounts to face value.\nIt is important to emphasize that what is odd\nis not that there was a risk of rising short-term\ninterest rates, as there always is, but that the market clearly expected an increase, as indicated by\nthe shape of the yield curve. This expectation, in\nturn, was encouraged by the Fed’s Open Market\nCommittee. The policy statement issued at the\nconclusion of the FOMC meeting of May 4, 2004,\n4\n\nsaid that “the Committee believes that policy\naccommodation can be removed at a pace that is\nlikely to be measured.” A similar phrase appeared\nin subsequent FOMC policy statements until\nDecember 2005, when the language was changed\nslightly to “the Committee judges that some further\nmeasured policy firming is likely to be needed.”\nAt its next meeting, in January 2006, the language\nchanged from “is likely to be needed” to “may\nbe needed,” and somewhat similar language\nremained in the policy statement through the\nFOMC meeting in January 2007.\nGiven these widely held expectations of rising\ninterest rates, it is difficult to avoid the judgment\nthat these ARM loans were poorly underwritten\nat the outset. It was imprudent for mortgage brokers and lenders to approve borrowers who likely\ncould not service the loans when rates rose, and\nit is surprising to me that sophisticated capitalmarket investors willingly purchased securities\nbacked by such poorly underwritten mortgages.\nAs a number of observers have emphasized,\nrapid growth of the non-prime sector has broadened access to mortgage credit in recent years.\nThe Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer\nFinances provides data on the percentage of families that had some mortgage debt on a primary\nresidence at three-year intervals between 1989\nand 2004. Between 1989 and 1995, there was little\nchange in the fraction of families that had a first\nmortgage in any income group, except for the\nincome group representing the 20 percent of families with the lowest incomes, where the fraction\nof families with mortgages rose from 7.6 percent\nto 10.4 percent. Gains for these families continued\nafter 1995, with the fraction of those with mortgages rising to 15.9 percent in 2004. Thus, in a\nperiod of only 15 years, from 1989 to 2004, the\npercentage of families in the lowest income quintile that had mortgages more than doubled.\nBetween 1995 and 2004, the fraction of families with a mortgage on a primary residence\nincreased notably in all income groups. The\nlargest increases were among families below the\nhighest income quintile, suggesting that access\nto mortgage credit may have increased most for\nfamilies that were in the middle and lower parts\n\n\fReputation and the Non-Prime Mortgage Market\n\nTable 1\nIncidence of Mortgage Debt on Primary Residence\nFamily income quintile\nPercent of families that had some\nmortgage debt on a primary residence\n\nI\nLowest\n\nII\n\nIII\n\nIV\n\nV\nHighest\n\nAll\nfamilies\n\n1989\n\n7.6\n\n23.4\n\n37.8\n\n56.4\n\n72.1\n\n39.5\n\n1995\n\n10.4\n\n25.9\n\n38.2\n\n59.1\n\n71.4\n\n41.0\n\n2004\n\n15.9\n\n29.5\n\n51.7\n\n65.8\n\n76.5\n\n47.9\n\nChange, 1989-1995\n\n+2.8\n\n+2.5\n\n+0.4\n\n+2.7\n\n–0.8\n\n+1.5\n\nChange, 1995-2004\n\n+5.5\n\n+3.6\n\n+13.5\n\n+6.7\n\n+5.1\n\n+6.9\n\nSOURCE: Survey of Consumer Finances, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nof the income distribution. The middle-income\nquintile—those families with incomes between\nthe 40th and the 60th percentiles of the income\ndistribution—is particularly striking. After essentially no increase in the incidence of first mortgages between 1989 and 1995, the fraction\nincreased 13.5 percentage points between 1995\nand 2004. This period coincides with the most\nrapid growth of the non-prime mortgage market,\nand it is likely that families in lower and middleincome groups were among those receiving nonprime mortgages. Table 1 provides more complete\ndata.\nThe data just discussed cover all mortgages.\nComprehensive, long-term data are not readily\navailable on the share of the non-prime mortgage\nsector in the total market or its composition. One\nreason for the lack of good data on the non-prime\nmarket is that the terms in common use today—\nsubprime and Alt-A, or borrower grades B, C and\nD—are not defined precisely or consistently\nacross lenders or across time. Another reason for\nthe lack of a good historical database is that what\nwe now call the non-prime sector was quite small\nuntil recently, and thus was easily overlooked.\nYet another important reason for the paucity of\ngood data is that these types of mortgages were,\nuntil recently, not even offered by depository\ninstitutions (banks, thrifts or credit unions) or\n4\n\npurchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the\nfederally chartered mortgage institutions. Instead,\na myriad of smaller and specialized nondepository lenders pioneered the subprime and\nAlt-A sectors, and regulatory agencies did not\nrequire these firms to collect and report data to\nthe same extent as their federally regulated\ndepository-institution counterparts.\nGiven these disclaimers about the limits of\nour knowledge, we do know that the total amount\nof home mortgages outstanding at the end of\nMarch 2007 was about $10.4 trillion. It appears\nthat as much as $1.3 trillion of subprime mortgages\nwas outstanding at that time, along with about\nthe same amount of Alt-A mortgages (although\ndifferent data sources provide somewhat different estimates of this sector). Thus, the subprime\nand Alt-A segments each represent 13 or 14 percent of the overall mortgage market. These sectors\ntogether accounted for only about 10 percent of\nmortgage originations in 1995 (Chomsisengphet\nand Pennington-Cross, 2006).\nThe jumbo sector—comprising mortgages\nlarger than the maximum loan size eligible for\npurchase by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac—consisted of perhaps $2.5 trillion in March 2007,\nwhile prime, conventional, conforming mortgages\ncomprised the remaining $5 trillion.4 In terms of\n\nThe market shares I cite were estimated by a prominent Wall Street investment firm, while other sources provide somewhat different market\nshares. The precise numbers are not important for my purposes today.\n\n5\n\n\fFINANCIAL MARKETS\n\nthe number of subprime borrowers, there are\nabout 7.5 million first-lien subprime mortgages\noutstanding (Bernanke, 2007c), out of a total of\nmore than 50 million first mortgages.\nDespite the heterogeneity in the non-prime\nmarket, the bottom line is that more people have\naccess to mortgage credit now than ever before.\nThe non-prime market has become very large; it\nis evolving constantly, and yet remains relatively\nopaque. Despite its limitations and flaws, the\nnon-prime market has served a large number of\nborrowers very well.\n\nBROKERS AND REALTORS IN\nTHE NON-PRIME MORTGAGE\nMARKET\nOne of the key features of the U.S. mortgage\nmarket is the large role played by independent\nmortgage brokers. Mortgage brokers are licensed\nand supervised by state, rather than federal,\nauthorities and therefore the industry is not subject to a single, consistent supervisory regime\nacross the nation. The Bureau of Labor Statistics\nreports that about 136,000 people were employed\nas “mortgage and non-mortgage loan brokers” in\nMay 2007, up from about 50,000 just ten years\nago. While the latest employment figure is down\nsomewhat from its recent peak in early 2006, the\nsector’s cumulative employment growth during\nrecent years remains impressive (see Figure 1).\nMortgage brokers are especially important in\nthe non-prime sector. According to a private\nresearch firm’s estimates, about 58 percent of all\nrecent residential mortgage loans involved a mortgage broker, up from about 40 percent a decade\nago.5 About 50 percent of prime mortgage transactions involve a broker, but brokers originated\naround 75 percent of subprime mortgages and\nabout 70 percent of Alt-A loans. Clearly, a nonprime borrower is especially likely to deal with\na state-licensed and -supervised mortgage broker.\nU.S. mortgage brokers are predominantly\nsmall, local firms—precisely the type of entre5\n\n6\n\npreneurial firm that contributes mightily to all\nsegments of the U.S. economy. It is quite plausible\nthat these firms generally are more knowledgeable than larger lenders about local markets and\nborrowers and perhaps can be more responsive\nand innovative. The employees of a local mortgage broker are likely to be long-time residents\nwith a stake in the community.\nIt is clear that a firm operating with little\ncapital investment enjoys some benefits. One\ncould mention the ease of opening up a new\nbusiness, of increasing or decreasing the scale of\noperations, and of moving or closing down the\nbusiness. Operating under a regime of “lighttouch” supervision also keeps costs low and\nenhances flexibility.\nBut the financial risk of operating with little\ncapital is that shocks to the operating environment—such as recent disruptions in secondary\nmarkets for non-prime mortgages—quickly can\ndamage, if not destroy, the business. One of the\nbenefits of financial capital is that it can serve as\na “buffer stock” of patient funding that will help\na firm survive adverse developments in its market.\nClearly, many mortgage brokers are thinly capitalized firms that are facing difficult times now in\nsome markets and segments. Many have already\nentered bankruptcy and others are likely to follow\ngiven the scale of the current mortgage-market\ndownturn. Significant exit from a market sector\nis not a problem as long as subsequent entry\nremains relatively easy, as appears to be the case\nin mortgage broking.\nThere is reason for concern about this business model, however, when capital is so thin that\nowners have little to lose if the business ceases\noperations. If the owners have a significant financial investment in the business, and if this capital\ncannot be withdrawn easily, then the key to profitability is long-term survival in order to earn\nreturns year after year on the invested capital.\nThe owners always will keep one eye on the\nimmediate prospects for short-term profit and\nthe other eye on future profitability.\n\nSimon and Hagerty (2007).

The\nbusiness also requires a continuing flow of capital\nfrom investors willing to buy the mortgages a\nmortgage originator wants to sell and securitize.\nGiven the difficulty any mortgage broker likely\nfaces in differentiating its own products, how\ncan a broker stand out from the crowd to become\na long-term survivor? One way is to give outstanding service to customers in the mortgage-shopping\nprocess. Another way is to stand behind the work\nthe firm does and to be there when a previous\ncustomer (or investor) has a question or complaint.\nTurning these practices into future business\nprospects, attracting both mortgage borrowers\nand investors, is precisely the role for reputation.\n6\n\nAdvertising may help get out a firm’s name,\nbut it is the firm’s good name and reputation\nspread through word of mouth that pays the\nhighest dividends.6 As former Federal Reserve\nChairman Greenspan aptly put it, reputation can\nbe thought of as a valuable asset in its own right:\nTrust as the necessary condition for commerce\nwas particularly evident in freewheeling\nnineteenth-century America, where reputation\nbecame a valued asset…In such an environment, a reputation for honest dealing, which\nmany feared was in short supply, was particularly valued. Even those inclined to be less\nthan scrupulous in their personal dealings had\nto adhere to a more ethical standard in their\nmarket transactions, or they risked being driven\nout of business (Greenspan, 2005).\n\nI do not mean to suggest that only mortgage brokers would benefit from greater investments in reputation and focus on the long term. Even\nsome large Wall Street firms active in underwriting, trading, and investing in non-prime mortgage-backed securities appear to have hesitated\nin recent months when asked by some of their counterparties to prove that their reputations are of great value—to demonstrate the old adage\nin financial markets, “My word is my bond.” Given that these firms have large capital investments and that they deal repeatedly with each\nother, one would have thought that reputation would be sacrosanct.\n\n7\n\n\fFINANCIAL MARKETS\n\nThe non-prime mortgage business may not\nbe as freewheeling as nineteenth-century America,\nbut it has come in for its fair share of criticism\nrecently, to be sure. A reputation for honest dealing surely would be an investment well worth\nmaking by many of today’s market participants\nthat would pay dividends well into the future—\nnot just for the firms building their reputations,\nbut for all other market participants, as well.\nRealtors also have an important responsibility in the mortgage market. From happy experience over the years, I myself know how valuable\na realtor can be in providing advice and information on neighborhoods, their schools, quirks of\nlocal government and everything else a homeowner should discover before making a commitment to buy a particular house. Realtors can help\npotential mortgage borrowers shop for mortgages\nand select mortgage terms appropriate for the\nindividual circumstances of each borrower.\n\nTHE FEDERAL RESERVE AND\nTHE NON-PRIME MORTGAGE\nMARKET\nThe Federal Reserve had followed developments in housing and the non-prime mortgage\nmarkets very closely this year (Bernanke, 2007a,\n2007b, 2007c). A highly visible development is\nthe growing amount of financial stress among\nsome of the millions of households with nonprime mortgages. We know that many non-prime\nmortgage lenders and brokers have gone out of\nbusiness or tightened their lending standards this\nyear, reducing the flow of mortgage credit to borrowers unable to access the prime market. Financial markets have dealt harshly, but on the whole\nappropriately, with banks, hedge funds and certain other investors who were heavily exposed\nto the riskiest segments of the non-prime securitized mortgage market.\n\nWhile none of these developments is pleasant\nfor the lenders and financial firms most directly\naffected, one cannot help being impressed with\nthe even-handedness of it all. Until we receive\nclear evidence that basically sound financial\ndecisions and arrangements were disrupted by\nerratic and irrational market forces, I believe we\nshould conclude that this year’s markets punished\nmostly bad actors and/or poor lending practices.\nLenders who made loans to borrowers without\ndocumentation, or who did not check borrower\ndocuments that proved fraudulent, or who made\nadjustable-rate loans to borrowers who could not\nhope to service the debt when rates adjusted up,\ndeserved financial failure. As is often the case,\nthe market’s punishment of unsound financial\narrangements has been swift, harsh and without\nprejudice. While I cannot feel sorry for the\nlenders who have gone out of business, my attitude is entirely different toward the relatively\nunsophisticated, but honest, borrowers who\nhave lost their homes through foreclosure. Many\nare true victims.\nLike other observers, we have noted with\ngreat concern the increasing delinquency and\nforeclosure rates on certain non-prime loan categories during 2006 and 2007. Because Congress\nhas assigned to the Federal Reserve and to the\nFederal Trade Commission the primary responsibility of interpreting and implementing several\nimportant consumer-protection statutes, we\nhave been undertaking a number of consumerprotection initiatives and actions.7 We have been\nworking on revising required credit-card disclosures for several years and, beginning in 2006, we\nhave turned our attention increasingly to nonprime-mortgage issues. I will list briefly some of\nthe more important recent Federal Reserve consumer-protection initiatives related to non-prime\nmortgages:8\n\n7\n\nMost notably, the Federal Reserve is responsible for implementing the Truth in Lending Act (TILA, implemented as Regulation Z) and for\ndefining unfair and deceptive acts and practices under and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA, implemented as Regulation C) and\nits key amendments, the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA), and under the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act).\nThe Fed’s enforcement authority, however, is limited to the financial institutions the Federal Reserve supervises directly.\n\n8\n\nFor more details, see Chairman Bernanke’s Congressional testimony (Bernanke, 2007a).\n\n8\n\n\fReputation and the Non-Prime Mortgage Market\n\n• In coordination with the other federal\nsupervisory agencies, we are encouraging\nthe financial industry to work with borrowers to arrange prudent loan modifications\nto avoid unnecessary foreclosures.\n• Federal Reserve banks around the country\nare cooperating with community and\nindustry groups that work directly with\nborrowers having trouble meeting their\nmortgage obligations.\n• We are working with organizations that\nprovide counseling about mortgage products to current and potential homeowners.\n• We are meeting with market participants—\nincluding lenders, investors, servicers and\ncommunity groups—to discuss their concerns and to gain information about market\ndevelopments.\n• We are conducting a top-to-bottom review\nof possible actions we might take to help\nprevent recurrence of recent problems,\nincluding more-effective disclosures to\nhelp consumers defend against improper\nlending.\n• We held five public hearings across the\ncountry during 2006 and 2007, during\nwhich we gathered information on the\nadequacy of disclosures for mortgages, particularly for nontraditional and adjustablerate products (see Kroszner, 2007, for more\ninformation).\n• By the end of the year, we will propose\nchanges to TILA rules to address concerns\nabout mortgage loan advertisements and\nsolicitations that may be incomplete or\nmisleading and to require lenders to provide mortgage disclosures more quickly so\nthat consumers can get the information\nthey need when it is most useful to them.\n• We have improved a disclosure that creditors must provide to every applicant for an\nadjustable-rate mortgage product to explain\nbetter the features and risks of these products, such as “payment shock” and rising\nloan balances.\n\n• We plan to exercise our authority under the\nHome Ownership and Equity Protection\nAct (HOEPA) to address specific practices\nthat are unfair or deceptive, including but\nnot limited to pre-payment penalties, the\nuse of escrow accounts for taxes and insurance, stated-income and low-documentation\nlending, and the evaluation of a borrower’s\nability to repay.\n• In coordination with the other federal\nsupervisory agencies, in 2006, the Fed\nissued principles-based guidance on nontraditional mortgages, and, in June of 2007,\nthe Fed issued supervisory guidance on\nsubprime lending.\n• We reviewed our policies related to the\nexamination of non-bank subsidiaries of\nbank and financial holding companies for\ncompliance with consumer protection laws\nand guidance.\n• As a result of that review and following\ndiscussions with the Office of Thrift\nSupervision, the Federal Trade Commission\nand state regulators, as represented by the\nConference of State Bank Supervisors and\nthe American Association of Residential\nMortgage Regulators, we are launching a\ncooperative pilot project aimed at expanding\nconsumer protection compliance reviews\nat selected non-depository lenders with\nsignificant subprime mortgage operations.\nBased on these activities, I think you will\nagree that the Federal Reserve takes its consumerprotection responsibilities in the area of nonprime mortgage lending very seriously.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nEvery mortgage foreclosure is a tragedy for\nthe borrower, except perhaps those where the\nborrower participated in a fraud. Yet this observation does not by itself suggest what can or\nshould be done to improve the functioning of\nthe mortgage market. Based on my observation\nof financial markets, institutions and regulation\n9\n\n\fFINANCIAL MARKETS\n\nover many years, I am convinced that we need to\nsearch for ways to strengthen borrower protections\nwithout so increasing regulatory costs and risks\nto lenders that they withdraw from the non-prime\nmarket. When we consider regulations designed\nto address abusive lending practices, we need to\nunderstand their possible impact on responsible\nlenders. We will not be helping potential borrowers if we eliminate abuses by imposing regulations\nthat have the unintended effect of eliminating\nthe entire subprime market. My comment is not\na counsel of despair, but a counsel of caution.\nRegulators need to be creative and not necessarily\ninactive.\nWe need to emphasize individual responsibility and accountability in every corner of the\nmarket. Lenders and brokers who put naive borrowers into unsuitable mortgages, which later go\ninto default, deserve the losses they suffer. But\nthese lenders and brokers also lose a long-term\nbusiness opportunity. A successful borrower,\nwho is able to stay current on a subprime mortgage, can expect to become a prime borrower in\ntime. Every mortgage lender or broker should\nwant that borrower to become a repeat customer.\nRegulators should do what they can to help\neducate borrowers and encourage improvements\nof incentives and business practices. If any of\nyou believe there are ways the Federal Reserve\ncan help in providing information, I hope you\nwill call on us so we can be partners in this\nendeavor.\nThank you, and I’d be delighted to take your\nquestions.\n\nREFERENCES\nBernanke, Ben S. “Semiannual Monetary Policy\nReport to Congress.” Presented to the Committee on\nFinancial Services, U.S. House of Representatives,\nJuly 18, 2007a, http://www.federalreserve.gov/\nboarddocs/hh/2007/july/testimony.htm.\nBernanke, Ben S. “The Housing Market and Subprime\nLending.” Presented to the 2007 International\nMonetary Conference, Cape Town, South Africa\n(via satellite), June 5, 2007b,\n10\n\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/\n2007/20070605/default.htm.\nBernanke, Ben S. “The Subprime Mortgage Market.”\nPresented at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago’s\n43rd Annual Conference on Bank Structure and\nCompetition, Chicago, Illinois, May 17, 2007c,\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/\n2007/20070517/default.htm.\nChomsisengphet, Souphala and Pennington-Cross,\nAnthony. “The Evolution of the Subprime Mortgage\nMarket.” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review,\nJanuary/February 2006, 88(1), pp. 31-56,\nhttp://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/\n06/01/ChomPennCross.pdf.\nGreenspan, Alan. “Commencement Address.”\nPresented at the Wharton School, University of\nPennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, May 15,\n2005, http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/\nspeeches/2005/20050515/.\nKroszner, Randall S. “Encouraging Responsible\nMortgage Lending: Prospective Rulemaking\nInitiatives.” Presented at the public hearing under\nthe Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act\n(HOEPA), Federal Reserve Board, Washington, DC,\nJune 14, 2007.\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency, et al, Joint\nPress Release, “Federal Financial Regulatory\nAgencies Issue Final Guidance on Nontraditional\nMortgage Product Risks,” Sept. 29, 2006,\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/\nbcreg/2006/20060929/default.htm.\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency, et al, Joint\nPress Release, “Federal Financial Regulatory\nAgencies Issue Final Statement on Subprime\nMortgage Lending,” June 29, 2007.\nQuigley, John M. “Federal Credit and Insurance\nPrograms: Housing.” Federal Reserve Bank of St.\nLouis Review, July/August 2006, 88(4), pp. 281-309.\nSimon, Ruth, and Hagerty, James R. “Mortgage Mess\nShines Light on Brokers’ Role.” Wall Street\nJournal, July 5, 2007, p. A1.\n\n\fReputation and the Non-Prime Mortgage Market\n\nAPPENDIX\nClassifying the Non-Prime Mortgage Market\nThere are several conceptually distinct approaches to classifying the various segments of the residential mortgage market. The sector classifications sometimes overlap each other, and sometimes they\ncreate anomalies of various sorts. This appendix provides a brief introduction to some of the classification schemes used in the mortgage market.\nConventional vs. Non-Conventional. One way to split the market is to distinguish between\ngovernment-insured or -guaranteed mortgages and the private, or “conventional” sector. The government (non-conventional) sector comprises mortgages made by private lenders but backed by the Federal\nHousing Administration (FHA) or the Veterans Administration (VA). Government-guaranteed mortgages constitute only about 10 percent of the total market today.9\nConforming vs. Non-Conforming. Another way to split the mortgage market is to distinguish\nbetween mortgages eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac—so-called “conforming”\nmortgages—and all others (“non-conforming”). The conforming share of the market is perhaps 70\npercent in the sense that this fraction of borrowing households could qualify for a mortgage eligible\nfor purchase by Fannie or Freddie if they chose to submit such an application. The actual purchases\nmade by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were just over 50 percent of the total market earlier this decade\nand now are below half. In addition, some conforming mortgages are held by the loan originators or\nsold to others without the intermediation of Fannie or Freddie.\nThe conforming market is entirely conventional and prime, but there are conventional and prime\nmortgages that are not conforming. The non-conforming sector includes “jumbo” mortgages—those\nlarger than the upper limit placed by law on Fannie and Freddie purchases—and others that fail to meet\nFannie and Freddie underwriting guidelines for one reason or another. The subprime, Alt-A and jumbo\nsectors emerged from the conventional, non-conforming part of the mortgage market.\nSubprime Mortgage Lenders vs. Prime Lenders. A third mortgage classification scheme is especially important for understanding the subprime sector and federal consumer-protection efforts in this\narea. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) deems all mortgage loans\nsubprime that are made by a lending institution engaged primarily in that business line.10 While not\nideal from an analytical perspective because it lumps together some dissimilar mortgages and borrowers simply because they have a common originator, the HUD classification scheme is extremely important in practical terms.11 This classification convention is followed both for Home Mortgage Disclosure\nAct (HMDA) reporting purposes and by the Mortgage Bankers Association when compiling its widely\nused mortgage-originations and -delinquency surveys.\nSubprime Mortgage Products and Practices vs. Prime Products and Practices. A fourth approach\nto determining what the non-prime market is could be termed a product- and practices-based approach.\nSome consumer advocates have argued that certain mortgage features, product types or underwriting\npractices are targeted to vulnerable populations, such as minorities, women, households with irregular\nincomes and others. These advocates argue that some features, products and practices—such as pre9\n\nFor more information on government mortgage programs, see Quigley (2006).\n\n10\n\nFor details of HUD’s methodology and a list of subprime lenders, see the HUD website, http://www.huduser.org/datasets/manu.html.\n\n11\n\nFor more information on HMDA and the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act amendments to HMDA, see\nhttp://stlouisfed.org/hmdaregcamendments/default.html.\n\n11\n\n\fFINANCIAL MARKETS\n\npayment penalties, hybrid ARMs with introductory teaser rates, underwriting without regard to longrun mortgage affordability and yield-spread premiums paid to brokers by lenders—are deceptive and\nabusive in their own rights. In other words, the advocates argue that these features, products and practices should be considered per se subprime—if not predatory—and deserving of greater oversight. In\nthis view, some borrowers who could have qualified for a prime mortgage end up with more-expensive\nsubprime or Alt-A loans because they are part of a group that is targeted to receive a non-prime mortgage.\n\n12\n\n\f"

        "content": "Changing World Demographics and\nTrade Imbalances\nThe American European Community Association (AECA)\nRound-Table Conference Luncheon\nBrussels, Belgium\nApril 16, 2007\n\nI\n\nam very pleased to have the opportunity\nto be involved in today’s discussion. I\nknow that the American European\nCommunity Association plays an important role in improving international understanding by organizing discussions on numerous\nissues that are of importance to both American\nand European audiences.\nThe world economy is characterized by three\nhighly unusual conditions. First, the capital flow\ninto the United States from the rest of the world\nand accompanying rest-of-world current account\nsurplus—the U.S. current account deficit—is very\nlarge and persistent. Second, the U.S. personal\nsaving rate has been falling and past year became\nnegative for the first time since 1933. Third, highincome countries are just now beginning a demographic transition in which the fraction of retired\npersons in the total population will rise to levels\nnever before experienced. The idea I will explore\nwith you is that these three conditions are connected; the first two, I believe, are to a considerable extent a consequence of the third.\nToday’s topic on the connection between\ndemographic changes and trade balances certainly\nis important. My analysis combines demographic\nand economics facts with economic theory to\nprovide some insights into the connections\nbetween demographic changes and international\ntrade. I hope that my comments will contribute\nat least in some small measure to increasing international understanding, especially given the\ncritical importance of an open international\ntrading system to improvements in economic\n\ngrowth in all our countries. I especially want to\nhighlight my unease with using the term\n“imbalances” to characterize the current situation. That term almost begs for a policy response—\nhow can policymakers allow imbalances to\npersist? Unfortunately, policy responses could\nwell involve damaging protectionist measures.\nI will argue that, to a large extent, the current\nsituation is not fundamentally an imbalance but\nrather a condition that is conducive to coping\nwith the major demographic changes that are\noccurring throughout the world.\nBefore proceeding, I offer the standard\nFederal Reserve disclaimer. The views expressed\nare mine and do not necessarily reflect official\npositions of the Federal Reserve System. I appreciate comments provided by my colleagues at\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Cletus C.\nCoughlin, vice president in the Research Division,\nprovided special assistance. However, I am\nresponsible for any errors.\n\nCURRENT ACCOUNT BALANCES:\nFACTS AND EXPLANATIONS\nLarge and persistent current account surpluses and deficits are common in the global\neconomy today, as illustrated in Figure 1. Since\nearly 1998, the U.S. current account has trended\ndownward, a fact that has attracted much attention not only in the United States but also throughout the world. As a share of U.S. GDP, the U.S.\ncurrent account deficit has increased from roughly\n1\n\n\fINTERNATIONAL TRADE AND FINANCE\n\n2 percent to a level exceeding 6.5 percent in 2006.\nPrior to recent developments, since 1960 the\nlargest U.S. current account deficit was nearly\n3.5 percent during the mid-1980s, thought at the\ntime to be unusually large. It is clear that today’s\nU.S. current account deficit substantially exceeds\nany other such deficits during the second half of\nthe last century.\nThe United States, however, is not the only\ncountry with a current account deficit that is a\nrelatively large share of its gross domestic product. In fact, certain European nations fit such a\ndescription. Figure 2 of the handout shows this\nratio for the European Union and for selected\nEuropean countries, some of which have current\naccount deficits relative to GDP larger than the\nUnited States. For example, both Spain and\nPortugal have current account deficits that are\nclose to 10 percent of GDP.\nGiven the logic of balance of payments\naccounting, the current account deficits of countries such as the United States, Spain, and Portugal\nmust be offset by current account surpluses in\nthe rest of the world. One observation is that the\ntiming of the increase in the U.S. current account\ndeficit roughly coincides with an increase in the\ncurrent account position of developing countries\nas a group, with developing countries in Asia\nbeing an especially noteworthy subset. This fact\nis shown in Figure 1.\nNot surprisingly, the large changes in current\naccount balances have attracted much interest\nfrom researchers. Economic theory can be used\nto identify various factors that affect international\ncapital flows. Potential explanations for a world\neconomy in which some countries exhibit large\ncurrent account surpluses and others exhibit large\ncurrent account deficits abound. For example,\nJoseph Gruber and Steven Kamin (2005) identified\nseven explanations for the increasing U.S. current\naccount deficit and the increasing surpluses of\nEast Asian economies. Time constraints preclude\nmore than a cryptic identification of the explanations. These explanations highlight the following:\n1) the increase of the U.S. fiscal deficit; 2) the\ndecline in the U.S. private saving rate; 3) the U.S.\nproductivity surge; 4) the increase in global finan2\n\ncial intermediation; 5) the global saving glut and\nemerging markets financial crises, which is an\nexplanation closely associated with Fed Chairman\nBen Bernanke; 6) exchange rate intervention by\nspecific Asian countries; and 7) increasing oil\nprices. Undoubtedly, some of these explanations\nare relevant for understanding the current global\npattern of current account imbalances.\nIn a recent paper Olivier Blanchard (2007)\nargues that an explanation for the U.S. deficit\nand the corresponding foreign surpluses requires\na combination of many of the preceding explanations. Specifically, he argues that low U.S. saving—private as well as public—is one key factor.\nAnother is high foreign saving—particularly in\nAsia. A third is low investment in a number of\ncountries in both Europe and Asia. The fourth\nkey factor is strong investor preference for U.S.\nassets relative to those of other countries.\nBlanchard’s argument is supported by information such as that contained in Ben Bernanke’s\n2005 speech discussing the global saving glut\nand by data on the U.S. current account balance\nby geographic regions.\nTable 1A contains data on current account\nbalances throughout the world for 1996, 2000,\n2004 and 2005. A comparison of 1996 with 2005\nhighlights some important developments. First,\nthe current account position of industrial countries has changed from surplus to deficit. Without\nquestion, the change in the U.S. current account\nbalance overwhelms changes in other countries.\nSecond, developing countries, most notably China,\nare exporting capital to the industrial countries;\nthis capital flow, of course, is the counterpart of\nthe current account deficits of the industrial\ncountries.\nTable 1B provides some geographic detail on\nthe U.S. current account deficit for 2006. The\nUnited States is running a current account deficit\nwith every major region of the world.

Such an explanation is closely connected\nto private saving and investment decisions. While\nthis explanation is certainly not novel and has\nreceived attention by researchers, I think it merits\nincreased attention, especially in policy discussions. Similar to the explanations offered above,\na demographic explanation can be only a partial,\nthough I believe quantitatively important, explanation of the current global pattern of national\ncurrent account surpluses/deficits.\nThere are many reasons that I think a demographic perspective merits more attention. A\ndemographic perspective is necessarily a longterm view, which I think is required for understanding the persistence of current account\nsurpluses and deficits. A demographic perspective also forces one to think through the underlying general equilibrium process that determines\ncurrent account balances across countries.\nMany policymakers and economists worry\nthat the U.S. current account deficit is too large.\nObviously, the U.S. deficit cannot continue to\nexpand indefinitely, which has led to a literature\non the sustainability of the deficit. How much\nlarger will these deficits become before they are\nreversed and will the reversal be orderly or disruptive? In my comments today I want to highlight the potential effects of demographic changes\non contributing to an orderly adjustment.\n\nCHANGING NATIONAL\nDEMOGRAPHICS THROUGHOUT\nTHE WORLD: SOME FACTS\nThe logical place to begin a demographic\ndiscussion is with some facts about population\ngrowth. World population growth has slowed\nand, using recent projections from the United\nNations, it is likely that population growth will\nslow further. A notable development is the changing distribution of population between the socalled “developed” and “less-developed” nations.\n\nTable 1B\n2006 U.S. Current Account Deficit\n($ Billions) Total $856.7\nEurope\nCanada\n\n158.0\n43.8\n\nLatin America\n\n114.0\n\nAsia\n\n440.1\n\nChina\n\n261.7\n\nJapan\n\n112.5\n\nMiddle East\n\n48.1\n\nAfrica\n\n57.6\n\nInternational Organizations\n\n(5.1)\n\nSOURCE: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic\nAnalysis, International Economic Accounts. Release Date\nMarch 14, 2007.\n\nPopulation growth has been much faster in the\npoorer countries than in those with high standards\nof living and wealth. Whereas the developed\ncountries of Europe, North America, Australia\nand New Zealand accounted for roughly onethird of world population in 1900 and about the\nsame percentage in 1950, by 2000, those countries\naccounted for just 20 percent of world population.\nIt seems likely, however, that the population\ngrowth of many lesser-developed countries will\nslow during the present century.\nWorld population has more than doubled in\nthe last 50 years, and it has nearly quadrupled\nsince 1900. Currently, world population is growing at a rate of 1.35 percent per year. The United\nNations’ most recent forecast, however, predicts\na slowing in the growth of world population to\nabout 0.33 percent per year by 2050, at which time\nforecasters are predicting that world population\nwill total 8.9 billion persons.\nWhile the world’s population growth has\nslowed, improvements in life expectancy have\ncontinued. These two conditions are leading to a\nrapid aging of the population, which can be seen\nin Table 2. A good summary measure of a population’s age is the median age—the age such that\nhalf the population is older and half is younger.\n5\n\n\fINTERNATIONAL TRADE AND FINANCE\n\nOver the past half century, the median age of the\nworld’s population has increased by 2.8 years,\nfrom 23.6 in 1950 to 26.4 in 2000. The United\nNations forecasts median age to rise to 36.8 years\nin 2050. More developed countries are expected\nto have an increase in median age from 37.3 years\nto 45.2 years, and lesser developed countries from\n24.1 years to 35.7 years. Using an estimate for\n2005, Japan is the country with the oldest population, having a median age of 42.9 years. Japan\nis projected to have a median age of 54.9 years in\n2050. Similar changes are occurring in Europe.\nItaly, with a median age of 42.0 years in 2005, is\nprojected to have a median age of 50.4 years in\n2050. Comparable numbers for selected countries\nin Western Europe are: Germany—42.1 and 49.4;\nFrance—38.9 and 44.3; and Belgium—40.3 and\n46.2. The United States is not excluded from this\naging; however, the United States remains somewhat younger. The median age of the U.S. population, by contrast, is currently 36.0 years, and is\nforecast to be 41.1 years in 2050.\nChina will also be undergoing a substantial\ndemographic change. China, which has been\nexperiencing rapid growth and is the world’s\nmost populous country, must be included in any\ndiscussion stressing demographic change and\ntrade balances. Between 2005 and 2050, the\nmedian age in China is projected to increase from\n32.5 years to 45.0 years. Note that this absolute\nchange in median age exceeds that of the European\ncountries that I have highlighted. Moreover, and\nremarkably, these projections indicate that in\n2050 China’s median population age will be above\nthat of the United States.\nThe world’s fastest growing age group is comprised of persons 80 years and older. In 2000, 1.1\npercent of world population was aged 80 or older.\nBy 2050, the number aged 80 or older is expected\nto be 4.2 percent of world population. In that year,\n21 countries or areas are projected to have at least\n10 percent of their population aged 80 or over.\nJapan is forecast to have 15.4 percent of its population aged 80 or more. Italy is projected to have\n15.2 percent of its population aged 80 or more.\nMost western European countries will have more\nthan 10 percent of population aged 80 or more.\n6\n\nGermany with 12.3 percent, France with 10.9\npercent and Belgium with 10.6 percent are a few\nexamples. Meanwhile, the United States is projected to have 7.2 percent of its population made\nup of those 80 and older.\nThe critical point to take away from these\npopulation projections is that today the United\nStates has a younger population than Europe and\nmuch younger than Japan. By 2050, these gaps\nwill have grown significantly and even China\nwill have an older population than the United\nStates, measured by median age.\n\nA DEMOGRAPHIC PERSPECTIVE\nON CURRENT ACCOUNT\nBALANCES\nThe projected demographic changes will have\nvery significant economic effects, most notably\non economic growth and, thus, on virtually every\neconomic variable. The connection between\ndemographic changes and international capital\nflows follows directly from the life-cycle theory\nof consumption and saving developed by Franco\nModigliani and Richard Brumberg in their 1954\npaper (1980). The argument is straightforward.\nYoung households save relatively little, because\nof the expense of child rearing. Middle aged\nhouseholds save a lot, in anticipation of retirement. Elderly households, no longer working,\ndraw down assets to pay for their consumption.\nThese ideas are easily extended to the entire\neconomy.\nWhen a population can be characterized as\nmiddle aged, then the economy should tend to\nhave a higher saving rate than when it can be\ncharacterized as elderly. Thus, as the population\nof a country moves from middle aged to elderly,\nit is reasonable to expect a country’s saving rate\nto decrease. Unless the country’s investment rate\nmoves identically, foreign capital flows and current account balances will be affected. Exactly\nhow depends on the change in investment.\nThe decline in the number of workers associated with an aging population tends to depress\ninvestment demand relative to a case of no decline\n\n\fChanging World Demographics and Trade Imbalances\n\nTable 2\nPopulation Projections\nPercentage of population\nMedian Age\n\n65 or older\n\n80 or older\n\nCountry/Area\n\n2005\n\n2050\n\n2005\n\n2050\n\n2005\n\n2050\n\nWorld\nMore developed regions\nLess developed regions\nLeast developed countries\nAfrica\nAsia\nChina\nIndia\nJapan\nEurope\nAustria\nBelgium\nDenmark\nFinland\nFrance\nGermany\nGreece\nIceland\nIreland\nItaly\nLuxembourg\nNetherlands\nNorway\nPortugal\nRussian Federation\nSpain\nSweden\nSwitzerland\nUkraine\nUnited Kingdom\nLatin America/Caribbean\nNorth America\nCanada\nUnited States\nOceania\nAustralia\nNew Zealand\n\n28.0\n38.6\n25.5\n19.0\n19.0\n27.6\n32.5\n23.8\n42.9\n38.9\n40.1\n40.3\n39.5\n40.9\n38.9\n42.1\n40.1\n34.2\n33.4\n42.0\n38.3\n39.1\n38.0\n39.1\n37.3\n38.8\n40.2\n40.1\n38.9\n38.9\n26.0\n36.3\n38.6\n36.0\n32.3\n36.7\n35.5\n\n38.1\n45.7\n36.9\n27.9\n28.0\n40.2\n45.0\n38.6\n54.9\n47.3\n48.0\n46.2\n43.8\n44.4\n44.7\n49.4\n50.1\n44.6\n43.0\n50.4\n40.4\n44.2\n43.7\n48.8\n45.3\n49.5\n43.3\n44.2\n50.0\n43.4\n40.1\n41.5\n45.3\n41.1\n40.0\n43.4\n44.1\n\n7.3\n15.3\n5.5\n3.3\n3.4\n6.4\n7.7\n5.0\n19.7\n15.9\n16.2\n17.3\n15.1\n15.9\n16.3\n18.8\n18.3\n11.7\n11.1\n19.7\n14.2\n14.2\n14.7\n16.9\n13.8\n16.8\n17.2\n15.4\n16.1\n16.1\n6.3\n12.3\n13.1\n12.3\n10.3\n13.1\n12.2\n\n16.2\n26.1\n14.7\n6.9\n6.9\n17.5\n23.7\n14.5\n37.7\n27.6\n29.0\n27.1\n23.9\n25.6\n25.9\n30.2\n31.7\n25.4\n23.4\n32.6\n19.5\n25.2\n23.8\n30.7\n23.8\n33.2\n24.1\n25.0\n27.6\n24.1\n18.5\n21.5\n25.7\n21.0\n19.4\n24.3\n24.1\n\n1.3\n3.7\n0.8\n0.4\n0.4\n1.0\n1.2\n0.7\n4.8\n3.5\n4.3\n4.3\n4.1\n4.0\n4.6\n4.4\n3.5\n3.0\n2.7\n5.1\n3.2\n3.6\n4.6\n3.7\n2.1\n4.3\n5.3\n4.3\n2.6\n4.5\n1.2\n3.5\n3.5\n3.5\n2.6\n3.5\n3.2\n\n4.4\n9.4\n3.6\n1.1\n1.1\n4.5\n7.3\n3.1\n15.5\n9.6\n11.9\n10.7\n9.2\n10.0\n10.2\n13.1\n11.1\n9.6\n6.7\n13.3\n6.9\n10.4\n9.0\n10.1\n5.8\n12.2\n9.3\n11.0\n7.1\n9.2\n5.2\n7.8\n10.0\n7.6\n6.8\n9.3\n9.2\n\nSOURCE: World Population Prospects: The 2006 Revision Population Database, United Nations Population Division.\n\n7\n\n\fINTERNATIONAL TRADE AND FINANCE\n\nin workers. The reason is simple. A country with\na declining work force need not replace all its\ndepreciating capital to maintain its capital stock\nper worker. In contrast, a country with a growing\nwork force must replace depreciating capital and\nadd to its capital stock to prevent the stock per\nworker from falling. Thus, the tendency for saving\nto outrun investment in many countries with\nslowly growing or declining work forces is perfectly sensible and not a sign of imbalance. But\nwith saving outrunning investment, capital flows\nabroad, especially to the United States.1\nEventually, for a country with an aging population, the decline in saving will exceed the decline\nin investment, which will cause the country’s\ncurrent account to decrease. However, it is not\nobvious whether aging would immediately cause\ninvestment to fall more or less than saving. It is\npossible that domestic investment falls more than\nsaving initially because of persistence in saving\nhabits. The key point is that the saving-investment\nbalances of individual countries can evolve in\ncomplex ways.\nThis complexity is compounded by the international dimensions of this issue. The impact of\naging on national saving relative to investment\nwill not necessarily be the same for every country.\nAt the global level, the sum of current account\nbalances must be zero. Thus, what matters is not\nthe fact of aging for a specific country, but rather\nhow it is aging relative to other countries.\n\nCURRENT ACCOUNT STUDIES\nFROM A DEMOGRAPHIC\nPERSPECTIVE\nA number of researchers have used a demographic perspective in their studies of changes\nin the current account. I do not have time to provide a thorough literature review; so, I will limit\nmyself to articles that are especially relevant to\ntoday’s discussion.\n1\n\n8\n\nIn a recent article, Feroli (2006) simulates a\nmulti-region overlapping generations model. The\nmodel is calibrated to match the demographic\ndifferences among G-7 countries from 1950-2000.\nThe demographic differences do explain some of\nthe long-term capital movements among the G-7\ncountries. The model predicts that from 2000-2030\nthe North American members of the G-7, the\nUnited States and Canada, will be net exporters\nof savings, while the rest of the G-7 will import\nsavings. Clearly, Feroli’s model has not correctly\npredicted the timing of the change in direction\nof the U.S. capital account, given that the capital\nflow to the United States continued to grow after\n2000. Nevertheless, the model does illustrate a\nmuch deeper level of detail than the analysis I\nhave outlined here.\nRecent work by Nicoletta Batini, Tim Callen\nand Warwick McKibbin (2006) also provides a\nglobal view of the impacts of the unfolding demographic transition. The authors examine the\nimpacts of the transition for four regions—Japan,\nthe United States, other industrial countries that\nare primarily in Europe and developing countries.\nThey stress four results. First, population aging\nin industrial countries will reduce growth. Not\nsurprisingly, Japan will experience this effect first.\nSecond, developing countries will experience\nstronger growth over the next 20 to 30 years as\nthe relative size of their working-age populations\nincreases. Ultimately, the effects of aging will set\nin for those countries also. Third, and most relevant to the current discussion, demographic\nchange induces changes in saving, investment\nand international capital flows. Specifically, the\nfastest aging countries—Japan and to a much\nlesser extent the other industrial countries—will\nlikely experience large declines in saving and\ncurrent account balances as the elderly support\ncurrent consumption by drawing down their\nassets. Meanwhile, the United States and developing countries will experience increases in their\ncurrent account balances. Fourth, the authors\n\nThis point was made by Higgins (1998), who argued that the demographic “center of gravity” for investment demand should occur prior in\nthe age distribution than for saving. As a result, regions with a relatively higher proportion of their populations in the high saving years should\ntend to have saving exceed investment and thus run current account surpluses.\n\n\fChanging World Demographics and Trade Imbalances\n\nstress—quite appropriately in my view—that the\nresults are sensitive to assumptions made about\nproductivity growth and external risk premia.\nThis point has been made more generally by\nDavid Bloom and David Canning (2004). They\nstress that population aging is a new phenomenon. Consequently, drawing insights from previous economic history is problematic. Fully\nanticipating the myriad of behavioral responses\nto the changing economic conditions, some of\nwhich are the result of policy changes, is difficult to say the least. Consequently, future age-specific behavior is likely to differ from the past. For\nexample, longer working lives appear to be\ninevitable, but how much longer? Such behavioral responses will translate into effects on saving and investment and, therefore, on\ninternational capital flows.\nThe importance of underlying assumptions\nhas also been made in a recent paper by Charles\nEngel and John Rogers (2006). Their analysis is\nfocused on the U.S. current account deficit, but\nthey do not stress demographic factors. In their\nmodel, the U.S. current account balance is determined by the expected discounted present value\nof its future share of world gross domestic product relative to its current share of world gross\ndomestic product. Using what they view are reasonable assumptions about U.S. growth relative\nto other countries, they conclude that it is possible to explain the U.S. current account deficit as\nthe equilibrium outcome of optimal consumption/\nsaving decisions. Of course, if U.S. growth is not\nrobust relative to other countries, then another\nexplanation would be in order to explain the historically large U.S. current account deficit.\n\nDEMOGRAPHICS AND U.S.\nSAVING\nThe low U.S. personal saving rate appears to\nbe a proximate cause of at least part of the U.S.\ncurrent account deficit. The saving rate is the\n2\n\ndifference between disposable personal income\nand consumption, expressed as a fraction of disposable income. The low saving rate—actually\nslightly negative in 2006—does not appear to\nreflect abnormal household behavior. A careful\nexamination of household assets suggests that\nconsumption has been driven importantly by\ngains in asset values, primarily equities and real\nestate.2\nWhy have asset values grown so much in\nrecent years? Part of the answer has to do with\nthe surge in U.S. productivity growth since 1995.\nBut another part is that real interest rates in the\nworld as a whole, and in the United States, appear\nto have declined significantly since the late 1990s.\nThe decline is related to the glut of world saving\nrelative to investment that Bernanke discussed\nin his 2005 speech. Bernanke did not discuss the\norigin of the glut, but I believe that demographics\nhave something to do with it. Many middle-aged\nhouseholds around the world are in their high\nsaving years, in anticipation of retirement—the\nanticipated rapid aging of the populations in many\ncountries. And, as I argued above, the need for\ncapital formation is reduced when labor force\ngrowth is low. Thus, in an aging population saving\ntends to outrun investment, at least for a while.\nThe U.S. population is aging also, of course, but\nat a slower rate than in many other countries.\nThus, differential demographics are central to\ndifferential current accounts.\n\nCONCLUDING COMMENTS\nIt is generally recognized that the world is\nundergoing a major demographic transition.\nPopulation growth is slowing and the age structure of the population is changing, with the shares\nof the young declining and the elderly increasing.\nAssessing the precise implications is complicated\nby the fact that different countries are at different\nstages of this demographic transition. It is also\nimportant to recognize that the scenarios I have\n\nThe analysis supporting this point can be found in my speech, “U.S. Saving,” which was given in Omaha, Nebraska, at the CFA Society of\nNebraska on February 15, 2007.

        "content": "Understanding Inflation\nNational Association for Business Economics (NABE)\nNew York Chapter\nNew York, New York\nApril 2, 2007\n\nO\n\nur economy is fundamentally\nsound. The GDP gap is small.\nPutting aside near-term uncertainties, mostly related to housing and\nhousing finance, economic activity is growing\nat approximately the same rate as potential.\nAlthough fourth quarter GDP growth is now\nestimated to be a 2.5 percent pace, down from\nthe advance estimate of 3.5 percent, much of\nthis markdown was due to a downward revision\nin inventory investment. Final sales of domestic\noutput—GDP minus the change in inventories—\ngrew at a robust 3.7 percent annual rate in the\nfourth quarter and were 3.3 percent higher than\na year earlier. Unemployment in the fourth quarter stood at 4.5 percent, as low as any point in the\ncurrent economic expansion. The employment\nrate—the fraction of the non-institutional population 16 and older with jobs—stood at 63.3 percent, also its high point in the economic expansion. Forecasters anticipate that these favorable\nfundamental conditions will continue; they foresee the economy’s output during the next two\nyears remaining near potential, with a growth\nrate averaging approximately 3 percent.\nAs always, my view on economic growth\nand inflation emphasizes longer-run conditions.\nI could point to numerous past episodes of either\nfaster or slower growth for a few quarters that we\nnow ignore because long-run developments dominated the outcome and indeed dominate our current assessment of these periods. In assessing\nshort-run developments, it is also essential to\nkeep in mind that forecasts have standard errors.\nOver a four-quarter horizon, a GDP forecast has a\nstandard error of about 1.5 percentage points\nand an inflation forecast has a standard error of\nabout 0.5 percentage points. We know also that\n\ndata are often revised. Finally, monetary policy\ncannot affect near-term conditions anyway. Thus,\na focus on medium- and long-term fundamentals\nis always appropriate.\nThe causes of our current prosperity will be\nstudied by economists for some time. Today, I\nwish to discuss one of those: our improved understanding of how price stability contributes to\noverall economic stability. That understanding\nis reflected in the Federal Reserve’s commitment\nto maintaining a low, stable rate of inflation.\nEfforts to improve communications and increase\nthe transparency of policymaking are essential\naspects of that commitment. The public must\nunderstand not only the policy objectives but\nalso the Fed’s objectives and the decision-making\nprocess through which it seeks to attain those\nobjectives—something that I have referred to for\nmany years as “synching” the Fed and financial\nmarkets. This process is eased if policymakers\nfollow what macroeconomists refer to as “rulebased” behavior, particularly rules focused on\nprice stability.\nBefore proceeding, I want to emphasize that\nthe views I express here are mine and do not\nnecessarily reflect official positions of the Federal\nReserve System. I thank my colleagues at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for their comments. Richard G. Anderson, vice president in the\nResearch Division, provided special assistance.\nHowever, I retain full responsibility for errors.\n\nTHE DUAL MANDATE\nUnder the Federal Reserve Act, the Fed has a\ndual mandate to foster both maximum employment and price stability. I regard “price stability”\n1\n\n\fMONETARY POLICY AND INFLATION\n\nas zero inflation, properly measured. What does\n“properly measured” mean? Price indexes have\nbiases of various sorts and experts generally\nbelieve that U.S. indexes overstate inflation by a\nmodest amount. If statisticians understood these\nbiases with precision, the indexes could be corrected. I myself make a rough guess that, for example, the consumer price index overstates inflation\nby about one percentage point a year.\nWith price stability, the average level of all\nprices—correctly measured—would neither\nincrease nor decrease during the medium- and\nlong-run. Price stability in this sense does not\nimply, however, that the prices of individual goods\nand services will not change, nor does it imply\nthat a number of prices cannot change sharply\nduring over the short run, nor does it imply that\nthere cannot be large changes in relative prices.\nIf fossil fuels or metals become more expensive\nrelative to other goods and services, so be it—\nstabilizing the relative prices of energy and metals\nis not a responsibility or even within the power\nof monetary policy. Differentials in productivity\ngrowth among goods and services also may cause\nsharp changes in the relative prices of some products—these are not the responsibility of monetary\npolicy either.\nIn recent years several FOMC members have\nreferred to a “comfort zone” of 1-2 percent inflation measured by the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures, excluding the volatile\nfood and energy components. Because agreement\non some reasonably low rate of inflation is more\nimportant than exactly what that rate is, I am perfectly happy to state my personal inflation objective as an inflation rate measured by the core PCE\nprice index of 1.5 percent, plus or minus 0.5\npercent.1\nIt used to be thought that the dual mandate\nrequired the Fed to temper pursuit of its inflation\ngoal from time to time in the interest of minimizing disturbances to employment. That view began\n1\n\n2\n\nto change 40 years ago. Over time, the mainstream\nview in the economics profession has increasingly\nemphasized the importance of price stability for\nachieving maximum employment and maximum\nsustainable economic growth. I myself have\nbecome passionate about price stability. It is\nimportant to remember that the two greatest\nemployment disasters in U.S. history were the\nGreat Depression and the Great Inflation. Deflation from late 1929 to 1933 drove the U.S. economy down and down, and the unemployment\nrate rose to 25 percent. During the Great Inflation,\nfrom 1965 to 1981, the United States suffered four\nrecessions, the last of which in 1981-82 drove\nthe unemployment rate to a peak of 10.7 percent\nat the end of 1982, the highest since the Great\nDepression.\nExperience abroad confirms the connection\nbetween price instability and unemployment.\nFor one example, Japan suffered a decade of\ndeflation in the 1990s; economic growth was\nminimal and unemployment rose.\n\nSOLIDIFYING PRICE STABILITY\nThe central bank’s primary tool to maximize\nemployment and growth is price stability. The\ncentral bank can refine its pursuit of price stability\nin three important ways. First, the leadership of\na central bank should form a consensus around\nthe goal of a specific low inflation rate; the particular chosen number is less important than commitment to a specific goal. Second, the central\nbank must develop a consistent policy model, or\ndecision framework, for responding to incoming\ndata. The framework must explain how policymakers reconcile near-term movements in inflation,\nover which monetary policy has almost no influence, with the path of medium- to long-term\ninflation, for which the central bank is almost\nwholly responsible. Constructing the policy\n\nI have discussed this range in several previous speeches. For a recent example, see W. Poole, “Inflation, Financial Stability, and Economic\nGrowth,” Global Interdependence Center Abroad in Chile Conference, Santiago, Chile, March 5, 2007 [http://www.stlouisfed.org/news/\nspeeches/2007/pdf/03_05.pdf]. Earlier examples include W. Poole, “The Monetary Policy Model,” Business Economics, October 2006, 41,\npp. 7-10, and W. Poole, “Inflation Targeting,” Junior Achievement of Arkansas Inc., February 16, 2006, published in the Federal Reserve Bank\nof St. Louis Review, May/June 2006, 88(3) pp. 155-163.\n\n\fUnderstanding Inflation\n\nmodel is far from a trivial task. And, third, the\ncentral bank must communicate this framework\nto the public in a credible and transparent way.\nOver the past decade or so, the Fed has gravitated to the position of placing primary emphasis on the core rate of inflation, as measured by\nthe PCE price index excluding food and energy.\nThe reason is that food and energy prices are\nsubject to large short-run disturbances that are\nbeyond the ability of monetary policy to control.\nIf we examine total and core price inflation over\nthree years, the averages are quite close. Food\nand energy prices display substantial short-run\nvariability that does not affect longer-run inflation.\nThe basic, strategic goal is all-items or headline\ninflation; core inflation is a tactical goal in the\nshort run.\nHowever inflation is measured, economists\nagree that monetary policy has at most a minimal\ninfluence on the rate of change in the price level\nover relatively short time periods—months,\nquarters or perhaps even a year. Central banks\nare responsible for medium- and long-term inflation—such inflation, as Milton Friedman wrote,\nis a monetary phenomenon that depends on past,\ncurrent and expected future monetary policy. As\na practical matter, the medium- to long-term\nlikely is a period of two to five years.\nThe phenomenon of modern inflation—a\nsustained, broad-based increase in the economy’s\naverage price level—is one that depends on the\nuse of an inconvertible “fiat” money. Because\nfiat money is not legally linked to specific quantities of any metal or other commodity, it is\nsubject to indefinite expansion. Monetary policymakers are acutely aware of the linkages between\nexcessive money creation and inflation. Although\ntoday central banks do not conduct policy by\ntargeting monetary aggregates, the classic linkage\nbetween money and inflation persists. Figure 1\nshows the correlation during three decades, for a\ncross-section of approximately 70 countries as\navailable on the International Financial Statistics\ndatabase. Inflation is measured as the country’s\nheadline inflation measure, and money is measured as a broad money aggregate (the sum of the\nvariables labeled “money” and “quasi money”\n\nin the database). The scales in all three panels\nare the same. A regression line also is shown,\nalthough it must be interpreted only as a descriptive statistic because money and inflation are\nendogenous, jointly determined variables. Generally, both the rates of inflation and money growth\nhave decreased over the three decades, and the\nscatter of points has become somewhat tighter.\nThe U.S. inflation record is shown in the\ntable of the handout. The data are the implicit\nprice deflator for personal consumption expenditures in the national income accounts; the PCE\nchain-price index behaves similarly except fewer\nhistorical observations are available. The table\nshows decade-average mean inflation rates and\ntheir standard deviations; the left-side columns\nare annual averages, the right-side columns Q4to-Q4 changes. For most periods, the CPI also\nbehaves similarly, except in 1980 when rising\nmortgage rates contributed to a large jump in the\nCPI but are not included in the PCE index.\nFigure 2 shows 10-year trailing moving averages, in the spirit of a backward-looking adaptive\nexpectations model. The figure shows the extent\nto which monetary policymakers failed citizens\nof the United States during the 1970s, a decade\nwhen both the level of inflation and its variance\napproximately tripled. Today, both the level and\nvariance of inflation have returned to their values\nof the late 1950s and early 1960s.\nThe challenge for policymakers is to be certain\nthat the recent behavior of inflation persists. To\nexplain what we know about how to do that, I\nnext discuss the period of the Great Inflation of\nthe 1970s and what lessons it taught us.\n\nTHE GREAT INFLATION AND\nREFORM OF OCTOBER 1979\nUnderstanding inflation in the U.S. economy\ncannot omit discussion of the Great Inflation that\nended with the policy reform of October 1979—\nthe premier event in U.S. inflation history. During\nthe 1970s, consumer price inflation (measured\nby the price deflator for personal consumption\nexpenditures) averaged 61/2 percent, approxi3\n\n\fMONETARY POLICY AND INFLATION\n\nFigure 1\nAverage Inflation and Growth Rate of Money Across Countries, 1975 to 1985\nFigure\n1.ÐAverage Inflation and Growth Rate of Money across Countries\n1975 to 1985\n100\n90\n80\nGDP Price Deflator\n\n70\n60\n50\n\ny = 0.48x + 5.49\n\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n-10\n-10\n\n10\n\n30\n\n50\n\n70\n\n90\n\n110\n\n130\n\n150\n\n110\n\n130\n\n150\n\n110\n\n130\n\n150\n\nMoney Growth\n\n1985 to 1995\n100\n90\n80\n\nGDP Price Deflator\n\n70\n\ny = 0.51x + 0.80\n\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n\n-10\n-10\n\n10\n\n30\n\n50\n\n70\n\n90\n\nMoney Growth\n\n1995 to 2005\n100\n90\n80\n\nGDP Price Deflator\n\n70\n60\n\ny = 0.47x - 3.88\n\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n\n-10\n-10\n\n10\n\n30\n\n50\n\n70\n\n90\n\nMoney Growth\n\nSOURCE: International Monetary Fund/Haver.\n\n4\n\n\fUnderstanding Inflation\n\nFigure 2\nU.S. Personal Consumption Expenditures: Implicit Price Deflator\n10-Year Moving Averages of Annual Data\nFigure 2.ÐU.S. Personal\nConsumption Expenditures: Implicit Price Deflator\n\n(10-Year Moving Average\ns of Annual Data)\nPercentage changes\n10.0\n\n8.0\n\n6.0\n\n4.0\n\n2.0\n\n0.0\n\n-2.0\n1940\n\n1945\n\n1950\n\n1955\n\n1960\n\n1965\n\n1970\nMean\n\nS\n\n1975\n\n1980\n\n1985\n\n1990\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\nStandard Deviation\n\nSOURCE: Bureau of Economic Analysis/Haver.\n\nmately double the historical average since 1930\nand triple the average of the prior two decades.\nInflation wasn’t steady over the decade either—\nthe year-to-year variance was triple that of the\nprevious two decades and there were two periods\nof double-digit inflation, more than 11 percent\nduring 1974 and more than 10 percent from\n1978-80, measured by the PCE deflator.\nThe 1970s illustrate the importance of a wellthought-out commitment to price stability as a\nbulwark against large shocks to individual commodities—that is, large relative price changes—\nfeeding through into more general inflation. In a\n1982 paper, Alan Blinder sought to quantify this\nprocess. First, he measured the baseline inflation\nrate, the medium- to long-term trend inflation due\nto monetary policy. In the early 1960s, it was near\n1 to 2 percent, in the early 1970s near 4 to 5 percent, and in 1980 near 9 to 10 percent. Although\n\nhe doesn’t mention it, the University of Michigan’s\nsurvey of inflation expectations began in January\n1978. At its inception, the median expected rate\nwas 5 percent; two years later, it was 10 percent.\nClearly, monetary policy had become unhinged\nfrom price stability during this period. But what\nwas the role of relative prices?\nThe energy shock of 1973-74 was the largest\nshock of its type, up to that time. Energy prices\nincreased approximately 25 percent in 1974,\nboosting near-term inflation to a pace more than\ntwice the estimated baseline, or trend, rate. Inflation slowed quickly in 1975, however, as energy\nprices steadied, with headline inflation at approximately a 5 percent pace in the second quarter of\n1975 and as low as 3 percent in 1976’s second\nquarter. Thereafter, however, inflation rebounded\nto a relatively stable baseline pace of approximately 51/2 to 61/2 percent.\n5\n\n\fMONETARY POLICY AND INFLATION\n\nTable 1\nU.S. Inflation Rates by Decade\nPersonal Consumption Expenditures: Explicit Price Deflator\nAnnual average percent change\nDates\n\nMean\n\nStandard deviation\n\n1930-1939\n\n–2.21\n\n5.65\n\n1940-1949\n\n6.05\n\n4.03\n\n1950-1959\n\n2.19\n\n1960-1969\n1970-1979\n\nAnnual Q4/Q4 percent change\nMean\n\nStandard deviation\n\n1.78\n\n2.31\n\n1.59\n\n2.15\n\n1.23\n\n2.26\n\n1.41\n\n6.44\n\n2.19\n\n6.64\n\n2.55\n\n1980-1989\n\n5.07\n\n2.64\n\n4.82\n\n2.46\n\n1990-1999\n\n2.41\n\n1.06\n\n2.37\n\n1.16\n\n2000-2006\n\n2.32\n\n0.52\n\n2.25\n\n0.59\n\nSOURCE: Bureau of Economic Analysis/Haver.\n\nInflation rose sharply once again during\n1977-1980. Blinder estimates that the baseline\nrate reached 81/2 percent in 1979 and 10 percent\nin 1980. The Michigan survey hit 10 percent in\nNovember 1979 and remained at that level until\nMay 1980—when the combination of tighter\nmonetary policy and the credit controls, authorized by President Carter on March 14, sharply\nslowed second-quarter economic activity. Relativeprice changes affecting food, energy and mortgage\ninterest rates pushed headline CPI inflation far\nabove the baseline pace—at that time, the CPI\nincluded mortgage rates. CPI inflation moved\nabove 101/2 percent in January 1979, and exceeded\n12 percent in nine of the year’s 12 months; the\nannual average, December to December, was 131/4\npercent. But 1980 was worse, as the CPI rose at a\n14.6 percent pace during the year’s first half. Not\nuntil March 1981 did the inflation rate slip consistently below 10 percent. The behavior of energy\nprices, measured as the energy price component\nof the CPI, was extraordinary. Energy prices\nincreased 37 percent during 1979 on a fourth\nquarter-to-fourth quarter basis, increased during\n1980’s first quarter at a 41 percent annual rate,\n2\n\n6\n\nand increased during 1981’s first quarter at a 28\npercent pace, before stabilizing after March 1981.\nThe inflation of the 1970s was a combination\nof large, rapid changes in relative prices for food\nand energy overlaid on top of a rising underlying\ninflation trend. Economists have long debated\nthe direction of causation: Did the increasing trend\nin inflation cause the relative price changes—for\nexample, as oil producers sought to offset falling\nreal prices—or did the shocks to relative prices\ntend to push upward the trend? And, did FOMC\nactions worsen the situation by seeking to sustain\nthe pace of economic activity? Blinder concludes\nthat the “behavior of money supply tells us almost\nnothing about the bursts of double digit inflation\nin 1974 and 1979-80.” Perhaps this claim is true.\nBut, why did the medium- and long-term baseline\ninflation rate, primarily due to monetary policy,\ncontinue to increase during the 1970s? Why didn’t\nthe prices of other goods decrease significantly\nas energy prices increased?\nI have elsewhere recently discussed some of\nthese issues; so, let me be brief.2 There is no reason, logically, why changes in relative prices—\neven large changes—should pass through\n\nW. Poole, “Inflation, Financial Stability, and Economic Growth,” presented at Global Interdependence Center (GIC) Abroad in Chile\nConference, Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez, Santiago, Chile, March 5, 2007.\n\n\fUnderstanding Inflation\n\nautomatically into headline inflation. Shouldn’t\nthe rate of increase of some other prices slow or,\nperhaps, some prices even fall as the relative\nprice changes alter nominal demand? I have suggested, as have various research studies, that the\nreason such changes did not occur during the\nGreat Inflation was that the FOMC lacked a clear,\nforward-looking framework for monetary policymaking containing a commitment to price stability.\nWithout it, the Committee reacted to events as\nthey happened; that is, its behavior consisted of\na series of individual policy actions that did not\nadd up to define a coherent policy regime. Critics\nhave argued that superior policy would have\noccurred if the Committee had operated according to a regime, in which the policy instrument is\na rule for the conduct of policy. The essential difference is the extent to which the markets and\nthe public understand that (1) policy is forward\nlooking, according to a rule or strategy, and (2)\ncan therefore infer the future course of policy.\nThe predominant school of thought during\nthe 1960s and 1970s taught that inflation possessed an inherent momentum. Generally, it was\nargued that consumers and businesses formed\ntheir inflation expectations in an adaptive, autoregressive manner—essentially, a long distributed\nlag with fixed coefficients. Academic efforts tended\nto focus on whether the length of the distributed\nlag was invariant to the rate of inflation—some\nevidence suggested a shorter lag at higher inflation rates or during a period of more variable\ninflation—and whether the coefficients summed\nto unity or not.\nThese approaches never examined whether\nthe fixed-coefficient model was correct in the\nfirst place. Although the distributed lag gave the\ninflation process persistence, current-period\nactual inflation, it was argued, depended only\nweakly on the unemployment rate—high unemployment tempered wage increases which, after\nsubtracting productivity gains, were the primary\ndeterminant of changes in the baseline inflation\n\nrate. Superimposed on this framework was the\nconcept of a long-run “equilibrium” unemployment rate, which we will call “U*.” Proponents\nacknowledged that U* could never be measured\nprecisely from aggregate data because of shifting\ndemographics and for other reasons. More recent\neconometric studies suggest that U* cannot be\nestimated accurately in almost any case—even\nthe best estimates have standard errors of 2 percentage points of unemployment or more.3\nFinally, some proponents—and many critics of\nthis view—noted that the underlying inflationunemployment tradeoff, commonly referred to\nas the Phillips curve, tended to shift for a large\nnumber of reasons, including changing expectations of future inflation and supply shocks.\nThis framework predicted a very high cost to\nreduce inflation: a typical estimate was that each\n1 percentage point reduction in the baseline inflation rate would cost approximately 1 percent of\nannual GDP. Many analysts concluded that, in\npresent value terms, the cost over the infinite\nfuture of steady inflation at the baseline rate was\nless than the near-term disinflation cost measured\nin foregone output.\nThe flaws in this model are now well-known.\nLast year in my NABE lecture I outlined the current state of macroeconomic theory for monetary\npolicy.4 The emphasis today is on forwardlooking behavior. The introduction of modelconsistent, or “rational,” expectations into\nmacroeconomics during the 1970s emphasized a\nsimple but essential idea: consumers and businesses in the economy understand the dynamic\neconomy in which they live. This theory does\nnot deny the persistence in inflation—the persistence is real, not an illusion. But the cause of\nthe persistence is not an inherent momentum\nunique to the social psychology of inflation. If\nthe central bank is perceived as being prepared\nto acquiesce in higher inflation and unprepared\nto pursue policies consistent with lower inflation,\nthen both inflation expectations and actual infla-\n\n3\n\nStaigher, Stock and Watson (1997)\n\n4\n\nW. Poole, “The Monetary Policy Model,” Business Economics, October 2006, 41, pp. 7-10.\n\n7\n\n\fMONETARY POLICY AND INFLATION\n\ntion will rise. And the reverse is also true: If the\ncentral bank is perceived as unwilling to underwrite higher inflation and prepared to pursue\npolicies consistent with lower inflation, then\nexpectations and actual inflation will fall.\nThis line of thought has profoundly altered\nour understanding of inflation and monetary\npolicymaking. When expectations are assumed\nto be formed in a sluggish autoregressive manner,\nit is natural to view policymaking as a series of\nindividual actions—determined meeting-bymeeting and based heavily on the incoming data.\nIn such a framework, it also is natural to view\nthe FOMC as having a single policy instrument—\nthe overnight federal funds rate. Policy conducted\nin this fashion leaves ill-defined the decision\nstructure governing future policy, and makes it\ndifficult, and perhaps impossible, to communicate clearly to the public the longer-term objectives and strategy of policy. Policymakers may\nlack credibility, and their actions may lack\ntransparency.\nThe rational expectations literature makes\nclear that policy regimes are the correct way to\ninterpret policy. Tom Sargent has defined a\nregime as “a function or rule for repeatedly\nselecting settings for economic policy variables\nas a function of the state of the economy.”5 Others\nhave labeled this “rule-like behavior.” A policy\nregime, in some cases, might be as simple as a\nsingle equation; an example is the Taylor Rule,\nwhich I and many others have discussed elsewhere. In this case, the policy rule, rather than\nfederal funds rate, is the instrument of monetary\npolicy—the federal funds target is an endogenous variable within the larger model. The precise form of the rule, so long as it is consistent\nwith price stability, is less important than policymakers displaying rule-like behavior. The “rule”\ncertainly need not be a simple linear equation.\nRather, the rule is a method of decision-making\nand a commitment to a specific, articulated\n\nobjective. Nobel laureate Robert Lucas (1981)\ncredits the introduction of this concept to Milton\nFriedman in his 1948 A Monetary and Fiscal\nFramework for Economic Stability.6 In the same\narticle, Lucas notes that Friedman’s maxim was\nlost to policymakers during the two decades of\nprosperity that followed the 1948 Employment\nAct, setting the stage for the Great Inflation.\nActual policymaking, of course, requires\nlarge doses of experience and judgment—former\nChairman Alan Greenspan argued that model\nuncertainty counseled caution in policymaking.\nModels omit many real-world problems such as\nincomplete and asymmetric information, the\nhigh cost of information and the value to both\nworkers and firms of multi-period contracts.\nNevertheless, the essential insight of rational\nexpectations survives—a sound policy rule or\nregime is essential for a good outcome.\nSome analysts have argued against rules for\nmonetary policymaking, viewing them as straitjackets for policy. If policymakers adopt a model,\nhow do they respond when the economy changes\nsignificantly? Modern models clarify that the\nbenefits of “rule-like” behavior accrue even if\nthe central bank from time to time changes its\npolicy regime or rule.7 What is required is that at\neach instance when policymakers decide to take\nan action that is not consistent with their extant\nrule, the new action must be consistent with some\npolicy rule that, in the medium- to long-term, will\nachieve the stated policy objective. Surely it cannot be the case that an optimal policy response to\na new set of circumstances could be determined\nby consulting a table of random numbers.\nWhen policy departs from usual practice, it\nis incumbent that policymakers communicate\nthe change—its nature and rationale—carefully\nto the public. Monetary policy is more powerful,\nand better able to achieve its goals, if the forwardlooking behavior of consumers and businesses is\nconsistent with the forward-looking behavior\n\n5\n\nSargent (1986). See also Sargent (1982) and Sargent (1999).\n\n6\n\nFriedman made similar arguments in his 1968 presidential address to the American Economic Association. Poole (1986) analyzes the ways\nthat political pressures push policymakers away from rule-like behavior and toward acting event-by-event to offset the problem of the moment.\n\n7\n\nWoodford (2003).\n\n8\n\n\fUnderstanding Inflation\n\nsuggested by the policy rule or regime. For several\nyears, I have referred to this as “synching” the\nmarkets and monetary policy. The fundamental\nmechanism for making synching work is communicating the policy regime or rule—but rulelike behavior must be adopted by policymakers\nin the first place before it can be communicated\nto the public.\nDuring the latter 1970s, the FOMC’s minutes,\ntranscripts and public statements suggest frustration with an economy in which inflation\nincreased with ease but decreased reluctantly;\nthe Committee’s response was the monetary policy\nreform of October 1979. Two years ago, we held\na special conference at the St. Louis Fed, on the\noccasion of the 25th anniversary of reform, to\nreflect on that monetary policy change. The papers\nfrom the conference are available in a special issue\nof our Review. In the conference opening remarks,\nChairman Alan Greenspan noted that by 1979 the\ninflation situation had deteriorated to such an\nextent that “if the Fed had not opted to initiate a\nsharp interest rate increase in this country, the\nmarket would have done it for us.” He emphasizes\nthat the 1970s inflation experience reinforces the\nrole of price stability as a prerequisite for the\nefficient allocation of resources in the economy\nand for fulfilling the Fed’s goal of promoting\nmaximum sustainable economic growth.\nAllan Meltzer, in his paper for the conference,\nconsidered a wide variety of explanations, including political business cycles, dynamic inconsistency in policymaking, and the use of incorrect\neconomic theories and data. He concludes that\nthe policy failure was so large that no single theory can account for it—multiple, mutually reinforcing failures are required. Among these was\nthe failure of FOMC members to distinguish\nbetween the corrosive effects of more rapid inflation as a cause of slower economic activity,\nbecause inflation increased uncertainty, and\ntheir fear that seeking to reduce inflation would,\nitself, further slow economic activity. Today, we\nappreciate that slowing inflation in the absence\nof a clearly defined and well-articulated policy\n8\n\nregime will be costly—the concerns of these\nCommittee members were well-founded. We\nalso understand, however, that a clear policy\nregime focused on price stability can sharply\nreduce, if not eliminate, the likelihood of finding\nourselves in such a situation.8\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFor the United States, the last four decades\nmay be viewed as one “long cycle” in inflation.\nThat experience, plus developments in economic\ntheory, have permanently altered our understanding of inflation. The cycle began as inflation\nincreased during the mid-1960s with the FOMC’s\naccommodation of Vietnam-era deficit spending,\nand reached full stride during the 1970s as monetary policy hesitated to slow inflation during\nepisodes of major changes in relative prices. The\ncycle peaked and changed direction with the\nOctober 1979 regime shift in monetary policy,\nbrought about by Chairman Paul Volcker’s keen\nunderstanding of what was at stake and skill in\nchanging policy direction. The disinflation of\nthe last 25 years has restored, today, both the\nlow level and low volatility of inflation that we\nenjoyed prior to the Great Inflation. The disinflation has brought to us an era of price stability in\nwhich recent energy price shocks have had but\nmodest near-term effects on inflation. Price stability has contributed to a resurgence of productivity growth by creating an environment in which\ninnovations in information and communication\ntechnology may be confidently deployed through\nincreased capital investment. The duration and\namplitude of business cycle slowdowns also has\ndiminished, a change that Chairman Bernanke\nhas labeled the “Great Moderation.”\nWhat longer-term lessons has the decade\nbrought to our understanding of how monetary\npolicy affects inflation? The most important lesson is that policymakers must regard consumers\nand businesses as understanding the dynamic\nnature of the economy—and the impacts of policy\n\nA number of papers have studied the October 1979 policy shift as a policy regime change. For a recent example, see Cecchetti, et al. (2007).\n\n9\n\n\fMONETARY POLICY AND INFLATION\n\non the economy—as well as they do. This lesson\ntells us to focus on monetary policy regimes and\npolicy rules as the instrument of policy, not the\nnear-term choice of the federal funds rate target.\nBy doing so, the Committee’s actions affect the\nexpected future path of interest rates and anchor\ninflation expectations. If the Committee communicates its objectives and strategy in a transparent and credible fashion, the bond market and\nother forward-looking financial markets will\namplify the Committee’s near-term decisions\nand thereby do a good deal of its work for it.\nAs always in an important line of research,\nunderstanding remains incomplete. In particular,\nwe need to focus effort on improving the policy\nrule—the regularity of policy actions that stabilize the economy and make planning in the markets possible. But we should not sell short the\nenormous advances already in place.\nThank you and I’d be delighted to take your\nquestions.\n\nREFERENCES\nBlinder, Alan S. “The Anatomy of Double-Digit\nInflation in the 1970s,” in R.

        "content": "Inflation, Financial Stability, and Economic Growth\nGlobal Interdependence Center (GIC) Abroad in Chile Conference\nKeynote Address\nUniversidad Adolfo Ibáñez\nSantiago, Chile\nMarch 5, 2007\n\nT\n\nhe Federal Reserve Act as amended in\n1977 directs the Federal Reserve to\npursue monetary policies to achieve\nthe goals of “maximum employment,\nstable prices, and moderate long-term interest\nrates.” The Federal Reserve and all central banks\nhave also long been expected to promote financial stability. Since the 19th century, central\nbanks have been expected to serve as lender of\nlast resort to the banking system.\nThe goals of maximum sustainable employment and economic growth, stable prices, moderate interest rates, and financial stability are too\noften viewed as incompatible with one another.\nConventional wisdom holds, for example, that if\nmonetary policy is too focused on controlling\ninflation, then output and employment growth\nwill likely fall below their potential and financial\nmarkets will be less stable than they otherwise\ncould be.\nToday, I will elaborate on how I see inflation,\nfinancial stability and economic growth fitting\ntogether in a coherent framework for monetary\npolicy. I do not subscribe to the conventional\nwisdom. Neither events nor economic theory\nsupport the notion that a monetary policy directed\ntoward price stability will result in a less stable\nfinancial system or an underperforming real\neconomy. Rather, in my view, price stability,\nfinancial stability and economic growth are\nmutually consistent goals for monetary policy.\nFurther, I believe that price stability must be the\nparamount objective for monetary policy because\nwithout price stability, the goals of maximum\nemployment, moderate interest rates and finan-\n\ncial stability will be more difficult, if not impossible, to achieve.\nI’ll discuss evidence from both recent and\nnot-so-recent history that support my contention\nthat a sound monetary policy—that is, committed firmly to long-run price stability—is conducive to financial stability and economic\ngrowth. Some of this evidence is not pretty—it\nshows how an unstable price level can wreck a\nfinancial system and harm the real economy.\nBefore proceeding, I want to emphasize that\nthe views I express here are mine and do not\nnecessarily reflect official positions of the Federal\nReserve System. I thank my colleagues at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for their comments, especially David C. Wheelock, assistant\nvice president in the Research Division, who\nprovided special assistance. However, I retain\nfull responsibility for errors.\n\nSOUND MONETARY POLICY\nI’ll begin by outlining the essence of sound\nmonetary policy and why I believe that sound\npolicy is a prerequisite for financial stability and\nmaximum economic growth. The foundation of\na sound monetary policy is long-run price stability. By “price stability” I mean a low and stable\nrate of inflation. I believe that the optimal rate of\ninflation is zero, properly measured. However,\nbiases in price indexes imply that, in practice,\nprice stability will likely be consistent with a\nsmall positive measured rate of inflation. These\nbiases arise from the difficulty of capturing\n1\n\n\fMONETARY POLICY AND INFLATION\n\nimprovements in the quality of goods and services, as well as substitutions among products\nthat comprise consumers’ total purchases. Differences in how price indexes are put together imply\nthat the specific rate of inflation that is consistent with price stability will likely vary across\ncountries and over time. For the United States,\nI’ll hazard a guess that zero true inflation translates to an annual rate of increase in the CPI of\nabout 1 percent and in the broader price index\nfor personal consumption expenditures of about\n0.5 percent.\nBy price stability, I do not mean that the\nprice index is constant. Monetary policy could\nnever eliminate high-frequency movements in\nthe inflation rate; nor should policymakers try to\ndo so. Price stability means that inflation is sufficiently low and stable as not to influence the\neconomic decisions of households and firms.\nWhen inflation is low and reasonably stable,\npeople do not waste resources attempting to protect themselves from inflation. They save and\ninvest with confidence that the value of money\nwill be stable over time.\nA highly predictable financial environment\nnot only requires a low and stable rate of inflation\nbut also widespread understanding of how that\nobjective stated in general terms translates into\nday-by-day monetary policy actions. Speaking\nagain in the U.S. context, it is more important\nthat policymakers agree on some relatively low\ntarget rate of inflation than exactly on what that\nrate is. A number of FOMC members have spoken\nabout a “comfort zone” of 1 to 2 percent inflation,\nmeasured by the PCE price index excluding food\nand energy—the so-called “core” inflation rate.\nThat statement is fully acceptable to me.1 My\nway of stating my comfort zone is core inflation\nof 1.5 percent per year, plus or minus a range of\n0.5 percent to allow for unavoidable short-run\nfluctuations. My statement is meant to indicate\nthat I would like monetary policy to aim at 1.5\npercent core inflation and not just accept inflation\n1\n\n2\n\nbarely inside one end or the other of a 1 to 2 percent range. As an aside, I would note that U.S.\nmonetary policy has come a long way over the\npast 20 years, as indicated by the fact that I think\nit worthwhile to talk about the difference between\na goal of 1.5 plus or minus 0.5 percent versus a\ngoal of 1 to 2 percent inflation.\nIn a market economy, consumers and firms\nbase their consumption and investment decisions\non information derived from prices, including\nasset prices and returns. Efficient allocation of\neconomic resources depends on the clarity of\nsignals coming from the price system and, I might\nadd, the clarity of signals from governments and\ncentral banks about economic policy. Uncertainty\nabout the aggregate price level muddies the waters\nby making it difficult for firms and households\nto determine whether changes in individual\nprices reflect fundamental shifts in supply and\ndemand or merely changes in the overall rate of\ninflation. By eliminating this uncertainty, a monetary policy that is committed to long-run price\nstability eliminates a potential drag on the efficient allocation of resources and, hence, on economic growth.\nLong-run price stability contributes to financial stability in a similar fashion. An unstable\nprice level can lead to bad forecasts of real returns\nto investment projects and, hence, to unprofitable\nborrowing and lending decisions. Unexpected\nbouts of inflation, for example, tend to encourage\noptimistic forecasts of real returns. Errors in distinguishing nominal and real returns result in\nmisallocation of resources and eventually to\nfinancial distress that would not have occurred\nif the price level had been stable. Business decisions based on expectations of continuing inflation often turn out badly when inflation falls,\nresulting in higher rates of loan defaults and\nbusiness failures. Outright deflation is particularly\nnotorious because a falling price level increases\nthe real cost of servicing outstanding debt.\n\nAnd has been for a long time. For a relatively recent example, see William Poole, “The Monetary Policy Model,” National Association of\nBusiness Economics Annual Meeting (NABE), Boston, Massachusetts, September 11, 2006 [http://www.stlouisfed.org/news/speeches/\n2006/PDF/09_11.pdf].\n\n\fInflation, Financial Stability, and Economic Growth\n\nLong-run price stability is the most powerful\ntool the central bank has to promote economic\ngrowth, high employment and financial stability.\nPrice stability also enables monetary authorities\nto pursue secondary objectives. Worthwhile secondary goals for monetary policy include the\nreduction of fluctuations in real economic activity\nand the management of financial and/or liquidity\ncrises. I refer to these as secondary goals because\nthe central bank is unlikely to be successful at\nlimiting fluctuations in economic activity or containing financial crises in the absence of price\nstability. The reason is that, in the absence of\nentrenched market expectations of long-run price\nstability, based on a high degree of confidence in\nthe central bank, expansionary monetary policy\nactions risk raising inflation expectations rather\nthan cushioning an economic or financial disturbance. Price stability must therefore be the principal goal of policy. A central bank that invests\nin achieving credibility will find that market\nconfidence yields a very high rate of return.\nThe Federal Reserve has faced a number of\nchallenges in recent history, including liquidity\nshocks associated with the Asian financial crisis\nand Russian government bond default in 1998,\nand the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\nThe Fed’s ability to respond quickly and decisively to the extraordinary demands for liquidity\nduring these events was enhanced by the fact\nthat inflation was low and expected by the public to remain low. The public understood that in\nproviding additional liquidity during the crises\nthe Federal Reserve was not giving up on its pursuit of price stability over the long term.\nLow inflation and contained inflation expectations have also enhanced the Federal Reserve’s\nability to react effectively to business cycle fluctuations. The Fed eased aggressively to encourage economic recovery from the 2001 recession.\nBecause the public had confidence in the Fed’s\ncommitment to price stability, we were able to\nbring the target federal funds rate to its lowest\nlevel in 40 years without triggering widespread\nfears of higher inflation. If expected inflation\nhad risen as the Fed brought rates down, longterm interest rates would likely have risen and\n\nhampered efforts to encourage economic recovery. Hence, price stability made the Fed’s actions\nmore effective than they otherwise would have\nbeen.\n\nLESSONS FROM U.S. ECONOMIC\nHISTORY\nWhereas recent experience supports the\nview that price stability contributes to financial\nstability and economic growth, there is no shortage of evidence that an unstable price level leads\nto financial instability and a poorly performing\nreal economy. Sadly, history is full of examples\nwhere mismanaged monetary policy resulted in\nfinancial instability and serious disruption of\neconomic activity. The experiences of the United\nStates during the Great Depression of the 1930s\nand the Great Inflation of the 1970s provide two\nsuch examples.\nThe Great Depression is a classic illustration\nof how financial disruptions can wreak havoc on\nthe real economy. Policy mistakes by the Federal\nReserve were critical, as Milton Friedman and\nAnna Schwartz demonstrated in their Monetary\nHistory of the United States. The Fed’s principal\nerror was in failing to act as lender of last resort\nto the banking system as banking panics swept\nacross the United States. The collapse of the banking system caused the money stock to contract\nsharply, which caused the price level to fall.\nDeflation drove up the real cost of servicing debt\nand led to widespread business failures and\nunemployment. Falling incomes and increased\nloan defaults put further strain on banks and\nother financial firms. Failure of the Federal\nReserve to act in timely fashion created a downward debt-deflation spiral. More than 1,000 banks\nwere forced to suspend operations in each year\nbetween 1930 and 1933.\nThe monetary hemorrhage finally ended\nwhen the entire banking system, including the\nFederal Reserve banks, was shut down by government decree in March 1933. Once confidence in\nthe banking system had been restored, the money\nstock and price level began to rise. The real\n3\n\n\fMONETARY POLICY AND INFLATION\n\ninterest rate fell as the price level rose, which\nencouraged increased business investment and\nconsumer spending, and the economy began to\nrecover.\nThe Great Depression illustrates how deflation can wreck a financial system and economy.\nThe Great Inflation, by contrast, showed the\ndestructive power of inflation. Inflation began to\nrise in the mid 1960s. It is interesting to compare\nattitudes toward restrictive monetary policy in\nthe late 1960s and attitudes now. Forty years ago,\nthere was great concern in the United States that\nhigher interest rates would have an undue impact\non housing finance and housing construction;\nthat concern contributed to delays in needed\nFederal Reserve policy actions that ended up\ndestabilizing the entire economy. Now, we understand that monetary policy must concentrate on\nthe goal of aggregate economic stability and\nespecially inflation control. We regard stresses\nin any particular industry as a problem for that\nindustry to deal with; those stresses are not an\nissue for monetary policy, unless they spill over\nto the economy more generally.\nIn the 1960s, political pressure for low interest rates combined forces with a growing consensus among economists and policymakers that\nmoderate inflation is an acceptable way to boost\nemployment and economic growth. Monetary\npolicymaking was viewed as simply a matter of\nselecting from among a menu of inflation and\nunemployment options. Choose a little more inflation and unemployment would fall, according to\nthis theory. Accept somewhat higher unemployment, on the other hand, and inflation would be\na bit lower.\nThe infamous Phillips curve made policymaking seem beguilingly simple. Based on this\ntheory, several influential economists argued\nthat the menu of inflation-unemployment options\noffered by the Phillips curve could be improved\nupon if policymakers were willing to discard\ntheir old-fashioned attraction to price stability.\nForego price stability, these economists argued,\nand the labor market would operate more efficiently, employment would rise and the economy\nwould grow faster.\n4\n\nThere were some notable dissents from this\nview. Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps\nargued strongly that inflationary policies could\nnot boost employment or economic growth in\nthe long run, and that attempts to do so would\nproduce ever higher inflation but no more\nemployment or growth than was possible with a\nstable price level.\nThe views of Friedman and Phelps became\nincreasingly accepted in the 1970s as economists\ncame to appreciate the importance of expectations in the economic decision making of firms\nand households. At a theoretical level, economists\nshowed formally that when the public comes to\nexpect that policymakers will attempt to use inflation to boost employment or economic growth,\nthe public will respond in ways that prevent\nemployment or output from rising. For example,\nif inflation is expected to rise, then workers will\ndemand higher nominal wages and savers will\ndemand higher nominal interest rates to prevent\nreal wages and interest rates from falling. Consequently, once the public figures out the central\nbank’s game, inflationary monetary policy will\nhave no effect on employment or output.\nAt an empirical level, as the 1970s progressed\nthe performance of the economy discredited the\nnotion that higher inflation could produce higher\nemployment and faster growth. If anything, the\ndata indicated just the opposite. As inflation\nrose still higher and became more variable, the\naverage growth rate of the U.S. economy slowed\nand business cycle fluctuations became more\npronounced.\nInflation, and especially inflation instability,\nproved disruptive for financial markets and firms.\nInitially the impact of the intensifying inflation\nseemed benign with respect to financial markets\nand financial stability. Below the surface, however, the rising inflation was interacting with the\nfinancial regulatory structure that had been\nestablished in the 1930s in response to the failures of the Great Depression.\nMutual savings banks and savings and loan\nassociations—the “thrift institutions”—had\nbecome the mainstay of housing finance in the\nUnited States after World War II. These financial\n\n\fInflation, Financial Stability, and Economic Growth\n\nintermediaries borrowed short and lent long—a\nclassic duration mismatch. As inflation premiums\nbecame built into market interest rates, short-term\ninterest rates rose much more rapidly than did\nthe return on the thrifts’ assets, which were\nheavily invested in fixed-rate 30-year home\nmortgages. By 1980, on a marked-to-market basis\nthe capital of a large portion of the thrift industry\nwas exhausted.\nAlthough the industry was kept afloat for a\ntime by government sanctioned accounting\ngimmicks, many thrifts were walking dead—\n“zombies” some called them—that had to be\nclosed. Because the deposit liabilities of most\nthrifts were federally insured, the collapse of the\nindustry was costly for taxpayers. The cleanup is\nestimated to have cost U.S. taxpayers between\n150 and 200 billion dollars. It is worth noting\nthat deposit insurance did function effectively\nin maintaining the public’s confidence in the\nbanking system. Nevertheless, in the absence of\nhigh inflation, the episode could largely have\nbeen avoided.\nInflation declined sharply in the early 1980s,\nthanks to a change in the course of monetary\npolicy under the leadership of Paul Volcker, then\nChairman of the Federal Reserve Board. The\ndecline was largely unanticipated. Because few\npeople expected inflation to remain contained,\nreal interest rates soared as savers continued to\ndemand high inflation risk premiums. The dollar\nalso appreciated sharply in world foreign exchange\nmarkets. The strong dollar was hard on U.S.\nexporters and particularly devastating for farmers\nas the dollar prices of agricultural commodities\nfell sharply. Many farmers had borrowed heavily\nto purchase land during the 1970s when commodity prices were soaring and land values were\nappreciating rapidly. Falling commodity and\nland prices in the 1980s left many farmers unable\nto service their debts and many went bankrupt.\nLosses on farm loans caused the failure of many\nbanks in agricultural regions of the United States.\nThis financial distress did not spread to the\n2\n\neconomy as a whole, but did severely affect\nfarming regions.\nThe U.S. inflation environment was fairly\nstable in early 1965, and fairly stable again in\n1985. The 20 years in between saw the failure of\nscores of banks and thrift institutions and of\nthousands of farms and two deep recessions, in\n1973-75 and 1981-82. Hundreds more thrift institutions were closed in the late 1980s and early\n1990s when the U.S. government finally faced up\nto the fact that they had exhausted their capital\nduring the Great Inflation.\nThe general principle common to these cases\nof financial distress is that significant changes in\nthe inflation rate cannot be accurately foreseen.\nForecasting errors, and resulting financial loses\nand bankruptcies, are inevitable when the price\nlevel is unstable. In short, inflation and inflation\ninstability put an economy’s financial sector at\nrisk.\n\nLESSONS FROM HIGH\nINFLATION EXPERIENCES\nAlthough I have focused on U.S. experiences,\nwhich I know best, many other countries have\nseen the deleterious effects of price level instability. Indeed, some have had far worse experiences\nthan the United States. Many lesser developed\ncountries have experienced very high rates of\ninflation at one time or another, often with disastrous consequences for financial stability and\neconomic growth.\nIn a study of cross-country data, Robert Barro\nfound that high rates of inflation significantly\nreduce economic growth, even after one controls\nfor such influences on growth as educational\nattainment levels, the rule of law and strength of\ndemocratic institutions.2 Michael Bruno and\nWilliam Easterly of the World Bank report similar\nevidence. They find that inflation crises—which\nthey define as inflation rates on the order of 40\npercent or more—produce significant shortfalls\n\nRobert Barro, “Inflation and Growth.” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, May/June 1996, 78(3), pp. 153-69.\n\n5\n\n\fMONETARY POLICY AND INFLATION\n\nin a country’s economic growth.3 For example,\nwhen Chile’s inflation rate soared from an average rate of 27 percent between 1960 and 1971 to\nan average rate of 240 percent between 1972 and\n1977, the country’s already modest rate of per\ncapita output growth declined from just under\nthe world average to more than 5 percentage\npoints below the world average. Bruno and\nEasterly show that other countries that have had\nsuch inflationary bursts also experienced large\ndeclines in output growth.\nPerhaps the most obvious examples of the\ndestructive force of inflation are hyperinflations\nin Germany after World War I, in various eastern\nEuropean countries after World War II and in\nLatin America more recently. These were caused\nby printing money to finance massive government\nbudget deficits. Hyperinflation was ended in\nthose countries by reforms that brought government spending under control and credibly ended\nthe financing of deficits by printing money.\nEconomists have debated whether the termination of hyperinflations resulted in serious declines\nin output. It is certain, however, that hyperinflation did not promote faster growth or financial\nstability. Hyperinflations went hand in hand with\ncollapsing economies and financial markets.\nCountries that have very high rates of inflation typically have weak institutions, including\npoor enforcement of contracts and property rights,\nand inefficient tax systems (and consequently\nlarge budget deficits). Many countries have made\nefforts to improve their political and economic\ninstitutions and are now experiencing lower\ninflation and higher economic growth than they\ndid before their reforms.\nChile is one example of a country that appears\nto have seen a direct benefit from implementing\npro-economic growth policies that include measures to control inflation. The executive board of\nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently\ncomplimented Chile for its enviable economic\n\nperformance over the past 15 years, which the\nIMF attributed largely to the implementation of\nsound economic policies. During the 15 years\nending in 2005, Chile enjoyed an average GDP\ngrowth rate of 5.5 percent, a tripling of its per\ncapita income in U.S. dollar terms, and a halving\nof its poverty rate, all while keeping the lid on\ninflation. The IMF cited Chile’s sound fiscal policies, its low barriers to international trade and\ncapital flows, sound financial regulatory and\nsupervisory framework, a floating exchange rate,\nand its inflation-targeting framework for monetary policy. These policies, the IMF argues, have\nhelped keep inflation and inflation expectations\nlow, sustained economic growth and helped\nmake the Chilean economy resilient to external\nshocks.4\nLike Chile, many countries have made price\nstability the paramount objective of monetary\npolicy, and several have adopted formal inflation\ntargeting as a way of anchoring inflation expectations. The advantage of adopting a formal\nquantitative target for inflation, especially when\ncoupled with institutional reforms, such as\nincreased operating independence for central\nbanks, is that it reduces uncertainty about the\nlong-term inflation rate. This, in turn, reduces\ninflation risk premiums in interest rates and promotes long-term contracting and investment.\nThese benefits can be especially important for\ncountries that have had a history of high or\nunstable inflation. However, I believe that any\ncountry could benefit from announcing and\nsticking to a specific numeric inflation objective.\n\nCONCLUSION\nI will conclude by noting that, over the past\n20 years or so, the inflation record of the United\nStates and many other countries has been far\nbetter than it was from the mid 1960s to the early\n1980s. It is not a coincidence, I believe, that we\n\n3\n\nMichael Bruno and William Easterly, “Inflation and Growth: In Search of a Stable Relationship.” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review,\nMay/June 1996, 78(3), pp. 139-46.\n\n4\n\n“IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with Chile.” Public Information Notice no. 06/97. August 11, 2006.\n\n6\n\n\fInflation, Financial Stability, and Economic Growth\n\nhave also had a better record of economic growth\nand financial stability over the recent two decades\nthan during the years of high and highly variable\ninflation. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke\nhas referred to the decline in the volatility of\nboth inflation and output over the past 20 years\nas “The Great Moderation.”\nDuring the recent past, our financial system\nand economy have shown remarkable resilience\nin the face of some serious shocks. I have already\nmentioned the Asian financial crisis and Russian\ngovernment bond default in 1998, and the terrorist\nattacks of September 11, 2001. None of these had\nmore than a passing impact on U.S. financial\nmarkets or firms or on the real economy. More\nrecently, we have seen little fallout from the ending of the housing boom. At least thus far, only\nthe residential construction industry and closely\nallied industries and professions have experienced any significant effects of the slowing of\nhousing markets. Needless to say, I doubt that our\nfinancial system or economy would show such\nresilience if inflation were not low and stable.\nMonetary policy is not magic. A stable currency is a necessary but not sufficient condition\nfor economic growth. A democratic government,\nable to transfer power peacefully and reliably, is\nessential to sustained prosperity. So also are\nsound legal traditions and processes to resolve\ndisputes according to the law. Governments need\nto pursue policies that encourage entrepreneurial activity. A social safety net is important in\ntoday’s world, but it must not destroy incentives\nfor firms to hire productive workers. In a market\neconomy, those who take risks should be rewarded\nwhen they are successful and should suffer losses\nwhen they are not. Monetary policy cannot offset\ngovernment policies destructive of the growth\nprocess.\nI finish by noting a common misunderstanding. In many countries, including the United\nStates, there is the view that good times are often\n\nassociated with a little inflation, and bad times\nwith falling inflation or, especially, deflation. That\nobservation is correct but incomplete. A little\nunexpected inflation is associated with temporary\ngood times but cannot last. Expectations catch\nup with reality. As expectations and actual inflation rise, the good times come to an end and\nfinancial instability begins. As Milton Friedman\nargued so brilliantly, for an economy operating\nclose to full employment, the trade-off is not\nbetween inflation and unemployment but between\nunemployment now and unemployment plus\ninflation later.\nUnder the Federal Reserve Act, the Fed operates with a dual mandate, to encourage maximum\nemployment and price stability. Those goals are\nnot incompatible but fundamentally the same\ngoal. Maintaining low and stable inflation is central to achieving maximum employment and the\nhighest possible rate of economic growth. Maintaining price stability does not require that the\ncentral bank come down hard on every upward\ntwitch in the inflation rate, but disciplined\nresponse is required when the inflation rate\nthreatens to rise in a sustained fashion or fall\ninto deflation. Central bankers need to apply\ntheir best judgment, and they will not always be\ncorrect in those judgments. But if they have a\ngood record and the market retains confidence\nthat the central bank will correct its mistakes,\nerrors in judgment will not do lasting damage. I\nmyself rely heavily on market measures of inflation expectations in forming my judgments and\nin deciding what policy risks to run—in an uncertain world, it is always the case that policy judgments depend on probabilistic calculations.\nI hope that I have persuaded you that financial stability and economic growth are enhanced\nby price stability. But I know that actual experience in the United States, in Chile and in many\nother countries is more persuasive that words\ncan ever be.\n\n7\n\n\f"

        "content": "Energy Prices and the U.S. Business Cycle\nGlobal Interdependence Center (GIC) Abroad in Chile Conference\nAmerican Chamber of Commerce in Chile Breakfast\nSantiago, Chile\nMarch 2, 2007\n\nA\n\nstaple of the macroeconomics literature is that energy price shocks have\nbeen an important contributor to\nU.S. recessions. The situation is\nclearly more complicated than the common\nmacro textbook exercise of using standard diagrams to work out the effects of an energy\nshock. Recent experience with a near tripling of\noil prices from mid-2003 to mid-2006 without a\nrecession suggests the need to review the conventional wisdom. One of my messages will be\nthat the conventional wisdom fails to consider\nthe fact that previous oil price shocks occurred\nwhen the U.S. economy was already suffering\nfrom substantial inflation pressures, whereas the\nrecent run-up of oil prices has occurred in an\neconomy with substantial overall price stability\nand entrenched, low inflation expectations.\nBefore I dig into the issue of the extent of\ncausality between oil price shocks and recessions,\nI want to emphasize that the views I express here\nare mine and do not necessarily reflect official\npositions of the Federal Reserve System. I thank\nmy colleagues at the Federal Reserve Bank of St.\nLouis for their comments. Ed Nelson, assistant\nvice president, provided special assistance. I\nretain full responsibility for errors.\n\nTHE DEBATE\nThe historical record since 1970 provides\nsome perspective on the relationship between\noil prices and the business cycle. Figure 1 plots\nthe U.S. benchmark oil price (the West Texas\nintermediate spot price), both in nominal terms\n(i.e., current U.S. dollars) and real terms (i.e.,\n\ndeflated by the CPI so as to be in constant 1982-84\ndollars) since 1970. Shaded regions denote U.S.\nrecessions, as designated by the National Bureau\nof Economic Research. These include the recession\nof 1973-75, associated with the oil price shock of\n1973-74, the recessions of 1980 and 1981-82,\npreceded by the second oil shock in 1979, and\nthe recession of 1990-91, also associated with a\nlarge, but more transitory, oil price increase of\nabout 75 percent in 1990-91. There are also more\ndrawn-out but steep oil increases in 1999-2000\nand 2003-2006. The presence of the recession\nbars in the graph brings out what Hamilton and\nHerrera (2004, p. 265) observe is “a correlation\nbetween increases in oil prices and subsequent\neconomic downturns.” In particular, recessions\nbegan in the United States within a year of the\n1973, 1979, and 1990 oil price increases.\nThere has been much debate on how much\nof this link between recessions and prior oil price\nincreases should be attributed to the powerful\neffect of oil shocks on the economy, and how\nmuch reflects a third factor—more restrictive\nmonetary policy imposed at roughly the same\ntime as the oil shocks. But I would draw attention\nto another aspect of the relationship between the\nbusiness cycle and oil prices highlighted by the\nfigure. The United States has never had an energy\nprice spike occur in the middle of a recession, or\nimmediately following a recession when unemployment is still relatively high. This fact suggests\ntwo properties of large oil price increases that\nare useful to keep in mind. First, very sharp\nincreases in oil prices that we have observed historically, while undoubtedly reflecting exogenous\nsupply disruptions to some degree, also reflect\n1\n\n\fECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\n\nFigure 1\nOil Prices and the Business Cycle\n$/Barrel\n\n1982 $/Barrel\n\n80.0\n\n60.0\nNominal Dollar Oil Price (left axis)\n\n70.0\n\n50.0\n\nReal Oil Price (1982-84 Dollars) (right axis)\n\n60.0\n40.0\n\n50.0\n40.0\n\n30.0\n\n30.0\n\n20.0\n\n20.0\n10.0\n10.0\n0.0\n1970\n\n0.0\n1975\n\n1980\n\n1985\n\n1990\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\nNOTE: Shaded areas are NBER recessions.\n\nthe strength of the economy at the time. Secondly,\nthe casual association often made, based on the\n1970s experience, between oil price increases\nand high inflation, is largely misguided because\nthe large oil price increases of the 1970s occurred\nagainst the background of cyclical expansions\nthat had gone too far.\nThe 1973 and 1979 episodes did not feature\ninflationary spirals triggered by the oil shocks.\nInstead, they are characterized by preexisting,\ngeneral inflationary pressures that an alternative\nmonetary policy could have avoided. The first\noil shock in 1973 occurred against a background\nof clear economic overheating in the United States.\nU.S. monetary policy was very expansionary in\n1971 and 1972, leading to excessive growth of\naggregate demand that, even in the presence of\nprice controls, spilled over into rising inflation\nin 1973. By October 1973—that is, the month of\nthe first oil shock, but largely before its impact\ncould be felt in the CPI—inflation had reached\n2\n\n8.1 percent on a 12-month basis, a sharp rise from\nthe 3.2 percent rate over the 12 months ending in\nOctober 1972. Annual CPI inflation subsequently\nrose to 11.8 percent in October 1974 and peaked\nat 12.2 percent in November 1974.\nSimilarly, in the wake of several years of\nexpanding demand, inflation rose throughout\nmost of 1977 and 1978, well before the second\noil shock, and the 12-month rate stood at 9.3 percent in January 1979, 2.5 percentage points above\nits value of January 1978. Inflation subsequently\npeaked at 14.6 percent in March 1980. Even the\n1990 oil price spike occurred late in a long economic expansion, with annual inflation having\nstood above 4 percent since mid-1988. In July\n1990, the 12-month CPI inflation rate was 4.8\npercent, too high to correspond to price stability\nand not far below the July 1989 value of 5.1 percent. Following the oil shock that began in August\n1990, inflation peaked at 6.4 percent in October\n1990.\n\n\fEnergy Prices and the U.S. Business Cycle\n\nThe strength of the economy at the time of\nthe three oil shocks is also reflected in the unemployment rate. In October 1973, the seasonally\nadjusted U.S. unemployment rate stood at 4.6\npercent, its lowest rate since early 1970; in January\n1979 it was 5.9 percent, close to its trough for\nthe late 1970s expansion; and in July 1990,\nunemployment was 5.5 percent, above its March\n1989 low of 5.0 percent, but still lower than its\nvalue in any month in the years 1975 to 1987.\nThis emphasis on the link between the state\nof the business cycle and the strength of oil prices\nmay seem surprising. Many of the well-known\nspikes in the oil price are associated with exogenous events on the supply side: for example,\nOPEC’s quadrupling of the oil price in late 1973\nin the wake of the Middle East war; OPEC’s doubling of the oil price in 1979 following the revolution in Iran; and Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in\n1990. These events were certainly major supplyside disruptions. But even a cartel like OPEC that\nadministers the price of its product cannot ignore\nmarket conditions. In particular, a reason why\nOPEC was able to sustain the very large 1973 oil\nprice increase for so long was because world\ndemand for oil was underpinned by rapid expansion of aggregate demand in key markets in\nEurope, Japan and the United States. Indeed,\nsome analysts of the 1973 oil shock have cast\ndoubt on whether the oil price increase of 1973\ncan be considered an exogenous event at all;\nBarsky and Kilian (2001) argue that it was a\ndelayed response to long-term demand developments in the oil market, combined with a response\nto contemporaneous buoyant world demand conditions.1 We do not have to go this far, however,\nto recognize that there was a significant endogenous component to the oil price increases in\n1973 and 1979 due to demand factors, reflecting\nan overheating of the U.S. economy which coincided with boom conditions in other advanced\neconomies.\n1\n\nOIL PRICES AND INFLATION\nMembers of the FOMC, as well as monetary\npolicy makers in Europe and the United Kingdom,\nhave spoken about oil prices and inflation on\nmany occasions in recent years. Despite differences in emphasis, a clear proposition runs\nthrough these discussions: Irrespective of the\nbehavior of oil prices, we can be confident that\nmonetary policy oriented to price stability will\ndeliver control over inflation over the medium\nterm. It is worth spelling out this proposition in\nsome detail.\nThe reason why price stability is not contingent on oil price behavior is that inflation is a\nsustained rise in the general level of prices. The\nprice of oil enters heavily into a particular category of consumer prices—gasoline prices—and\nindirectly into the prices of many other products.\nIt is possible for the price of energy-intensive\ngoods to change relative to a general index of\nprices; in fact, such relative-price movements\nare part of the everyday workings of a market\neconomy. And, over periods of, say, a year or\nmore it is possible for monetary policy to secure\nlow inflation—which means low growth rates in\nindexes of overall prices—even when energy price\ninflation is high. Over time, the general level of\nprices responds to the supply-demand imbalance\nin the economy: that is, to longer-term movement\nin total spending in the economy relative to longrun supply potential. Monetary policy actions\naffect the total volume of spending, and so can\ninfluence the balance between aggregate demand\nand supply. By keeping aggregate demand in balance with aggregate supply, monetary policy can\ncreate conditions for general price stability, even\nif certain components in the price index are persistently increasing.\nTwo aspects of this picture are worth emphasizing. First, the overall price level is susceptible\nto influence by monetary policy even if the price\nof oil, or other commodities, is being driven by\nexogenous supply events. That is why Milton\n\nSee Hamilton (2003, pp. 388-89) for a rebuttal of Barsky and Kilian’s (2001) position that the 1973-74 oil price increase did not incorporate a\nmajor exogenous supply shift.\n\n3\n\n\fECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\n\nFriedman could advance his proposition that\n“inflation is always and everywhere a monetary\nphenomenon” even though he acknowledged\nthat the 1973 OPEC shock had produced a “drastic alteration in the conditions of supply of crude\noil.”2 The general trend of prices is distinct from\nthe behavior of a single price in the index or subset of the index. Inflation is always an endogenous variable in the medium term, whatever\nexogenous shocks are affecting its components\nin the short term.\nSecondly, monetary policymakers often pay\nattention to “core” measures of prices that exclude\nenergy and food prices. This focus does not, however, mean that policymakers’ concept of price\nstability refers only to a basket of goods that\nexcludes energy-intensive items. The overall\ncost of living is what matters for welfare, so stability over time in indexes that include energy\nis desirable. But because the price of gasoline is\nvolatile, it is often desirable to “see through”\nvery short-term movements in consumer prices,\nand work out what is happening to the underlying trend of prices. Looking at core measures of\ninflation can be useful for this purpose. Indeed\ncore and aggregate inflation clearly move together\nover longer periods. That said, during periods of\nsustained increases in relative energy prices,\ngeneral price stability requires that price indexes\nthat exclude energy will need to grow more slowly\nthan the aggregate price index; over this period,\nachievement of inflation at a desirable level means\nthat core inflation, on average, proceeds below\nthe overall level of inflation.\nThirdly, an oil price increase may reduce\naggregate supply and policymakers also need to\ntake this fact into account in keeping demand\nand supply in balance. This issue is most prominent when the oil price change is permanent and\nwhen the economy’s technology is very energyintensive on average. The 1973 oil shock, for\nexample, was long-lasting and took place at a\ntime when U.S. production was very energyinefficient. Potential output thus fell substantially.\nThe economy was already overheated by 1973;\n2\n\n4\n\nFriedman and Schwartz (1982, p. 414).\n\nso, some reining in of spending by monetary\npolicy was justified even before the oil shock;\nbut once the oil shock took place, monetary\npolicy needed to tighten, just to keep supply and\ndemand from going further into imbalance. That\nis, it was necessary to let actual output fall with\nthe decline in potential output. From this perspective, Hamilton and Herrera (2004) are not\nnecessarily posing the right question when they\nask how much of a monetary policy loosening\nwould have been required to avoid a recession\nafter the 1973 oil shock. The supply shock alone\njustified a monetary policy tightening on stabilization grounds.\nIn recent years, on the other hand, the circumstances of the 1973 oil shock have not been\nrepeated. The economy has not been overheated;\nthe economy is more energy-efficient so the impact\non supply of oil shocks has been moderated; and\nthe more severe spikes in the oil price such as in\nsummer 2006 have been recognized as transitory\nin nature. In these circumstances, monetary policy is in a much better position to support aggregate demand in the face of oil shocks without\nendangering medium-term price stability. This\nstate of affairs has been emphasized by the Federal\nReserve Chairman in his discussion of the effect\nof oil shocks (Bernanke, 2006).\nIn summary, maintenance of low inflation\nover a period of several years or more is achievable whatever happens to oil prices. The same\nwas true in the 1970s, and the fact that inflation\nwas high on average reflected over-expansionary\nmonetary policy, not the oil shocks.\n\nRECENT OIL PRICE INCREASES\nThe oil price increase in 2003-2006 is in line\nwith the earlier pattern that surges in oil prices\noccur during economic expansions. Indeed,\nrecent increases are more clearly a demand phenomenon than the previous increases. Energy\nprices in recent years have been driven by demand\nrather than supply. The source of this demand is\n\n\fEnergy Prices and the U.S. Business Cycle\n\nunusual compared to the past, with a smaller\ncontribution of U.S. demand and a much larger\ncontribution of China. China’s net imports of oil\nwere projected to be 2.3 percent of its GDP in\n2006 compared to 0.9 percent in 2002 (IMF, 2006,\np. 31). A longer-term perspective is given by the\nfact that China's share of world demand for oil is\nestimated to have risen from 3.5 percent in 1990\nto around 8.2 percent in 2006 (Weber, 2006). This\nincrease reflects the rapid growth and industrialization of China in the past fifteen years, as well\nas the use of production technology that is, on\naverage, energy-inefficient compared to the\nUnited States.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWithout question, energy supply shocks are\ndisruptive, but they need not create recessions.\nIndeed, there is a more general lesson from experience with oil price shocks. Monetary policy\nshould not allow an economy to operate at the\nedge of a cliff. When balanced precariously at\nthe edge of a cliff, even a minor disturbance, oil\nor otherwise, may be sufficient to push the economy over the edge. Although an outside shock\nmay be the catalyst, or trigger, that creates undue\ninflation pressures, the fundamental problem is\nnot the catalyst but the powerful and risky brew\nof an overheated economy. To use another analogy,\nif someone opens gas jets and fills a house with\ngas, do we blame the explosion on the person\n\nwho lights the match or the person who opened\nthe jets? I know where I want to place the blame.\n\nREFERENCES\nBarsky, Robert B. and Kilian, Lutz. “Do We Really\nKnow That Oil Caused the Great Stagflation?

        "content": "U.S. Saving\nCFA Society of Nebraska\nOmaha, Nebraska\nFebruary 15, 2007\n\nI\n\nam delighted to be here today—my first\ntrip to Omaha since coming to the St. Louis\nFed in 1998. My subject is an important,\nand puzzling, one. The puzzle is nicely\nillustrated by recent newspaper stories reporting\nthat the U.S. saving rate is at the lowest level in\n73 years—that is, since 1933, the bleakest year\nof the Great Depression. But let me ask five questions: Are there signs of distress all around, as\nthere were 73 years ago? Has there been a tremendous surge of bankruptcies? Has the United\nStates become a nation of profligate spenders?\nAre the data wrong? Are the data screwy?\nMy answers to these five questions are no,\nno, no, no and no. But there are some puzzles to\nexplain, and that is what my remarks are about.\nAs you may be able to tell from these introductory remarks, I am not going to express deep\ndismay in line with the headline news. Nevertheless, to avoid being misinterpreted, I want to\nemphasize that my relaxed perspective on national\nsaving today does not imply that individual households have nothing to worry about. Many households would be much better off if they had larger\nassets and less credit-card debt carrying high\ninterest rates. Many would have a happier and\nmore secure retirement if they consumed less and\naccumulated more wealth during their working\nyears. But these points were as valid 25 years ago\nwhen the personal saving rate was fairly consistently above 6 percent as they are today when the\nsaving rate is negative. Moreover, I think there was\na case 25 years ago that the United States as a\nwhole would have been better off if it had saved\n1\n\nmore, and that is equally true today. The reality has\nchanged far, far less than the headlines suggest.\nBefore proceeding, I want to emphasize that\nthe views I express here are mine and do not\nnecessarily reflect official positions of the Federal\nReserve System. I thank my colleagues at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for their comments. Robert H. Rasche, senior vice president\nand director of Research, and Massimo Guidolin,\nassistant vice president, provided special assistance. I retain full responsibility for errors.\n\nHEADLINE GRABBING DATA\nWithin the past year the personal saving ratio,\nwhich is reported every month, has turned negative (Figure 1A), and these monthly data releases\nhave yielded headlines all along the way. Monthly\ndata on household debt service payments as a\npercent of personal income have reached all time\nhighs (Figure 1B). The federal government is\nrunning a large budget deficit (Figure 1C), and\nthe U.S. net international investment position\n(Figure 1D) is now reported as a negative net\nposition in excess of 20 percent of GDP.

Economists are often a bit\nsloppy, in my view, in how they use these two\nwords and headline writers may not appreciate\nthe importance of the distinction. Saving is the\n\n2\n\n2\n\nWritten by Merle Travis, 1947.\n\n\fU.S. Saving\n\nflow of after-tax income not consumed. Roughly\nspeaking, saving is the part of your monthly paycheck that is left over after paying all your bills.\nYou may use your saving to pay down debt or add\nto your assets. Savings, with the “s” on the end,\nis the stock of wealth you have accumulated—\nyour net worth calculated by taking the value of\nall the assets you own and subtracting your liabilities. Saving is a flow, savings is an accumulated stock. The distinction between saving and\nsavings is as elementary and as important as the\ndistinction between a company’s income statement and its balance sheet.\nFor the economist, the basic definition of\nhousehold income in a particular year is consumption plus the change in net worth. The saving rate is then income minus consumption as a\npercentage of income. The issue is simple when\nthe setting is simple. Suppose you have an annual\nsalary income of $100,000 and your only asset is\na bank deposit bearing no interest. If, over the\ncourse of the year, you spend $95,000 on consumption goods, then your saving is $5,000, which\nshows up as an increase in your bank deposit.\nWe can think of your income as the salary of\n$100,000, or as your consumption of $95,000\nplus the increase of $5,000 in your net worth.\nThe two different approaches yield the same\nanswer. Your saving of $5,000 yields a saving\nrate of 5 percent.\nIf you had consumed goods worth $105,000,\nyou would have had to draw down your bank\naccount or borrow. In either case, your net worth\nwould have declined by $5,000. Your income was\nstill $100,000, whether calculated directly from\nyour salary or from your consumption plus the\nchange in your net worth. Your saving rate would\nhave been minus 5 percent.\nThe issue becomes much more complicated\nwhen your assets can change in price, yielding\ncapital gains or losses. As we will see, that is\nmuch of what the saving rate issue is all about.\nThe underlying data of the headline news\nare mostly derived from our National Income\nand Product Accounts—the NIPA. These are flow\naccounts, constructed by the Bureau of Economic\nAnalysis (BEA), designed to measure the current\n\nproduction of goods and services in some particular period, such as a year. The BEA defines personal saving as the difference between current\npersonal outlays and current disposable personal\nincome. The saving rate is saving as a percentage\nof disposable income.\nThe NIPA framework is that of a double-entry\naccounting system. By construction, gross national\nproduct is equal to gross national income. Consider the value of a company’s output. Its revenue\nfrom sales is the value of the production. The\nrevenue is then distributed as income to employees, dividends to shareholders and retained earnings, or undistributed corporate income. Of course,\nthe tax collectors get some too, and it shows up in\nthe NIPA as government revenue. By definition,\nthe total value of the product equals the total\nvalue of the income to various income recipients.\nThe NIPA focus on both expenditure and\nincome flows has the potential to create accounting discrepancies because the data are collected\nfrom different data sources. Income data are collected from payroll data, IRS filings, corporate\ntax reports and the like. Personal outlays are\nalmost entirely personal consumption expenditures. The dollar value of these expenditures is\nthe value of the goods and services companies\nsell to households. The more reliable data are\nthose from the demand (expenditure) side of the\nnational accounts. Income data are notoriously\nimprecise, and they fail to add up to aggregate\nGDP by as much as 2 to 3 percent. This difference\nappears in the NIPA as an account called “statistical discrepancy.” If income data are typically\nunderestimated, the NIPA saving rate will also\nbe underestimated. In any event, we know that\nthe saving rate is subject to substantial measurement error and to frequent major revisions.\nThese observations are meant to help understand the measurement issue, but they do not\nresolve the apparent mystery of why the saving\nrate has become negative. The statistical discrepancy in the NIPA has not been growing over time.\nA number of other issues I’ll flag do not solve the\nmystery either, because the measurement errors\ndo not seem to be changing enough over time to\naccount for the change in the saving rate. Never3\n\n\fECONOMIC GROWTH\n\ntheless, I’ll go though some of the more important\nissues.\nA number of statistical and measurement\nissues have been debated in the literature on the\nevolution of the U.S. saving rate. I will focus on\nfive distinct issues that may cause the measured\nNIPA saving rate to substantially differ from a\ntrue, unobserved personal saving rate.\n\nThe NIPA Saving Rate and Realized\nCapital Gains\nGross domestic income is designed to measure income generated by current production.\nPersonal income goes to households and includes\nwages, salaries, rents, royalties, dividends and\ninterest. These are all income flows derived from\ncurrent production of goods and services. Disposable income is personal income less direct taxes,\nwhich include income taxes, Social Security\ntaxes and the like.\nAll transactions involving exchange of existing assets, however, are excluded from measured\nincome because such transactions do not have\nan associated production of goods or services. If\na household consumption unit considers any\nsuch capital gains or losses as income, then the\nNIPA framework underestimates the saving rate\nas perceived by households. And, I might add, it\nis perfectly sensible for a household to consider\ncapital gains to be income available to be spent\non consumption goods.\nHere is one problem: Capital gains taxes are\nconsidered direct taxes and subtracted from personal income in calculating disposable personal\nincome. Thus, capital gains income is not counted,\nbut tax paid as a result of realized capital gains\nis counted. In an environment where there are\naggregate taxable capital gains, the NIPA saving\nrate underestimates the true saving rate as seen\nby households.\nThe capital gains issue has grown, and not\njust because stock market gains have often been\nsubstantial in recent years. A company can throw\n\noff cash to investors either through paying dividends, which appear in personal income, or\nthrough share repurchases. Share repurchases\ntend to increase stock prices, yielding capital\ngains to shareholders which do not appear in\npersonal income. If companies have increasingly\nused share repurchases instead of dividends—\nwhich appears to me to be the case—the result\nwould be to create a downward bias to the measured saving rate.\n\nNIPA Saving Rate and Pension Plans\nThe NIPA treat contributions to defined contribution pension plans, whether made by\nemployees or by employers on their behalf, as\ndisposable personal income at the time such\ncontributions are made. Investment income on\nthese accounts is also accrued as disposable personal income. Investment income consists of\ninterest and dividend earnings.3 Payments from\nsuch funds are not counted as current income,\nbut treated as an exchange of one financial asset—\npension accumulations—for another—cash. While\nnot completely clear, consistency suggests that\nthe unrealized capital gains accrued by defined\ncontribution pension plans are not counted as\nincome, nor is the realization of such gains in\nbenefit payments counted as retirement income.\nDefined benefit plans are treated similarly\nto defined contribution plans. Employer contributions to such plans and the investment income\naccruing are counted as personal disposable\nincome. The administrative expenses of such\nplans are included in personal consumption\nexpenditures. Again, benefit payments are\nexcluded from personal disposable income.4 At\none point, government sector defined benefit pension plans were treated differently from private\nsector defined benefit plans. That asymmetry\nhas now been changed and the above treatment\nis applied to all defined benefit plans.\nNote that this treatment of defined benefit\nplans can generate issues in the timing of income\n\n3\n\nWilliam G. Gale and John Sabelhous, “Perspectives on the Household Saving Rate,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, I:1999, p. 182.\n\n4\n\nMarshall B. Reinsdorf, “Alternative Measures of Personal Saving,” Survey of Current Business, September 2004, p. 20.\n\n4\n\n\fU.S. Saving\n\nand saving since at any point in time such plans\ncan be under- or overfunded. Underfunding, and\nsubsequent “catch-up” payments, defers the\nrecording of income. Overfunding resulting from\ncapital gains on the investment portfolio can produce temporary or permanent understatement of\nincome from such plans.\nWhile payments out of defined contribution\nand defined benefit pension plans are not counted\nas personal income, such payments are subject\nto income tax. These tax payments reduce measured personal disposable income and the saving\nrate at the time that the retirement benefits are\npaid. The logic of this treatment in the NIPA is\nthat personal income is recognized when the\nretirement plan contributions are earned rather\nthan when the benefits are paid, often many years\nafter being earned.\nEmployers make investment decisions for\ndefined benefit plans and retain investment risk.\nGiven this fact, an alternative approach, not used\nin the NIPA accounts, would be, first, to remove\nemployer contributions as well as rental income,\ndividends and interest accruing to such plans\nfrom personal income and, second, remove\nadministrative expenses from personal outlays.\nThen, third, under this alternative treatment, the\nbenefits paid out by defined benefit plans would\nbe added to personal income. Experiments with\nthese adjustments show that the impact on the\nmeasured saving rate is minor, in part because of\nthe decreasing importance of defined benefit\npensions in the private sector in recent decades.5\n\nNIPA Saving Rate and Stock Options\nStock options are a form of deferred compensation to employees. At the time they are\ngranted, they are not treated as generating income\n\nfor the employee, nor do they produce a charge\nagainst profit and loss for the employer. At the\ntime that nonqualified stock options are exercised, the difference between the market price\nand the exercise price of the option is reported\nas capital gain on the employee’s income tax\nreturn and the employer receives a tax deduction\nfor this same difference.6 In principle the exercise of a nonqualified stock option generates\nincome that is reported for purposes of assessing\nunemployment insurance taxes. Since reported\nunemployment insurance wage and salary\nincome are the basic data used to construct compensation in the NIPA, taxable option income\nlikely is included in personal income. However,\nincome from nontaxable incentive stock options\ndoes not get included in personal income.\n\nNIPA Saving Rate and Deferred\nCompensation\nIncreasing use of deferred compensation can,\nin principle, bias the NIPA saving rate downward. Compensation is accrued in national\nincome at the time it is earned. However, it is\nonly recorded in Personal Income at the time\nthat it is received. Growing deferred compensation would lead to an increasing discrepancy\nbetween accrued compensation and received\ncompensation. If households determine their\nconsumption patterns on the basis of earned\ncompensation (whether or not it is received)\nthen the measured saving rate is biased downward. However, since 1959 wage accruals less\ndisbursements as recorded in the NIPA accounts\nhave never been more than 0.3 percent of personal income, so deferred compensation cannot\nhave made a significant contribution to the negative trend in the saving rate.7\n\n5\n\nJack VanDerhei, Craig Copeland, and Dallas Salisbury, Retirement Security in the United States, Washington, D.C.: Employee Benefit Research\nInstitute, 2006, pp. 44-50.\n\n6\n\nSome stock options (incentive stock options) do not result in a tax liability to the employee or a tax deduction for the employer. It is believed\nthat nonqualified stock options are the most prevalent form. For a detailed discussion of the treatment of stock options in the NIPA see Carol\nMoylan, “Treatment of Employee Stock Options in the U.S. National Income Accounts,” Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Department of\nCommerce (undated).\n\n7\n\nSee the NIPA table: “Relation of Gross Domestic Product, Gross National Product, Net National Product, National Income, and Personal\nIncome.”\n\n5\n\n\fECONOMIC GROWTH\n\nNIPA Saving Rate and Purchases of\nConsumer Durable Goods\nThe accumulation of reproducible capital\ngoods purchased by households is not treated\nsymmetrically in the NIPA. Purchases of newly\nconstructed houses are considered in the NIPA\nas an investment activity, not a consumption\nexpenditure at the time of purchase. Houses are\ntreated as assets that generate housing services or\nrental income and depreciate over time regardless of whether the units are owner-occupied or\nare owned by a rental business. Consequently,\nover the useful life of the house owner-occupiers\nare treated as if they are both landlords and tenants renting the property from themselves. An\nimputation is made for rent from the owneroccupied unit, based on market data from comparable rental units. This imputed rent is included\nin personal consumption expenditures for each\nperiod. On the income side of the accounts this\nimputation is included in rental income.\nIn principle, the accounting applied to houses\nshould apply to all purchases of durable goods\nby households, including automobiles, household\nappliances, electronic equipment and so forth.\nIn practice consumer durables purchases are\ntreated like food purchases—a current outlay\nthat is quickly consumed. Thus, in the NIPA purchases of newly produced consumer durables\nare included in entirety at the time of purchase,\nrather than imputing a flow of services from the\nassets over their useful lives. If cars, for example,\nwere treated like a house in the NIPA, the consumption entry would be imputed transportation\nservices, including depreciation, from cars rather\nthan the amount spent on the car itself at time of\npurchase.\nEstimates of the household saving rate that\ntreat purchase of consumer durable goods as\nconsumption and impute service flows from such\n\ngoods as consumption have been constructed.8\nThese alternative estimates show a higher level\nof the saving rate and different behavior of the\nsaving rate over business cycles. However, the\nnegative trend observed in the NIPA saving rate\nover the past 10 to 15 years is evident in this\nalternative measure.\n\nA LITTLE BIT OF\nCONSUMPTION THEORY\nThe foundations of modern economic theory\nof household consumption behavior were established a half century ago. The pioneering work in\nthis field was done in the 1950s and early 1960s\nby Milton Friedman and by Franco Modigliani\nand coauthors.9 The common starting point for\nthese theories is that households derive utility,\nor satisfaction, from their consumption over\nmultiple periods. The theoretical concept of\nconsumption includes the flow of services from\nconsumer durables, not the expenditures on\ndurables measured in the NIPA. In Modigilani’s\nformulation, the multiple periods span the lifetime of the household and encompass both\nworking years and a period of retirement. The\nmotivation assigned to households is to maximize\nthe utility derived from consumption over the\nmulti-period horizon. Under this assumption,\nhouseholds smooth their consumption over time.\nFaced with fluctuations in income, households\nuse borrowing, saving, and wealth accumulation\nas the tools by which they achieve the desired\ntime profile of consumption. In this framework,\nthe principal determinant of consumption is not\ncurrent personal disposable income, but rather\nhousehold net worth.\nAndo and Modigliani show that this theoretical framework can be used to derive hypotheses\nabout aggregate household consumption and\n\n8\n\nSee, for example, Marshall B.

In particular,\nthey conclude that, with a stable age distribution\nof the population and continuing productivity\ngrowth, over time household net worth should\ntend to grow at a constant rate.10\n\nANOTHER STORY:\nEVIDENCE FROM THE FLOW\nOF FUNDS ACCOUNTS\nThe flow of funds accounts published by the\nBoard of Governors are another source of data on\npersonal saving and household wealth accumulation. The personal saving concept in these\naccounts is conceptually the same as the NIPA\nmeasure, but because different source data are\nused, the numbers are not identical.11 From the\nflow of funds accounts it is possible to construct\nanother concept of personal income and consumption, and hence saving, that treats expenditures on consumer durables as investment and\nmeasures consumption as a flow of services, as\nsuggested by theories of consumption behavior.\nYet another perspective is available from the\nbalance sheet data in the flow of funds accounts.\nEnd-of-year balance sheets for the household\n(and nonprofit institution) sector are available\nfrom 1946. End-of-quarter balance sheets are\navailable beginning in 1952. These tables contain\nestimates of reproducible assets, financial assets,\nliabilities and net worth for the various sectors.12\nMarket values are used for housing assets and\ncorporate equity in these accounts, though holdings of bonds are reported at face value. Thus,\nthe changes in household net worth measured in\n\nthese accounts include capital gains/losses on\nboth houses and equities.\nRaymond Goldsmith also constructed estimates of net worth on nonfarm households and\nnonprofit institutions in his monumental Study\nof Saving.13 These data are available for selected\nyears from 1900 through 1949. Albert Ando and\nE. Cary Brown extended these data to annual time\nseries from 1929 through 1958.14 Ando and\nBrown also constructed measures of consumption\ndefined as total personal consumption expenditures, less personal consumption expenditures\non durable goods plus depreciation of the stock\nof durable goods valued at replacement cost.15\nSince the stock of consumer durable goods\nrecorded in the flow of funds accounts is measured at replacement cost, a comparable series for\nannual consumption can be constructed by subtracting the annual change in the flow of funds\nmeasure of the stock of consumer durables from\nthe annual NIPA total personal consumption\nexpenditure measure. The time series of these\nmeasures of annual consumption to end-of-year\nhousehold net worth are shown in Figure 2 on an\nannual and five-year average basis. The behavior\nof these time series is quite consistent with the\ntheory that consumption should be proportional\nto net worth. There are small fluctuations in the\nseries from year to year that largely average out\nover five years. The notable exceptions are during\nthe Great Depression and during the second half\nof the 1990s when household net worth changed\nrapidly with major stock market fluctuations.\nThe annual percentage change in both the\nAndo-Brown and the flow of funds series, less\nthe December-to-December rate of CPI inflation\n\n10\n\nSee Ando and Modigliani, footnote 30, equation (b), p. 77.\n\n11\n\nDaniel Larkins, “Note on the Personal Saving Rate,” Survey of Current Business, February 1999, p. 8.\n\n12\n\nFor annual data, see Table B-100.\n\n13\n\nR.W.

These series measure the\nreal (i.e. inflation adjusted) rate of change of\nhousehold net worth. Both series are quite volatile.\nHowever, neither series exhibits a trend, and the\nmeans of the series are quite close. The mean\nreal growth of household net worth from 1929\nthrough 1958 is 3.0 percent. The mean real growth\nof the flow of funds measure of household net\nworth from 1946 through 2005 is 3.6 percent.\nAgain, the data are consistent with the broad\nimplications of the received economic theory on\nthe determinants of aggregate consumption.\nThere is not uniform agreement among economists that increases in net worth generated by\ncapital gains should be considered saving. Some\nargue that the relevant capital gains are those\ngenerated by increased productivity of the underlying asset, and capital gains that do not contribute to increased future income should not be\ntreated as saving. Of course, there is no obvious\nway to separate observed capital gains into those\ngenerated by higher productivity of capital and\nthose that could result from changes in tastes or\nrisk premiums. There is now general agreement\namong economists that a significant increase in\ntrend productivity occurred in the U.S. economy\nstarting around the mid 1990s. A major stock\nmarket boom occurred in the late 1990s.\nOver most of the post-World War II period,\nthe personal saving rate averaged about 6 percent,\nwith some higher years from the mid-1970s to\nmid-1980s. The negative trend in the NIPA saving\nrate started in the mid-1990s, about the same time\nthe stock market boom started. Thus it is hard to\ndismiss the hypothesis that the decline in the\nmeasured saving rate in the late 1990s reflected\nthe response of consumption to large capital gains\nfrom corporate equity. Evidence from panel data\nof households also supports the conclusion that\nthe decline in the personal saving rate since 1984\n\nis largely a consequence of capital gains on corporate equities.16\nAs is well known, the stock market boom\ncollapsed in 2001, and equity prices are only\nnow returning to the previous peak levels. Subsequent to the stock market boom, however, there\nwas a major housing boom in the United States\nboth in terms of construction and property values.\nIt is more problematic to argue that the recent\ngrowth in household net worth, supported by\ncapital gains in housing, reflects improved productivity trends. Nevertheless, in the past several\nyears, consumption demand appears to have\nresponded to the capital gains in housing. There\nis substantial evidence of “equity extraction” by\nhomeowners during the recent housing boom,\nand cross-section evidence of large responses of\nconsumption by some groups of households to\nincreases in house values.17\nAs an alternative measure of the saving rate,\nwe can consider the ratio of the change in household net worth from the flow of funds accounts\nto the NIPA measure of personal disposable\nincome. The annual and five-year average data\nfor this series are shown in Figure 4. Year to year,\nthe movements are quite volatile, but the negative trend characteristic of the headline saving\nrate is not present. Indeed, in the late 1990s this\nratio jumped up, reflecting large capital gains on\ncorporate equities, fell in 2000-2001 reflecting\nthe end of the stock market boom, but has moved\nabove its long-term average in 2003-2005.\n\nCAPITAL GAINS AND LONG-TERM\nREAL INTEREST RATES\nThe evidence presented above suggests that\nthe behavior of aggregate consumption in the\nUnited States relative to household net worth\nover the past two decades is consistent with long-\n\n16\n\nF.

Thus, most of the observed\nnegative trend in the NIPA saving rate seems to\nbe attributable to the omission of capital gains\nand losses from measured personal disposable\nincome. The evidence suggests that it is not a\ncoincidence that increases in household wealth\nand a long-term downward trend in the NIPA\nsaving rate have occurred together. Increases in\nhousehold wealth have been driven by increases\nin stock prices after 1982, albeit with some significant fluctuations, and by the more recent\nincrease in home values after 2001.\nThis observation, however, leaves a question:\nWhy have we observed such high capital gains\non corporate equities and housing? Part of the\nstory is the substantial decline in inflation and\ngreater confidence in sustained low inflation\nafter 1982. At that time, also, changes in tax and\nother policies contributed to higher economic\ngrowth and increases in corporate profits, which\nhave been growing most years since 1982. But\nanother part of the story may be a downward\ntrend in real interest rates since the late 1990s.\nDeclining real interest rates increase asset values.\nRecent yields on indexed bonds both in the\nUnited States and globally appear very low, relative to the conventional wisdom on the historical behavior of real yields. With the exception of\nthe United Kingdom, where indexed bonds were\nintroduced in the early 1980s, markets in inflation indexed debt are relatively new. The U.S.\nTreasury started issuing such securities in 1997.\nThe French introduced a bond that is denominated in Euros and indexed to the Euro area harmonized CPI inflation in 2002. For the past four\nyears, the real yield on these bonds has fluctuated\naround two percent or slightly higher.\nTo infer the behavior of U.S. real yields since\nthe early 1990s, we can use U.K. indexed bond\ndata and assume that U.S. yields have moved in\nsimilar fashion or we can use U.S. data that are\nconstructed from survey measures of inflation\n\nexpectations. Such data are shown in Figure 5.\nThe first series shown there is the 10-year Treasury\nconstant maturity yield less the 10-year inflation\nexpectation reported in the Survey of Professional\nForecasters.18 The second series is the monthly\naverage yield on the 10-year U.K. indexed bond\nfor the middle month of each quarter. The third\nseries is the monthly average 10-year constant\nmaturity Treasury yield, again for the middle\nmonth of each quarter.19 The series inferred from\nthe Survey of Professional Forecasters is quite\nconsistent with the market yield on the indexed\nbond for the periods where both series are\navailable.\nThese data suggest that a significant decline\nin long-term real interest rates started in the early\n1990s, when the estimated real yield averaged\naround 3.5 percent. More recently, the average\nreal yield has been around 2 percent. This negative trend is also visible in the U.K. indexed yield,\nwhich declined rapidly in the late 1990s from\naround 3.5 percent to 2 percent or below in recent\nyears. A decline in global real rates of this size,\nif expected to be permanent, should produce a\nmajor upward revaluation of the value of longlived assets such as corporate equities and housing. Hence the explanation of the observed trend\nin the conventional saving rate in the U.S. can\nlikely be traced, in considerable part, to global\nchanges in real rates of interest.\nWhere do these observations leave us? I’ll\noffer two tentative conclusions. First, household\nsaving behavior does not seem to have changed\nin any fundamental way. What has changed to a\ndegree is the trend in asset values. Households\nhave consumed some of the increase in asset values in about the same way they always have.\nMy second tentative conclusion is that the\nbehavior of households, though perfectly sensible and responsible for households as a whole,\nhas led to a situation in which the United States\nas a whole is saving too little of its national out-\n\n18\n\nThe Survey of Professional Forecasters data are collected once a quarter by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.

        "content": "State of the U.S. Economy\nAAIM Management Association\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nFebruary 9, 2007\n\nI\n\nam pleased to be here today to discuss\nthe state of the U.S. economy and the\nnear-term outlook. Despite some variability in quarterly growth rates last year, primarily related to declines in housing investment, the state of our economy looks good. The\nU.S. economy is highly productive, profit-making\nopportunities abound, interest rates and inflation\nare both relatively low and stable. The largest\nchallenge facing the United States is not the\nbusiness cycle but the task of adjusting on\nmany fronts to the retirement of the baby boom\ngeneration. Fortunately, U.S. laws and institutions will enable us to face these challenges with\na greater deal of optimism than in some other\ncountries that will face the demographic challenge sooner and in larger measure than we will.\nAs background for discussing the economic\noutlook I’ll start by presenting a bird’s-eye view\nof recent developments in the U.S. economy,\nincluding those on the inflation front. Although\nmy main topic is prospects for the U.S. economy\nover the next year or so, I do want to say a few\nwords about some of the economic implications\nof long-run demographic change.\nBefore proceeding, I want to emphasize that\nthe views I express here are mine and do not\nnecessarily reflect official positions of the Federal\nReserve System. I thank my colleagues at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for their comments, especially Kevin L. Kliesen, associate\neconomist in the Research Division, who provided special assistance. However, I retain full\nresponsibility for errors.\n\nTHE BIG PICTURE\nThe U.S. economy is fundamentally sound.\nOver the past few years, surveys of business\neconomists by the National Association for\nBusiness Economics have regularly pointed to\nkey sources of strength. These include a dynamic\nand flexible labor market and a financial system\nthat rewards innovation and risk-taking by channeling capital to its highest rates of return. In\nshort, our market-based economy affords firms\nthe ability and the incentive to innovate and to\nadapt quickly to changes in relative demands for\ngoods and services. Managements today respond\npromptly to various shocks that rattle the economy. The growing dynamism of the U.S. economy\nis nicely illustrated by the rise in the economy’s\nrate of productivity growth that began around\n1995—a change of enormous importance. It does\nnot yet appear that the current productivity\nboom has run its course.\nThe rise in productivity growth has increased\nthe economy’s potential output growth. At present,\nmany economists estimate the potential growth\nrate at between 3 and 3.5 percent. From mid-2003\nto the beginning of 2006, the U.S. economy’s\nactual real GDP growth was above the growth of\npotential. Over this period, the economy’s growth\ncould exceed long-run potential because the\neconomy was recovering from the 2001 recession.\nGiven that the economy’s actual growth cannot\npermanently exceed its potential growth, it was\ninevitable that some slowing was to occur. And,\nindeed, during the second and third quarters of\n2006 real GDP growth averaged about 21/4 percent,\nconsiderably less than the roughly 33/4 percent\ngrowth experienced from the second quarter of\n1\n\n\fECONOMIC OUTLOOK\n\n2003 to the first quarter of 2006. As the growing\neconomy absorbed underutilized labor and capital resources, the Fed gradually raised its target\nfor the federal funds rate from 1 percent in 2004\nto 51/4 percent in June of last year. The fed funds\ntarget rate remains today at 51/4 percent.\nMonetary policy actions kept inflation largely,\nthough not perfectly, in check and likely had\nsomething to do with the timing of slower GDP\ngrowth. I emphasize timing because slower GDP\ngrowth was inevitable as the margin of underutilized resources fell. As is so often the case, certain characteristics of the economic slowdown\nhad little or nothing to do with monetary policy.\nTwo other developments were important determinants of the nature of the economy last year.\nOne was the sharp run-up in energy prices, which\nbegan to be reversed in the middle of 2006. The\nother was substantial weakness in housing markets, which may just now be showing very tentative signs of reaching bottom.\nThree remarkable facts deserve attention.\nFirst, real GDP growth, though sluggish in 2002,\nhas been robust since 2003, and the unemployment rate is now down to 4.6 percent. Second,\nlong-term inflation expectations have hardly\nbudged. Third, the quarterly average yield on\n10-year nominal Treasury securities is actually\nslightly lower today than it was in mid 2002.\nThe economy has performed well despite a near\ntripling of crude oil prices since December 2001.\nIn years past, an energy price shock of this magnitude was typically associated with a substantial\nincrease in inflation and a sharp recession.\nTwo things are different about energy price\nincreases this time. One is that the increases were\nprimarily a consequence of a booming world\neconomy, which raised energy demand rather\nthan a supply shock. Second, monetary policies\nhere and in most other countries have done a\nfine job of anchoring inflation expectations.\nThe current housing slowdown, which is\nmuch in the news, is unusual in that it has not\noccurred against the backdrop of an economywide recession, when especially large declines\n1\n\n2\n\nin real residential fixed investment typically\noccur. For example, real residential fixed investment declined by about 40 and 45 percent, respectively, in the periods surrounding the 1973-75\nand 1980-82 recessions.1 By contrast, real residential fixed investment has declined by about\n13 percent since its peak in the third quarter of\n2005.\nLet me now turn to current economic developments in more detail, which will set the stage\nfor the outlook portion of my talk. As I step back\nand survey the economic landscape, I see an\neconomy that appears to be transitioning quite\nnicely from last year’s slow patch, to more sustainable growth.\n\nCURRENT DEVELOPMENTS\nDuring the past week or so we have seen a\ndizzying array—though typical, I might add—of\neconomic reports. As usual, some were good and\nsome were so-so. As usual, we need to be aware\nthat first releases of data are often revised.\nOn balance, there seems to be a firmer tone\nto the latest data. Particularly noteworthy was\nthe larger-than-expected increase in real GDP\nduring the fourth quarter of 2006. Following relatively anemic rates of growth in the second and\nthird quarters of 2006, growth of real GDP during\nthe fourth quarter picked up nicely, rising to a\n3.5 percent annual rate.\nKeep in mind, though, that this estimate is\nthe first for the fourth quarter and subject to revision. Measuring GDP growth over the four quarters of the year, real GDP increased by more than\n3 percent for the fourth straight year. A closer\nlook at the GDP report reveals that two areas of\nstrength were real consumer outlays and foreign\npurchases of U.S. goods and services. To some\nextent, the former reflects the decline in energy\nprices that began in the middle of last year, which\nhas restored some of the purchasing power that\nwas lost when gasoline prices rose well above $3\nper gallon in many parts of the country. The latter\n\nThese two periods are 1973:Q1 to 1975:Q1 and 1978:Q3 to 1982:Q3. The latter period encompasses the 1980 and 1981-82 recessions.\n\n\fState of the U.S. Economy\n\nprobably reflects the improving growth prospects\nfor the rest of the world. Another striking aspect\nof the report was the 4.2 percent growth in real\nfinal sales. Hence, despite a modest downturn\nin inventory investment, which nevertheless\nremained positive, real GDP growth was quite\nstrong.\nTwo other aspects of the GDP report were\nless favorable than the overall report. First, business fixed investment posted a slight decline in\nthe fourth quarter. I suspect that the decline was\nnothing more than normal variation, perhaps a\nconsequence in part of firms waiting for release\nof the new Vista operating system from Microsoft.\nOver the four quarters of 2006, nonresidential\nfixed investment rose by 6.8 percent, a healthy\nand expected increase given that the economy\nhas continued to absorb excess capacity. At this\npoint, forecasts still point to a healthy pace of\ngrowth in business capital outlays this year—\nand perhaps the better-than-expected increase in\nDecember factory orders is a reflection of this\nexpected growth. Nonetheless, extension of the\nfourth quarter weakness in business capital outlays going forward certainly would be a cause\nfor concern.\nThe second aspect of the GDP report that garnered a lot of attention was the nearly 20 percent\nrate of decline in residential fixed investment.\nThe decline began in the second quarter and the\npace of decline picked up in each subsequent\nquarter. Naturally, the sharp decline in private\nhousing starts and sales imparted a significant\ndrag on real GDP growth last year. During the\nsecond half of 2006, the contribution to real GDP\ngrowth from real residential fixed investment\naveraged about –11/4 percentage points.\nLast year was a difficult environment for\nhomebuilders. It was also difficult for some\nhomeowners in those parts of the country where\nthe pace of home price appreciation slowed to a\nstandstill. I’ll focus on new single-family homes,\nsince that is the dominant part of the new-home\nmarket; the number of multi-family units started\nhas remained relatively constant since 1997, at\nabout 340,000 units per year.\n\nFollowing a record-setting rate of 1.7 million\nunits started in 2005, single-family starts fell to\n1.5 million units in 2006. This average, though,\nreflected a relatively large number of starts during\nthe first half of the year and then a much lower\nlevel of starts during the second half of 2006. By\nDecember 2006, single-family starts were roughly\n16.5 percent below their annual average.\nIn 2006, new home sales fell about 171/4 percent to a little more than 1 million units and\nbuilders soon found themselves facing an accumulation of unsold homes. As a result, inventories of new homes rose sharply relative to sales,\nand in July 2006 the inventory-sales ratio reached\nits highest level in more than 10 years.\nIn response, builders naturally began to\nreduce new construction. Part of this pullback\nwas motivated by skittish households; cancellation rates, according to some large builders,\nreached 40 percent or more during the latter part\nof 2006. Although the majority of forecasters\ncorrectly anticipated softness in housing construction, the magnitude of the decline exceeded\ntheir expectations. In December 2005, the consensus of the Blue Chip forecasters was that real\nresidential fixed investment would decline by\nonly about 1.4 percent in 2006, using annual\naverage data. Instead, the decline was about 41/4\npercent, but was considerably steeper—more than\n12.5 percent— measured from the fourth quarter\nof 2005 to the fourth quarter of 2006.\nBy some indicators, the housing market is\nbeginning to show signs of stabilizing. New singlefamily home sales rose in December, the fourth\nincrease in the past five months, while in January\nthe National Association of Home Builders’ housing market index—a measure of builder confidence—rose to its highest level since July 2006.\nFurther, the four-week moving average of the\nMortgage Bankers Association index of applications for home purchases has increased nicely\nsince its trough last October. Finally, the University\nof Michigan’s consumer survey of home-buying\nconditions in January 2007 reportedly rose to its\nhighest level since mid-2005.\nThe market for previously sold single-family\nhomes may also have stabilized. Existing home\n3\n\n\fECONOMIC OUTLOOK\n\nsales rose a modest 0.1 percent in the fourth\nquarter of 2006, after declining 6.4 percent in the\nthird quarter. Moreover, the pending home sales\nindex reported by the National Association of\nRealtors turned up in January, registering its largest\nmonthly increase since March 2004. Although\nthe inventory of existing homes for sale, relative\nto sales, has also dropped over the past few\nmonths, its December level of 6.5 was still a bit\nabove that for new homes, which stood at 5.9.\nWhile recent data seem to point in a favorable\ndirection, we must recognize that the housing market is not out of the woods yet. The most pressing\nissue for builders remains the backlog of unsold\nhomes, at which they are chipping away, and the\ncontinued high rates of canceled orders.\nA special word of caution is in order concerning housing data. Starts and permits data are\nroutinely affected by weather variations, especially in the winter. To an unusual degree, sales\ndata are affected by cancellations, which occur\nwhen buyers walk away from sales contracts. In\npublished data, cancelled sales are not subtracted\nfrom new sales to create a net sales series. Moreover, cancelled sales are not put back into the\ndata on the inventory of unsold new homes.\nAnecdotal reports clearly indicate that cancellations have been material. Thus, official data overstate net sales of new homes and understate the\ninventory of unsold homes. Finally, favorable\nrecent news on the inventory of existing homes\nfor sale may well have been influenced by discouraged homeowners taking their properties off\nthe market rather than by actual sales.\nHouse price data are also subject to distortions. For existing homes, the median sales price\ndata released by the National Association of\nRealtors (NAR) show a decline starting in August\nand continuing every month except for a solid\nrecovery in December. However, median price\ndata can be distorted by a changing mix of sales.\nFewer sales of high-end homes will reduce the\nmedian. Data released by the Office of Housing\nEnterprise Oversight (OFHEO) are not subject to\n2\n\n4\n\nthis problem, but only cover homes financed by\nconforming mortgages, which are currently capped\nat $417,000. Although a changing mix of homes\nsold is not a problem with this series, high-end\nhomes are excluded altogether. The OFHEO home\nprice series derived from mortgage data for newly\npurchased homes shows an annual rate of price\nchange of only about 1.5 percent in the third\nquarter of 2006, the latest data available as of\nthis time.\nTo avoid the statistical limitations of the NAR\nand OFHEO price data, we can turn to the CaseShiller price series for 20 cities, available through\nNovember 2006. The 20-city composite series\nshows declines for both October and November;\nin November, the series was only 1.7 percent above\nits prior year level. Moreover, the November\ndecline from October occurred in 17 of the 20\ncities.\nMy summary conclusion on home prices is\nthat we have evidence of pervasive weakness\nlast year. It remains to be seen what this year will\nbring, but at a minimum we can say that we do\nnot have evidence as yet that home prices have\nstabilized.\nFor forecasters and policymakers, a key\nunknown is the long-run sustainable level of\nhousing starts going forward. If the recent rate of\nstarts has been above this sustainable rate, then\nwe would expect to see an extended period of\nslower-than-normal activity until the inventory\nbulge is worked off. By the same token, if starts\nhave fallen to a level that is below their sustainable rate, then we can expect that the inventory\nbulge will be worked off this year, so that the\nlevel starts will return to their normal rate sometime later this year.\nStatistically, there are several ways to estimate\nthe normal level of starts. A common method is\nto estimate a model of some sort. For our purposes, assume that single-family housing starts\nin any year is a function of three primary variables: interest rates, household income and demo-\n\nThe model specifies the log-level of single-family starts as a function of the level of the 10-year Treasury yield, the log-level of households\nand the log-level of real GDP. The model is an ARMA specification of AR (1) and MA (2). The model uses annual data, 1965 to 2006. Further\ndetails are available on request.\n\n\fState of the U.S. Economy\n\ngraphics.2 In 2006, a model of this sort projected\nthat housing starts would total about 1.7 million\nunits, about 12.5 percent more than the actual\nlevel of about 1.5 million units. Assume: 1) no\nchange in the average level of interest rates this\nyear (relative to 2006); 2) that real GDP increases\nby 3 percent this year; and 3) that the number of\nhouseholds increases by 1 percent. With these\nassumptions, the model predicts that singlefamily housing starts will total about 1.4 million\nunits this year, which we can compare to the\nactual 1.5 million units in 2006. This projection\nfor 2007, which would be a 2.5 percent decline\nfrom 2006’s average, appears to be at the high-end\nof most forecasters’ expectation, perhaps because\nthe model just outlined makes no allowance for\nthe overhang of excessive inventory at the beginning of this year. But, eventually, as the inventory\nis worked off, home-building activity should pick\nup substantially from the 2006 year-end level of\nabout 1.2 million units at an annual rate.\nSome economists have worried that a potential side effect from the housing recession would\nbe to drag down consumer spending more generally as home prices leveled off. Yet, as the fourthquarter GDP report revealed, real consumer\noutlays appear to be holding up well.\nThe strength of consumer outlays is surely\ndue to a sustained healthy labor market outlook,\nwhich we can expect to help keep consumer\nspending on a solid footing this year. Although\nlast week’s employment report showed that job\ngains in January were a bit below expectations,\njob gains over the previous months were revised\nsubstantially higher as a result of the annual\nbenchmark revision to the establishment survey\nby the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). According to the BLS, nonagricultural payroll employment in the benchmark month—March 2006—was\nrevised up by 752,000, an unusually large revision.\nAverage monthly job gains from March 2006 to\nDecember 2006 were also boosted, from their\noriginal estimate of 148,000 per month to 174,000\nper month.\n3\n\nData revisions are one of the numerous\nsources of uncertainties that face monetary policymakers. The reason is that our current policies\nare always calibrated to the data that present\nthemselves to us today—in real-time—and how\nthe data map into the near-term outlook for economic activity and inflation. There is always the\nrisk that our current policy can inadvertently be\neither be too restrictive or too stimulative. That’s\npart of the challenge of making monetary policy.\nAs I think you can see from my earlier remarks,\nwe dig deeply into the data and our inferences\nfrom what we observe are not always in accord\nwith a surface reading of the data.\n\nRECENT INFLATION\nDEVELOPMENTS\nI’ll now discuss recent developments on the\ninflation front. Last year’s CPI inflation news was\nsomewhat peculiar in that, over the 12 months\nending December 2006, inflation measured by\nthe all-items CPI—sometimes called “headline\ninflation”—declined but core inflation, which\nexcludes food and energy prices, rose slightly.\nHeadline CPI inflation slowed from 3.4 percent\nin 2005 to 2.6 percent in 2006, while the inflation rate measured by the PCE price index rose\nslowed from 2.9 percent to 2.3 percent over the\nsame period.\nThe moderation of headline inflation is\nundoubtedly a reflection of the sharp decline in\nenergy prices over the second half of 2006. Most\neconomists believe that core inflation is a better\nmeasure of inflation pressures. The core PCE price\nindex rose slightly from 2.1 percent in 2005 to\n2.2 percent in 2006 and the core CPI index rose\neven more, from 2.2 to 2.6 percent.3 Fortunately,\ncore price pressures have eased of late: The threemonth rate of change in the core PCE was 1.7\npercent, while the six-month rate of change was\n1.9 percent. Clearly, the momentum seems to be\nheaded in a favorable direction, as last week’s\nFOMC press release noted.\n\nInflation is measured as the percent change, December to December.\n\n5\n\n\fECONOMIC OUTLOOK\n\nBut before we declare victory and head home,\nit’s wise to consider some of the upside risks that\nI worry about. One of these risks, as I’ve noted\nearlier, is the possibility that we might be underestimating the likely pace of economic activity.\nIf we get an upside surprise on GDP growth, then\nmonetary policy may have to be tightened somewhat.\nAnother risk is that labor productivity growth\nmight be lower than currently expected. Data\nreleased just two days ago indicate that in 2006\nthe annual average increase in productivity in\nthe nonfarm business sector was 2.1 percent,\ndown slightly from the increase of 2.3 percent in\n2005 and down substantially from the average\nrate of 3.2 percent for 2000-2004. Given that the\neconomy’s potential growth depends on trend\ngrowth in productivity and in the labor force, we\nwill have to watch trends in both of these closely\nin the years ahead.\n\nTHINKING ABOUT THE\nOUTLOOK\nIn its policy statement issued after the meeting\nlast week, the FOMC noted that the economy\nseems likely to expand at a moderate pace over\ncoming quarters. My own take on what “moderate\npace” means is that real GDP is likely to increase\nby roughly 3 percent over the four quarters of\nthis year—particularly if the housing market is\nnear an inflection point and no longer a significant drag on growth. But I want to emphasize that\nfluctuations in growth are normal and that no\npolicy action is necessarily indicated if growth\ncomes in somewhat above or below that outlook.\nWhen data come in outside the range expected,\nwe need to understand the reasons and the likelihood that the departure will be sustained unless\nthere is an offsetting policy response. Only then\ndoes it make sense to consider a policy response.\nRegarding the outlook for inflation, I’ve said\nfor quite some time that it might take a while for\nunderlying price pressures to recede. Recent\ninflation data themselves, and other information\n6\n\nrelevant to judging the inflation outlook, suggest\nthat the inflation rate is likely to fall into a reasonable range this year. If, however, core inflation\nseems to be settling at a rate above 2 percent, then\nsuch an outcome would be unacceptable to me. I\nput a very high weight on the Fed’s responsibility\nto maintain low and stable inflation.\nAt some point we’ll almost certainly see some\nsurprises in the data. Long experience with economic forecasts indicates that we need to consider\nas a standard feature of the environment GDP\nforecast errors in the neighborhood of 11/2 percentage points on a four-quarter-ahead horizon.\nThus, a forecast of 3 percent GDP growth should\nbe expressed as 3 percent plus or minus 11/2 percent. From experience, an outcome in this range\nhas a probability of about two-thirds. The other\none-third probability is divided equally above\nand below the range. Thus, the probability of an\noutcome significantly different from the baseline\nforecast is not small. The FOMC is prepared to\nrespond when the outcome promises to depart\nfrom the baseline in a sustained way.\nAlthough incoming data will at some point\nsurprise us, what should not be surprising is the\nFed’s commitment to maintaining price stability.\nInflation forecasts over the next four quarters\nare also subject to standard errors. Over a longer\nhorizon, though, the inflation issue is not one of\nforecast errors but of policy commitment and\npolicy errors. My commitment, certainly, is to do\nwhat I can to promote policy adjustments that will\nyield an inflation outcome, on average over a\nperiod of several years, centered on 11/2 percent\non the core PCE price index. Such an outcome\nwill ensure that the FOMC maintains its current\nhigh level of credibility. Maintaining price stability is central to maximizing sustainable economic\ngrowth and the highest possible level of employment. Stable inflation also contributes greatly to\nthe economy’s ability to adjust successfully to\ninevitable shocks. That has been the Fed’s message—and its stated policy—for many years. It\nhas been a successful strategy.\n\n\fState of the U.S. Economy\n\nLONG-RUN CHALLENGES\nIn an outlook speech, I cannot skip the opportunity to discuss briefly the economic implications of the changing demographic situation in\nthe United States and the rest of the world.\nDemands on government from our aging population center on, but are not confined to, financing this country’s two primary programs for the\nelderly—Social Security and Medicare. Chairman\nBernanke recently testified before the U.S.\nCongress on this matter.4\nThe macroeconomic implications of demographic change are significant. The retirement\nof the baby boomers is expected to reduce the\neconomy’s labor force participation rate dramatically. The participation rate is the percentage of\npersons age 16 and over in the labor force, either\nworking or seeking work. Declining growth in the\nlabor force has important implications for our\nlong-run, sustainable growth of GDP.\nIn its latest Budget and Economic Outlook,\nthe Congressional Budget Office estimates that\nthe average annual growth of potential output\nfrom 1950 to 2006 was 3.4 percent. The 3.4 percent is divided between labor productivity growth\nof 1.8 percentage points and labor force growth\nof 1.6 percentage points. Over the next 10 years,\nthe CBO expects these contributions to change\ndramatically. From 2007 to 2017, the CBO projects\nthat productivity will increase by an average of 2\npercent per year; however, owing to the gradual\ndeclines in the labor force participation rate, the\ngrowth of the labor force is projected to increase\nby an average of only 0.7 percent per year. Hence,\nthe CBO projects the growth of the economy’s\npotential output will slow by about 0.75 percentage points in the coming decade to a little more\nthan 2.5 percent. This projection, if accurate, has\nserious long-term implications.\nIn a previous speech, I discussed the possibility that participation rates among older workers\n\nmight rise modestly in the coming years. If that\nhappens, labor force growth will not slow as rapidly as some projections indicate because more\npeople over age 65 will be continuing to work\nthan past retirement patterns would lead us to\nexpect.5 But the demographics tell us that such\nan outcome only delays inevitable adjustment. It\ncould be that more of those in the 65-69 age group\nmight work than has been the case recently, but\nwhen those same persons become the 75-79 age\ngroup we can be pretty sure that most will be\nretired. Because labor represents the largest single\ninput in U.S. production, GDP will eventually\nbegin to exhibit a slower rate of growth unless\nthere is an offsetting increase in the economy’s\nstructural rate of productivity growth.6 Because\nincome for the country as a whole depends on\nproduction, slower growth in GDP and income\nimplies slower growth in consumption of U.S.\nhouseholds.\nThe likely result is that, all else equal, a\ndecrease in labor supply growth will lead to\nslower growth in our economic well-being. Since\nmonetary policy can affect only prices and not\nquantities in the long run, the Fed cannot alter\nthis situation.\nMy discussion of the macroeconomic outlook\nmay seem somewhat abstract, as is unavoidably\nthe case when discussing a GDP of $11.422 trillion. That is a larger number than I can comprehend. Slower growth in this number is also hard to\nmake real to us as individuals. The demographic\nchallenge, however, will be felt by every firm in\nthe economy. I know that we at the Federal\nReserve Bank of St. Louis are acutely aware of\nthe significant number of employees retiring\nover the next decade. Those retiring employees\nare our little piece of the nation’s demographic\nchallenge. My confidence in the United States\nmeeting the challenge reflects my confidence in\nthe nation’s decentralized market system. Individual firms will adjust, by persuading some\n\n4\n\nSee Bernanke (2007).\n\n5\n\nSee Poole (2006).\n\n6\n\nOf course, this assumes that immigration rates or changes in fertility rates do not materially alter the projected growth of potential labor force.\n\n7\n\n\fECONOMIC OUTLOOK\n\nemployees to retire later, by moving younger\nemployees more quickly into positions of responsibility and by substituting capital for labor. The\nchallenge for governments will be more difficult,\nbecause political decisions are not reached as\neasily as decisions in individual firms. Still, if\nwe approach the political issues with full understanding of the fundamentals of the demographics\nand with the spirit of compromise that characterizes our democracy, I am confident that we’ll\ncome out the other side of the demographic transition in fine shape.\n\nREFERENCES\nBernanke, Ben S. “Long-term Fiscal Challenges\nFacing the United States.” Testimony before the\nCommittee on the Budget, U.S. Senate.

        "content": "The GSEs: Where Do We Stand?\nChartered Financial Analysts of St. Louis\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nJanuary 17, 2007\nPublished in the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, May/June 2007, 89(3), pp. 143-51\n\nO\n\nne of the Federal Reserve’s most\nimportant responsibilities is maintenance of financial stability. The\njob obviously, and sometimes dramatically, encompasses crisis response. However,\nthe very existence of a crisis, when one occurs,\noften demonstrates a failure of some sort, on the\npart of the firms involved, the government, or\nthe Federal Reserve. It would not be difficult to\ncite examples of such failures.\nNot long after coming to the St. Louis Fed\nin 1998, I became interested in governmentsponsored enterprises, or GSEs. My interest arose\nwhen I began digging into aggregate data on the\nfinancial markets and discovered how large these\nfirms are. The bulk of all GSE assets are in the\nhousing GSEs—Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and\nthe 12 federal home loan banks (FHLBs). Using\ninformation as of September 30, 2006—the latest\navailable as of this writing—these 14 firms have\ntotal assets of $2.67 trillion; given their thin capital\npositions, their total liabilities are only a little\nsmaller. Just two firms—Fannie Mae and Freddie\nMac—account for $1.65 trillion of the assets, or\n62 percent of all housing GSE assets. Moreover,\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac have guaranteed\nmortgage-backed securities outstanding of $2.82\ntrillion. Thus, the housing GSE liabilities on\ntheir balance sheets and guaranteed obligations\noff their balance sheets are about $4.47 trillion,\nwhich may be compared with U.S. government\ndebt in the hands of the public of $4.83 trillion.\nIn what follows, I’ll confine most of my comments to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, where\nthe largest issues arise. My purpose is to make\nthe case once again that failure to reform these\n\nfirms leaves in place a potential source of financial crisis. Although there is pending legislation\nin Congress, a major restructuring of these firms\nand genuine reform appear to be as distant as ever.\nMy initial curiosity about the GSEs was stoked\nsimply by the size of these firms. As I investigated\nfurther, I became concerned about their thin capital positions and the realization that if any of\nthem got into financial trouble the markets and\nthe federal government would look to the Federal\nReserve to deal with the problem. As I worked\nthrough the issues, I began to speak on the subject; my first such speech was in October 2001\n(Poole, 2001). I last spoke on a GSE topic two years\nago, before the St. Louis Society of Financial\nAnalysts. My title then was “GSE Risks” (Poole,\n2005). Given that the risks did not seem likely to\ndisappear any time soon, about six months ago I\nsettled on a GSE topic once again.\nToday I want to look back over the past few\nyears to summarize a few of the changes that\nhave occurred at the GSEs and in the regulatory\nenvironment they face. It is no exaggeration to\nsay these have been event-filled years for the\nGSEs, primarily because of disclosures of accounting irregularities at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\nAlthough these firms stopped growing when the\nirregularities were disclosed, I will emphasize\nthat once they get their houses in good order they\nwill likely resume rapid growth because of the\nspecial advantages they enjoy in the marketplace\nfrom their ties to the federal government. I remain\nhopeful that Congress will eventually pass meaningful GSE reform legislation. Private sector financial firms ought to have an intense interest in\nreform legislation. Still, given that there seems\n1\n\n\fFINANCIAL MARKETS\n\nto be so little appreciation of the importance of\nthe GSE issue, where do they—and we—go from\nhere?\nBefore proceeding, I want to emphasize that\nthe views I express here are mine and do not\nnecessarily reflect official positions of the Federal\nReserve System. I thank my colleagues at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for their comments—especially Bill Emmons, senior economist,\nwho provided special assistance.\n\nTHE HOUSING GSEs SINCE\nJUNE 9, 2003\nAlthough the housing GSEs are less obscure\nthan they used to be, they are not much discussed\nin recent months. A year ago I would have noted\nthat it was not unusual to find stories about the\nGSEs on the front pages of major financial newspapers. They were the subject of substantial\ndebate in Congress and among financial policy\nexperts. They had escaped from obscurity, primarily because of publicity in recent years over\ntheir accounting irregularities. But today they\nseem to be returning to obscurity.\nFor Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two\nstockholder-owned housing GSEs, history can be\ndivided into two distinct eras—before June 2003\nand after. June 9, 2003, was the day the board of\ndirectors of Freddie Mac announced discovery\nof significant accounting irregularities. The stock\nprices of both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae\nplunged, as investors immediately realized that\nsomething might have gone terribly wrong with\nboth GSEs. Subsequent investigations by private\nexperts and public authorities confirmed the fears\nof many investors and financial supervisors.\nThese giant, fast-growing firms had poor accounting systems and financial controls.\nBecause it is important for my analysis later,\nkeep in mind these facts: First, the effect of disclosure of accounting irregularities at Freddie\nMac on June 9, 2003, led to a decline of 16 percent\nin Freddie’s stock price and 5 percent in Fannie’s\nstock price that day. However, as I’ll document\nlater, the effect of these disclosures on the mort2\n\ngage market was negligible. Similarly, when\nFannie’s accounting irregularities were disclosed\non September 22, 2004, its stock fell by 6.5 percent that day and by a total of 13.5 percent over\na three-day period; the mortgage rate was again\nunaffected.\nFortunately for financial stability, the accounting irregularities at Freddie Mac had been\ndesigned, as we later learned, to understate earnings by a total of about $9 billion over a period\nof years. Thus, there was no question of Freddie\nMac defaulting on any of its obligations and\nimmediately unleashing unpredictable effects\non its counterparties or the financial system. In\n2004, we learned that Fannie Mae’s accounting\nwas revealed to be faulty. In December 2006,\nFannie restated its earnings for 2002, 2003, and\nthe first half of 2004, revealing that it had overstated its earnings by a total of about $6 billion.\nFannie and Freddie are supervised by the\nOffice of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight,\nor OFHEO. In both cases, OFHEO’s early response\nto disclosure of the accounting irregularities was\nto declare the enterprises “significantly undercapitalized” because their extremely high leverage makes uncertainty of any kind about the true\ncapital backing of their portfolios a risk to their\nown safety and soundness, as well as the stability\nof the financial system. Beginning in the first\nquarter of 2004, OFHEO required Freddie Mac to\nhold capital at least 30 percent above the statutory\nminimum level; OFHEO imposed the identical\nrequirement on Fannie Mae in the third quarter\nof 2005. In addition, OFHEO required the firms\nto correct their accounting; undertake a thorough\nreview of corporate governance, incentives, and\ncompensation; appoint an independent chief\nrisk officer; and refrain from increasing their\nretained portfolios.\nThe stunning accounting irregularities at\nFreddie Mac and Fannie Mae served as wake-up\ncalls both to the GSEs themselves and to the\nsupervisory and legislative communities. Freddie\nMac fired virtually all of its top-level management\nimmediately in June 2003 and then, a few months\nlater, fired the new CEO it had hired to replace\n\n\fThe GSEs: Where Do We Stand?\n\nthe original disgraced CEO.1 Barely a year-and-ahalf later, Fannie Mae ejected its own top managers, who had repeatedly declared that, unlike\nFreddie’s, its own books were clean. The boards\nof both companies agreed to a series of governance\nreforms designed to bring the GSEs into line with\nother large financial firms. Hundreds of millions\nof shareholder dollars were committed to rebuilding accounting and control systems at both firms.\nBoth firms agreed to restate earnings for the past\nfew years; so massive was this undertaking that\nneither firm is current on its financial reporting.\nFreddie did release its annual report for 2005\nbut, according to its press release of January 5,\n2007, may revise its results materially for the first\nnine months and the third quarter of 2006. Nor\nis Fannie filing current reports. In December 2006,\nFannie filed its Form 10-K for 2004 with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nCurrently, investors in common stock or debt\nobligations issued by both companies rely on\npartial and incomplete information subject to\nmaterial revision.\nThe GSE accounting scandals constituted a\nrude awakening for OFHEO and Congress. OFHEO\nwas caught napping at Freddie Mac but, to its\ncredit, then identified Fannie Mae’s shortcomings\non its own. Once alerted to the problems, OFHEO’s\ntenacious investigations into wrongdoing at both\nFreddie Mac and Fannie Mae spurred investigations by the SEC and the Department of Justice.\nCongressional hearings were held, and GSE reform\nlegislation was passed in oversight committees\nof both houses of Congress in 2004 and 2005,\nalthough no final legislation has been enacted as\nof this time. I’ll have more to say about reform\nlegislation later, because I think this is an important missing piece of the overall puzzle.\nMeanwhile, the FHLBs—the “other housing\nGSEs”—were enduring accounting and control\ncrises of their own. Two of the twelve FHLBs\nsigned written regulatory agreements in 2004\n\nwith their supervisor, the Federal Housing\nFinance Board (FHFB), to rectify portfolio riskmanagement deficiencies. Then, in 2005, 10 of\nthe 12 FHLBs failed to meet their agreed deadline to register their stock with the SEC. Like\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, all of the FHLBs\nrestated their earnings for recent years; all have\nnow returned to timely filing of accounting\nstatements.\nSo where do we stand? I would characterize\nthe current situation as a period of uneasy waiting. The GSEs have grown much more slowly,\nand they have been more reticent in public in\nrecent quarters than they had been during the\npre-2003 decade. It appears that they want to\npursue a low-key strategy while memories of\ntheir accounting and control failures gradually\nfade. Their aim, apparently, is to return to the\nenvironment before heightened scrutiny arose in\n2003.\n\nWHAT HAS BEEN\nACCOMPLISHED: ANALYSIS OF\nGSE RISKS\nAlthough I think much more needs to be done,\nit would be a mistake to believe that nothing useful was done after severe accounting problems\nsurfaced in June 2003. In general terms, the most\nimportant achievement is a much broader and\nbetter-informed discussion of the risks to financial\nstability posed by the GSEs.2 We were fortunate\nthat the GSE accounting and governance scandals did not threaten the immediate solvency of\nthe enterprises and that the problems surfaced\nwhen the economy and financial markets were\nstrong.\nI will point to six major contributions to the\npublic investigation into, and debate about, the\nrisks posed by the GSEs. There have been other\ncontributors, to be sure, but this list provides\n\n1\n\nFreddie Mac’s board of directors had misjudged at first how deeply ingrained the internal-control and governance problems were and had\nhired the former CFO to become the new CEO.\n\n2\n\nFor a more detailed discussion of this topic, see Poole (2005).\n\n3\n\n\fFINANCIAL MARKETS\n\nwhat I think is a good overview of the issues and\nwhat we have learned so far:\n• a 2003 study by Dwight Jaffee of interest\nrate risks run by the GSEs;\n• a 2003 study by OFHEO of the potential\nsystemic risks posed by the GSEs;\n• a series of testimonies and speeches by\nFederal Reserve Board Chairman Alan\nGreenspan;\n• a series of research papers prepared by\nFederal Reserve System staff members;\n• the results of a Federal Reserve ad hoc\nstudy group investigating counterparty\nexposures and risks in the over-thecounter interest rate derivatives markets;\n• and an economic-capital analysis of\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac prepared by\nKenneth Posner, an equity analyst at\nMorgan Stanley.\nThese bullet points provide the flavor of\nsome of the recent work on the GSEs. The appendix to this speech provides a brief summary of\neach of these items and citations.\nConsidering these results as a whole, we have\nlearned a great deal in recent years about the\nway the GSEs operate, the risks they are taking\nand how they attempt to manage them, and what\neffects the GSEs have on financial markets during\nnormal times as well as during periods of market\nturbulence. Armed with this knowledge, lawmakers and policymakers are in a much better\nposition to make needed improvements in the\nstatutory and regulatory environment in which\nthe GSEs operate.\n\nTHE CASE FOR FUNDAMENTAL\nREFORM\nI continue to believe that the nation would\nbe well-served by turning the GSEs into genuinely\nprivate firms, without government backing,\nimplied or explicit. If they bolster their capital,\n3\n\n4\n\nSee www.ofheo.gov/media/pdf/capclass93004.pdf.\n\nthey can function perfectly well as purely private\nfirms.\nA key issue for many is whether privatizing\nFannie and Freddie would raise mortgage rates\npaid by borrowers. We now have some solid evidence on how the mortgage market would function if the housing GSEs became fully private\nfirms. A careful econometric investigation by\nthree economists at the Board of Governors last\nyear (Lehnert, Passmore, and Sherlund, 2006,\nabstract) reached this conclusion: “We find that\nGSE portfolio purchases have no significant effects\non either primary or secondary mortgage rate\nspreads.” Put another way, the 30-year mortgage\nrate fluctuates in tandem with the rate on 10-year\nTreasury bonds and the spread over the Treasury\nrate is not affected by portfolio purchases by\nFannie and Freddie.\nAnother approach to acquiring evidence on\nthe effects on the mortgage rate of mortgage purchases by Fannie and Freddie is to examine what\nhappened when their portfolios stopped growing\nin the wake of disclosures of accounting irregularities. Those disclosures led OFHEO to impose\n30 percent temporary surcharges on the firms’\nrequired minimum capital levels. Freddie Mac’s\ncapital surcharge was imposed in January 2004,\nwhereas Fannie Mae’s capital surcharge became\neffective in September 2004.3 To meet the higher\ncapital ratio, the two firms had to do some combination of raising new capital and reducing their\nportfolios.\nThe retained portfolios of mortgages and\nmortgage-backed securities (MBS) held by Fannie\nand Freddie grew strongly in the years preceding\nthe OFHEO orders. For example, if we look at\nyear-end figures for 2002 and 2003, we see that\nover the course of 2003 the two firms’ retained\nportfolios grew by a net of 12.3 percent and, at\nthe end of 2003, they held 22 percent of outstanding mortgages on 1- to 4-family properties. Net\ngrowth of their retained portfolios then stopped;\nover the course of both 2004 and 2005, their total\nportfolios of mortgages and MBS fell slightly. In\n2006, their retained portfolios continued to\n\n\fThe GSEs: Where Do We Stand?\n\ndecline and by the end of the third quarter their\nportfolios were below year-end 2005. Meanwhile,\nthe total market continued to expand. The combined market share of Fannie and Freddie fell\nfrom 22 percent at the end of 2003 to 14 percent\nat the end of the third quarter of 2006.\nWhat happened to the mortgage spread when\nthe GSEs stopped accumulating ever-larger portfolios? Nothing. Because fixed-rate mortgages\nare subject to prepayment risk, whereas the 10year Treasury bond is not, there is a degree of\nvariability of the mortgage spread. But if the cessation of the GSEs’ portfolio growth had made a\ndifference, it surely would have shown up in the\ndata. The annual average of the spread in 2003,\nbefore the OFHEO orders that restricted Fannie\nand Freddie’s portfolio growth, was 180 basis\npoints; the spread was 157 basis points in both\n2004 and 2005.\nNor did we observe any sort of shock to the\nmarket when the accounting irregularities at\nFreddie were disclosed in June 2003. The spread\nwas 196 basis points in May 2003, 198 basis points\nin June, and 196 basis points in July. Consider\nalso January 2004, when OFHEO imposed a capital surcharge on Freddie. That month, the mortgage spread was 159 basis points. The month\nbefore, the spread was 161 basis points; the month\nafter, 156 basis points. The OFHEO order applying to Fannie came in September 2004. That\nmonth the spread was 163 basis points; the month\nbefore, 159; the month after, 162.\nToward the beginning of my remarks, I noted\nthat disclosure of the accounting irregularities\ndid affect the stock prices of the two firms. Now\nwe see that there was no effect on the mortgage\nmarket. The issue, clearly, is the profitability of\nthe firms and not effects on the mortgage market.\nThe effects of problems at Fannie and Freddie\non the mortgage market have been minimal\nbecause the market contains many competent\nand well-capitalized competitors that can readily\npick up the slack when other players stumble.\nFinancial firms throughout the economy\nought to have an intense interest in reforming\n4\n\nthe GSEs. One reason is simply that banks and\nother financial firms, and many nonfinancial\nfirms, hold large amounts of GSE obligations and\nGSE-guaranteed MBS. I believe that many risk\nmanagers simply accept that GSEs are effectively\nbackstopped by the Federal Reserve and the federal government without ever thinking through\nhow such implicit guarantees would actually\nwork in a crisis. The view seems to be that someone, somehow, would do what is necessary in a\ncrisis. Good risk management requires that the\n“someone” be identified and the “somehow” be\nspecified. I have emphasized before that if you\nare thinking about the Federal Reserve as the\n“someone,” you should understand that the Fed\ncan provide liquidity support but not capital.4\nAs for the “somehow,” I urge you to be sure you\nunderstand the extent of the president’s powers\nto provide emergency aid, the likely speed of\ncongressional action, and the possibility that\npolitical disputes would slow resolution of the\nsituation.\nThere is a long-run issue that goes beyond\nthat of today’s systemic risk. The fact is that it is\nvery profitable for a firm to be able to borrow at\nclose to the Treasury rate, lend at the market rate,\nand hold little capital. That is why the promise\nof constraints on the portfolio growth at Fannie\nand Freddie had a significant effect on their stock\nprices. Any firm with such a privileged position\nwill want to extend its scope of operations. Over\nthe past 15 years, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\nhave grown much more rapidly than has the\nstock of mortgages outstanding and, as a consequence, now hold or guarantee a large fraction of\nU.S. home mortgages. At the end of 1990, they\nheld in their portfolios 5 percent of the mortgages\nfor 1- to 4-family properties; the share peaked at\n22 percent at the end of 2003; and, at the end of\nthe third quarter of 2006, the share was 14 percent. Given the powerful incentive Fannie and\nFreddie have to grow, the systemic risk they pose\nto the economy will also grow.\nOnce their current accounting problems are\nfully resolved, Fannie and Freddie will want to\n\nFor a discussion of Federal Reserve emergency powers, see Poole (2004).\n\n5\n\n\fFINANCIAL MARKETS\n\nresume their growth. It is simply very profitable\nto be able to borrow at close to the Treasury rate\nand invest in mortgages while holding minimal\ncapital. Banks maintain capital ratios double or\nmore the ratios that Fannie and Freddie maintain.\nBanks pay deposit insurance premiums to the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, whereas\nFannie and Freddie pay no insurance premiums.\nAssuming that the implied guarantee would, in a\ncrisis, lead to a federal bailout, U.S. taxpayers\nbear the risk while the shareholders and managers of Fannie and Freddie enjoy the profits.\nThis situation encourages these firms to grow\nvigorously.\nThese two firms, however, cannot meet their\ngrowth targets in the long run if they confine\ntheir operations to conforming home mortgages.\nTheir interest in increasing the conforming mortgage limit is clear. Moreover, in my opinion, it is\ninevitable that they will look for ways to extend\ntheir operations into new areas. They have that\nclear incentive because of the implicit federal\nguarantee they enjoy. For them to extend their\noperations into market segments already well\nserved by existing private firms will not enhance\nthe efficiency of mortgage markets or reduce\ncosts to mortgage borrowers.\nThere are two possible ways to constrain the\noperations of the GSEs to areas with a clear public\npurpose. One is to end the implied federal guarantee so that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac compete on an equal basis with other fully private\nfirms. The other is to place restrictions on the\nsize of their owned portfolios if they retain their\nprivileged position. Their owned portfolios should\nbe limited to mortgages held temporarily in the\nprocess of securitization.\nAbsent complete privatization, or on the way\nto it, Congress should strengthen the powers of\nOFHEO or a successor regulator. OFHEO has\nweaker powers than provided by law to the federal bank regulators—the Office of the Comptroller\nof the Currency, the Federal Reserve, and the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The GSE\nsupervisory framework remains fragmented and\n5\n\n6\n\nMost recently, the GAO criticized GSE oversight in Walker (2005).\n\nweak, as the GAO has pointed out on numerous\noccasions.5 Thus, structural change of the GSEs\nand their supervision should be at the top of the\nreform agenda. There is a glaring need for legislation to clarify the bankruptcy process should a\nGSE fail. At present, there is no process and no\none knows what would happen if a GSE becomes\nunable to meet its obligations.\nFreddie Mac and Fannie Mae both got into\ntrouble with accounting irregularities in part\nbecause of the complexities under generally\naccepted accounting principles for derivatives\npositions and rules determining which assets\nshould be reported at market value and which\nshould be reported at amortized historical cost.\nSound risk management practices require that\nGSE management base decisions on market values,\nor estimates as close to market values as financial\ntheory and practice permit. The reason is simple:\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac pursue policies\nthat inherently expose the firms to an extreme\nasset/liability duration mismatch. They hold\nlong-term mortgages and MBS financed by shortterm liabilities. Given this strategy, they must\nengage in extensive operations in derivatives\nmarkets to create synthetically a duration match\non the two sides of the balance sheet. These operations expose the firm to a huge amount of risk\nunless the positions are measured at market value.\nAlmost all the assets and liabilities of the\nGSEs are either traded actively in excellent markets or have values that can be accurately measured by prices in such markets. For this reason,\nthe financial condition of the GSEs ought to be\nmeasured through fair-value accounting and such\naccounts ought to be the principal yardstick of\ncondition and performance.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSince the GSE accounting scandals emerged\nin mid-2003, one thing has remained rock-solid:\nThe GSEs have continued to borrow at yields\n\n\fThe GSEs: Where Do We Stand?\n\nonly slightly higher than those of the U.S. government and noticeably lower than those available\nto any other AAA-rated private company or entity.\nIn other words, despite the vast recent accumulation of knowledge about the significant risks\nrun by the GSEs, as well as their inability (or\nunwillingness) to manage these risks, investors\nin GSE debt securities appear unmoved. Upon\nreflection, the lack of market discipline evident\nduring this crisis period is striking—like a dog\nthat did not bark. This fact indicates to me that\nthere still is a significant problem with the GSEs\nthat needs to be fixed.\nThe obvious answer to why the dog did not\nbark is that the so-called “implicit guarantee”—\nthat is, the belief by investors that the U.S. government would not allow the GSEs to default on\ntheir debt obligations—has not been removed.\nIndeed, the talk of increased GSE regulation and\nthe failure of structural-reform legislation to\nbecome law may actually have reinforced the\nbelief of many that, overall, the government is\nperfectly happy with the situation as it is. The\nGSEs remain politically powerful, if less strident\nthan they were a few years ago.\nThree essential reforms are needed to eliminate the GSEs’ threat to financial stability. First\nis a limit on their portfolio growth, second is an\nincrease in their minimal required capital, and\nthird is satisfactory bankruptcy legislation so that,\nshould the worst happen, federal authorities can\ndeal with the problem in an orderly way.\nFreddie Mac apparently does not expect any\nsignificant increases in constraints on its operations. Funds that could have been used to build\ncapital to better protect taxpayers have instead\nbeen used to increase common stock dividends.\nFreddie set a quarterly dividend of $0.22 in the\nfourth quarter of 2002 and has increased the dividend every year since. As of the fourth quarter\nof 2006, the dividend stands at $0.50 per quarter,\nmore than twice its level four years earlier.\nFannie Mae cut its dividend in half in early 2005\nto build capital, but I’ll hazard a guess that once\nit starts issuing regular financial statements the\ncompany will increase its dividend rather than\nbuild capital further.\n\nI began this speech noting that the Federal\nReserve has a responsibility to maintain financial\nstability. That responsibility includes increasing\nawareness of threats to stability and formation of\nrecommendations for structural reform. I do not\nbelieve that a GSE crisis is imminent. However,\nfor those who believe that a GSE crisis is unthinkable in the future, I suggest a course in economic\nhistory.\n\nREFERENCES\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n(Parkinson, Patrick and Gibson, Michael) and\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York (Mosser, Patricia;\nWalter, Stefan and LaTorre, Alex). “Concentration\nand Risk in the OTC Markets for U.S. Dollar Interest\nRate Options,” March 2005;\nwww.federalreserve.gov/ BoardDocs/Surveys/\nOpStudySum/OptionsStudySummary.pdf.\nEmmons, William R. and Sierra, Gregory E.\n“Incentives Askew?

Jaffee concluded that the\nGSEs actually incurred significant interest rate and liquidity risks, despite their own characterization\nof such risks as being minimal. Subsequent events and analysis have proven Jaffee correct.\nOFHEO (2003) Study of Potential Systemic Risks Posed by GSEs\nEven before the GSE accounting scandals broke, the GSEs’ safety-and-soundness supervisor had\nprepared a study comprising scenarios in which the GSEs might contribute to systemic risk. Although\nOFHEO concluded that the likelihood of one or both GSEs contributing to financial-system instability\nwas very small, the agency recommended to Congress that its (OFHEO’s) supervisory powers should\nbe enhanced to further safeguard the GSEs and the financial system.\nPublic Statements by Chairman Alan Greenspan (2005a,b,c)\nFederal Reserve Chairman Greenspan (2005a) rejected the idea of stronger GSE regulation in favor\nof portfolio limits, stating that,\nWorld-class regulation, by itself, may not be sufficient and, indeed, might even worsen the potential for\nsystemic risk if market participants inferred from such regulation that the government would be more\nlikely to back GSE debt in the event of financial stress…We at the Federal Reserve believe this dilemma\nwould be resolved by placing limits on the GSEs’ portfolios of assets.\n\nChairman Greenspan also drew attention to the strains the GSEs could place on the over-thecounter interest rate derivatives markets due to their portfolio-hedging activities.\nResearch Papers by Federal Reserve Staff 6\nOne of these papers estimated the pass-through by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of their fundingcost advantage into primary mortgage rates, finding a mere 7 basis points of pass-through. Another\npaper provided evidence against the GSEs’ claims that their purchasing behavior stabilizes mortgage\nrates during periods of market turbulence. Other papers discuss (i) likely competitive interactions\nbetween the GSEs and large banks that will be subject to Basel II capital regulation and (ii) the illstructured incentives the GSEs face to increase the size of their portfolios.\nAd Hoc Federal Reserve Study Group Examining GSE Impacts on Interest Rate Derivatives\nMarkets (Board of Governors, 2005)\nThe study group identified potential channels through which disruptions at the GSEs could flow\nthrough to other market participants in the over-the-counter markets for interest rate derivatives, like\nswaps, interest rate options, and swaptions (options on swaps). The study group reported that market\nparticipants felt current risk-management practices were sufficient to contain risks posed by the\nGSEs.\n\n6\n\nThese include Passmore (2005), Sherlund, and Burgess (2005), Lehnert, Passmore, and Sherlund (2006), Hancock et al. (2005), Frame and\nWhite (2005, and Emmons and Sierra (2004).\n\n9\n\n\fFINANCIAL MARKETS\n\nEconomic-Capital Analysis of GSEs by Morgan Stanley (Posner, 2005)\nKenneth Posner, an equity analyst at Morgan Stanley, isolated the distinct economic risks faced by\nthe GSEs and estimated how much capital the firms would need to provide adequate protection to\ndebtholders to justify an AA senior-unsecured bond rating. This analysis assumed that there would be\nno support forthcoming (or expected by financial-market participants) from the federal government.\nHis estimate of the required equity-to-assets capital ratio was in the range of 4 to 7 percent, about\ntwice as high as the current GSE ratios of closer to 3 percent. Thus, the GSEs would be significantly\nundercapitalized today if there were no expectation of government support of their liabilities.\n\n10\n\n\f"
