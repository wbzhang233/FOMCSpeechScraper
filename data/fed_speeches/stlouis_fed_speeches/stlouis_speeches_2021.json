He spoke about several aspects of Fed\npolicy, the arrival of vaccines, the possibility of higher in�ation, and more.\nBullard noted that the Fed acted very quickly in response to the COVID-19 crisis. The\nemergency lending programs stemmed an incipient �nancial crisis that could’ve occurred\non top of the pandemic, he said.\nOn the health crisis, Bullard cited projections that show fatalities per day declining as the\nvaccine is rolled out. Declining fatalities will have big rami�cations for the economy, and\npeople will see the light at the end of the tunnel for the pandemic, he said.\n\n\fRegarding the Fed’s balance sheet policy, Bullard noted that the FOMC has agreed on statecontingent (or data-dependent) language that says how long asset purchases will continue at\nthe current pace—i.e., the pace will continue until substantial further progress has been\nmade toward the maximum employment and price stability goals.\nBullard also said that the conditions are good for generating in�ation, and noted that three\ntheories on what determines in�ation over the medium term are all pointing in the same\ndirection. He cited less pre-emptive policy from the Fed than in the past, the large size of\n�scal de�cits, and the outlook for a hot economy.\n\n\f",

He spoke during a\nmoderated panel discussion at the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) Economic\nPolicy Conference.\nBullard noted that the monetary policy and fiscal policy responses during the COVID-19 crisis have\nbeen quite good. He also noted that the economic recovery has been quite a bit stronger than most\npeople had projected as of last March and April.\nHe said that he is expecting a strong year on many dimensions for the U.S. economy. For 2021, he\nhas penciled in 6.5% real GDP growth, inflation moving up to 2.5% and unemployment moving\ndown to 4.5%. He cautioned that the pandemic is still going on, adding that he’d like to see actual\ndata come in that verifies his forecast.\nOn the issue of federal debt, Bullard noted that he has been thinking about new ways to assess debtto-GDP ratios across nations and how much debt is too much. He said the advice from\nmacroeconomists has to take the country into account, rather than having a blanket statement that\nsome debt-to-GDP ratio is appropriate for all nations at all times.\nRegarding the U.S. dollar, he reiterated his view that the dollar is going to be the world’s reserve\ncurrency for a long time. He also discussed currency competition, privately issued currencies and\nexchange rate chaos.

The Paul Simon Public\nPolicy Institute at Southern Illinois University hosted the virtual conversation.\nBullard discussed the history behind the Fed’s regional structure as well as some of the different\nresponsibilities of Federal Reserve banks and the Board of Governors. He also talked about ways\nthe St. Louis Fed keeps in touch with businesses and communities throughout the Eighth Federal\nReserve District.\nIn discussing the Fed’s actions during the pandemic, he said that the “13(3)” backstop lending\nprograms eliminated the incipient financial crisis that could have occurred on top of the pandemic.\nSection 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act allows for such emergency lending by the Fed with the\nconsent of the U.S. Treasury Secretary. Bullard also said that the fiscal policy response has been\nexceptionally effective for this shock.\nRegarding current monetary policy, Bullard said the Federal Open Market Committee has a great\npolicy in place for right now. He said he anticipates the pandemic will come to a close through the\nvaccine strategy, but it hasn’t happened yet. “And so, I think keep the policies in place until you get\nfarther along here, and then as the dust settles, we can open up a conversation about what to do\nnext,” he said.\nHe said he expects to see a very strong U.S. economy and a strong labor market once the pandemic\nends, and expects inflation to be 2.5% at the end of this year.\nBullard also highlighted several St. Louis Fed resources during the event, including the new\nInstitute for Economic Equity, his research on monetary policy and inequality, the FRED economic\ndatabase and the On the Economy blog.\nHaving trouble with the video?

He participated in a panel discussion with Dallas Fed President Robert S. Kaplan.\nBullard noted that the Federal Open Market Committee’s median projection for economic growth in\n2021 was upgraded to 7% and the median projection for core PCE inflation moved up to 3% in the\nlatest Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). These compare to median projections of about 4%\non economic growth and 1.8% on core PCE inflation in the December SEP. “I just think we’re in a\nmuch stronger position with respect to reopening than we would have anticipated, and the inflation\nhas come along with it,” he said.\nThe essence of the Fed’s new monetary policy framework is that the FOMC would allow inflation to\nrun above target for some time, Bullard noted. Then the FOMC would approach 2% inflation from\nthe high side and get something pretty close to 2% inflation when averaged across past years, he\nsaid.\nBullard cautioned that this is a period of high volatility and that there is upside risk to inflation.\n“We have to be ready on both sides, I think, to be able to react to that, to be state contingent, to be\nnimble, just as nimble coming out of the pandemic as I think we had to be going into the\npandemic,” he said.\nOn the labor market, Bullard said that the anecdotal evidence is overwhelming that it is very tight.\nHe also noted that the extent of labor market improvement has been dramatic, with the\nunemployment rate now down to 5.8%. He added that he expects lots of further improvement in the\nmonths and quarters ahead.\nRegarding tapering the Fed’s bond purchases, Bullard noted that the debate is now open and that\nmany parameters will have to be set, including the degree of state contingency.\nHe also addressed questions about fiscal policy, financial stability risks and the U.S. Treasury\nmarket during the panel discussion.\nHaving trouble with the video?

Regarding U.S. labor markets, Bullard said they\nare tight according to anecdotal evidence and key labor market metrics.\nBullard also talked about rising inflation. He said that inflation is likely to be meaningfully\nabove 2% over the forecast horizon, so the Federal Open Market Committee can meet a key\nprovision of its new policy framework with an appropriate monetary policy. “A new risk is that\ninflation may continue to surprise to the upside,” he said.\n\nFOLLOW US\n\nSIGN UP FOR EMAIL ALERTS\nReceive updates in your inbox as soon as new content is published on our website\nSIGN UP\nQUICK LINKS\nAbout Us\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2021/us-monetary-policy-a-new-risk\n\n1/2\n\n\f12/21/22, 5:46 PM\n\nU.S. Monetary Policy: A New Risk | James Bullard | St. Louis Fed\n\nLegal Information\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nCareers\nDoing Business with the Fed\nEvents\nFederal Reserve Services\nVisiting the St. Louis Fed\nFederal Banking Regulations\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2021/us-monetary-policy-a-new-risk\n\n2/2\n\n\f",

It has\npassed the pre-pandemic peak and is poised to move considerably\nhigher.\nThe “keep households whole” U.S. fiscal strategy has been successful\nwell beyond initial hopes.\nU.S. labor markets are exceptionally tight.\nInflation is likely to be meaningfully above 2% over the forecast\nhorizon, allowing the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to\naccomplish a key provision of its new framework, but also presenting\nupside risks.\nThe three topics for future research are hidden in these slides.\n3\n\n\fThe State of the Health Crisis\nin the U.S. and Europe\n\n4\n\n\fFatality rates and economic activity\n•\n•\n•\n\nWith the arrival of vaccines, daily fatalities per 100,000 population\ndeclined from peaks set in the winter of 2021 in both Europe and the\nU.S., but these measures have increased in recent weeks.\nEast Asia and Pacific countries as a group have reported daily fatalities\nper 100,000 population that are much lower than those of the U.S. and\nEurope, until recently.\nSome emerging market countries remain vulnerable to the pandemic and\nwill take longer to vaccinate.\n\n5\n\n\fPandemic intensity in key production regions\n\nSources: Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and\nauthor’s calculations.

Last observation: July 2021.\n14\n\n\fThe payoff to the U.S. fiscal strategy\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nThe fiscal strategy has enabled U.S. households to pay ordinary\nexpenses during the pandemic.\nThis has kept the U.S. economy from suffering additional damage that\ncould have occurred during the pandemic.\nHouseholds are now in a strong position to spend and invest as the\npandemic comes under better control.\nA key research question is whether this type of fiscal policy has\nbroader applicability outside of a well-defined pandemic crisis.\n\n15\n\n\fTight U.S. Labor Markets\n\n16\n\n\fUnemployed persons vs. job openings\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nAnecdotal reports from U.S. businesses strongly suggest that attracting\nworkers to available jobs is difficult in the current environment.\nAlternative measures of labor market performance may give a more\naccurate reading of the state of the labor market than the number of\njobs on payrolls or the number of hours worked.\nOne alternative measure is the ratio of officially unemployed persons\nto job openings.\nThis measure is approaching an all-time low, suggesting a very strong\nlabor market.\n\n17\n\n\fA tightening labor market\n\nSources: Bureau of Labor Statistics and author’s calculations.

Shaded areas indicate U.S. recessions. Last observation: July 2021.\n20\n\n\fInflation Rising\n\n21\n\n\fInflation surprises to the upside\n•\n•\n•\n\nLast December, the FOMC median projection suggested that in 2021\nreal GDP would grow at a 4.2% rate but that core PCE inflation would\nbe just 1.8%.*\nAt the June FOMC meeting, the median projection suggested that in\n2021 real GDP growth would be 7% and core PCE inflation would be\n3%.\nThis year has brought a substantial upside surprise on both real GDP\ngrowth and inflation.\n\n* These are the median projections of change in real GDP and core PCE inflation. Both measures are percent changes\nfrom 2020-Q4 to 2021-Q4.\n22\n\n\fInflation above target this year\n\nSources: Bureau of Economic Analysis and Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). Last observation: July 2021.\n23\n\n\fThe new monetary policy framework\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nThe FOMC’s new policy framework was announced in Chair Powell’s\nJackson Hole speech in August 2020.\nA key aspect of the new framework is the desire of the FOMC to allow\ninflation to run above the 2% target for some time to make up for past\nmisses of the inflation target to the low side.\nIt now appears that the FOMC will be able to achieve this result with\nan appropriate monetary policy over the next several years.\nAn important focus for research is the development of appropriate\nmetrics for the evaluation of flexible average inflation targeting\n(FAIT).\n24\n\n\fAverage inflation targeting\n\nSources: Bureau of Economic Analysis, Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) and author’s calculations. Last\nobservation: 2020-Q4.\n25\n\n\fConclusion\n\n26\n\n\fThree research questions\n\n•\n•\n•\n\nHow does the macroeconomy adapt to an important new risk, one that did\nnot exist previously? In the pandemic, this has been a new mortality risk,\nbut there could also be other types of new risks.\nIn the pandemic, U.S. fiscal policy appears to have successfully insured\ndisrupted households against declines in income. Could this type of fiscal\npolicy be used more generally?\nThe Fed has adopted flexible average inflation targeting, and in the very\nfirst year of implementation, there has been a large inflationary shock. What\nis the best metric to evaluate whether FAIT is successful?\n\n27\n\n\fConnect With Us\nJames Bullard\n\nstlouisfed.org/from-the-president\nDISCOVER STLOUISFED.ORG\n\nNEWS &\nVIEWS\nStay informed of our\nworld-renowned economic\nresearch through blogs,\npodcasts and publications.\n\nFRED®\n\nECONOMIC\nEDUCATION\n\nFederal Reserve\nEconomic Data\n\nGraph, transform and share\nhundreds of thousands of\ndata series from trusted\nsources around the world.\n\nEXPLORE THE EXHIBITS\n\nFind award-winning activities,\nvideos, lessons and more,\nwith publicly available\nresources for all ages.\n\nCOMMUNITY\nDEVELOPMENT\nLearn how the St. Louis\nFed works to support\nan economy in which\neveryone can benefit.\n\nS U B S C R I B E & S TAY I N T O U C H\n\nSubscribe to\ne-newsletters\n\nFollow us\non social\n\n28\n\n\f",

Held virtually this year, the conference is sponsored by the\nFederal Reserve System, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors and the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation.\nBullard discussed the importance of bringing various perspectives together to inform the\nthinking on the future of community banking. He also introduced the �rst keynote speaker\nof the conference: Federal Reserve Gov. Michelle “Miki” Bowman.\nFull text of remarks:\n\nPrepared Welcoming Remarks1\nJames Bullard\nPresident and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n2021 Community Banking in the 21st Century Research and Policy Conference (Virtual)\nFederal Reserve System, Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) and Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)\nSept. 28, 2021\nOn behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, I’d like to welcome you to this year’s\nvirtual community bank research conference. I’d also like to acknowledge the important\npartnership we enjoy with the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation, the Board of Governors and other Reserve banks to bring you this\n\n\fconference every year.\nIn “normal” times, we would be gathering in St. Louis to hear from an impressive array of\nresearchers, bankers and regulators from around the world—and after the formal\npresentations were over, we’d meet informally in our Gateway Conference Center to engage\nin lively discussions and debate ideas.\nOver the years, those discussions have led to new relationships. They’ve also generated new\nresearch ideas. For example, I recently learned that one of the papers in this year’s\nconference came about directly because of a conversation between a community banker\nand a researcher a few years ago at this conference.\nWhile those conversations will be a bit more challenging in the virtual environment, we’ve\nall gotten much better at working, communicating and interacting with each other virtually\nover the past 18 months. I encourage you to take full advantage of the opportunities to\nconnect with one another during this virtual event in order to keep information and ideas\n�owing between all of our presenters and attendees. That’s the real value of this and all\nresearch conferences: the exchanging of ideas.\nThis year’s conference focuses on a number of important ideas, including:\n• The impact of two extraordinary pandemic-era programs: the Paycheck Protection\nProgram and the Federal Reserve’s Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility\n• The impact of minority banks in their communities and the role community\ndevelopment �nancial institutions (CDFIs) play in allocating credit to low- and\nmoderate-income communities\n• The consequences and incentives around supervisory oversight\nWe’ll also hear from an expert panel of community bankers who will offer their views on the\nfuture of commercial real estate lending.\nAs we just heard, thanks to the efforts of the state banking commissioners who conduct the\nCSBS National Survey of Community Banks, community banks were able to understand and\nreact quickly to the challenges of the pandemic. They are now looking ahead to a future that\nwill consist of new competitors and new technologies that could have a signi�cant impact\non how banks will offer products and services in the future.\nUnderstanding that future is a challenge for all of us—researchers, regulators, policymakers\nand community bankers. That’s why I believe that this conference is so important—it’s the\none place that we very deliberately bring all of those perspectives together.\nAmong the perspectives that inform our thinking on the future of community banking are\n\n\fthose of our �rst keynote speaker: Federal Reserve Gov. Miki Bowman.\nGov. Bowman, with her focus on community and regional banking organizations, has\nbrought new ideas and new energy to the Board of Governors regarding banking and\nbanking supervision issues. She’s challenged staff to promote innovation and lessen\nregulatory burden while also strengthening our overall banking and �nancial system.\nAs a former community banker and state regulator, she brings important insights to her\nwork at the Fed and to forums such as this conference. I appreciate the commitment she\nhas made to incorporate a wide range of perspectives into her thinking as she implements\nnew initiatives and ideas. I also appreciate the commitment she has made to this\nconference—and her commitment to participate in these proceedings every year since she\nbecame a Fed governor (and even prior to becoming governor).\nWelcome, Gov. Bowman.\n1 Any opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily re�ect those of the\n\n\f",

His\nremarks were during a panel discussion at the International Research Conference hosted by the\nCentral Bank of the Philippines and the Reinventing Bretton Woods Committee.\nWhile nobody really knows at this point how big an effect the delta variant has had on GDP growth\nin the third quarter, most forecasters expect that growth to get pushed into the next few quarters or\nall of 2022, Bullard said. “In a way, it’s a bullish factor for 2022 because it’s just postponing growth,\nnot eliminating growth, for the U.S.,” he said.\nRegarding inflation, Bullard noted that the risk with the Fed’s flexible average inflation targeting\nframework is that this year’s inflation shock will be too big and that monetary policy won’t react fast\nenough, resulting in more inflation than the FOMC intended.\n“The risk management approach to monetary policy that I’ve been advocating suggests that we\nshould take this inflation risk seriously,” he said. “We certainly are expecting inflation to moderate.\nBut I want to be prepared for the case where it doesn’t moderate as much as hoped, and that we’re\nable to keep inflation under control in that scenario without disrupting the economy or sending the\nU.S. economy or the global economy into recession.”\nIn discussing current monetary policy, Bullard noted that the FOMC gave a strong signal at its most\nrecent meeting that tapering of the Fed’s asset purchases would begin soon. The tapering process is\nthe first step toward pulling back some of the aggressively easy monetary policy that was put in\nplace to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, he said.\nHaving trouble with the video?

The Aspen Institute and the St.\nLouis Fed partnered to publish the book, which includes 63 essays from leading experts.\nFull text of remarks:\n\nOpening Remarks1\nJames Bullard\nPresident and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nBook Launch: The Future of Building Wealth\nThe Aspen Institute and Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nSept. 30, 2021\nIt’s a pleasure to be here. I want to thank Dan Porter�eld for his introduction and for\norganizing today’s exciting book launch event.\nThe St. Louis Fed is proud to partner with the Aspen Institute for this book on building\nwealth inclusively. When Ray approached us with the idea for this book, we thought, “What\na great way to keep Ray busy!”\nBut seriously, like Ray, the St. Louis Fed believes that the con�uence of so many large events\nmakes this book especially timely—the pandemic, the recession that followed, and our\nnation’s critical efforts around racial reckoning. And all of these are occurring amidst levels\nof economic inequality our nation hasn’t seen in a century. These are precisely the kinds of\n\n\fevents that present opportunities to update our country’s social contract. We didn’t want to\nmiss our chance to put some bold and innovative ideas on the table.\nWhile it’s not the Fed’s role to direct �scal policy, it is our role as thought leaders—in\nmacroeconomic policy, economic research, economic education and community\ndevelopment—to offer fact-based ideas that could improve our nation’s economy, especially\nfor those struggling Americans who could more fully reap its rewards.\nThought leadership has always been central to the St. Louis Fed’s mission, and we were\neager to provide leadership in an area where we were already heavily invested: savings and\nwealth building among those with fewer resources.\nThrough our recently sunset Center for Household Financial Stability, founded in the wake\nof the Great Recession, we documented large and enduring wealth gaps along racial,\neducational, generational and gender lines. These gaps, as the opening essays in the book\ndemonstrate, remain large and enduring:\n• The top 10% of American families owns 70% of total �nancial wealth, while the bottom\nhalf owns only 2%.\n• Those in the top half of the wealth distribution are more likely to be older, white or\nhighly educated; these groups own more family wealth than their share of the\npopulation.\n• The bottom half is disproportionately younger, Black or Hispanic and less educated;\nthese groups own less family wealth than their share of the population.\nIn many ways, we see this book as a capstone of the Center’s efforts to promote wealth\nbuilding inclusively, but we also see it as a cornerstone of the Center’s successor, the\nInstitute for Economic Equity, which views wealth equity as critical to achieving overall\neconomic equity in our country.\nObviously, we have a long way to go to reach wealth equity. For example, the typical, or\nmedian, white family has a net worth of about $184,000, while the typical Black family has\njust $23,000.\nThink about what these different levels mean for a family’s economic resilience in the face\nof a job loss, car breakdown or natural disaster—or for a family’s ability to look ahead: to\ninvest in education, a small business, a �rst home or a secure retirement. We all know that\nwealth begets wealth, so the challenge is: How do you accumulate some wealth in the �rst\nplace? Answering that question is one of the reasons we’re eager to publish this book.\nThe book aims to document profound wealth gaps but also point toward some promising\nsolutions. Knowing that we don’t have all the answers, Ray and Aspen reached out to over\n\n\f100 diverse and leading experts, resulting in over 60 original essays. These essays not only\noffered the latest thinking on ways to shore up fragile family balance sheets, but also how to\ndevise entirely new ways of generating an ownership stake in the U.S. economy.\nImportantly, working toward wealth equity at the household level contributes to a stronger\noverall economy. This point was strongly reinforced in a conversation I had with three of my\nFed colleagues—Presidents Bostic of the Atlanta Fed, Harker of the Philadelphia Fed and\nKashkari of the Minneapolis Fed—a summary of which is included in this book. In that\ndiscussion, my colleagues also described how the Fed could help address racial and other\nwealth gaps using the tools at its disposal.\nThank you for joining us today. We hope you’ll pick up your free copy—the price is right—of\nthe book and especially engage in the conversations we’re sure it will start.\nI’m now pleased to turn the program over to the book’s co-editors, my colleague Ray\nBoshara along with Ida Rademacher of the Aspen Institute.\n1 Any opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily re�ect those of the\n\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\n\f",

That hasn’t been felt to be the case in the U.S. for years, he added.\nDuring the panel, Bullard noted that output and national income are higher today than before the\npandemic because the U.S. economy has adjusted and has so much resilience. He also said the U.S.\nmay be switching to a higher productivity growth rate and therefore a higher medium-term growth\nrate for the economy.\nHe also touched on fiscal policy during the pandemic, trade policy and immigration policy.\nHaving trouble with the video?

        "content": "Unofficial Transcript:\nVirtual Discussion with St. Louis Fed President James Bullard\nSeymour, Ind. (via WebEx)\nNov. 18, 2021\nNikki Lanier: Good morning, all. My name is Nikki Lanier, and I have the pleasure of serving as the senior\nvice president and regional executive of the Louisville Branch office of the Federal Reserve Bank of St.\nLouis. And I’m just so excited to welcome you to this convening this morning. This feels like a long time\ncoming. We’ve had various fits and starts, trying to make sure that we have an opportunity for our\nwonderfully auspicious president to visit with the leaders in Seymour. And COVID notwithstanding, we\nwere able to find an opportunity to do just that. So I’m very appreciative of all of you hanging in there\nwith us and kind of pivoting to this format this morning.\nToday’s session is being recorded and will likely be posted on the St. Louis Fed website. I would\njust ask that, during the Q&A, if you have a question, if you wouldn’t mind, please briefly introducing\nyourself when asking the question and then of course unmute yourself after the moderated discussion\nto do so.\nSo the timeline will be as follows for today’s discussion. The first portion will be a moderated\ninterview. It’s going to be about 20 minutes, followed by 30 minutes of open dialogue. Our President Jim\nBullard is super interested in your perspectives and your musings as it relates to your own\nunderstanding of and experience with the economy right now, so he’d love to hear that. During the\nopen dialogue session, the attendees will be able to mute and unmute your microphones to ask\nquestions after the commentary.\nI do want to make a few acknowledgements. The first is our wonderful board chair, Emerson\nGoodwin. And then my illustrious boss, First Vice President of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nKathy Paese. We have various members of the Bank’s External Engagement and Corporate\nCommunications team and the Supervision team that’s represented, our Research team, Guest Services\nteam—lots of teams from the Federal Reserve kind of make this magic happen behind the scenes. Of\ncourse, our Louisville Branch office employees as well. So thank you to all of you for your amazing\nsupport in getting us to this point.\nSo it’s my pleasure now to introduce Marvin Veatch. It’s been fantastic to work with Marvin. He\nhas been such a stalwart supporter of our work at the Branch office and certainly at the Bank level. He,\nas you all know, many of you on the call, he’s the president and CEO of the Jackson County Bank. He’s\nthe ninth CEO in the bank’s 121-year history. And he’s bringing more than 29 years of banking and\nfinancial accounting experience to this role with the 19 years that he’s been with the bank. Marvin\n1\n\n\fpreviously served as senior VP, CFO and COO with the bank, so he’s got a great storied history, very\ndeep understanding of the institution that he now has leadership over. As importantly, Martin has\nserved on the St. Louis Fed’s Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council, and did so from 2018\nto 2020. Marvin is a graduate of Anderson University and currently serves as treasurer of the Jackson\nCounty Industrial Development Corp. Marvin, I’m happy to turn the program over to you, sir.\nMarvin Veatch: Great, thank you, Nikki. And good morning, everyone. I too would like to add my\nwelcome and thank you for attending this morning’s virtual meeting with St. Louis Fed President Jim\nBullard. It’s certainly an honor for Jackson County to host President Bullard this morning. We would’ve\nall liked to have had this meeting be onsite and an in-person event. However, as Nikki has mentioned,\ngiven the resurgence of COVID during the planning stages, we needed to pivot, like we’re all accustomed\nto doing, and make this a virtual gathering.\nI first had the privilege of meeting President Bullard while serving on the Community Depository\nInstitutions Advisory Council, as Nikki mentioned, from 2018 to 2020. I can tell you that I certainly\nbenefited far more from those council meetings than I contributed, but my main takeaway from those\ncouncil meetings was President Bullard’s keen interest in taking the pulse of the economy and issues\nfacing the council members’ represented geographic area. As has been mentioned, the format of this\nmorning’s discussion will be a moderated discussion between myself and President Bullard, leaving\nample time for questions and open discussion because he truly does want to hear directly from each\nand every one of you.\nJim Bullard is the president and CEO at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In that role, he is a\nparticipant on the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee, which meets regularly to set the\ndirection of U.S. monetary policy. He also oversees the Federal Reserve’s Eighth District, including\nactivities in the St. Louis headquarters and its branches in Little Rock, Arkansas; Louisville, Kentucky; and\nMemphis, Tennessee.\nA noted economist and policymaker, Bullard makes Fed transparency and dialogue a priority on\nthe international and national stage as well as on Main Street. He serves on the board of directors of\nConcordance Academy of Leadership, and he is a past board chair of the United Way U.S.A. Bullard is coeditor of the Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, a member of the editorial advisory board of the\nNational Institute Economic Review, and a member of the Central Bank Research Association’s senior\ncouncil. He’s an honorary professor of economics at Washington University in St. Louis, where he also\nsits on the advisory council of the economics department and the advisory board of the Center for\nDynamic Economics. A native of Lake Forest, Minnesota, President Bullard is also a Hoosier, receiving his\ndoctorate in economics from Indiana University in Bloomington. Welcome, Jim.\nJim Bullard: Yeah, it’s great to be here. Thanks for the introduction.\nVeatch: All right. If you’re all right, let’s just jump right in. As a bit of a backdrop for our discussion this\nmorning, I think it’s important that keeping our economy healthy is one of the most important jobs of\nthe Federal Reserve. Since 1977, the Federal Reserve System has been given a dual mandate by\nCongress, pursuing economic goals of maximizing employment and price stability. It does this by using a\nvariety of policy tools to manage financial conditions that encourage progress towards its dual mandate.\nIn other words, conducting monetary policy.\n2\n\n\fFed Chairman Jerome Powell said he expects inflation to persist well into next year. My question is, is\nthe current high inflation function in excess of fiscal monetary stimulus added over the past two years?\nOr if not, what do you attribute to those inflationary pressures? And secondarily, do you share the view\nthat the current inflation is temporary or transitory? And if so, what current conditions must change to\nbring that down?\nBullard: Yeah. It’s great to be here today, and it’s great to see everybody. And I’ll just put my emphasis\non the idea that it would be nicer if we could be in person. I always like moving around the District and\nmeeting people firsthand. I think soon we’ll be able to get back to that, but we’re not quite there yet, so\nwe had to do this via virtual interaction. But I think we can have a great meeting today, and I’m looking\nforward to everyone’s input because I really do like to hear how the anecdotes from around your area\nare matching up with all the data that we see and analyze all the time, which I would just emphasize is a\nlittle bit dated. The data is always a couple months behind or even a couple quarters behind, so the\nvalue for me is to really hear about what’s going on right now and how you’re seeing the next couple of\nmonths or couple of quarters in the economy.\nOn inflation, I think just a few numbers. The Committee likes to emphasize what we call the core\nPCE inflation rate, which is the personal consumption expenditures inflation less food and energy. So\nyou’re going to throw out the energy component in particular. And you can measure this from one year\nago. So that particular number—and there are other ways to measure inflation, but that one’s the\nfavorite of the Committee. That number is 3.6% right now, and it’s expected to tick up further, maybe\nover 4% by the end of this year.\nNow if you look back historically, so this is a smoothed measure, and one that throws out some\nstuff, which may not be that wise because those are prices people actually have to pay. But you’re\nalready doing a lot of smoothing and a lot of trimming when you look at this number, 3.6%. But that’s\nthe highest this has been in 30 years, so since the early 1990s. And I would consider that era, from let’s\nsay 1979-1980 to 1995, to be part of the Volcker era where we were trying to bring inflation down and\nkeep inflation under control. We didn’t really succeed in that until 1995. So you have to go all the way\nback to that era to see inflation at the levels that they’re at today. And I think this is a major challenge,\nboth within the Fed, for the people that analyze inflation within the Fed, for financial markets. I just\ndon’t think people are used to the idea that we’re going to have this much inflation and we’re probably\ngoing to have to take action to combat this inflation and keep it under control.\nAnother thing I would emphasize here is that it’s the central bank’s responsibility to keep\ninflation low and stable, and to hit the inflation target of 2%. And when it’s not happening, it’s because\nof the central bank. It isn’t because of anything else. And some of the discussion today is veering off in\nother directions and putting blame for inflation on all kinds of other factors, but no. It’s up to the central\nbank to keep inflation near the inflation target, and to take actions that make sure that you achieve your\ninflation objective. So we made a lot of progress I think, starting in 2012 when we actually named an\ninflation target, and it was 2%. That’s an international standard. Similar to the European Central Bank\nand other central banks around the world. And for a long time, we missed it to the low side. I was\nactually on the dovish side of the Committee during that era saying we should do more to try to hit our\ninflation target and maintain credibility. But now, just in the last nine months or so, we’ve gone to the\nhigh side and we’re at risk now of allowing inflation to drift even higher during 2022. I’m not saying\nthat’s my baseline case, but that could happen. We’re vulnerable to further shocks or further surprises\n3\n\n\fon inflation. And if that happens, I think we’ll have to take more action in order to keep inflation under\ncontrol.\nSo this is why I’ve been advocating that we tack in a hawkish direction in the meetings ahead.\nWe’ve got a very easy monetary policy. We’re buying lots of bonds and mortgage-backed securities. And\nwe’ve got the policy rate near zero. So this is really an all-out response to the pandemic. I think that was\nappropriate in March and April of 2020, but since then, the economy has boomed since really the third\nquarter of 2020 and all the way up to the present time. It has totally surprised to the upside, to the point\nwhere real GDP or national income is actually above the pre-pandemic level. So in that sense, the\neconomy’s completely recovered from the pandemic, and the pandemic isn’t even over yet, as this\nmeeting has illustrated and we can’t meet in person yet. So I think that’s a tribute to the ingenuity of\nAmerican businesses that they’ve been able to take on this new challenge, think about how to provide\ntheir goods and services even though they’re in a different environment than they would have\nanticipated, more automation, different types of products. Some businesses have been hit too hard and\nthey haven’t been able to survive, but many have been able to do very well during this period.\nSo I just wanted to give those as some baseline comments on where I think we are with\ninflation, but I’ll quit rambling on so that you can ask more questions.\nVeatch: No, you’re fine. That kind of leads me into my next question here. We talked about kind of the\nelevated level of inflation, but we’ve all heard the supply chain issues that many are facing and most are\nconsidering that to be very, very frustrating. What direct impact do you believe that the supply chain\nissues are having on the economy and the inflation increase that you just spoke about?\nBullard: Yeah. Those are getting a lot of attention and they’re very tangible and very real. One thing\nabout the pandemic is that it has upset global supply chains, and the pandemic is affecting different\nparts of the world at different rates. And so one day one part of the world might be more affected, and\nanother day another part of the world might be more affected. And that’s showing up in disruptions in\nsupply chains that were not anticipated. And of course, if you have restrictions to supply, you’re going to\nsee higher prices.\nI would caution people though that that can’t be the entire story here. If you take your supply\nand demand diagram from econ 101 and you shift the supply curve to the left, yes, the price level will go\nup and the quantity will go down, but that isn’t totally what’s happened here because, as I just said, real\nGDP is actually higher than it was before the pandemic. So I think the demand curve has also shifted to\nthe right, so at least half the inflation is due to demand factors, even though some of it’s due to supply\nfactors.\nSo this is sounding a lot like the 1970s where you did have supply shocks. You had a lot of\npeople arguing that it wasn’t up to the central bank to control inflation, but it is up to the central bank\nto control inflation.\nVeatch: Speaking of the supply chain issues, do you have any idea on what needs to be done direct by\nthat, or when those supply chains will be reopened in any measure?\nBullard: Most businesses seem to think that this is going to persist through 2022 and even into 2023.\nThe pandemic itself is going to have this long tail I think, despite the arrival of vaccines. I guess what\n4\n\n\fwe’ve learned is that those don’t penetrate across the entire population and certainly not across the\nentire world population. Different countries have different strategies about how to handle the\npandemic, and have maybe been slower to vaccinate and the disease itself can morph and has to some\nextent. So I think for those reasons, you probably shouldn’t expect a sudden resolution of supply chain\nissues. But I also think that companies do adapt, and over these kinds of time scales. They can’t adapt\nover 90 days maybe, but over a year or 18 months, then they can start to think about, well, I’m going to\nfind some way around this log jam and find some other way to get the inputs that I need to produce my\nproduct. So I think a lot of that is happening. And I think also business school 101 is coming back into\nplay here, which I always thought was diversify your supply chain so you don’t get into these problems\nand don’t lock into a particular supply arrangement, because you can really get burned if it gets\ndisrupted.\nVeatch: Finding workers continues to be an issue, not only here in Jackson County, but across the state\nand the entire U.S. Jackson County’s unemployment rate at the end of September was 2.9%. That\ncompares to Indiana’s rate of 3.5% and the U.S. rate of 4.6%. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics,\nin the two months ending October 2021, the U.S. labor participation rate ranged between a low of\n61.4% and a high of 61.7%. Can you provide any thoughts or insight as to why you believe this\nparticipation rate remains depressed?\nBullard: Yeah. So I’ll tell you my story about it, but I’d like to hear input from all of you as well. I think\nthis is one of the hottest labor markets we’ve seen in the post-World War II era. And I would cite three\nmeasures on this. One is the unemployment rate itself, 4.6% right now. But the key thing about that is\nit’s been declining at about two-tenths per month since vaccines came on the scene last December. And\nif it continues to decline at two-tenths per month, we’ll be below 4% unemployment in the U.S. in the\nfirst quarter of 2022. So for those of you that track these kinds of numbers, anything below 4% is a\nfantastic labor market in the U.S., and even 4.6% would have been considered well below full\nemployment at one point by the Open Market Committee. So it’s low and it’s coming lower, so that’s\none argument.\nAnother argument is that the number of job openings compared to the number of unemployed\nworkers is—if you take the unemployment-to-vacancies ratio, that’s at an all-time low, even lower than\nit was in 2018-2019 before the pandemic, lower than it was in 2006-2007 before the financial crisis, and\nlower than it was even in the late 1990s, which was one of the very best job markets that we’ve ever\nseen. So I think there’s just no question that the number of people seeking work is much, much less than\nthe number of job openings that businesses are posting. And so it’s very clear that there’s a scramble for\nlabor, and I’d like to hear more about this here. Even to the point where you see some businesses\nunable to reopen from the pandemic because they just can’t find any workers, or they have to open for\njust limited hours, maybe four hours is all they can do to stay open. So you really have a scramble here.\nYou’re seeing this in wages. You’re seeing this in banners on businesses as you’re driving down the\nhighway, “We’re hiring. Signing bonus. You can start tomorrow. You can start today. You can start\nbefore lunch.” So it’s just a very hot labor market on that dimension.\nAnd then the other thing I would cite here is that we’ve wanted to have a broad and inclusive\nmeasure of labor market performance so that we’re not overly focused on just one number. And you\ncan do that. There are lots of labor market indicators, anywhere from 15 to 25, depending on how you\nwant to count it. And so what you can do is put all those indicators together in an index, call that the\nlabor market conditions index. And the Kansas City Fed has done this; they have a labor market\n5\n\n\fconditions index. And that’s a way of getting at this issue of broad and diverse measures of labor market\nperformance. So that index is back at the pre-pandemic level, and has been shooting up rapidly in recent\nmonths. So I think there again, all indications are that this is a very strong labor market.\nNow on the labor force participation, I think there’s been overemphasis on this issue. It’s very\nclear that as the pandemic came on, it changed behavior in certain ways, in two key ways. One is the\namount of retirements that occurred. Now, we think that might be as high as three million early\nretirements. You can measure it in different ways. You might get somewhat different numbers, but it’s\nseveral million. And I think it makes perfect sense that when the pandemic came along, people that\nwere near retirement decided to go ahead and retire because their nest eggs looked pretty good,\nequities are near or at an all-time high, house prices have gone up dramatically, so if they owned a\nhouse, then they were in good shape on that dimension. And the COVID is more risky for elderly people;\n80% of the deaths have occurred in people over 65. So all those factors would push a person that’s on\nthe margin toward the retirement decision. So I think that was made. And I wouldn’t begrudge any of\nthem. I hope they have a good retirement. But I wouldn’t expect them to come back into the labor force\nin this situation. The pandemic isn’t even over.\nAnd the other factor that has driven labor force participation down is child care. There again\nyou’ve got a situation where households looked at the pandemic. They looked at schools not being in\nperson, and if they’re on the margin they decided that, “Hey, maybe this is a good time for one of the\nadults in the house to stay home.” And child care couldn’t be more personal interaction and a lot of high\nphysical contact, which isn’t good in this era. So there again, you’ve got probably more than a million\ndropping out of the labor force because of that. Those factors will dissipate as we go forward over the\nnext five to ten years and you’ll get back to something more normal, but I wouldn’t expect them to\ndissipate in the near term here while we’ve got our inflation pressure in the economy. So I wouldn’t wait\nfor that. And I wouldn’t begrudge any of these people for making these decisions. These sound like\nsensible decisions given the fact that you’re in the middle of a pandemic.\nSo I think labor force participation is going to be depressed for a while. But I think nevertheless,\nit’s a very hot labor market with increases in labor compensation.\nVeatch: You talked about housing and that’s a great segue into kind of our next topic here. Housing\ncontinues to be an issue facing not only our region, state and country. In Indiana, on a 12-month rolling\naverage, the housing inventory is down 42% while average prices have increased 13%. In Jackson\nCounty, there are currently 59 homes on the market. And over the last year, there’s an approximate 1.3\nmonth inventory supply. So as you know, that’s a very, very low inventory supply number there.\nSo with that, do you believe that there’s any kind of a housing bubble that’s being created with\nthe increasing and escalating prices?\nBullard: Yeah. I’ve been concerned about this. I do think that the Fed got into a lot of trouble in the mid2000s by neglecting a housing bubble, and not moving rapidly enough to try to contain it. I think housing\nprices getting out of control turned out to be much more important than, let’s say, an individual stock or\neven the dot-com bubble because it’s a leveraged purchase by most households, and the decline in\nhouse prices during the earlier crisis from 2007 to 2009 caused tremendous pain and rippled throughout\nthe economy and throughout the global economy. So I do worry about the idea that we might be\nfeeding into an incipient housing bubble, especially with our purchase of mortgage-backed securities,\n6\n\n\fwhich is still going on right now. This was something that we did put in place in March and April of 2020.\nAt least my thinking at the time was that we were going into this pandemic. You didn’t know what was\ngoing to happen. It could have been a Great Depression scenario, and probably the housing market\nwould be hard hit. But instead what happened was that the housing market boomed during the\npandemic as people reassessed where they could live and where they wanted to live. And combine that\nwith input supply problems, which we’ve already talked about for being able to build houses or add to\nthe stock.\nSo I am concerned about this. I think that’s a good reason to end asset purchases even\nsomewhat sooner than what the Committee has already decided to do. We have a tapering program\nthat’s supposed to end in June. I’d want to think carefully about speeding that up. I don’t think there’s\nany reason to be doing these asset purchases at this point. It’s not really helping us and it might be\nfeeding into a bubble situation, which we may regret later.\nVeatch: Going back to some of the workforce related issues, we’re also finding kind of lack of workers\nwith experience in the trades to even build the houses that are needed. Our local Seymour High School\nhas what’s called Al Manufacturing Program, which focuses on training high schools in the\nmanufacturing sector, and this was an opportunity that I had to share with Nikki and she toured this\nwith me a couple years ago. But since that time, the high school’s also restarted building a trades\nprogram and is also developing an agriculture related curriculum knowing that college may not be for all\nkids.\nSo what are you finding or seeing along these lines? Do you see any kind of a transition in that\nwhole education aspect?\nBullard: I mean, I applaud that kind of program, and I’ve toured some myself around the District in other\nmunicipalities and counties. I think it’s a great idea. I do think it’s right that you have to think at a\nsomewhat earlier age about what’s going to be likely for where different people want to go with their\nwork life, and picking up skills, and being able to do important work, I would say, but maybe not things\nthat require the college degree is appealing to a certain segment, and I think that’s great. And they can\ndo pretty well in those kinds of fields. So I think it’s a great idea. Sometimes I’d point to the German\nmodel. Germany is a country that made labor market reforms. For a long time they had an\nunemployment around 10%, and they had youth unemployment extremely high. Much higher than 10%.\nAnd then they went to this labor market reform, and part of it was a lot of apprenticeship programs at\nwhat we would call the high school level, and that was very successful. It cut the youth unemployment\nrate in half and reduced the overall unemployment rate probably in half. And so I have always thought\nthat Germany had the right model here about how to ease that transition for people, let’s say between\n15 and 20 years old, that when they’re thinking about their future give them some options and some\ntraining so they can do some things other than, if they want, other than necessarily going and getting\nthe college degree.\nVeatch: Great. Approximately two weeks ago, President Biden nominated Saule Omarova, a Cornell\nUniversity law professor, to serve as the next comptroller of the currency. An outspoken critic of the\nbanking system, she’s forwarded an idea of restructuring the Federal Reserve and downsizing the\ninfluence of and roles of banks. She’s argued that by shifting deposit accounts from banks to the Fed, it\nwould make the financial system less complex, more stable and more efficient in serving the long-term\nneeds of the American people. Many have weighed in to say this position is bad for the country’s\n7\n\n\ffinancial position. I’m interested in your thoughts and insights on this idea that’s been put forward, and\nwhether or not you believe it has any merit.\nBullard: Yeah. Well, I wouldn’t comment on any pending nominees, and I don’t know the details around\nthis proposal, but I can talk in general terms about some of the ways I see financial intermediation\nevolving in the country.\nI would say a couple things. One to keep in mind is that a lot of the intermediation actually does\nnot go through banks. So Congress generally is overly enamored, I would say, with the banking sector,\nand they don’t pay enough attention to the non-bank financial sector. You’ve got 80% of what’s going\non is this non-bank financial, and you’ve got a whole host of people in Silicon Valley and elsewhere\naround the country that are thinking of ways to provide financial services without calling themselves\nbanks. This is regulatory arbitrage 101, and that’s mainly what’s going on in this country. So to come in\nand do something—lay on more regulations around the banks or something, that probably isn’t going to\nbe what’s going to stabilize the financial sector, and it’s not going to be what prevents the next financial\ncrisis. The next financial crisis is almost certainly going to come from the unregulated part of financial\nintermediation services.\nI would say another thing in this kind of idea of Fed accounts is Japan had a postal kind of\nbanking system. So you could—for years I think in the post-war era, and maybe up until today, you could\nhave an account in the Japanese postal system. As far as I know, I’ve never seen anything that that really\nmade very much difference one way or the other. People could do it if they wanted to, but they could\ndeposit elsewhere if they wanted to. I mean, I just don’t see it as a silver bullet for anything. And I think\none thing I’d like to see is an argument that that kind of system made some big difference in how the\neconomy operated. I don’t think that it did.\nAlso you’ve got credit unions, which are a favorite subject of bankers. So if the concern is that\npeople are putting their deposits in profit-making entities, and these entities are turning around and\nallocating capital according to marketing signals, well, you’ve also got a not-for-profit sector, the credit\nunion sector, which has almost as many institutions and lots of assets. So I would say that households\nhave an option if that’s the concern. I’ve often wondered why we don’t put those two parts of the\ndeposit taking institution sector on a level playing field, but that isn’t something Congress has wanted to\ndo.\nI was going to say about central bank digital currency. So this is getting wrapped up in the\ncentral bank digital currency debate, and that is a debate about whether a virtual coin should be issued\nby the Fed. And that’s a little bit different from just the idea of having deposit accounts at the Fed. I\ndon’t think that the ideas around central bank digital currency are addressing the phenomenon of\nprivately issued currency effectively. I’m sure people are interested in this, so let me just talk about it for\na little bit.\nThe privately issued currency, which is what a cryptocurrency is, that was for a long time not\nlegal in the U.S., but in the last part of the last century it became okay to do that. So now you’ve got\nvirtual currency circulating around. I think you might wonder if they’re perfect substitutes for dollars,\nthen why are the virtual currencies being used? But most of that is also regulatory arbitrage of various\nkinds. They’re trying to use the cryptocurrency for transactions that would be hard to make if you just\ndid them through banks and through the normal payment system. I don’t think cryptocurrencies have\n8\n\n\fany advantages as far as speed or anything like that. You can trade dollars around the world instantly. So\nit has to do with regulatory arbitrage and getting outside of the regulations inside the banking system\nand inside the payment system.\nSo the idea of a central bank digital currency would be that it’s going to compete with the\ncryptocurrency, but it’s not because it’s not going to be regulatory arbitrage if we issue it, because we’re\ngoing to put all the rules around it that would be around the normal payment system. So I think people\nare a little confused on this issue, and I think cryptocurrency has to face up to the types of transactions\nthat are being made on this system. I think there’s probably more regulation coming on cryptocurrency\nas we go forward. Cryptocurrency has another problem which is free entry. So free entry means\nanybody can issue one of these, and that is certainly happening. You’re seeing thousands actually have\nbeen issued, and more every day, and it’s inexplicable how they trade against one another. So a lot\ngoing on in this space, but I just wanted to get to some of those issues.\nVeatch: I appreciate your insight on that. And I think speaking for most, if not all bankers across the\ncountry, we certainly would welcome the idea of a level playing field with our credit union friends there.\nSo appreciate that.\nRecently this past Monday, President Biden signed into law a one trillion dollar infrastructure\nbill. Any insight on what you believe the current and/or future impact this bill might have on some of the\nthings we’ve already talked about, inflation, employment, supply chain issues and the like?\nBullard: Yeah. This was a hard infrastructure bill, and I am one that thinks Congress should be probably\nevery year—they don’t behave like this, but every year you should have an infrastructure bill that’s kind\nof the same way you’d have an ag bill or something. And then you should wrestle with the public\ninfrastructure in the economy, and you should be thinking about—all the time I think—where do we\nneed to update? Where do we need to build out for the future? And those decisions, as we all know, are\nfraught. It’s hard to make those decisions. Some parts of the country benefit and other parts of the\ncountry get less benefit. But nevertheless, it’s up to the Congress, in my view, to take care of the\nphysical capital stock. If you let it depreciate too much, that hurts the whole economy. If you build it up,\nit can be good, but you also have this problem of wasteful spending. You can build highways and bridges\nthat don’t need it, and that comes out of the political process and the jockeying around this kind of bill. I\ndon’t know how much of that is going on here, but one thing that would be helpful is to track very\ncarefully how this actually gets spent and look at what actually happens with the dollars as they go out\nthe door.\nBut we did get bipartisan support for this in the Senate and some in the House, and I think that\nreflects the idea that a lot of things probably do need to be done nationally on infrastructure. Whether\nthis would influence the longer-run growth rate of the economy, I would say, well, yes, compared to\ndoing nothing. If you’re going to let your public infrastructure crumble, that’s going to hurt the\neconomy. But it should be viewed more as this is the normal makeup for the depreciation of physical\ncapital stock, and you should be doing a little bit of this all the time so that you don’t get too far behind\nand your infrastructure totally crumbles. I think bridges that need repair is one of the examples that’s\noften given, and this bill only does actually a little bit of the total amount of bridge repair that we\nprobably should be doing. So I’d advocate that you had a bill like this sort of every year, and you had a\nlist of projects, and you’re thinking, “Okay, well, we’ll do some of these this year, and we’ll do some of\nthese next year, and some of these the year after that.” But the politics of it really gets very difficult.\n9\n\n\fVeatch: We’ve covered a lot of ground this morning, and I’ve got really one last question before I turn it\nback over to Nikki and we open it up for questions and discussion from our guests. As you may recall, as\nI reported at our CDIAC meetings, I believe our county and our region has a lot of great things going for\nit. From an economic development perspective, according to Jim Plump, our executive director of\nJackson County Industrial Development Corporation, our 2021 promised investment, and this was\nthrough September, is about 105.5 million dollars. That’s the fifth highest total in history and just the\nsecond time since 2014 that more than 100 million was invested. We’re also confident at this point that\nanother 92 million will hit the books for 2022. And as you know, we’ve not even yet closed the books for\n2021. Additionally, recent U.S. Census Bureau data reported that Jackson County ranks as the fastest\ngrowing Indiana rural county and the seventh fastest overall in Indiana. Jackson County also ranks\nseventh out of 92 counties with a growth rate of 9.6% over the past decade. Further, the city of Seymour\nregistered a 23.2% population increase. And we also have some other great assets in our community.\nOur local hospital and health care system is a tremendous asset and has received numerous regional,\nstate and even national awards for their quality of care.\nWhile I think it would be certainly unfair for us to compare ourselves to other metro areas like a\nSt. Louis, a Louisville or a Memphis, given this limited overview of our county and there are\napproximately 44,000 population with nearly half of those living in Seymour, can you give a sense of\nhow you would say that we kind of stack up to those other communities you’ve visited in the Eighth\nDistrict?\nBullard: Yeah. I think those statistics speak to the quality of life I think in the Midwest. You know, I\nalways say the Midwest is America’s best kept secret. I actually think it’s one of the wealthiest regions in\nthe country if you are willing to account for cost of living. And I’ve tried to emphasize in some of my\ntalks, cost of living. And I think because the costs are so high in some of the glam cities, it really makes it\nkind of a miserable lifestyle to be living in a place where even with a pretty good job or two jobs, the\nhousehold really has a struggle to live a good lifestyle. So I think that the pandemic may be a turning\npoint where people do a better job of recognizing that they could live in various parts of the country,\nthey could have a higher quality of life. You don’t have to pile into the big city in order to have a good\nlifestyle. So we’ll see the extent to which that happens, but I would think that that’s going to be\npotentially a major trend over the next ten years. And you’re certainly seeing a lot of that where firms\nare thinking about whether they could hire workers at somewhat higher wages, but not as high as they\nwould have to pay in the big city. And certainly tech companies and others are talking about that and\nmoving in that direction. So I think this is really a major technological trend that will influence the\neconomy for some time to come.\nThe unemployment rate for the District, which we measure by taking the MSAs in the District\nand looking at their unemployment rates and weighting that, it’s 4%. So in this part of the country,\nyou’re talking about unemployment heading into the 3% range very soon. Probably with the next jobs\nreport. And if you look at where unemployment is still high, it’s California, New York and some of the\neast coast, and maybe a few other places. But I think that the pandemic has influenced especially very\nlarge cities differently because of the public transportation issue and the difficulties of commuting and\npeople kind of reassessing whether they really want to or need to be commuting as much as they are. In\na smaller place you don’t really have that issue. It goes away and you get sort of better housing per\ndollar. So I think this is really a place where we’re going to be reassessing as we go forward and come\nout of the pandemic here.\n10\n\n\fVeatch: All right. Great. Well Jim, thank you so much for taking time out of your schedule this morning.\nIt’s been certainly a pleasure. And I’m hopeful that when we get this pandemic in our rearview mirror\nthat you will join us in person here in Seymour in Jackson County. At this point, I’ll turn the meeting back\nover to Nikki. Nikki?\nLanier: Marvin, thank you. Thank you so much. That was masterfully moderated. I very much appreciate\nthat. Jim, thank you for your remarks and your perspectives. I’d love to open up the floor. I think we are\nan intimate enough of a group to maybe manage this organically over the next 15 minutes or so. So if\nyou have a question, a comment or a reaction, if you would not mind unmuting and of course introduce\nyourself briefly, and then if you could share your thought or your question with Jim. Please do so now\nwhoever would like to go first.\nQuestion from the audience: We’re in some of the major supply chains in the automotive industry, and\none of the challenges that we’re having is convincing our end customers that these increases are real\nand how long they’re going to last. And I thank you very much for the graphs you have on the St. Louis\nFed website. I’ve been using them a lot in these types of presentations.\nI was looking if you could give us some insight into what are some of the best ways to look at the\nfuture predictors so we can help them understand that. And if you were in my position, are there some\nspecific graphs or data you would use to help convince them of this problem? They all recognize it, but\nthey don’t really want to recognize it when it comes to increasing costs for us as a producer.\nBullard: Well, yeah. I guess you’ll have to be forceful with them. But I’m not probably a great negotiator,\nso I’m not sure that I can offer too much insight on this. I do think though that anecdotally we’re\ncertainly getting the idea that certain types of supply chain problems are going to persist for a long time.\nI would just give a big macro picture out of this, which is that I think that Asia early in the pandemic\nseemed to be addressing the pandemic better than North America and better than Europe. And of\ncourse a lot of these supply chain issues are tied toward factories and manufacturers in Asia.\nHowever, I think that as the pandemic went on, it became clearer that actually North America\nand Europe probably had the better strategy. More oriented toward vaccines, more oriented toward\nquick vaccination. And then you had the delta variant come along, which made kind of the COVID zero\nstrategy not be that effective anymore. And so in a sense, the Asian economies were sitting ducks when\ndelta came along; they weren’t highly vaccinated and you had this very virulent type of COVID that was\nspreading very rapidly. So I think that’s one reason why I think that these supply chain problems are not\nclearing up as readily as you would think. Now, the world’s a big place. You’ve got billions and billions of\npeople. You shouldn’t expect everyone to get vaccinated, and it’s certainly not going to happen that\nway. So how this is going to play out, I don’t know. But I think that’s one sort of high-level argument that\nyou can make, that this is going to persist for quite a while.\nAlso, these supply chains are too specialized, I would say. That’s kind of the lesson. I mentioned\nthis earlier. The drive toward cost cutting over the last 25 years, just fierce, I would say, and you just go\nto the very lowest cost producer, and you’ve got the one factory somewhere that’s producing\nsomething, and you’re going to put all of your marbles in that basket, and this shows that that isn’t a\ngood strategy. It’s not resilient enough when something unexpected happens. And you should have\nmore diversity in your supply chain. Like I say, some of that’s happening, but it’s not that easy to just\nbuild a plant. “Oh, all of a sudden I’m going to build two new plants in different parts of the world so\n11\n\n\fthat I’m more diversified.” That’s not that easy to do. But it will happen, but it’s going to take quite a\nwhile. So I know that’s not a great answer for your situation, but those are some of my thoughts.\nQuestion from the audience: If I understand correctly, you talked about unemployment is moving\ndown, 4% in the next report. When you break that down race and gender, what does that look like?\nBullard: The gender will look similar, but the race, as we all know, I think will be, have a gap. Black\nunemployment tends to be higher. I would very much like to see that gap come down to zero. What I\nwould suggest on that is that that should be an assignment given to the labor secretary where the Labor\nDepartment is responsible for getting these gaps down to zero. I think it could be done with some\nmanagement attention, frankly, on it. And it seems to me like that would be a great focus. We could get\na lot better outcomes for Black America, but also good outcomes for the whole economy if we could get\nthese unemployment rates to sort of match up across racial and ethnic groups.\nQuestion from the audience: I’m blessed to have nine grandchildren and always concerned about the\nlevel of our national debt. Can you discuss the influence of the national debt, both recorded and off\nbalance sheet on the behind the curtains discussions about monetary policy?\nBullard: Yeah. I think it’s clear that the pandemic led to a lot of deficit spending. On that, I would say\nthat the kind of spending done in March, April 2020—if there was ever a time when you were going to\ntake on a lot of debt to try to get through a crisis, it seems like that was the time to do it. By itself, that\nprobably put 10 percentage points on the debt-to-GDP ratio. I will say Congress has been mildly more\ndisciplined, I guess, than I was expecting in later legislation. They’ve insisted on trying to pay for some of\nthe things that they want to spend money on. I think that’s good. There are always gimmicks and tricks\naround that, which I think is not good and I wish we could get that out of our political process. But can\nthe country carry a 100% or 110% debt-to-GDP ratio? I think that we can at low interest rates, and\ncertainly we’ve had low interest rates for quite a while.\nI think the way to maintain low interest rates is to maintain discipline on inflation and make sure\nthat you’re keeping inflation low and stable so that you don’t get the high nominal interest rates that\nare associated with the high inflation. So when we had problems in the 1970s, that’s what happened is\nthat you had high inflation and high nominal interest rates, and it made the debt service component of\nthe federal debt skyrocket and create a lot of problems. So hopefully we don’t get into that situation.\nBut to avoid that situation, the Fed has to remain vigilant on inflation, and keep inflation low and stable.\nLanier: Probably have time for one more question.\nQuestion from the audience: You worked with Janet Yellen for a number of years as Fed Chair and\ncolleague, and now she’s Treasury Secretary. Do you find significant differences in her positions as Fed\nChair and where she is now as Secretary of the Treasury? And that may be too political for you to\nanswer, but I’ll leave that for you to decide.\nBullard: I always really enjoyed working with Janet. We don’t always agree on everything, but I’ve\nalways found her to be a very good economist. She has a lot of middle-of-the-road, I would say, ideas\nabout how to handle certain issues. I think it’s put a lot of pressure on her I think to ask her to step in\nafter being Fed Chair as Treasury Secretary, but she was willing to do it, so I think we should salute her\nfor her service to the country. I think she’s influential inside the Biden administration. She’s a person\n12\n\n\fthat has the ear, I’d say, on both sides of the Democratic party, and that makes her a pivotal person for\nhow the nation will approach key issues. So I’ve always enjoyed working with her.\nQuestion from the audience: Thank you. That sounds very politically correct, and I accept that at face\nvalue. Maybe a follow up. Your position on the idea of the IRS having access to the extent that’s being\nproposed to everyday consumer and business checking account information.\nBullard: Yeah. I’ve been concerned about this issue, and it’s a little unclear exactly what the proposal is.\nI have talked to members of the Congress from the Eighth District. They do seem to be concerned about\nit. I don’t think you’d want to be tracking every transaction of every account. And it seems like an\nadministrative burden and probably unnecessary for what’s going to be accomplished. I’m not even sure\nyou could handle that much data with our current system. So I think we probably need something. The\nspirit of it I think is to get better enforcement for the IRS, but there must be better ways to do it than to\ntry to keep track of all these transactions over millions and millions of people.\nLanier: Well thank you so much, Jim. And we are right at 9:30. That’s absolutely incredible. We finished\nright on time. I just want to express my appreciation again on behalf of the Branch and our Bank, St.\nLouis Federal Reserve, for your very gracious, attentive, focused engagement today. Starting out your\nmorning with us is quite a treat, and we very much appreciate that. Thank you, Jim. Thank you, Marvin.\nThank you everyone on the Federal Reserve team who made today possible. And we definitely look\nforward to an opportunity to get Jim physically in Seymour. I have been, and thoroughly enjoyed my\ntime there, and I’m sure he will too. You all have a great rest of your morning, and we will talk soon\nagain I’m sure.\n\n13\n\n\f",
