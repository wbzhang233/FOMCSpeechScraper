A participant on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee, Bullard focused his presentation on modernizing monetary policy rules.\nAbout 150 business and community leaders, as well as economists, attended the event, held\non the campus of the University of Memphis.\nDuring his talk, Bullard discussed modernizing a popular monetary policy rule, a version of\nthe Taylor rule, whose construction was based on U.S. data from the 1980s and 1990s. Since\nthen, he noted, three important macroeconomic developments have altered key elements of\npolicy rule construction.

Bullard also discussed a handful of topics related\nto technology, including “�ntech,” arti�cial intelligence and innovation hubs. “The\nchanging landscape of �nancial services is an important reason for this conference,” he\nsaid.\nFull text of remarks:\nWelcoming Remarks1\nJames Bullard\nPresident and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nSixth Annual Community Banking in the 21st Century Research and Policy Conference\nFederal Reserve System, Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) and Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corp. (FDIC)\nSt. Louis, Mo. Oct. 3, 2018\nI am pleased to welcome everyone to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for the sixth\nannual community banking research and policy conference.\nI am also pleased to welcome the FDIC as an of�cial conference sponsor, starting this year.\nThe Federal Reserve and the FDIC work closely with the state banking regulatory\nauthorities to supervise our nation’s state-chartered banks—the vast majority of which are\ncommunity banks. Due to this shared supervisory role, the Fed, CSBS and FDIC have mutual\n\n\finterests in understanding the opportunities and challenges facing community banks and\nin promoting quality academic research that helps inform policy decisions that affect the\nindustry.\nToday, we are looking at a somewhat different set of opportunities and challenges than\nwhen this conference was �rst launched in 2013. Regulatory burden and the potential\nimpacts of the Dodd-Frank Act dominated the discussion during the �rst few years of the\nconference. Although concerns over regulatory burden are still on the minds of community\nbankers, attention is shifting to the opportunities and challenges posed by technology.\nOn some level, these concerns aren’t new: Banks have always had to keep current on the\nlatest technological innovations impacting their industry. But the pace of change and\ngrowing cyber threat environment have accelerated the impact as the number of new\n�nancial technology �rms seems to be increasing rapidly.\nAs new �nancial technology offerings entered the marketplace, we heard regular assertions\nthat �ntechs would “disrupt” the �nancial services industry—or perhaps even replace it.\nBold statements were frequent: Fintech �rms are going to “upend relationship lending,”\nthey will “provide unprecedented credit access to the underserved,” �ntech will “make\nbranch banking obsolete.”\nTo date, those assertions have not been ful�lled. Indeed, we have seen signi�cant\ncooperation between �ntech �rms and �nancial institutions because of their mutual\ninterests, and importantly, because �ntech �rms have largely relied on banks to clear and\nsettle their transactions. We are aware of many successful and responsible partnerships.\nFor the most part, these partnerships work well, allowing banks to offer products and\nservices that may have been out of reach previously, or engage new customers and new\nmarkets that had previously been closed to them. I understand we will close this year’s\nconference with a panel that speci�cally explores the future of community banking through\nthe lens of those who have engaged in these types of partnerships.\nThese partnerships, of course, are not without risk. Increasingly, we are hearing stories of\n�ntech companies interested in their own �nancial services charters—special purpose\ncharters, industrial loan company charters or traditional bank charters. While traditional\nbank charters provide a level playing �eld in terms of the regulatory and supervisory\nprocess, the options and opportunities with other forms of charters are yet unknown.\nFor those banks partnering with �ntech �rms or using their services, there is also some\ndegree of uncertainty. I mentioned cyber risk earlier. We are very cognizant of the potential\nfor growing interconnectivity in our �nancial system. I anticipate that operational risk will\nsomeday equal or exceed credit risk for many community banks.\n\n\fWe also recognize the uncertainty of the impact of the use of arti�cial intelligence on the\nunderwriting of credit and its impact on �nancial markets during economic cycles.\nProviders of these services must be vigilant about providing fair and equal access to credit.\nThere must be mechanisms to ensure credit availability even during stressed economic\ncycles. One of the lessons learned from the �nancial crisis was that the volume of small\nbusiness loans fell substantially in larger banking organizations. This was often not due to\nliquidity or capital issues. Indeed, it is possible that automated underwriting mechanisms\nwere an important contributing factor.\nThe changing landscape of �nancial services is an important reason for this conference.\nThe impacts of automation on the �nancial services industry have been substantial in\nrecent years, and the pace of change will likely only increase. Across the country, cities are\nmaking investments in technology incubators to improve the ef�ciency of common\nbusiness processes. In the St. Louis Fed’s District, we have examples of these technology\nand innovation hubs including the Cortex and T-REX innovation communities in St. Louis\nand the Little Rock technology park in Little Rock, Ark., which are enabling innovation in\nseveral industry sectors. Perhaps their innovations will be the topic of a future conference.\nIn closing, I want to thank you all, our in-person and webcast audience for your\nparticipation in this year’s event. It is your ideas, your questioning, your debating and your\nengagement that make this conference what it is and enable it to have the impact it has had.\nI look forward to another successful conference.\nAnd now I would like to introduce our keynote speaker to begin today’s conference.\nLoretta Mester is the president and chief executive of�cer of the Federal Reserve Bank of\nCleveland, a position she has held since June 2014.\nPrior to her current position, she served as executive vice president and director of\nresearch at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.\nLoretta is originally from Baltimore, Md. She graduated from Barnard College of Columbia\nUniversity with a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics and economics. She earned M.A.\nand Ph.D. degrees in economics from Princeton University, where she was a National\nScience Foundation Fellow.\nAlthough this is her �rst time attending the conference, she had a paper that she coauthored presented here during the 2016 conference. That paper, titled “Is Bigger\nNecessarily Better in Community Banking?,” examined economies of scale among publicly\ntraded community banks. Her research on banking gives her a unique perspective on the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and brings great perspective to this year’s\nconference.\n\n\fPlease join me in welcoming Loretta to this year’s conference.\n1\n\nAny opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily re�ect those of the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\n\f",

He noted that yield curve inversion is\nbest avoided in the near term by caution in raising the fed funds rate. “Given tame U.S.\nin�ation expectations, it is unnecessary to push monetary policy normalization to such an\nextent that the yield curve inverts,” he said.\nPresentation:\n\n\fAudience Q&A:\n\nST.

Last observation: Week of July 6, 2018.\n10\n\n\fPrivately Issued Currency Enters the\nCurrency Competition\n\n11\n\n\fPrivately issued currency\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nPrivately issued currency can fit into this context of many\ncompeting currencies.\nOne of the interesting results from the literature is the\nexistence of a steady state in which both publicly and\nprivately issued currencies circulate as exchange media.\nThe key point is that, at least in an equilibrium like this, one\ntype of money need not crowd out the other. Both are\nrequired to allow all voluntary trade to occur.\nWhat is happening? It is simple: The private currency\nfacilitates exchange that would not otherwise occur.\n\n12\n\n\fAre more transactions better?\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nIn an abstract model, more transactions are a good thing.\nVoluntary exchange should be encouraged and not\ninhibited.\nIn the real world, some of these now-enabled transactions\nmay be illegal or quasi-legal.\nSome examples include illegal drug trades or simple\navoidance of other types of rules, such as Chinese capital\ncontrols.\nThis issue has been widely debated.\n\n13\n\n\fLots of Privately Issued Currency\n\n14\n\n\fFew limits on issuance\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nAnother prediction from the theory is that many private\ncurrencies would be issued.\nIn the literature, every person who wants to issue a private\ncurrency could do so and would do so as part of the\nequilibrium.\nIf we turn to the real world today, something like this\nappears to be happening.\nAccording to Investing.com’s current list, about 1,900\ncryptocurrencies have been launched.\n\n15\n\n\fNon-uniform currency then\n•\n•\n•\n\nHistorically, the profusion of privately issued currency in\nthe U.S. created an unsatisfactory system.\nIn the 1830s, 90 percent of the U.S. money supply was\nprivately issued banknotes.*\nContemporaries did not like this system. Currencies traded\nat different rates at different times and places. There were\ndiscount books in each town to keep track of how much\neach currency should be discounted. There was a call for a\n“uniform currency,” which was implemented during the\nCivil War.\n\n* See P. Temin, The Jacksonian Economy, Norton, 1969.\n16\n\n\fNon-uniform currency now\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nIs something like this happening today?\nIt certainly appears to be.\nThere are lots of privately issued cryptocurrencies, trading\nat various rates minute by minute.\nThe only reason this is not a bigger issue today is that the\ntotal volume of cryptocurrency trade is not that large in\nrelation to the entire economy.\n\n17\n\n\fThe drift toward non-uniformity\n•\n•\n•\n\n•\n\nThe current situation could be described as a drift toward a\nnon-uniform currency in the U.S.\nOne suspects that consumers and businesses will not like a\nnon-uniform currency in which many types of currency\ntrade simultaneously at a variety of prices in a local market.\nCurrencies have to be reliable and hold their value. This is\nprobably why government backing has been important\nhistorically, combined with a stable monetary policy that\npromotes stability of the currency.\nThe Venezuelan example fails the second part of this test:\nNo one is sure what future Venezuelan monetary policy\nwill be.\n18\n\n\fThe Vagaries of Monetary Policy Remain\n\n19\n\n\fThe vagaries of monetary policy\n•\n\nThe problem of how to stabilize currency value is not\nmitigated by commodity-backed money or cryptocurrency.\no Under a gold standard, the government had to name the\n\n•\n\nexchange rate between notes and gold, and governments\nsometimes altered this rate.\no With cryptocurrencies, there is a monetary policy encoded in\nthe system, perhaps a fixed volume of “coins.” But the\nsystem can also bifurcate, creating two fixed volumes of\ncoins—a process that can happen multiple times.\n\nThe core question remains: How credible are promises for\nlimits on future issuance?\n\n20\n\n\fThe credibility of future policy\n•\n•\n•\n\nOne of the main lessons of monetary theory is that the\ncredibility of future issuance policy is a key aspect to the\nvalue of a currency.\nAn important illustration of this is Thomas J. Sargent’s\nfamous paper, “The Ends of Four Big Inflations.”*\nSargent reviewed hyperinflations in four countries\nfollowing WWI and found that they all ended with credible\ncommitments to future policy.\n\n* T.J. Sargent, “The Ends of Four Big Inflations,” in Inflation: Causes and Effects, R.E. Hall, ed., University of Chicago\nPress, 1982.\n21\n\n\fThe end of hyperinflation in Austria\n\nSource: Figure 2.1 from Sargent (1982).\n22\n\n\fThe Chaos of Exchange Rates\n\n23\n\n\fThe single-currency solution\n•\n•\n\nSocieties have disliked non-uniform currency systems\nbecause the currencies trade at different values—that is,\ndifferent exchange rates.\nThis can be avoided by having a uniform currency.\no Panama is a country that does this by being dollarized.\no The country accepts the U.S. monetary policy and the\n\n•\n\nexchange rates associated with the dollar.\n\nIf this happened with a cryptocurrency, that country would\nbe accepting the monetary policy embedded in the code,\nalong with exchange rates associated with that particular\ncryptocurrency.\n24\n\n\fLocal versus global uniformity\n•\n•\n•\n\nLocally, countries have wanted a uniform currency.\nGlobally, we do not have a uniform currency. Instead we\nhave a system of competing currencies with exchange rates.\nI am arguing that the current cryptocurrency wave may be\ndriving the U.S. uniform currency system toward\nsomething more like the international non-uniform currency\nsystem.\n\n25\n\n\fThe controversial international\nmonetary order\n•\n\n•\n•\n\nGenerally speaking, the international monetary order\nremains controversial, as the currencies seem to fluctuate\nexcessively, attracting speculative trading and altering real\ncapital flows.\nGovernments can and do devalue suddenly, forcing\ninvestors to price in devaluation risk premia.\nThis could be viewed as a distraction from the real business\nat hand, which is to use the price system to judge and\nassign value to goods and services globally.\n\n26\n\n\fExcessive exchange rate volatility\n•\n•\n•\n\n•\n\nThe chart on the next slide illustrates what many consider\nto be excessive FX volatility.\nIn the chart, the change in the yen-dollar exchange rate is\nmuch more volatile than fundamentals, such as real GDP\ngrowth in the U.S. and in Japan, which is also plotted.\nThe chart is impressive because both the U.S. and Japan\nhave had relatively stable monetary policies during this\nperiod, but the exchange rate has fluctuated widely\nnevertheless.\nBottom line: The global non-uniform currency system\nfeatures volatile exchange rates. A local non-uniform\ncurrency system may have similar volatility.\n27\n\n\fThe volatility of foreign exchange\n\nSources: International Monetary Fund, Bureau of Economic Analysis and author’s calculations. Last observations: June\n2018 and 2018-Q1.\n28\n\n\fFamous arguments on FX volatility\n•\n\nHere is my take on some of the many views of FX\nvolatility:\no Hayekian: The chart shows that governments cannot be\n\ntrusted to maintain the value of their currencies.\no Friedmanian: The chart shows markets at work.\no Wallacian: The chart shows that the relative price between\ntwo intrinsically worthless objects is indeterminate.\no Mundellian: The chart shows a deadweight loss from nonuniform currency arrangements.\n\n29\n\n\fConclusion\n\n30\n\n\fConclusions\n•\n•\n•\n\nThe U.S. is drifting toward non-uniform currency trading\narrangements, a system the society has disliked historically.\nGlobally, we have an example of a non-uniform system of\ncurrencies, but these currencies trade at exchange rates that\nare often viewed as excessively volatile.\nConclusion:\no Cryptocurrencies may unwittingly be pushing in the\nwrong direction in trying to solve an important social\nproblem, which is how best to facilitate market-based\nexchange.\n\n31\n\n\fConnect With Us\nJames Bullard\n\nstlouisfed.org/from-the-president\nSTLOUISFED.ORG\n\nFederal Reserve\nEconomic Data\n(FRED)\n\nThousands of data\nseries, millions of users\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nBlogs and\nPublications\n\nNews and views\nabout the economy\nand the Fed\n\nEconomic\nEducation\nResources\n\nFor every stage\nof life\n\nCommunity\nDevelopment\n\nPromoting financial\nstability of families,\nneighborhoods\n\nECONOMY MUSEUM\n\n32\n\n\f",

Temin, The Jacksonian Economy, Norton, 1969.\n17\n\n\fNon-uniform currency now\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nIs something like this happening today?\nIt certainly appears to be.\nThere are lots of privately issued cryptocurrencies, trading\nat various rates minute by minute.\nThe only reason this is not a bigger issue today is that the\ntotal volume of cryptocurrency trade is not that large in\nrelation to the entire economy.\n\n18\n\n\fThe drift toward non-uniformity\n•\n•\n•\n\n•\n\nThe current situation could be described as a drift toward a\nnon-uniform currency in the U.S.\nOne suspects that consumers and businesses will not like a\nnon-uniform currency in which many types of currency\ntrade simultaneously at a variety of prices in a local market.\nCurrencies have to be reliable and hold their value. This is\nprobably why government backing has been important\nhistorically, combined with a stable monetary policy that\npromotes stability of the currency.\nThe Venezuelan example fails the second part of this test.\n\n19\n\n\fThe Vagaries of Monetary Policy Remain\n\n20\n\n\fThe vagaries of monetary policy\n•\n\nThe problem of how to stabilize currency value is not\nmitigated by commodity-backed money or cryptocurrency.\no Under a gold standard, the government had to name the\n\n•\n\nexchange rate between notes and gold, and governments\nsometimes altered this rate.\no With cryptocurrencies, there is a monetary policy encoded in\nthe system, perhaps a fixed volume of “coins.” But the\nsystem can also bifurcate, creating two fixed volumes of\ncoins—a process that can happen multiple times.\n\nThe core question remains: How credible are promises for\nlimits on future issuance?\n\n21\n\n\fThe credibility of future policy\n•\n•\n•\n\nOne of the main lessons of monetary theory is that the\ncredibility of future issuance policy is a key aspect to the\nvalue of a currency.\nAn important illustration of this is Thomas J. Sargent’s\nfamous paper, “The Ends of Four Big Inflations.”*\nSargent reviewed hyperinflations in four countries\nfollowing WWI and found that they all ended with credible\ncommitments to future policy.\n\n* T.J. Sargent, “The Ends of Four Big Inflations,” in Inflation: Causes and Effects, R.E. Hall, ed., University of Chicago\nPress, 1982.\n22\n\n\fThe end of hyperinflation in Austria\n\nSource: Figure 2.1 from Sargent (1982).\n23\n\n\fThe Chaos of Exchange Rates\n\n24\n\n\fThe single-currency solution\n•\n•\n\nSocieties have disliked non-uniform currency systems\nbecause the currencies trade at different values—that is,\ndifferent exchange rates.\nThis can be avoided by having a uniform currency.\no Panama is a country that does this by being dollarized.\no The country accepts the U.S. monetary policy and the\n\n•\n\nexchange rates associated with the dollar.\n\nIf this happened with a cryptocurrency, that country would\nbe accepting the monetary policy embedded in the code,\nalong with exchange rates associated with that particular\ncryptocurrency.\n25\n\n\fLocal versus global uniformity\n•\n•\n•\n\nLocally, countries have wanted a uniform currency.\nGlobally, we do not have a uniform currency. Instead we\nhave a system of competing currencies with exchange rates.\nI am arguing that the current cryptocurrency wave may be\ndriving the U.S. uniform currency system toward\nsomething more like the international non-uniform currency\nsystem.\n\n26\n\n\fThe controversial international\nmonetary order\n•\n\n•\n•\n\nGenerally speaking, the international monetary order\nremains controversial, as the currencies seem to fluctuate\nexcessively, attracting speculative trading and altering real\ncapital flows.\nGovernments can and do devalue suddenly, forcing\ninvestors to price in devaluation risk premia.\nThis could be viewed as a distraction from the real business\nat hand, which is to use the price system to judge and\nassign value to goods and services globally.\n\n27\n\n\fExcessive exchange rate volatility\n•\n•\n•\n\n•\n\nThe chart on the next slide illustrates what many consider\nto be excessive FX volatility.\nIn the chart, the change in the yen-dollar exchange rate is\nmuch more volatile than fundamentals, such as real GDP\ngrowth in the U.S. and Japan, which are also plotted.\nThe chart is impressive because both the U.S. and Japan\nhave had relatively stable monetary policies during this\nperiod, but the exchange rate has fluctuated widely\nnevertheless.\nBottom line: The global non-uniform currency system\nfeatures volatile exchange rates. A local non-uniform\ncurrency system may have similar volatility.\n28\n\n\fThe volatility of foreign exchange\n\nSources: International Monetary Fund, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Cabinet Office of Japan and author’s calculations.\nLast observations: April 2018 and 2018-Q1.\n29\n\n\fFamous arguments on FX volatility\n•\n\nHere is my take on some of the many views of FX\nvolatility:\no Hayekian: The chart shows that governments cannot be\n\ntrusted to maintain the value of their currencies.\no Friedmanian: The chart shows markets at work.\no Wallacian: The chart shows that the relative price between\ntwo intrinsically worthless objects is indeterminate.\no Mundellian: The chart shows a deadweight loss from nonuniform currency arrangements.\n\n30\n\n\fConclusion\n\n31\n\n\fConclusions\n•\n•\n•\n\nThe U.S. is drifting toward non-uniform currency trading\narrangements, a system the society has disliked historically.\nGlobally, we have an example of a non-uniform system of\ncurrencies, but these currencies trade at exchange rates that\nare often viewed as excessively volatile.\nConclusion:\no Cryptocurrencies may unwittingly be pushing in the\nwrong direction in trying to solve an important social\nproblem, which is how best to facilitate market-based\nexchange.\n\n32\n\n\fConnect With Us\nJames Bullard\n\nstlouisfed.org/from-the-president\nSTLOUISFED.ORG\n\nFederal Reserve\nEconomic Data\n(FRED)\n\nThousands of data\nseries, millions of users\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA\n\nBlogs and\nPublications\n\nNews and views\nabout the economy\nand the Fed\n\nEconomic\nEducation\nResources\n\nFor every stage\nof life\n\nCommunity\nDevelopment\n\nPromoting financial\nstability of families,\nneighborhoods\n\nECONOMY MUSEUM\n\n33\n\n\f",

Second, the current level of the policy rate appears to be neutral, meaning it is\nputting neither upward nor downward pressure on inflation.

Kliesen, “Living\n\n•\n\nStandards in St. Louis and the Eighth Federal Reserve\nDistrict: Let’s Get Real,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nReview, Fourth Quarter 2017, pp. 377-94.\n\nFor more regional research at the St. Louis Fed, see\nhttps://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/regionalresearch/.\n\n4\n\n\fMotivation: Literature on\nInternational Standards of Living\n\n5\n\n\fThe cross-country literature\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nI take as a motivation the very large literature comparing\ninternational standards of living.\nThat literature tries to address the question of which\nnational economies are performing relatively well and\nwhich are performing less well for their citizens.\nThe literature tries to understand what makes some\ncountries relatively well-off in terms of material wellbeing and what makes other countries relatively poor.\nI would like to do the same for U.S. MSAs.\nThe next slide shows a chart of some recent findings from\nthe international literature.\n6\n\n\fReal per capita GDP in 2014 internationally\n\nSource: Penn World Table, version 9.0. PPPs refer to the purchasing power parity exchange rates.\n7\n\n\fStandard of living: from international\nrankings to MSA rankings\n•\n\nOne of the standards in the international literature is to use\nreal per capita income as the key metric.\no This is defined as total real income produced in the economy\n\n•\n•\n•\n\ndivided by the population.\no This is the clearest measure of “standard of living.”\n\nWe say, based on the previous chart, that the U.S. standard\nof living is relatively high and that the standard of living in\nmany other countries is lower.\nThe goal of this talk is to make the same types of\nstatements for MSAs in the U.S.\nNote that the countries with a high standard of living are\nnot necessarily the fastest-growing countries.\n8\n\n\fMSAs in the U.S.\n\n9\n\n\fMSA as the basic unit of analysis\n•\n•\n•\n\nAn MSA is an area containing a large population center and\nadjacent counties with a high degree of integration with that\ncenter, as measured by commuting patterns.\nMSAs provide the natural unit of analysis for this talk.\nA large fraction (about 90 percent) of U.S. gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) is produced in MSAs.\n\n10\n\n\fPopulation among all MSAs\n•\n•\n•\n\nI will consider 381 MSAs.*\nIn 2015, about 86 percent of the U.S. population lived in\nMSAs.\nSome basic statistics:\no The smallest was Carson City, Nev., with a population of 54K.\no The largest was New York, with a population of 20M.\no The median population was 238K.\n\no The average population was 721K.\n\no The fact that the average is significantly larger than the median\n\nmeans that the large MSAs are very large and skew the size\ndistribution.\n\n* Because\n\nof data availability, I will not include Enid, Okla., which was classified as an MSA in 2015.\n11\n\n\fPopulation among large MSAs\n•\n•\n•\n\nI will also consider the subset of large MSAs, defined as\nhaving a population of at least 1M.\nIn 2015, about 56 percent of the U.S. population lived in\nthe 53 large MSAs.\nSome basic statistics for large MSAs:\no The smallest was Tucson, Ariz., with a population of 1M.\no The largest was New York, with a population of 20M.\no The median population was 2.3M.\n\no The average population was 3.4M.\n\no The average is still greater than the median, but the skewness\n\nis not as pronounced as for the entire set of MSAs.\n\n12\n\n\fMSAs in the U.S.\n\nSource: Census Bureau.

Bullard, “Living Standards across U.S. Metropolitan Statistical Areas.” Remarks delivered at the Bi-State\nDevelopment 2017 Annual Meeting, St. Louis, Mo., Oct. 6, 2017.\n3\n\n\fFor more details\n•\n\nI will be referring to St. Louis Fed research that was\nconducted by my Bank colleagues:\no C.C. Coughlin, C. Gascon and K.L. Kliesen, “Living\n\n•\n\nStandards in St. Louis and the Eighth Federal Reserve\nDistrict: Let’s Get Real,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nReview, Fourth Quarter 2017, pp. 377-94.\n\nFor more regional research at the St. Louis Fed, see\nhttps://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/regionalresearch/.\n\n4\n\n\fMotivation: Literature on\nInternational Standards of Living\n\n5\n\n\fThe cross-country literature\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nI take as a motivation the very large literature comparing\ninternational standards of living.\nThat literature tries to address the question of which\nnational economies are performing relatively well and\nwhich are performing less well for their citizens.\nThe literature tries to understand what makes some\ncountries relatively well-off in terms of material wellbeing and what makes other countries relatively poor.\nI would like to do the same for U.S. MSAs.\nThe next slide shows a chart of some recent findings from\nthe international literature.\n6\n\n\fReal per capita GDP in 2014 internationally\n\nSource: Penn World Table, version 9.0. PPPs refer to the purchasing power parity exchange rates.\n7\n\n\fStandard of living: from international\nrankings to MSA rankings\n•\n\nOne of the standards in the international literature is to use\nreal per capita income as the key metric.\no This is defined as total real income produced in the economy\n\n•\n•\n•\n\ndivided by the population.\no This is the clearest measure of “standard of living.”\n\nWe say, based on the previous chart, that the U.S. standard\nof living is relatively high and that the standard of living in\nmany other countries is lower.\nThe goal of this talk is to make the same types of\nstatements for MSAs in the U.S.\nNote that the countries with a high standard of living are\nnot necessarily the fastest-growing countries.\n8\n\n\fMSAs in the U.S.\n\n9\n\n\fMSA as the basic unit of analysis\n•\n•\n•\n\nAn MSA is an area containing a large population center and\nadjacent counties with a high degree of integration with that\ncenter, as measured by commuting patterns.\nMSAs provide the natural unit of analysis for this talk.\nA large fraction (about 90 percent) of U.S. gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) is produced in MSAs.\n\n10\n\n\fPopulation among all MSAs\n•\n•\n•\n\nI will consider 381 MSAs.*\nIn 2015, about 86 percent of the U.S. population lived in\nMSAs.\nSome basic statistics:\no The smallest was Carson City, Nev., with a population of 54K.\no The largest was New York, with a population of 20M.\no The median population was 238K.\n\no The average population was 721K.\n\no The fact that the average is significantly larger than the median\n\nmeans that the large MSAs are very large and skew the size\ndistribution.\n\n* Because\n\nof data availability, I will not include Enid, Okla., which was classified as an MSA in 2015.\n11\n\n\fPopulation among large MSAs\n•\n•\n•\n\nI will also consider the subset of large MSAs, defined as\nhaving a population of at least 1M.\nIn 2015, about 56 percent of the U.S. population lived in\nthe 53 large MSAs.\nSome basic statistics for large MSAs:\no The smallest was Tucson, Ariz., with a population of 1M.\no The largest was New York, with a population of 20M.\no The median population was 2.3M.\n\no The average population was 3.4M.\n\no The average is still greater than the median, but the skewness\n\nis not as pronounced as for the entire set of MSAs.\n\n12\n\n\fMSAs in the U.S.\n\nSource: Census Bureau.

Until recently, Forbes was an external member of the\nMonetary Policy Committee for the Bank of England; she served during the historic Brexit\nvote. She is now an economics professor at MIT. Previously, Forbes served in senior policy\nroles at the U.S. Treasury and on the White House Council of Economic Advisers.

Let me explain how. The ties that bind Milton\nFriedman and the St. Louis Fed go back to Rutgers University in the early 1930s. At that\ntime, Friedman studied as an undergrad with an economics professor named Homer Jones.\n\n\fJones encouraged Friedman to go into economics via graduate school at Columbia\nUniversity, and they remained friends and colleagues thereafter. Eventually, Friedman\nwould go on to fame and notoriety, as well as a Nobel Prize, at the University of Chicago.\nHomer Jones would take a different route. He would go west to St. Louis. Homer’s fame and\nnotoriety was cemented at the St. Louis Fed.\nDuring his time as research director, Homer Jones presided over the rise of rigorous\nmacroeconomic research at the Bank. He was a leader in insisting on careful theoretical\nand empirical work to back up major monetary policy decisions, a tradition that remains\nwith the Bank today. He liked macroeconomic data and worked to make data available to\nevery person who wanted access to it. That tradition also continues today via the Bank’s\nFRED and family set of databases, which now boast a user base of about 25 million\nworldwide.\nWe commemorate the legacy of Homer Jones through this lecture series. It is one of the\nBank’s signature events.\nThe �rst lecture was given in 1987, shortly after Homer Jones’ death. The lecture has\npersisted, in large part, because of the past support of many organizations and people.\nThese have included Saint Louis University, Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, the\nUniversity of Missouri at St. Louis and Washington University in St. Louis. For the past\nseveral years, the lecture series has been a joint collaboration between the St. Louis\nGateway Chapter of the National Association for Business Economics and the Federal\nReserve Bank of St. Louis.\nOwing to its prominence, the lecture series has attracted many outstanding economists and\npolicymakers. Past speakers have included Allan Meltzer, Anna Schwartz, Ben Bernanke,\nRobert E. Lucas Jr., Larry Summers and John Taylor.\nThis year’s speaker is Kristin J. Forbes.\nKristin Forbes is the Jerome and Dorothy Lemelson Professor of Management and Global\nEconomics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management. Her\ndistinguished career includes senior policy roles at the U.S. Treasury and the White House\nCouncil of Economic Advisers, as well as a long list of publications in top academic journals.\nFrom 2014 to 2017, she was an external member of the Monetary Policy Committee for the\nBank of England, a time that included the controversial decision by the U.K. to leave the\nEuropean Union, the so-called Brexit vote that has upended British and European politics\nover the last two years. Forbes has been honored as one of the top 25 economists under the\nage of 45 who are “shaping how we think about the global economy.” The World Economic\nForum has also named her a “Young Global Leader.” The Homer Jones Memorial Lecture is\none of her �rst public speeches after leaving the Bank of England.\n\n\fForbes will discuss aspects of globalization under the intriguing title, “How Have Shanghai,\nSaudi and Supply Chains Affected U.S. In�ation Dynamics?”\nPlease join me in welcoming Dr. Kristin Forbes.\n1 Any opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily re�ect those of the\n\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\n\f",

He presented a regime-switching view of the issues around the natural\nreal rate of interest, which he called r-dagger (r†) to emphasize that these estimates use an\nalternative methodology. Bullard considered three factors that can influence the natural rate\nand noted that the U.S. is currently in a regime (or state) of low productivity growth, appears to\nbe in a low-growth state for the U.S. labor force, and is in a regime of a high desire for safe\nassets (the most important of the three factors). He concluded that the natural safe real rate of\ninterest, and hence the appropriate policy rate, is relatively low and unlikely to change very\nmuch over the forecast horizon of two years.\nRelated article in Business Economics, (2018).\n\nFOLLOW US\n\nSIGN UP FOR EMAIL ALERTS\nReceive updates in your inbox as soon as new content is published on our website\nSIGN UP\nQUICK LINKS\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2018/natural-real-rate-of-interest\n\n1/2\n\n\f12/21/22, 5:38 PM\n\nR-Star: The Natural Real Rate of Interest | James Bullard | St. Louis Fed\n\nAbout Us\nLegal Information\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nCareers\nDoing Business with the Fed\nEvents\nFederal Reserve Services\nVisiting the St. Louis Fed\nFederal Banking Regulations\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2018/natural-real-rate-of-interest\n\n2/2\n\n\f",

However, recent U.S. tax code changes may spur investment.\nBullard suggested that business investment has been relatively low during the past eight years,\nbut if it returns to its average from past expansions, growth in the U.S. will improve. He also\naddressed inflation, which remained low in 2017 against a backdrop of relatively good labor\nmarket performance and a still historically low policy rate (i.e., the federal funds target rate).\nHe said that inflation expectations also remain a bit low, although they have increased recently\nand are closer to being in line with the Federal Open Market Committee’s 2 percent target.\nTurning to monetary policy, Bullard noted that “the current policy setting is closer to neutral\nthan in previous years.”\n\nFOLLOW US\n\nSIGN UP FOR EMAIL ALERTS\nReceive updates in your inbox as soon as new content is published on our website\nSIGN UP\nQUICK LINKS\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2018/us-macroeconomic-outlook\n\n1/2\n\n\f12/21/22, 5:39 PM\n\n2018 U.S. Macroeconomic Outlook | James Bullard | St. Louis Fed\n\nAbout Us\nLegal Information\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nCareers\nDoing Business with the Fed\nEvents\nFederal Reserve Services\nVisiting the St. Louis Fed\nFederal Banking Regulations\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2018/us-macroeconomic-outlook\n\n2/2\n\n\f",

        "content": "Home > Former President Jim Bullard > Speeches, Presentations and Commentary\n\nFrom the President\n\nAllan Meltzer and the Search for a Nominal Anchor\nJanuary 4, 2018\nSpeech: pdf | text (below) | Supplemental Slides (pdf)\nIn a speech in Philadelphia, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard paid tribute to the late\nAllan Meltzer, a monetary economist, economic historian and “a great friend of the St. Louis\nFed.” Bullard cited Meltzer’s research on the run-up to the Great In�ation of the 1970s and\nearly 1980s and contrasted that period with the in�ation targeting era of the past two\ndecades, when in�ation was brought under control. “In�ation targeting has worked well\nbecause it deals more directly with the coordination of macroeconomic expectations than\nother approaches. By committing to an in�ation target, in�ation has generally been kept\nlower and less variable, and in�ation expectations have also been less variable,” Bullard\nsaid. “This has been a major achievement of U.S. monetary policy, and one to which Allan\nMeltzer made an outsized contribution.”\nRead the related article in Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review »\nFull text of remarks:\nAllan Meltzer and the Search for a Nominal Anchor1\nJames Bullard\nPresident and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nMeltzer’s Contributions to Monetary Economics and Public Policy\nPhiladelphia, Pa.\n\nIntroduction\nAllan Meltzer was an outstanding monetary economist with a long and distinguished\ncareer.2 He has been an absolute �xture on the central banking and monetary economics\nscene during my entire career, so much so that I have a hard time picturing that scene\n\n\fwithout him. He was also a great friend of the St. Louis Fed.\nMeltzer published seven papers in the St. Louis Fed’s Review. The �rst was published in\n1969 and was titled “Controlling Money.”3 The last was published in 2005 and was a\nprecursor to Volume 2 of his monumental A History of the Federal Reserve.4 I will use this\nlast Review publication as a starting point for my comments.\nThe paper, titled “Origins of the Great In�ation,” discusses the run-up to the extraordinary\nin�ation of the 1970s and early 1980s in the U.S. from a policymaker perspective. Meltzer\npresents in the style later carried on in the History. He quotes the views of individual\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members, along with those of the staff, that\ndescribe what they thought they were doing in adopting particular monetary policy actions\nat particular times. He presents this material almost deadpan, with little judgment, to try to\ndiscern what the protagonists were thinking as the Great In�ation developed.\nAnd indeed, they were thinking and saying a wide variety of things. As the narrative\nprogresses, however, it becomes quite apparent that there was little in the way of a clear\nframework for monetary policy during these years. Meltzer states that the Committee had\nno common baseline even for fundamental questions, such as the causes of in�ation. Ideas\nfor the provision of a nominal anchor centered on keeping �scal de�cits low, closely\nregulating the growth of the money supply, or keeping interest rates suf�ciently high. None\nof these were widely accepted, and all had detractors. Some FOMC members eschewed\nmacroeconomic theory altogether. He notes that then-Board Governor Sherman Maisel\noften exhorted the Committee to spend more time on the development of a coherent model\nthat could be used to better guide decision-making, but with little effect. As a result of the\ntheoretical incoherence, actual decision-making was perhaps more open to in�uence by\nother factors, such as domestic politics, which Meltzer discusses in some detail.\nFrom this situation some �ve decades ago as described by Meltzer, we come to the present.\nIs the situation today very different? The debates in the monetary theory literature and the\n�scal theory of the price level literature roll onward. Certainly, much progress has been\nmade, but complicated arguments abound and clear resolution seems distant. Yet today,\ndespite the remaining theoretical incoherence, in�ation control has been in place in the\nU.S. for about two decades—and this despite the global �nancial crisis. If there is a problem\nwith in�ation today, it is because in�ation has been lower than promised, not higher. How is\nit that a nominal anchor for the U.S. has been found without clear resolution to the puzzles\nposed in the academic literature?\n\nIn�ation Targeting\nThe answer to this question is surely “in�ation targeting.” In�ation targeting does not\n\n\fprovide a comprehensive account of in�ation dynamics or of the methods used to attain a\ngiven in�ation goal over the medium term. As implemented in the U.S., it is really only a\ncredible statement of a goal and a promise to try to achieve the goal in the medium term via\nall means at the disposal of the FOMC. That is not enough to satisfy any modern notion of\nwhat constitutes a macroeconomic theory. Nevertheless, it has succeeded in providing the\nU.S. with the nominal anchor that so eluded us during the 1970s and early 1980s.\nIn�ation targeting came upon the global central banking scene in the 1990s. Early adopters\nincluded the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and the Bank of England, but many other central\nbanks around the world have followed since that time. The European Central Bank was\nconceived and established with a formal in�ation target. The Bank of Japan and the Federal\nReserve did not join the club formally until fairly recently, with the U.S. adopting an\nin�ation target in January 2012.\nNevertheless, in my opinion the U.S. has followed a de facto in�ation targeting policy from\n1995 onwards. As of that time, U.S. in�ation had declined to about 2 percent and has not\ndeviated substantially from that target over the last 22 years, at least not on the scale\nobserved during the 1970s and early 1980s. U.S. policymakers were well aware of the\ntrends in the international policy debate toward in�ation targeting during this era, and\nmany members of the Committee were sympathetic to the arguments supporting in�ation\ntargeting.\nGenerally speaking, the evidence from around the globe is that in�ation targeting has been\nsuccessful in those countries that have implemented it. In�ation rates are generally lower\ntoday than in the pre-in�ation targeting era, and in�ation rates are often maintained\nrelatively close to the announced in�ation target. The variance of in�ation has generally\nbeen lower than in the pre-in�ation targeting era. In addition, the variance of in�ation\nexpectations has also declined, generally speaking, because �nancial market participants\nhave tended to view many central bank in�ation targets as relatively credible commitments.\nThese developments are all in line with what one might expect based on theories that\ncompare a noisy and purely discretionary monetary policy like the one Meltzer described\nfor the U.S. during the run-up to the Great In�ation, as opposed to a policy based more on a\ncommitment by the central bank as to what it intends to achieve.\nWhat would Allan Meltzer say if he were here? My reading of his views is that he would\nstress that the act of naming a credible in�ation target recognizes some fundamental truths\n—truths that were not recognized in the run-up to the Great In�ation. In particular, it\nassigns the responsibility for the in�ation rate to the central bank. It strongly suggests that\nin�ation is a monetary phenomenon. But it stops short of requiring an implementer of the\npolicy to commit to any particular macroeconomic theory beyond these precepts.\n\n\fI would add my own view at this point, without trying to implicate Allan Meltzer, as I am not\nsure that he would stress it as much as I do. My point is this: The act of naming an explicit\nin�ation target recognizes the importance of macroeconomic expectations and future\npolicy expectations as being paramount in the monetary policy arena. It is the expectations\nof future policy that can be unruly and lead to changes in economic behavior that can, in\nturn, change the nature of the macroeconomic equilibrium. If expectations are the problem,\nthen a natural way to help tie them down is to credibly commit to an in�ation target. This\napproach has worked admirably during the last two decades.\nOne could tie private sector expectations down still further by credibly committing to a\nmonetary policy rule, such as a Taylor-type rule.5 The Taylor-type rule has the in�ation\ntarget as a critical component, but also speci�es how the central bank should respond to\nvarious shocks to the economy. Would there be additional gains, on top of those already\nachieved through the naming of a credible in�ation target itself, by a central bank\ncommitment to such a rule? Allan Meltzer thought so, and testi�ed to that effect before\nCongress in 2015.6 Others have been opposed, including my long-time colleague and now\noutgoing Fed Chair Janet Yellen.7\n\nTwo Indications of Monetary Policy Quality\nHow can we decide if there are additional gains that would accrue to the U.S. economy via\nmonetary policymakers more explicitly adopting a Taylor-type policy rule? Much has been\nwritten on this issue. Some of the issues addressed in the literature include the idea that the\nTaylor-type policy rule is a more model-dependent object and that its policy prescriptions\nwill be valid only in certain model environments. A very real issue, therefore, is the\nsubstantial model uncertainty that characterizes today’s policy landscape. But instead of\nrehashing these arguments, I wish to go in a different direction in the remainder of my\nremarks.8\nI want to turn now to make an assessment of whether in�ation targeting, as implemented\nimplicitly in the U.S. since 1995 (and explicitly since 2012), has led U.S. policymakers to\nadopt something we can view as close to optimal monetary policy. If recent monetary policy\ncan be viewed as close to optimal, then attempts to further pin down expectations of future\npolicy actions may be less desirable. If recent monetary policy is viewed as less close to\noptimal, then further monetary policy commitment may confer important bene�ts to the\neconomy.\nI will proceed by considering two examples. In these examples, the evidence on whether\nrecent monetary policy is close to optimal or not is somewhat mixed, so the results here are\nbroadly inconclusive. Nevertheless, I think it is instructive to work through these examples.\n\n\fTo make an assessment of this type requires a model. Since there are many models to\nchoose from, we could simply stop here and say we do not know. But in the spirit of trying to\nunderstand a little more about the effects of in�ation targeting, I will use a very simple\nversion of a New Keynesian model. Since most of you know the ideas behind this model\nvery well, I have relegated the details to an appendix.\n\nThe Case of the Disappearing Phillips Curve\nThe �rst example is the case of the disappearing Phillips curve. Here we will begin with the\nempirical evidence, which is neatly summarized in Figure 1, adapted from the latest annual\nreport of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).9 The �gure shows the coef�cient on a\nmeasure of resource slack (unemployment) in a regression of price in�ation on resource\nutilization, using the authors’ preferred speci�cation. The coef�cient is estimated\nrepeatedly in rolling 15-year samples, and the point estimates, along with 90 percent\ncon�dence bands, are plotted in the �gure. The sample runs from the 1980s to the present.\nThe data are for a panel of G-7 economies, and the point estimate is a weighted average\nacross economies.\nThe main idea of the �gure is that the slope of the Phillips curve was once negative in the\n1980s but has been drifting toward zero in the in�ation targeting era since 1995. The\ncoef�cient has not been different from zero in recent years—hence the disappearing\nPhillips curve that has been widely discussed in �nancial markets and in monetary policy\ncircles.\nThe empirical phenomenon documented in Figure 1 can be related to the idea that\nmonetary authorities have moved closer to implementing optimal monetary policy during\nthe in�ation targeting era.10 The details of this argument can be found in the appendix, but\nI will describe the approach here. I begin with a standard, two-equation, linearized New\nKeynesian model. I then assume that the monetary policymaker wishes to stabilize a\nquadratic function of in�ation gaps and output gaps over an in�nite horizon. I give the\npolicymaker a Taylor-type linear feedback policy rule to work with. I allow the policymaker\nto choose just one parameter in this feedback rule in order to minimize the loss function.\nThat single parameter is the coef�cient on the in�ation gap. We could think of this as\nrepresenting the weight placed on in�ation stabilization versus output stabilization in the\nTaylor-type rule.\nIn this simple exercise, the solution to the policymaker problem is to set the value of the\ncoef�cient on the in�ation gap to a very large value—technically, in�nity. In this situation,\noptimal monetary policy would call for very low tolerance of deviations of in�ation from\ntarget. The central bank reacts very aggressively to keep in�ation under control.\n\n\fIn this simple model, we can also write out explicitly the value of the regression coef�cient\nin a regression of the in�ation gap on the output gap, which is the theoretical counterpart of\nthe slope of the Phillips curve in the BIS regression of Figure 1. The Taylor-type rule\ncoef�cient on the in�ation gap appears in this formula. As this value tends to in�nity the\npolicymaker is following something closer and closer to optimal policy—and at the same\ntime the slope of the Phillips curve is tending toward zero.\nThis result is one way to state the idea that central banks have become better and better at\nin�ation targeting, and that this success has driven the Phillips curve slope to zero. The\nempirical evidence in Figure 1 can therefore be interpreted as a signature of optimal\nmonetary policy in observable data. Figure 1 is saying, in effect, that policymakers have\nalready jumped on the Taylor rule bandwagon during the last two decades.\n\nPrice Level Targeting\nThe second example is price level targeting. I have so far argued that in�ation targeting has\nconferred considerable bene�ts on the economy. And yet, within the standard New\nKeynesian model, optimal monetary policy is often characterized as price level targeting or\nits close cousin, nominal income targeting. In recent years, FOMC members (including me)\nhave discussed both price level and nominal income targeting as a possible future of U.S.\nmonetary policy. A move in this direction would require considerable debate and re�ection,\nbut might also confer substantial bene�ts to the U.S. economy if it could be implemented\neffectively.\nIf we simply take as given that price level targeting is optimal policy within the New\nKeynesian construct, a signature in the U.S. data of optimal monetary policy would be\nwhether the price level in the U.S. follows a prescribed price level path. If it does, then the\nFOMC has been de facto price level targeting even if the Committee has not of�cially said\nthat it has been doing so. The hallmark of price level targeting is that periods of belowtarget in�ation are averaged out with other periods of above-target in�ation in such a way\nthat the economy remains on a price level path consistent with a given in�ation rate.\nIn the price level targeting world, the starting date matters. I have already argued that 1995\nis the point at which the Volcker-era in�ation stabilization came to full fruition, and that\nfrom that point onward, the FOMC attempted to maintain a 2 percent in�ation target. But\ndid the Committee do even more, implicitly attempting to keep the U.S. economy on a 2\npercent price level path?\nIn the fall of 2012, I argued that the FOMC had kept the U.S. on a 2 percent price level path\nsince 1995, and that this was an outstanding achievement given the global �nancial crisis\nduring the intervening years.11 Again, at least as of 2012, the actual implementation of U.S.\n\n\fmonetary policy could be viewed as optimal. By itself, this would suggest that there would\nbe little to be gained from additional monetary policy commitments by the central bank.\nHowever, as Figure 2 illustrates, in the last �ve years, the U.S. has fallen off the 2 percent\nprice level path established in 1995. The deviation from the path is now fairly substantial,\nabout 4.6 percent on the low side. Recent FOMC forecasts do not seem to anticipate enough\nin�ation to return the economy to the 2 percent path. Therefore, we will have to conclude\nthat monetary policy has not been optimal from this perspective.\n\nSummary and Conclusion\nI have ruminated on Allan Meltzer’s excellent career by casting it in terms of a search for a\nnominal anchor for the U.S. I took as a starting point Meltzer’s last article for the St. Louis\nFed’s Review, “Origins of the Great In�ation.” That article, a precursor to the much larger\nwork, A History of the Federal Reserve, Volume 2, suggests that during the period of the\nrun-up to the Great In�ation, there was no coherent monetary policy framework. This lack\nof coherence may have left monetary policy susceptible to in�uences other than those from\nmonetary science, such as politics.\nToday, some �ve decades later, there remains a great deal of theoretical and empirical\nuncertainty about the effects of monetary policy on the economy. And yet, despite this\nuncertainty, the U.S. and many other countries have been able to achieve low and stable\nin�ation and, if anything, have faced a problem of in�ation being lower than promised,\ninstead of higher than promised as in the 1970s and early 1980s. How was the nominal\nanchor found, and what was it?\nMy answer is that it has been in�ation targeting, either practiced implicitly or explicitly.\nThis may not have been the answer many economists were expecting during the earlier\nportions of the postwar era—ideas then revolved around constant money growth, low �scal\nde�cits or the level of short-term nominal interest rates. In�ation targeting has worked well\nbecause it deals more directly with the coordination of macroeconomic expectations than\nother approaches. By committing to an in�ation target, in�ation has generally been kept\nlower and less variable, and in�ation expectations have also been less variable. This has\nbeen a major achievement of U.S. monetary policy, and one to which Allan Meltzer made an\noutsized contribution.\nIf the naming of a credible in�ation target coordinates expectations and helps inform the\nmacroeconomic equilibrium, then perhaps further coordination can be achieved by being\neven more explicit about the future actions of monetary policymakers. One method of doing\nthis would be for the central bank to commit to using a Taylor-type monetary policy rule.\nWhether this would confer added bene�ts or not would depend on whether one thinks there\nare in fact additional gains to be had for the economy by more tightly buttoning down future\n\n\fexpectations of monetary policy.\nSuch questions cannot really be answered without the assistance of a macroeconomic\nmodel. But if we go ahead with a popular and simple version of the New Keynesian model,\nwe can consider two examples of what optimal policy would look like and how it compares\nto actual monetary policy outcomes during the in�ation targeting era. The “disappearing\nPhillips curve” example suggests that actual U.S. monetary policy has tended to be closer\nand closer to optimal in the last two decades, and that this has, in fact, killed off the Phillips\ncurve correlation previously apparent in the data. The “price level targeting” example\nsuggests U.S. monetary policy was close to optimal between 1995 and 2012, but has since\nfallen away somewhat.\nWhether we can do better than these two examples suggest, or whether the available gains\nhave largely accrued already via the commitment to in�ation targeting implicitly made in\nthe U.S. in the 1990s, remains an important question for future research.
