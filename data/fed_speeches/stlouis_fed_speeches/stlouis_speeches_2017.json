He highlighted the importance of\nadjusting for price differences across MSAs when making\nsuch comparisons. In all, 381 MSAs in the U.S. were\nstudied. Bullard noted that the St. Louis MSA ranked in the\ntop 6 percent of these metro areas. This analysis may lead\nto other research on why some cities are more successful\nthan others, he said. Bullard spoke at the Bi-State\nDevelopment’s annual meeting, in downtown St. Louis.\n*Please note the updated chart on slide 33 and the addition of\nslide 35, “Bottom line on top 10 MSAs,” on Oct. 24, 2017.\n\nBelow is a transcript of Bullard's remarks, in addition to Q&A\nwith the audience. This transcript has been lightly edited for\nclarity. A video of the event is also available.\nJames Bullard: Well, good afternoon, and what a great\naudience here. I'm really looking forward to the remarks\nhere and to challenge this audience and also to a Q&A. I\nwill take Q&A at the end if I can see any of you. These are\nbright lights up here, so I'm not really used to that. So we're\ngoing to need slides up here in order to do this. Here we\nare. Can we go back one? Good. Here we are. I wanted to\nstart with this because, you know, I'm not going to talk\nabout monetary policy here. [Laughter.] The audience\nbreathed a sigh of relief.\nI'm going to talk about something I think you'd be very\ninterested in, which is living standards across U.S.\nmetropolitan statistical areas, and this represents, as I'm\ngoing to outline here, some research and some ideas I've\nbeen thinking about and that I've talked with John about\nover the last year or so. So this is kind of testing out the\nresearch results. I'm anxious to hear what you guys think\nabout it.\n\nJames Bullard\nPresident and Chief\nExecutive O cer\nBio\nCurriculum Vitae\nStaff Contacts\nIDEAS/RePEc Pro le\nPhotos\nVideos\nSubscribe:\nEmail alerts\nRSS\n\"Rationally, let it be said in a\nwhisper, experience is certainly\nworth more than theory.\"\nAmerigo Vespucci\n\n\fSo this is going to draw on some recent research at the St.\nLouis Fed, but it will also be supplemented by additional\nrecent research from outside the Bank. Some of you know\nthat the St. Louis Fed has one of the top economic\nresearch departments in the Federal Reserve and in fact in\nthe world, so we're trying to leverage that to attack this\nparticular issue. For those that want to see recent\ncomments on monetary policy, you can look at my talk at\nTruman State University last week, and also during the Q&A\nI'd be happy to entertain questions about monetary policy if\nyou want to go in that direction.\nThe paper I'm going to talk about is by my colleagues,\nCletus Coughlin, Chuck Gascon and Kevin Kliesen. It is\navailable on our webpage. You can click on it. It's called\n\"Living Standards in St. Louis and the Eighth Federal\nReserve District: Let's Get Real.\" The things I'm going to talk\nabout here in these slides are a little bit more preliminary\nthan the published paper. And so I'm happy to take\ncomments if you have any or you know other people that\nhave comments.\nI want to motivate this by—with the really large literature on\ninternational standards of living that is already out there.\nAnd in that literature we try to address—we economists try\nto address the question of which national economies are\nperforming well and which national economies are\nperforming less well for their citizens. And there's an\nestablished methodology for how to do that, and I'm going\nto copy that methodology.\nAnd, again—you're just talking about whether the citizens\nare well-off in terms of material well-being. You're not\ntrying to get at anything else. It's just sort of pure\neconomics, material well-being. Some countries do very\nwell and are considered rich countries, like the United\nStates. Others do less well, and they're considered\nrelatively poor on the world scale. So we would like to be\nable to make similar statements across metropolitan\nstatistical areas in the U.S.\nSo if you look at this international literature, you'll get a\npicture like this. The vertical axis is some kind of measure\nof real per capita income across countries, and each bar on\nthis represents one country. And the U.S. is called out\nthere. It's on toward the left in this picture, which means it's\na relatively high per capita income. GDP is the same as\nincome. And China and India are relatively low on this.\nAnd so we make statements that say, you know, U.S. is a\nrelatively wealthy country or relatively rich country in terms\nof per capita income. And China and India have lower\nstandards of living because they have lower per capita\nincome. So we want to make exactly these kinds of\nstatements across U.S. metropolitan statistical areas.\nNow, I just want to stress to people that, just because\nyou're the highest, or one of the highest standards of living\n\n\fin the world doesn't mean that we're the fastest-growing.\nIt's well-known in particular China and India are fastergrowing countries, but they have lower standards of living.\nAnd I think it's—you know, it's something where the\nstatistics bear out actual experience. If you go to India, if\nyou go to China, you'll see a very different country than\nwhat you see here, if you travel across the whole country.\nSo let me just talk about MSAs in the U.S. And I think some\nof you probably know this, but we've got the whole set of\nMSAs. An MSA is an area containing a large population\ncenter in adjacent counties with a high degree of\nintegration with that center, as measured by commuting\npatterns. So there's some science behind this about how\nyou do this and how you de ne this. And it provides a\nnatural unit for what we want to talk about here, instead of\narti cial political boundaries, which are, you know, sort of\ndotted lines around certain areas.\nWe want to talk about the economic unit, and I think the\nMSA is designed to do that. And so we're going to do that.\nAnd, certainly, Bi-State Development is all about getting the\nwhole region to work together. About 90 percent of U.S.\nGDP is produced in metropolitan statistical areas. We're\ngoing to look at the whole set here: 381 MSAs in the U.S.,\nabout 86 percent of the U.S. population lived in these\nplaces.\nThe smallest was Carson City, Nev., at 54,000 people.\n50,000 is the cutoff here, so they won't de ne an MSA\nsmaller than that. Largest is New York City, population 20\nmillion. The median population, about 238,000; average\npopulation, 721,000. So this means these big cities are\nreally big compared to the Carson City, Nevadas of the\nworld. So you have a lot of skewness in the size\ndistribution of cities.\nSo what we're going to do, because it's so skewed, is that\nwe're also going to consider just a set of the very largest\nMSAs in the sample, having a population of at least 1\nmillion. For that group, about 56 percent of the population\nlives in that group. There are 53 of these large MSAs. St.\nLouis is one of them. Tucson, Ariz., is the smallest, about 1\nmillion. New York's the largest. Median population for this\nlarge set, 2.3 million; average population, 3.4 million. Those\nnumbers are not too far from the St. Louis area. And so\nthere's skewness even among the large MSAs, but it's not\nas extreme as for the whole set of MSAs. So we're going to\nreport results for both sets.\nAnd here's a picture that I love that our staff did to give you\nan idea about what we're talking about here. Those blue,\ndarker blue, are the 53 large MSAs in the country. And,\nagain, you're talking about half of GDP is in those blue,\ndarker blue blocks. If you add in the lighter blue blocks, you\nget the entire set of MSAs. You've got 90 percent of GDP\nbeing produced in those areas. So this is what we're talking\nabout. And the question as I look at this map, where is the\n\n\f—which of these are performing the best and which are\nperforming less well, based on per capita income?\nNow, a key to this research is the idea of price levels by\nMSA. And those of you that know me and have heard me\ntalk about this know where I'm going on this. Prices vary\ngreatly across the U.S. And, certainly, we all have an\nintuitive sense that some places are wildly expensive and\nother places are very inexpensive.\nAnd the good thing is that, recently, there's been more\nsystematic accounting of this and better data has been\ndeveloped on regional price level differences. And we're\ngoing to use this new data—that's what makes this really\ninteresting to macroeconomic people like me—hey, this is\nsome new data that we can use. But we're going to use this\nnew data to calculate the real income per capita across\nthese MSAs.\nSo these new data are called Regional Price Parities, RPPs.\nThey measure the differences in price levels by MSA,\nacross MSAs, in a given year. So it's annual data. This is\ndone by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. These data\nstarted to be published in 2014. So in the world of\nresearch, that's just like yesterday. They just became\navailable, and so we're starting to use them. They are\navailable back to 2008, but here in this talk I'm mainly just\ngoing to focus on one particular year, the most recent year\nfor which we have complete data, which is 2015.\nThese RPPs are expressed as a percentage of the national\nprice level. So you'll see numbers like 90 or 110. That\nmeans 90 percent of the national price level or 110 percent\nof the national price level. And this covers all consumption\ngoods and services and includes rents, and that's a key\naspect of what I'm talking about here.\nSo a key issue here is, well, why do these prices differ\nacross different parts of the country? If you think of\nsomething like gas stations, I can always go to the next\ngas station and it should be competitive with the last gas\nstation that I was at, and therefore the prices should be just\nabout the same across the cities. But the reason prices\ndiffer is housing costs, and the housing differentials are\nhuge.\nI've got an example here from Zillow data. St. Louis median\nhouse is about 105 bucks per square foot, median home in\nSan Francisco about $479 per square foot. That's a ratio of\nabout ve to one. And I think we know this intuitively, that\nthese housing costs are so substantially different that it\nreally affects your standard of living if you live in different\nplaces around the country.\nSo here's a picture—I've got two pictures like this—this is a\n3D picture from metrocosm.com, and the basic message\nof this picture, yellow and orange means $200 to $500 per\nsquare foot for housing costs. The darker colors are less\n\n\fthan $50 up to $100 or $150 per square foot. And the basic\nidea that you get from this picture is the East Coast—\nBoston, New York, D.C., South Florida—and especially the\nCalifornia coast and Hawaii—are extremely expensive on\nthis measure, the middle part of the country much less\nexpensive. Aspen, Colo., comes up to be the very highest\nhere. I think this is by Zip code, not by MSA. Aspen isn't\nactually that big of a place.\nThis is another picture that shows the same kind of thing,\nthe share of households that can afford payments on the\nmedian-priced single-family home. And dark green means\nthree-quarters of the households could afford to buy the\nmedian house in that particular area. Red means that less\nthan a third of the households could afford to buy even the\nmedian house in that particular area.\nSo you can see in this picture that the West Coast is all red.\nSo that means it's very unaffordable even for most\nhouseholds to buy the median house in that area. I'm not\ntalking about buying the very best house in the area, just\nthe median house in the area, whereas the same can be\nsaid for the East Coast—Boston and New York, Florida—\nand then in the middle west part of the country, we get\nmuch more affordability, and you get things like two-thirds\nor three-quarters of the households can afford to buy the\nmedian house in that area.\nSo this is just another way to say what we already know,\nthat housing costs are very different across the country.\nThis affects your lifestyle. It affects your standard of living\nacross the country. And it shows up in these RPPs, these\nRegional Price Parity numbers, for different parts of the\ncountry.\nSo the least expensive MSA is Beckley, W.Va. It has an RPP\nof about 80 percent, so about 80 percent of the national\nprice level. So it's cheaper to live there. The most expensive\nis Honolulu, 125 percent. And St. Louis is a little over 90\npercent of the national average.\nOK. So we're ready to do our calculation. What is real\nincome per capita across these MSAs? We're going to take\nreal income per capita for each MSA and adjust it based on\nthese regional price levels. And that's going to give us the\nstandard of living as the average level of real income per\nperson for a particular location analogous to the crosscountry literature graph that I showed you at the beginning.\nNow, I don't have median data here. I only have the\naverage. And so this isn't going to take into account\nincome inequality. You might be saying, OK, the MSA\ngenerates a certain amount of income. That's income per\nperson. We're not really saying who's getting the income.\nThat's income inequality. But I'm going to come back with a\nsection later that's going to talk about income inequality,\nincluding for St. Louis. And we'll take a look at that at the\nend.\n\n\fSo the measure of real income is going to be per capita\npersonal income adjusted for in ation, so this is real\npurchasing power. Another possibility would be to look at\nhousehold income, and if you read the paper, they do look\nat household income. I think that's probably a less good\nway to look at it, but if you want to get into that, we can talk\nabout it. And then if we divide by this RPP for that\nparticular MSA, we're going to get this real income per\ncapita, adjusted for regional price differentials. I'm going to\nfocus on 2015 only here.\nSo here's the result for the St. Louis MSA. We had an RPP\nadjusted real personal income per capita that was about\n12 percent higher than the national average. Among the 53\nlargest MSAs, we ranked No. 7 in the nation. Among the\ncomplete set of 381 MSAs, St. Louis ranks about 20, which\nis in the top 6 percent or so. So another way to say this is\nSt. Louis' standard of living is higher than about 94 percent\nof the MSAs in the nation.\nAnother way to say this is, if I randomly reallocated all of\nyou to other MSAs, you're probably going to be worse—and\nyou're the average guy—you're probably going to be worse\noff going to one of those other MSAs than staying here in\nSt. Louis. So this is a good set of numbers for St. Louis\nthat I think highlights how well this region really does and\nbrings into stark relief the high standard of living that exists\nin this part of the country.\nSo, what I'm going to do in the rest of the talk is show\ntables that expand on this result right here and talk about it\nin a variety of ways. So here's the picture analogous to the\ncross-country picture that we looked at at the beginning.\nSo this is our measure of real per capita income. One\nwould mean that you are the same as the national average\nin that particular MSA. Higher than that means you're\nhigher than the national average.\nAnd you can see that this is arranged—MSAs are arranged\nfrom highest to lowest, going from left to right in this\npicture. Each bar represents an MSA. We put St. Louis on\nhere, and we put the three largest MSAs in the country—\nNew York, Chicago and LA—that are all trailing us in\nstandard of living.\nYou can see there's—this is an S-shaped curve, which I\nthink is interesting. Some places do extremely well. The\nvery highest bar there on the far left I believe is Midland,\nTexas, so something about oil boom going on there. And\nthen things gradually trail off, and then some places are\nsubstantially lower in standard of living than the nation as\na whole. But, basically, St. Louis does extremely well on\nthis.\nNow this is the whole set of 381 MSAs. We might also\nwant to look at the very largest MSAs, and here they are. So\nthese are the 53 largest ones. Again, we called out St.\nLouis and then the three largest ones, which are New York,\n\n\fChicago and Los Angeles, which are trailing us. And I'm\ngoing to show you some pictures here in just a minute of\nthe top 10 here, which we are in the top 10.\nNow one thing about this picture and interpreting this, the\nones on the far left there are clearly doing something right,\nbecause they're much higher or substantially higher than\nthe national average. And then when you get to St. Louis,\nwe're at the high end, but the cities behind us are not too\nfar behind us, so you've got a lot of more or less equal\ncities that are—the slope is very—not very steep there. And\nwe're going to look at that also.\nSo, now what I'm going to do is just focus the rest of the\ntime on the top 10 large MSAs—and we're No. 7 in that\ngroup—and just look at who they are. So this is a table that\nshows you how this came out. St. Louis is No. 7. We're\nabout at—1.13 for us means about 13 percent above the\nnational standard of living.\nOur competitors are here in this top 10 list. We've got—the\nBay Area does extremely well here. The tech boom has\nbeen going on for at least 20 years there, and it really\nshows in these numbers. They're No. 1 and 2, really the\nsame place—San Jose, Calif., and San Francisco. Boston\ndoing very well, Seattle also a tech hub. Seattle has\nAmazon and Microsoft. Then you get to Washington, D.C.,\nand the other—the bottom ve in this list out of the top 10.\nAnd they're very close to being equal. So there's not a huge\ndifference between them, but we are in the top 10.\nNow, some of these in this group have a high cost of living\nand some of them have a low cost of living. So one thing\nwe could add to the list is, say, OK, among these that have\na high standard of living, which are the low-cost areas and\nwhich are the high-cost areas? And we're going to do that\nhere. And, as you might have surmised just looking through\nthis list, it's only us and Nashville, Tenn., that have this\nlower cost of living. All the others in this list either have\ncost of living at the national average or considerably higher\nthan the national average in the case of San Jose, Calif.,\nand San Francisco or even Boston or even Seattle or\nWashington, D.C.\nNow, I mean, these might just—you might just think, \"Well,\ngee, Jim, these are just numbers on a table.\" But, you know,\nyou think about what this means. You're talking about 90\npercent here. You're talking about 110 percent in Boston.\nThat's a 20 percent cost differential. You think about 121 in\nSan Francisco or close to that in Washington, D.C. That's a\n30 percent cost differential. So if you're a company and\nyou're producing product here and then shipping it around\nthe country versus producing product in Washington, D.C.,\nor San Francisco and trying to ship it around the country,\nthose other guys have a 30 percent disadvantage in cost\ncompared to St. Louis or Nashville. So those are huge\ndifferences.\n\n\fCould you imagine trying to run your business and your\nopponent has a 30 percent cost advantage on you? You're\ngoing to get killed. So I think this is one of the biggest\nthings about St. Louis and Nashville on this list—Nashville's\ngoing to turn out to be basically identical to St. Louis in\nthese numbers—is that we have tremendous cost\nadvantage over our rivals among the cities that have the\nhighest standard of living in the nation.\nNow, just to keep perspective on what we're talking about\nhere, the international income distribution is a lot more\nunequal than the U.S. income distribution. If you take the\nratio of the 90th percentile to the 10th percentile across\nMSAs, you're going to get a number of 1.37. So what does\nthat mean? That means that the average guy in the kind of\nthe rich city is making about 35 percent, 37 percent more\nthan the average guy in the poor city that's in the 10th\npercentile. So that's a difference of 35-40 percent across\nthat spectrum.\nIf you do the same thing to the international data, you get a\nstunning number of 28. So that means that the guy in the\n90th percentile of the rich countries is making 28 times\nwhat the guy in probably a Sub-Saharan African country is\nmaking. So the international income differentials are so\nstaggering they make your jaw drop. And that remains true\neven if you focus on a more homogeneous set of\ncountries. For instance, just European countries, you do the\n90-10 ratio, you get 3.8. And if you do the OECD countries,\nyou get 2.1.\nSo among—within the international context, that 1.37 is not\na huge number. But when we think about competing across\nMSAs within the USA, 35 percent or 40 percent is a big\nnumber. So you've got to keep everything sort of in\nperspective when you're looking at this here.\nSo, now we're going to go to the income inequality idea\nwithin MSAs. Obviously, we're just averaging across all the\npeople in the St. Louis MSA. Some are doing well. Some\naren't doing very well. We'd like to be able to account for\nthat and get the idea of how much income inequality is\nthere within these different MSAs. The data that I'm looking\nat does not account for the distribution of income. So I'm\ngoing to have to go to a different paper, and it's going to be\nthe paper that's cited here by three authors that I don't\nknow very well. But we're going to use their research. They\nhave studied the issue of income inequality across MSAs.\nIt turns out that St. Louis is kind of average in terms of\nincome inequality and some of our rivals on the top 10 list\nhave very high income inequality, and we're going to look at\nthat here. So here's the picture. This isn't per capita income\nanymore. This is a measure of income inequality, and the\nMSAs are along the horizontal as we had before, and the\nmeasure of inequality is on the vertical axis.\n\n\fAnd the measure of inequality is the ratio of the average\nincome of the guy in the top 1 percent versus the average\nincome of the guy in the bottom 99 percent. And if you look\nat that ratio for New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, which are\nlisted there, those numbers are all higher. St. Louis is down\nthe list. I wouldn't say it's exactly low, but it's close to the\nmiddle of the distribution here as you go off to the right in\nthis picture. You've got the one with the highest—the MSA\nwith the highest inequality is Bridgeport, Conn. I don't know\ntoo much about that MSA, but the kind of rumor would be a\nlot of hedge fund type people like to live in Bridgeport, and\nit probably has also a poorer segment of its MSA, and\nthat's creating a lot of inequality in that particular place.\nBut I think the main message of this is that the larger cities\ntend to be places where income inequality is quite a bit\nhigher than it is for the rest of the MSAs. And this is all 380\nof them in here.\nSo now we can put that extra column on our top 10 list\nhere, so this is the same table that we had before with our\nmeasure of per capita income. We're No. 7 on the list.\nWe've got our measure of cost of living and the RPP. We're\nlow cost. And then we've got our measure of inequality in\nthis last column. And I just want to focus on this for a\nminute, because some of these cities have pretty high\ninequality.\nAnd what cities are they? They're the Bay Area cities that\nhave inequality numbers around 30, Boston very high,\nHouston also quite high. But the other cities on this list are\nprobably comparable to St. Louis, kind of in the middle.\nNashville in particular is close to us, Minneapolis close to\nus. Seattle a little bit higher, but generally speaking close to\nus. Washington, D.C., actually comes up with relatively low\ninequality. I think the federal government there provides a\nkind of a lot of income across a very large swathe of the\nworkforce there, and so it's kind of a different city from\nother places.\nSo the message I would like to take—and this talk's about\nover here, so you can wake up again. [Laughter.] The\nmessage I'd like you to take is that, among the top 10\nplaces for standard of living in the U.S., there's only two\nthat are low cost. That's us and Nashville. And then—and\nNashville is really almost identical to us across the board\nhere. And then, among the ones that do better than us on\nstandard of living, some of them are high cost—they're\nhigher-cost than us, but some of them also have quite a bit\nhigher inequality than what we have here.\nSo I'm going to stop there. I think we're about done—oh, I've\ngot one more thing. We often talk about economic growth,\nand I think a lot of the discussion that I've had with all of\nyou we think of growth as being the measure of how well\nwe're doing, whereas I'm talking about the level, the\nstandard of living level that we're at. If we don't grow, then\n\n\fothers will catch up to us and pass us in per capita income.\nBut economic growth is not the same as standard of living.\nNow in the cross-country literature it's well-understood that\nsome of the poorer countries are also the fast-growing\ncountries. And that's certainly happening with China and\nIndia. If you look at their growth rates, 6 percent to 7\npercent per year, year in and year out—U.S. is growing at 2\npercent a year, year in and year out—after a while they're\ngoing to catch up in per capita income if they continue to\ngrow faster than us. However, the standard of living as of\ntoday is still low, you know, by a factor of 5 to 10, than it is\nin the U.S. So they have a relatively low standard of living,\neven though they're growing really fast.\nYou might say the same thing about MSAs, but I don't really\nhave enough data here to get at this issue. And so we're\ngoing to have to defer that to a future day. Of course, it\nwould be great to be growing fast, but I think the point here\nis that the level of per capita income is high in St. Louis.\nOK. So let's conclude. If you want to think about these\nissues, you have to adjust for price differences across\nMSAs and housing prices in particular. Otherwise, you\nwon't have meaningful comparison about the standard of\nliving across MSAs. So I used some recent data that's\nbecome available on this issue. We use that to calculate\nper capita income across MSAs. And I'm hopeful that we\ncan use this kind of data to keep perspective of where we\nare and what we have to do to get better and where our\ncompetition is in the U.S. going forward.\nSo I'm going to stop there and let you guys ask some\nquestions. So thanks very much. You've been very attentive\nand very good. [Applause.] I think we have microphones\nover on this side and another one over on this side, so\nyou're going to have to troop up to the microphone if you\nwant to get a question. I prefer softball questions.\n[Laughter.]\nMale: Sorry about that, no softball. Dr. Bullard, I don't think\nthe data correlates with how most people in the region\nwould feel about our success.\nJames Bullard: Yes. I'm trying to shock you into what's\nreally going on here. This is what's really going on. These\nare the numbers. This is the data. Now from here you can\ngo say all kinds of other things. [Laughter.]\nMale: What do you think the reason is for that lack of\ncorrelation between what you're presenting and how\nprobably most of us feel? Humbleness?\nJames Bullard: There is a Midwestern humbleness, I would\nsay that. But some of the other places—it's not just St.\nLouis. It's that the cultural story has become very popular\nin the last 20 years, and I think that's mostly because of the\ntech boom. And the tech boom is a great story, and these\ntech companies are coming to dominate the U.S. economy,\n\n\fand that makes places like Seattle and the Bay Area look\nvery, very good. And they look good in this data as well.\nBut then you forget about, well, what about Minneapolis—\nforget about St. Louis. But what about Minneapolis? What\nabout Nashville? What about Houston? Are those also\nplaces with a high standard of living? And they are,\naccording to these data. So, I think—the idea that everyone\nhas got to scramble up to San Francisco to get into the\ntech boom I always think is a little bit funny. I mean, you\ncould do that from anywhere. You don't have to be out\nthere paying 30 percent more than what you're paying here.\nPlease?\nMale: OK. Since we're here in a transit agency, I thought I'd\nask a transit-related question. How did your data\ncompensate for the difference in utility and private car\nownership versus the availability of mass transit? In other\nwords, dense areas would obviously have higher property\ncosts, but also much higher costs of owning cars.\nThe ipside of that and something that came out in the\nFerguson Commission is the affordability of mass transit.\nIf you are living in a high-cost area and you have good\nmass transit and you compare that, how do you compare\nthat to living in perhaps a low-cost area which has car\nownership as a prerequisite to working?\nJames Bullard: Well, I think that's a great question, and the\nanswer is this data does not address that question.\n[Laughter.]\nSo, what I wanted to get at is this international comparison\nliterature. So when we're saying Switzerland has a high\nstandard of living, U.S. has a high standard of living, U.K.\nhas a high standard of living, we're not telling stories about\nthe transportation network in those countries. We're not\ntelling—there are a whole host of things that are going to\nbe a lot better in those three countries than they're going to\nbe in Latin America or Sub-Saharan Africa. There's going to\nbe dramatic differences in all kinds of dimensions between\nthose kinds of countries on the international scale.\nAnd you want to think of the MSA in the same way.\nDifferent MSAs are going to have different transportation\nnetwork needs. I think the coastal cities in particular seem\nto—at least from afar seem to be extremely congested\nbecause they're limited in what they can do with their\ngeography, and this creates a lot of complications about\ngetting around. I mean, New York City, who thought of the\nidea of putting 20 million people on that island? I mean,\nthat was like the stupidest thing we ever did. [Laughter.]\nSo I think what the advantage of the Midwest is—\nMinneapolis, Indianapolis, Dallas, Houston—you've got\nareas where you can spread out. And if you can build a\nrealistic transportation network, you can keep this cost of\nhousing more competitive than what you see in these\n\n\fcoastal communities. And that just provides tremendous\ncost advantage in the Midwest compared to the coast.\nSo I think that's what's going on in spades and it seems to\nbe getting even—you know, the prices are increasing more\nand more. If you look internationally at these cities, the\nhousing prices are increasing more and more. In the sort of\nglam cities or coast cities, people seem to want to pay a lot\nfor their housing. So I think the Midwest has a great\nadvantage on it.\nNow, being in the Midwest all by itself, even with a cost\nadvantage, doesn't mean it would be a great MSA. You also\nhave to have the jobs in the city that are good enough or\nthat are going to provide a high standard of living. So not\nall the cities on this list are in the Midwest. And so it's kind\nof that you're competing against a rival that has other—that\nmight have other advantages. But cost is not one of them.\nAnd I think we're doing very well against the list here.\nPlease?\nMale: Comparison to international comparisons was\ninteresting. For the international one, people can't move\nbetween countries. But for cities, people can move. So\nyou're saying the living standards are 20, 50 percent\ndifferent, and people aren't apparently moving given\nmigration statistics. Is it because of cost or is it because of\namenities you don't measure?\nIf it's amenities, it might be interesting to compare the\ndifferences in things like public transportation like the\nprevious speaker said or the things that might suggest\nmore investment in bi-state regional development. If these\nare amenities they control, they explain why we don't see\nmigration moving in the direction you suggest.\nJames Bullard: Yep.\nMale: Maybe there are other things that can be done.\nJames Bullard: Brilliant, brilliant question. So if the\nstandard of living is better somewhere else, then you would\nthink people would say, \"Hey, I'm going to move to the\nsomewhere else,\" if you're the average guy. We're talking\nabout the average guy here, too. We're not talking about the\nrich people. They can y wherever they want. But the\naverage person might say, \"Gee, my life would be a lot\nbetter if I go over from the poor country to the rich country,\nand therefore I'm going to move to the rich country.\"\nAnd that does happen internationally in spades, I would\nsay. But if you talk to people from poor countries, they\ncomplain about brain drain. They complain about their\nmost talented people wanting to be in Europe or the U.S.\nAnd so that happens. It doesn't happen on a grand scale\nbecause of immigration restrictions across countries. And,\ntherefore, what you see across countries is a lot of\ninequality across countries internationally.\n\n\fNow when I show you the MSA distribution, it's way atter.\nSo I think that process has gone on over the last 50 years\nor 100 years in the U.S., and people have moved to places\nwhere they thought the economic opportunity was bigger\nand where they can do better. And in order to get that\nprocess to work appropriately, people have to have the\nright perception about where the economic opportunity\nreally is. To a young person, this would say that places like\nSan Francisco and Boston are good. But it would also say\nplaces like Minneapolis and Nashville are also good and St.\nLouis also good.\nSo the fact that labor does not move internationally means\nthat that distribution is not getting equalized the same way\nthat it has in the U.S. It has become—it's much more equal\nin the U.S. across places, but not completely where you still\nhave a 35 percent or 40 percent differential between the\n90th percentile MSA and the 10th percentile MSA.\nOK, I think I've exhausted you. Well, it's a pleasure to be\nhere. What a great audience.

        "content": "An Illustrative Calculation of r†\nwith Policy Implications\nJames Bullard\nPresident and CEO\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nCentral Bank Forecasting Conference\nNov. 9, 2017\nSt. Louis, Mo.\nAny opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n1\n\n\fIntroduction\n\n2\n\n\fWhy worry about r†?\n•\n\n•\n•\n\nIn a Taylor-type rule, the natural real interest rate, r† ,\ndetermines the intercept:\ni = r† + π e + ϕπ π GAP + ϕy y GAP,\nwhere π e = π* = 2 percent, the FOMC’s inflation target.\nWhen the gaps are zero, a Taylor-type rule simply\nrecommends setting the policy rate equal to the value of r†\nplus the inflation target.\nBut what is the value of r†?\n\n3\n\n\fDecomposing r†\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nr† is often referred to as “the natural real rate of interest.”1\nOne way to think of it is to divide it into three factors:\nr† = λ + ψ + ξ, where\nλ: the labor productivity growth rate\nψ: the labor force growth rate\nξ: an investor desire for safe assets. A strong desire for\nsafe assets would imply a relatively large negative value\nfor ξ, whereas an ordinary desire for safe assets would\nimply a value closer to zero.\n\n1I\n\nuse the term r† instead of r* because r* has become associated with the New Keynesian model, whereas I make broader\nstructural model assumptions here.\n4\n\n\fWhy this decomposition of r†?\n•\n\nAssumptions:\no log preferences T-period OLG with no discounting\n\n•\n\n•\n\no fixed capital and no other frictions\n\nIn this type of model, if there was no special desire for safe\nassets, r† would equal the real output growth rate (also the\nconsumption growth rate), λ + ψ, along the balanced\ngrowth path.\nThis is one concept of a natural rate of interest.\n\n5\n\n\fLonger-run outcomes as regimes\n•\n•\n•\n\nThis conception of the natural real rate of interest suggests\nr† will have a constant mean associated with a single\npossible balanced growth path.\nThe point of this presentation is that this single mean may\nbe better modeled as shifting over time.\nShifting means can be modeled as regime-switching\nprocesses.\no For example, relatively long eras of high productivity\n\ngrowth may be followed by relatively long eras of low\nproductivity growth, and the natural rate of interest would be\ndifferent in the two regimes.\n\n6\n\n\fData\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nI use U.S. data from 1984 to the present.\nI construct an ex-post measure of r† by subtracting the\nDallas Fed trimmed-mean PCE inflation rate from the 1year Treasury rate.1\nThese raw data show a clear downward trend.\nMacroeconomic theory does not like this downward\ntrend—it wants a constant mean.\nCentral bank policy may influence this rate over short\nperiods of time, but not over the entire sample period.\n\n1Forward-looking\n\nmeasures, based on the FRB of Cleveland data, are similar but more volatile.\n7\n\n\fReal rate of return on short-term\ngovernment debt, r†\n\nSources: Federal Reserve Board, FRB of Dallas and author’s calculations. Last observation: September 2017.\n8\n\n\fThe declining trend is on government\npaper only, not on capital\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nThe chart shows a declining trend on an ex-post real return\nto holding government paper.\nThe declining trend does not appear to extend to ex-post\nreal returns on claims to capital as measured from the U.S.\nGDP accounts.\nThat return has been fairly constant since the 1980s, as\nshown in the next chart.\nThis provides a rationale for the inclusion of the ξ factor\nabove, which measures the desirability of holding safe\nassets relative to capital.1\n\nFor an alternative perspective on this issue, see J.C. Williams, “Three Questions on R-star,” FRB of San Francisco\nEconomic Letter No. 2017-05, Feb. 21, 2017.\n1\n\n9\n\n\fReal returns on capital and safe assets\n\nSources: P. Gomme, B. Ravikumar and P. Rupert. “Secular Stagnation and Returns on Capital,” FRB of St. Louis Economic\nSynopses No. 19, 2015; Federal Reserve Board, FRB of Dallas and author’s calculations. Last observation: 2017-Q3.\n10\n\n\fMain question\n•\n•\n\n•\n•\n\nWhich of the three factors is most important in accounting\nfor this downward trend? Is it productivity growth, labor\nforce growth or the desirability of safe assets?\nI will treat each of these three factors as following a twostate Markov-switching intercept process:\nxt = x(st) + εt , where εt is an i.i.d. error term\nst can take two values, high and low.\nThe two possible mean values are called “regimes.”\nThe idea is that these types of factors generally have\nconstant means, but that there can be infrequent shifts in\nmean. I want to characterize these shifts statistically.\n11\n\n\fLabor Productivity Growth\n\n12\n\n\fU.S. labor productivity growth has\nbeen low\n•\n•\n•\n\nA statistical model that estimates the probability that the\nU.S. economy is in a low-productivity-growth regime puts\nnearly all the probability on the low-growth regime.1\nThe most recent estimates from Kahn and Rich (2006) put\nthe growth rate in the low (high) state at 1.24 percent (2.94\npercent).2\nThe U.S. economy was in the high-productivity-growth\nregime from early 1997 to late 2004.\n\nSee J.A. Kahn and R.W. Rich, 2006, “Tracking Productivity in Real Time,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Current\nIssues in Economics and Finance, 12(8).\n2 In previous talks, I have used even lower productivity growth assumptions.\n1\n\n13\n\n\fThe high- and low-productivitygrowth regimes\n\nSources: Kahn and Rich (2006) and FRB of New York. Last observation: 2017-Q3.\n14\n\n\fLabor Force Growth\n\n15\n\n\fLabor force growth has been low\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nThe U.S. labor force had been growing at a 1.33 percent\nannual rate until the financial crisis.\nThe growth rate has been 0.46 percent since the financial\ncrisis.\nIt looks like the U.S. is in a low-growth state, but a case\ncould be made that some recent observations have been\nmore consistent with the high-growth state.\nI will consider both possibilities.\n\n16\n\n\fThe high- and low-labor-force-growth\nregimes\n\nSources: Bureau of Labor Statistics and author’s calculations. Last observation: October 2017.\n17\n\n\fInvestor Desire for Safe Assets\n\n18\n\n\fInvestor desire for safe assets\n•\n•\n•\n\nI now remove the regime-switching trends for both labor\nproductivity and labor force growth from the raw data on\nex-post safe real returns.\nThis leaves us with a time series of adjusted safe real\nreturns, and this series still has a downward trend.\nI then fit a two-state regime-switching process to these\nadjusted data, and I interpret the two states as a strong\ndesire for safe assets versus a more normal desire for safe\nassets.\n\n19\n\n\fThe normal- and\nhigh-desire-for-safe-assets regimes\n\nSource: Author’s calculations. Last observation: September 2017.\n20\n\n\fHigh-desire-for-safe-assets regime\n•\n•\n•\n\nThe estimated values for ξ are -3.01 percent in the highdesire-for-safe-assets regime and 0.64 percent in the\nnormal-desire-for-safe-assets regime.\nThe U.S. is currently in the regime with a high desire for\nsafe assets.\nThe difference between the two regimes is largest for this\nfactor; it is in some sense the “most important” of the\nthree.\n\n21\n\n\fCurrent regime: High desire for safe assets\n\nSource: Author’s calculations.

The max (min) natural rate is the value corresponding to all three factors taking\nthe value in the high (low) state.\n24\n\n\fUsing the regime-switching approach\n•\n•\n\n•\n•\n\nLabor productivity appears to be in the low-growth\nregime, so set λ = 1.24 percent.\nThe labor force appears to be in the low-growth regime as\nwell, so set ψ = 0.46 percent. Plausibly, labor force\ngrowth could be interpreted as switching to the highgrowth regime, ψ = 1.33 percent.\nThere also appears to be a high desire for safe assets, so set\nξ = -3.01 percent.\nAccording to this analysis, r† = λ + ψ + ξ is either -131\nbasis points or -44 basis points, depending on how one\nviews labor force growth.\n25\n\n\fRecent Related Estimates\nfrom the Literature\n\n26\n\n\fRelated literature and regime\nswitching\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nThere is a fairly large and growing literature trying to\nunderstand the downward trend in the natural rate of interest.\nThe literature tends to be quite a bit more sophisticated than\nthe analysis presented here.\nThe only point here is to think in terms of regime switching.\nTwo of the three factors analyzed, labor productivity growth\nand the desire for safe assets, are in the low state and do not\nappear to be shifting to the high state.\nThis suggests the natural rate of interest, and hence the Fed’s\npolicy rate, can remain low over the forecast horizon.\n\n27\n\n\fRelated literature on the natural rate\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nLaubach and Williams (2003) impose a structural model and\nestimate a low r* without a safe asset demand factor.1\nCurdia (2015) performs a similar analysis with somewhat\naltered assumptions and gets a very low r*.2\nDel Negro et al. (2017) impose a structural model, include an\nevolving demand for safe assets and get a low value for r*.3\nI have imposed less structure along with an alternative\nstochastic conception, regime switching. This suggests a\ndifferent view of mean-reversion properties.\n\n1 T.\n\nLaubach and J.C.

Taylor (1999) implies i ∈ [-14, 193].\n1.\n\n•\n•\n\nThe actual policy rate range today is 100 to 125 basis points,\nand the federal funds rate is trading at about 116 basis points.\nThis is within the range of the recommendations.\n\n35\n\n\fMean-reversion properties\n•\n•\n•\n\n•\n\nThe regime-switching approach suggests that the current\nsetting of the policy rate is appropriate.\nIt also suggests that r† is unlikely to shift over a forecast\nhorizon of two years (the typical time frame for monetary\npolicy decisions).\nThis suggests forward guidance should be characterized by\na relatively flat policy rate path, as opposed to an upwardsloping one that would be appropriate if one had a constant\nr† with strong mean reversion.\nThe median policy rate path in the Summary of Economic\nProjections (SEP) has had strong mean-reversion\nassumptions over the last several years.\n36\n\n\fThe FOMC policy rate projections\nversus reality\n\nSources: Federal Reserve Board and author’s calculations.
