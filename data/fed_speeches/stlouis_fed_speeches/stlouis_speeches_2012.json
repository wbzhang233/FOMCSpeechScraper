The event was\nheld during the annual meeting of the American Economic Association/Allied Social\nScience Associations.\nIn his remarks, Bullard discussed business cycle stabilization using scal rather than\nmonetary policy. The former attempts to react to aggregate shocks to the economy\nthrough changes in taxes and spending, while the latter reacts to aggregate shocks by\ntargeting the nominal interest rate or by in uencing in ation and in ation expectations\nthrough quantitative easing when the interest rate is at the zero lower bound.\nBullard noted that over the two decades leading up to the nancial crisis, the\nconventional wisdom concerning macroeconomic stabilization was that scal policy\nwas in fact not a good tool. Shorter-run stabilization issues should be handled by the\nmonetary authority while scal authorities should focus on a stable taxing and\nspending regime to achieve economic and political goals over the medium and long\nrun.\nIn late 2008, the Federal Open Market Committee set the policy rate at 0 to 25 basis\npoints, effectively at the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates. This led many to\nconclude, erroneously in Bullard’s view, that the burden for short-term macroeconomic\nstabilization had shifted to scal policy. Thus, the last three years have detoured from\nthe conventional wisdom.\nThere has been a very active literature on when the scal approach to business cycle\nstabilization would be useful and effective. Bullard cited a paper by Michael\nWoodford[1] in which Woodford notes that “while a case for aggressive scal stimulus\ncan be made under certain circumstances, such policy must be designed with care if it\nis to have the desired effect.” The literature assumes that monetary business cycle\nstabilization policy is ineffective once the zero lower bound is encountered. In addition,\nthe types of policy experiments considered in this literature involve extra government\nspending and taxation only during the period when the zero bound is a binding\nconstraint and nancial markets are in considerable turmoil.\nGiven current conditions, Bullard pointed out three caveats related to the assumptions\nin Woodford’s paper:\n\n\f1. The political process is ill-suited to make the types of timely and subtle decisions\nthat are called for based on the literature.\n2. Bullard emphasized that, in fact, “monetary policy has been quite effective, even\nwhile the policy rate has been at the zero lower bound.” Thus, he said, “it is not\nnecessary or desirable to turn to scal stabilization policy.”\n3. While the literature says that taxes should be collected simultaneously with the\nincrease in government spending, the actual policy for many countries involved\nheavy reliance on government borrowing. Increased debt would be interpreted in\nthe literature as delayed taxes.\nBullard also discussed issues related to debt sustainability and argued that low interest\nrates may not be a good indicator of the probability of a debt crisis.\nBullard concluded that “the turn toward scal approaches to stabilization policy has run\nits course, and that the conventional wisdom that existed in the decades prior to 2007\nis being re-established in the U.S.” Therefore, “stabilization policy should be left to the\nmonetary authority, which can operate effectively even at the zero lower bound,” Bullard\nsaid. And, scal authorities should set the tax and spending programs in a way that\nmakes economic and political sense for the medium to longer term. In particular, “a\nstable tax code aligned with a stable plan of government spending would allow\nbusinesses and households to plan for the future in the most effective way,” Bullard\nnoted.\n[1] Woodford, M. 2011 “Simple Analytics of the Government Expenditure Multiplier.”\nAmerican Economic Journal: Macroeconomics 3: 1-35.\n\nGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\nCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\nEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\nOn the Economy Blog\nOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\nLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\nBridges\nEconomic Synopses\n\n\fHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.

        "content": "Death of a Theory\nExecutive Summary\nIn this article, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard discusses business cycle\nstabilization using fiscal rather than monetary policy. He concludes that the turn in recent years toward\nfiscal approaches to stabilization policy has run its course and that the conventional wisdom of the past\nseveral decades is reasserting itself. In short, the conventional wisdom says that stabilization is the realm\nof monetary policy and that fiscal policy should focus on medium- and longer-run goals.\nMacroeconomic stabilization policy means reacting in a timely manner to aggregate shocks that hit the\neconomy and in a way that smoothes out an otherwise rocky ride for the economy’s businesses and\nhouseholds. Fiscal policy attempts to do this through changes in taxes and government spending, and\nmonetary policy attempts to do this by targeting the nominal interest rate or, when the interest rate is near\nzero, by influencing inflation and inflation expectations primarily through quantitative easing.\nBullard notes that over the two decades leading up to the financial crisis, the conventional wisdom was\nthat fiscal policy was not a good tool for macroeconomic stabilization. Conventional wisdom suggested\nthat shorter-run stabilization issues should be handled by the monetary authority and that fiscal authorities\nshould focus on a stable taxing and spending regime to achieve economic and political goals over the\nmedium and longer run. This state of affairs lasted, broadly speaking, until the fall of 2008.\nAt that point, the short-term nominal interest rate targeted by the Federal Open Market Committee was\npushed nearly to zero, where it remains to this day. This led many to conclude that the burden for shortterm macroeconomic stabilization had, as a result, shifted to fiscal policy. Indeed, over the past three\nyears, we have seen numerous attempts at stabilization policy by fiscal authorities in the U.S. and around\nthe globe. Bullard argues that the net effect of these attempts has been to confirm much of the\nconventional wisdom regarding fiscal stabilization policy that existed prior to the financial crisis.\nMuch research has been published on when the fiscal approach to business cycle stabilization would be\nuseful and effective. Bullard cites a paper by Michael Woodford 1 in which Woodford notes that “while a\ncase for aggressive fiscal stimulus can be made under certain circumstances, such policy must be\ndesigned with care if it is to have the desired effect.” This line of research assumes that monetary\nbusiness cycle stabilization policy is ineffective and unable to influence real interest rates once the policy\nrate is near zero. In addition, the types of policy experiments considered in this research involve extra\ngovernment spending and taxation only during the period when the policy rate is near zero and financial\nmarkets are in considerable turmoil, and not any longer than that.\nThree key issues related to the assumptions in Woodford’s paper lead Bullard to doubt the merits of\npossible fiscal stabilization programs for the present circumstances. These three issues are:\n1. The types of fiscal policy interventions recommended in the research are fairly intricate and must\nbe designed carefully if they are to have the desired effect. However, the conventional wisdom\non fiscal stabilization policy emphasizes that political processes in the U.S. and elsewhere are not\nwell-suited to make timely and subtle decisions like these.\n\n1\n\nMichael Woodford, 2011. “Simple Analytics of the Government Expenditure Multiplier.” American Economic\nJournal: Macroeconomics 3: 1-35.\n\n\f2. Bullard emphasizes that monetary stabilization policy has been quite effective, even while the\npolicy rate has been near zero. This is because the monetary policy authority can use many other\ntools to influence inflation and inflation expectations. Thus, a turn toward fiscal stabilization\npolicy is not necessary.\n3. Although the research says that taxes should be collected simultaneously with the increase in\ngovernment spending, the actual fiscal stabilization policy for many countries has involved heavy\nreliance on government borrowing. This increased debt would be interpreted as promised future\ntaxes. However, shifting the taxes into the future can undo most or all of the benefits that might\notherwise come from the fiscal stabilization program.\nIn light of increased debt in the West, Bullard discusses issues related to debt sustainability. According to\nresearch on the topic, “too much debt” for a sovereign nation will be defined by the point where the\ntemporary benefits of default exactly offset the value of continued access to international credit markets.\nThe research says markets will understand the incentive to default and, thus, will not lend to a nation\nbeyond this point. Bullard argues that debt yields alone are not the best way to evaluate whether a nation\nis borrowing too much; that is, low interest rates may not be a good indicator of the probability of a debt\ncrisis. A look at the data for selected European countries, such as Greece and Portugal, from 2000 to the\npresent confirms this.\nBullard concludes that the conventional wisdom on stabilization policy is being re-established in the U.S.\nStabilization policy should be left to the monetary authority, which can operate effectively even with a\nnear-zero policy rate. Fiscal authorities should set the tax and spending programs in a way that makes\neconomic and political sense for the medium to longer term. In particular, a stable tax code that is aligned\nwith a stable plan of government spending would allow businesses and households to plan for the future\nin the most effective way.\n\n\f",

        "content": "Inflation Targeting in the USA 1\nUnion League Club of Chicago, Breakfast@65West\nChicago, Ill.\nFeb. 6, 2012\n\nThe FOMC Sets an Inflation Target\nAt the January meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) took an important step\nforward by naming an explicit, numerical inflation target for the U.S. of 2 percent, as measured\nby the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index. In taking this action, the Federal\nReserve has joined many central banks around the world that have set explicit inflation targets\nover the past two decades. This step has been a goal of Chairman Bernanke’s since he joined\nthe Fed nearly a decade ago. I want to congratulate the Chairman on this accomplishment,\nwhich I believe will serve the nation well for years to come.\nIn a targeting context, inflation means headline inflation. It does not make sense to ignore\nsome inconveniently volatile prices, like those for gas or food, when discussing the inflation rate\nactually faced by U.S. households. 2 By the headline PCE measure, U.S. inflation is running\nsomewhat above target right now, at 2.4 percent measured from one year ago. This rate has\nbeen moderating in recent reports. Inflation is up sharply when compared with the autumn of\n2010, when PCE inflation measured from one year earlier hit a low of about 1.2 percent. We\nare double that rate right now.\nInflation targeting emphasizes control over inflation as the key long-term goal of monetary\npolicy. This makes sense because the central bank can only influence inflation and not any real\nmacroeconomic variable in the long run. As is well known, the actions of the FOMC can also\ntemporarily influence the direction of the economy in the short run, but only temporarily. This\ninfluence can be used to help mitigate short-run gyrations in economic activity, thus smoothing\nout an otherwise bumpy ride for U.S. households and businesses. This is often described as\nmonetary stabilization policy. The amount of smoothing that can actually be accomplished\nthrough this channel is meaningful, but not particularly large, a fact which is often lost in\n1\n\nAny opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of others on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee. I thank my staff for helpful comments, including Riccardo DiCecio, Cletus Coughlin, Karen\nBranding, Chris Waller, Dan Thornton and Marcela Williams.\n2\nFor more on this theme, see James Bullard, “Measuring Inflation: The Core is Rotten,” Federal Reserve Bank of St.\nLouis Review, July/August 2011, 93(4), pp. 223-233.\n\n\fcontemporary discussions. Putting an explicit inflation target together with a sensible\nstabilization policy is often called flexible inflation targeting. This is the policy that has been\nadopted by the FOMC and that follows the practice of many other central banks around the\nworld during the last twenty years.\nFlexible inflation targeting enables central banks to conduct a stabilization program and make it\nas effective as it can be made without departing from the longer-run goal of keeping inflation\nlow and stable. This reflects a conventional wisdom borne of the 1970s, namely, that allowing\ninflation to rise and accelerate not only is not helpful for the macroeconomy, but is actually\nvery damaging. During the 1970s, U.S. inflation eventually rose to double-digit levels, and this\nwas accompanied by especially poor macroeconomic performance on the real side of the\neconomy. The lesson for U.S. policymakers and many others around the world has been that\nhigh inflation just causes problems and does nothing to help address fundamental\nmacroeconomic issues.\nTo run the flexible inflation targeting program, one needs a concept of where the economy\nwould ideally be operating versus where it is actually operating. This leads us to the topic of\noutput gaps.\n\nOutput Gaps: The Wrong Idea\nThe recent recession has given rise to the idea that there is a very large “output gap” in the U.S.\nThe story is that this large output gap is “keeping inflation at bay” and is fodder for keeping\nnominal interest rates near zero into an indefinite future. If we continue using this\ninterpretation of events, it may be very difficult for the U.S. to ever move off of the zero lower\nbound on nominal interest rates. This could be a looming disaster for the United States. I want\nto now turn to argue that the large output gap view may be conceptually inappropriate in the\ncurrent situation. We may do better to replace it with the notion of a permanent, one-time\nshock to wealth.\nThe key to the large output gap story is the use of the fourth quarter of 2007 as a benchmark\nfor where we expect the economy to be today. The idea is to take that level of real output,\nassume the real GDP growth rate that prevailed in the years prior to 2007, and project out\nwhere the “potential” output of the U.S. should be. By that type of calculation, we are indeed\nstunningly far below where we should be, perhaps 5.5 percent below, using data through the\n\n\ffourth quarter of 2011.3 What is more, we have made little progress in closing the gap defined\nin this way, because real GDP has only grown at modest rates since the recession ended in the\nsummer of 2009. And furthermore, using current GDP forecasts from, say, the Blue Chip\nconsensus, we have little prospect for closing the gap any time soon.\nIs this really the right way to think about where the U.S. economy should be? I do not think it is\na defensible point of view. Let me give you some of my perspectives.\nMost analysts seem to agree that the middle part of the 2000s was characterized by a “bubble”\nin the housing sector. Housing prices were high and rising fast compared to nominal GDP. It is\nnot prudent to extrapolate a bubble into the indefinite future and claim that such a calculation\nprovides a good benchmark. Yet, that is what we are doing when we extrapolate fourth quarter\n2007 real GDP. Furthermore, we normally have the good sense not to do this in other\neconomic situations.\nThink about the tech bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s. The NASDAQ index peaked at\nabout 4800 on a monthly average basis in March 2000. In the month just passed, January 2012,\nit averaged about 2744, which is 57 percent of its peak value. In fact, with the type of\ncalculation usually done for real GDP, which extrapolates growth rates, the NASDAQ would be\nmiles below its “potential.” Of course, most observers and market participants do not say that\nthe NASDAQ is far below its potential value today. Instead, most say that there was clearly a\nbubble in the NASDAQ during the late 1990s and early 2000s, and that today’s valuations are\nmore sensible than the ones that were in vogue during the bubble period.\nWhen I put the case this starkly, I think many would agree that establishing a benchmark by\nextrapolating from the previous peak of a variable, when that variable was clearly influenced by\na bubble, is a mistake. It gives a distorted view of the situation.\n\nA Level Shock\nA better interpretation of the behavior of U.S. real GDP over the last five years may be that the\neconomy was disrupted by a permanent, one-time shock to wealth. 4 In particular, the\nperceived value of U.S. real estate fell substantially with the 30 percent decline in housing\n3\n\nThis value can be calculated based on the Congressional Budget Office potential output series.\nMacroeconomists like me often use the word “permanent,’’ even though nothing is really permanent. Think of\npermanent as “exceptionally persistent.”\n\n4\n\n\fprices after 2006. This shaved trillions of dollars off of the wealth of the nation. Since housing\nprices are not expected to rebound to the previous peak anytime soon, that wealth is simply\ngone for now. This has lowered consumption and output, and lower levels of production have\ncaused a significant disruption in U.S. labor markets.\nSo what’s the point, you ask? Well, to me, the important difference is what happens after the\nshock.\nFor those who take the “large output gap” view, the expectation is for real GDP to grow rapidly\nafter the recession comes to an end, as the economy catches up to its potential. It is like a\nrubber band, there is supposed to be a bounce back period of rapid growth. In fact, most\nanalysts have been looking for exactly this effect since the summer of 2009. It has not\nhappened. This has led to a lot of analysis concerning special factors and headwinds that might\nbe inhibiting the “bounce back” effect.\nThe wealth shock view puts a different expectation in play. The negative wealth shock lowers\nconsumption and output. But after the recession ends, the economy simply grows from that\npoint at an ordinary rate, neither faster nor slower than in ordinary times. It is more like an\nearthquake which has left one part of the land higher than another part. There is no\nexpectation of a “bounce back” to a higher level of output after the recession ends. This is\ncloser to what has actually happened since mid-2009. Output has grown at a moderate rate,\nbut not a rapid rate, since the recession ended.\nIn the wealth shock view, there is no “large output gap” rationale for keeping interest rates\nnear zero. There is only an economy growing at normal rates following a large shock to wealth.\nI mentioned that a wealth shock significantly upsets labor market relationships. This is because\noutput declines, so less labor is required. It takes a long time for those displaced by the shock\nto find new working relationships. I would expect to see high unemployment and only slow\nimprovement in labor markets following the wealth shock.\nOne might say that the peak in U.S. housing prices represented an overvaluation, and in my\nview, that would be right. Valuing the physical capital stock of the nation is always a tricky\nproposition. The entire stock, on the order of three times GDP, or $45 trillion, cannot\nmeaningfully be marketed all at once. Still, we do observe bits and pieces of the physical\ncapital stock being bought and sold at any point in time, and those prices can help us notionally\nvalue the entire portfolio. Those prices of bits and pieces could be driven by beliefs alone—\nsuch as the belief that housing prices only go up—and become temporarily detached from\n\n\ffundamental supply and demand factors. This may make it appear that real estate is worth\nmore than it really is, and lead many to make what in retrospect are poor economic decisions,\nsuch as taking on too much debt and consuming too much.\nMany prices in the economy may at times seem to be far away from anything that could be\nrationalized purely by supply and demand. But housing prices are special in that they represent\nvaluations on a significant fraction of the wealth of the nation, defined as the value of the\nphysical capital stock. To have those prices fall hard and stay down without much prospect for\nrapid recovery is a one-time, permanent wealth shock. This is a different type of shock than the\nones that have caused previous postwar U.S. recessions.\n\nThe Costs of Near-Zero Rates\nI have argued that the large output gap view may be keeping us all prisoner—tethering our\nexpectations for output, in effect, to the collapsed bubble in housing. It is setting a very high\nbar for the U.S. economy, one that may not be appropriate given the nature of the shock that\nthe economy has suffered. Importantly, it may influence the FOMC’s near-zero rate policy far\ninto the future, since output is continually viewed as falling short of the high-bar benchmark.\nBut the near-zero rate policy has its own costs. If we were proposing to remain near-zero for a\nfew quarters, or even a year or two, one might argue that such a policy matches up well with\nthe short-term business cycle dynamics of the U.S. economy. But a near-zero rate policy\nstretching over many years can begin to distort fundamental decision-making in the economy in\nways that may be destructive to longer-run economic growth.\nIn particular, the lengthy near-zero rate policy punishes savers in the economy. Because of life\ncycle effects, most of the asset holding in the economy is done by older Americans. Recent\nreadings from the TIPS market suggest a 10-year real rate of return of minus 30 basis points or\nso, and a five-year real rate of return of about minus 120 basis points. These are extraordinarily\nlow—substantially negative—real rates of return over very long time scales, and they are driven\nin part by FOMC policy.\nThese low rates of return mean that some of the consumption that would otherwise be enjoyed\nby the older, asset-holding households has been pared back. In principle, the low real interest\nrates should encourage younger generations to borrow against their future income prospects\nand consume more today. However, this demographic group faces high unemployment rates\n\n\fand tighter borrowing constraints, which may limit its ability and willingness to leverage up to\nfinance consumption. Consequently, the consumption of the older generations may be\ndamaged by the low real interest rates without any countervailing increase in consumption by\nother households in the economy. In this sense, the policy could be counterproductive.\nAgain, these broader effects of a low real interest rate policy might not be so critical in an\nenvironment where the low yields last for a few quarters, but they may be significantly more\nimportant as the length of time is stretched out over many years.\n\nConclusion\nThe FOMC has adopted an explicit, numerical inflation target. This is an important\ndevelopment, as it may prevent the U.S. from repeating the mistakes of the 1970s, in which a\nmisreading of the size of the output gap led the Fed to maintain easy monetary policies for far\ntoo long.\nInflation targeting in the U.S. will be flexible, matching a desire to keep inflation low and stable\nin the long run with the challenge of providing some business cycle stabilization in the shorter\nterm. One of the key issues in stabilization policy is the benchmark against which economic\nperformance is measured.\nI have argued that the “large output gap” benchmark, in which current economic performance\nis continually compared to the bubble-influenced mid-2000s, may not be realistic. Instead, one\nmay want to interpret the recent U.S. experience as a one-time, permanent shock to wealth.\n\nJames Bullard, President and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\n\f",

The paper is part of\nthe 2012 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum.\n\n*\n\nThis version: 23 February 2012. I appreciate helpful comments from the St. Louis Fed research\nstaff, especially Bill Emmons, Carlos Garriga, and Rajdeep Sengupta. Any views expressed are\nmy own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n\f1\n\nTwo trend lines\n\nI am pleased to be here at the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum to comment on\nthis very nice paper by Michael Feroli, Ethan Harris, Amir Su…, and Ken\nWest. It represents the best of what this Forum is about. In particular, it\nbrings together judgments from academia, the private sector, and the policy\nworld to better inform all of us on a key issue. I certainly learned a lot from\nthis paper and I recommend it to all of you if you have not already read it.\nLet me …rst lay out a big picture issue as I see it and then turn to a few\nmore speci…c comments on the paper.\nIt has become commonplace in the past several years to refer to the mid2000s as a real estate price “bubble” that has burst.1 This metaphor is, in\nfact, so commonplace that it has ceased to be controversial. In this paper,\nfor instance, the authors lament (p. 14), “What started as a localized bubble\nand bust has been transformed into a national problem.”Housing prices now\nseem to have been far too high in the middle part of the past decade, driven\nin large part by the widespread belief that “house prices never fall.”\nIf households and businesses had viewed the high prices as mere noise,\nand therefore not changed their economic decision making very much, the\nfall in housing prices would not have been such a critical event. But that is\nnot what happened.\nInstead, the high real estate prices were taken very seriously. Households consumed more and borrowed more than they otherwise would have;\ndevelopers built homes at an aggressive pace; Wall Street developed new\n…nancially engineered products to feed the boom; and ancillary industries\nthrived. When house prices fell by 30 percent and remained low, the widespread belief that “house prices never fall” was shattered. Households were\nleft with debt levels much higher than they intended to take on, housing con1\n\nFor economists, I prefer the language “sunspot” equilibrium to refer to a sustainable,\nmarket-clearing situation in which the real allocation of resources is driven by beliefs\nalone. In the macroeconomics literature, “bubble” equilibria are often socially desirable,\nas for instance in much of monetary theory, while “sunspot” equilibria are often socially\nundesirable, as they involve excess volatility. However, in common parlance the bubble\nlanguage overwhelms all attempts at distinctions.\n\n1\n\n\fFigure 1: Decomposing Real GDP.\nstruction fell dramatically, Wall Street was nearly destroyed, and abetting\nindustries had to scale back aggressively. The size of the shock severely disrupted labor market relationships, pushing unemployment to exceptionally\nhigh levels. It takes a long time for those displaced by the shock to …nd new\nworking relationships.\nThe belief that drove the bubble cannot be reconstituted, and therefore\nwe say that the bubble has collapsed.2 It is neither feasible nor desirable to\nrein‡ate such a damaging bubble. The authors explicitly (p. 13) “... make\nno presumption that it would be socially optimal to have a booming housing\nmarket” and state that “... we expect ... and probably want ... relatively\nlow investment post-boom.”\nA simple way to view what is at stake is to consider Figure 1, which simply\nplots two decompositions of real GDP.3 On the left hand side is a linear trend\n2\n3\n\nSee also Bullard (2012a, 2012b).\nFor additional discussion, see Thoma (2012).\n\n2\n\n\fcomputed from 1947 to the present, and on the right hand side is a HodrickPrescott (HP) …lter computed over the same time period.4 In order to see\nthe implications for recent GDP movements, only the past ten years are\nplotted here. On the left, the current level of GDP is far below trend. On\nthe right, the current level of GDP is at or even above the trend line. Both\ntrend lines are atheoretical, statistical constructs: At best, they can give us\nonly a rough notion of where we think the macroeconomy should be if it\nwas behaving normally. Still, the policy messages are very di¤erent from the\ntwo graphs. Pictures like the one on the left suggest that, three-and-a-half\nyears after Lehman-AIG, we remain in crisis mode. Actual output is far from\nnormal, and we must maintain emergency measures into the distant future.\nPictures like the one on the right give a di¤erent message. They suggest\nthat the business cycle adjustment dynamics are already complete. While\nthe current level of output is unsatisfactory, it is because of the trend, not\nbecause of inadequate business cycle adjustment. Policy should be focused\non improving the trend line, because attempts to push the economy “back\nto trend” through conventional business cycle stabilization policies will not\nbe very e¤ective.\nBecause the HP …lter is atheoretical, it cannot really substitute for a\ncareful theory that can tell us how to decompose trend from cycle.5 But\nthe …lter does attempt to isolate business cycle frequency movements in key\nmacroeconomic variables. If the adjustment is taking a long time, the …lter\nascribes more and more of the data movement to the trend component.\nI interpret much of the analysis in the current paper as consistent with\nthe second view. The authors describe a variety of evidence consistent with\na collapsed real estate bubble. They provide estimates that suggest that the\nactual stock of housing may be much larger than the desired stock. They\n4\n\nThe smoothing parameter for the HP …lter was set to 1; 600.\nNew Keynesian theory as described by Woodford (2003) is an example of a theory\nthat provides such a decomposition. In that theory, the gap that matters for monetary\npolicy is the distance between actual output under sticky prices and the ‡exible price level\nof output. The ‡exible price level of output would ‡uctuate continuously in response to\nshocks hitting the economy.\n5\n\n3\n\n\fdescribe an economy that is not returning to a simple trend line with the\nvigor that might have been expected given past experience. They give good\nexplanations as to why this has happened. And they describe additional\nadjustment processes that are likely to take years to unfold. All of this\nsounds like medium- and long-term adjustment as described by the HP trend\nin Figure 1.\n\n2\n\nThe state of the economy and the housing\nmarket\n\nOne of the more striking …gures presented in the paper is Chart 6, which\ndescribes real household debt. The chart (see Figure 2) shows that, unlike\nall other recovery periods, this one has been marked by a reduction in real\nhousehold levels of indebtedness. This is commonly called deleveraging, and\nit makes sense since the bubble story describes a household sector that borrowed too much based on an optimistic assessment of future house prices.\nOne of the fundamental tensions in current U.S. macroeconomic policy is the\ntendency to push against the need to reduce household debt levels. I believe\nthat this is because we— collectively as economists and policymakers— are not\nused to recessions in which debt levels were too high. It has never happened\nbefore according to the chart. Consequently, we get seemingly paradoxical\npolicy. Monetary policy has kept interest rates low to encourage borrowing—\nin the context of an economy with too much borrowing. Fiscal policy has\nloaded on debt— in e¤ect borrowing on behalf of households who are already\noverindebted.\nChart 9 in the paper (Figure 3 here) shows the developments in multifamily versus single family housing starts. This will surely continue to be\none of the key stories in housing during the coming years. My sense is that\nthe housing debacle of the past …ve years may have scared o¤ a generation\nof potential homeowners. The current cohorts of new home buyers likely\nsee homeownership as a fundamentally riskier proposition than earlier cohorts and therefore may be far more likely to rent rather than own. It seems\n4\n\n\fFigure 2: Real Household Debt.\nChart 6 in Feroli et al. (2012).\n\n5\n\n\fFigure 3: Housing starts, single-family and multifamily.\nChart 9 in Feroli et al. (2012).\n\npossible to write down models that would predict such a shift in the wake\nof a crisis that revealed a far riskier price landscape than previously understood. Such a theory might suggest a more permanent shift to renting than\ndescribed in this paper.\nAs for the ugly part of the housing situation, Figure 4 provides an additional perspective.6 According to estimates by my sta¤, there are about\n75.3 million homeowners in the U.S. as of the third quarter of 2011. About\ntwo-thirds of these, 49.4 million, had some mortgage debt outstanding on the\nhouse. These households collectively had $712 billion of equity to support\n$9,882 billion of mortgage debt as of the third quarter of 2011. Figure 4\nshows the average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio from 1970 to the present. The\nLTV averaged 58.4 percent between 1970 and 2005, but shot up to 90 percent\nduring the crisis and has remained there. This picture makes it particularly\nclear that homeowners were borrowing during the bubble phase not expecting house prices to fall appreciably. If we think of the 58.4 percent LTV as\nbeing the desired steady state, homeowners would have to pay down mort6\n\nThese estimates are due to Bill Emmons at the St. Louis Fed.\n\n6\n\n\fFigure 4: Estimated average loan-to-value ratio of mortgaged homeowners.\nLatest data point: Q3.2011.\n\ngage debt collectively by $3,695 billion, about one-quarter of one year’s GDP.\nAs the authors suggest via other means, it will take a long time to get back\nto that type of steady-state situation. Figure 4 shows just how badly households have been knocked o¤ of their historical norms. This picture suggests\na persistent shift, not simply an ordinary business cycle dynamic around an\nunchanged trend line.\n\n3\n\nHousing and monetary transmission\n\nThe authors argue that monetary policy is less e¤ective in the current situation than it might otherwise be. Their argument is based on the idea\nthat borrowing constraints play an important role in the economy and that\n‡uctuating housing valuations alter collateral constraints. Monetary policy\ncan have e¤ects on agents in the economy that are not constrained, but it\nwill have more di¢ culty reaching— or may not be able to reach at all— those\nhouseholds that are sharply constrained. This is an interesting hypothesis\n7\n\n\fbecause of a subtle di¤erence from earlier arguments concerning monetary\npolicy impotence. Earlier arguments sometimes emphasized the idea that\nonce the central bank encounters the zero lower bound, its ability to a¤ect\ninterest rates is lost. However, QE has generally been viewed as e¤ective\nboth in the U.S. and abroad during the past several years, and the authors\npost no quibble with the ability of the central bank to continue to drive real\ninterest rates lower through unconventional policy actions. Indeed, according\nto the TIPS market, the real yield on 5-year securities is about minus 110\nbasis points, and the real yield on 10-year securities is about minus 25 basis\npoints. These are exceptionally low yields over very long time horizons.7\nThe authors instead argue that, while the central bank can in‡uence\nyields, those that can respond to the lower yields have done so already and\nthose that cannot will not be in‡uenced by further policy actions because\nthey are backed up against sharply binding collateral constraints. I think\nthis is an interesting and plausible hypothesis.\nWealth e¤ects could in‡uence the economy not only through collateral\nconstraints but also through distributional e¤ects. I want to mention one paper that has tried to quantify the consequences of severe declines in housing\nand other asset values of the magnitude observed during 2008-2009 across\nage cohorts in the economy.8 The paper is by Andrew Glover, Jonathan\nHeathcote, Dirk Krueger, and Víctor Ríos-Rull, and is entitled “Intergenerational Redistribution and the Great Recession.” The basic idea is to use a\ncalibrated stochastic general equilibrium overlapping generations model to\nquantify the e¤ects. In the model, as in the data, asset-holders tend to\nbe older and su¤er greatly when the shock disrupts the economy. Younger\nhouseholds bene…t from the lower prices of assets, including housing assets,\nbut this e¤ect is largely swamped by the e¤ects on the older households.\nAccording to the paper, a recession of the magnitude observed during 20082009 is nearly welfare-neutral for the younger generations, but causes a large\n7\n\nFor more on the e¤ectiveness of quantitative easing, see the papers from the St. Louis\nFed conference, “Quantitative Easing,” June 30, 2011, available at the St. Louis Fed web\nsite: http://research.stlouisfed.org/conferences/qe/.\n8\nSee Glover et al. (2011).\n\n8\n\n\fwelfare loss for older generations, equivalent to about 10% of consumption\nfor households over 70. This paper suggests that distributional consequences\nare probably more important than commonly appreciated.\nFeroli et al. (2012) present fascinating evidence from U.S. states to get\nat the idea that areas with more intense housing busts also face problems\nthat inhibit a rebound in economic activity (e.g., see Figure 5). I found this\nevidence very interesting and informative. It seems clear that the states with\nthe largest house price declines are also the states with the slowest recoveries.\nIn the earlier stages of the housing debacle, regionalism in house prices was\nwidely cited in a sort of virtuous way. Former Chairman Greenspan, for instance, at one point described certain housing markets as “frothy.”But now,\nwith the data in hand, the authors are able to demonstrate with much more\nclarity the di¤ering impact of the housing bubble collapse across locations.\n\n4\n\nSummary\n\nThe bottom line of the paper is in some ways unsurprising: The situation in\nU.S. housing markets represents a quantitatively signi…cant headwind. Still,\nI think the paper provides one of the better statements that I have seen\ndescribing the nature of the likely problems and the magnitudes involved.\nThe authors counsel that improvement is likely to be very slow and that, in\nany case, there is no presumption that a booming housing market would be\ndesirable in the aftermath of the collapse of the bubble. The desired physical\nhousing stock is lower than the actual stock, according to the estimates in\nthe paper, and likely by a substantial margin. Taken literally, this means\nthat households would like to reduce square footage and remove amenities in\nexchange for lower levels of debt. The only realistic way for that to happen\nis to allow the natural depreciation in the housing capital stock to catch up\nwith household desires. Unfortunately, that is a long process.\nThank-you for listening and thanks for the opportunity to comment on\nthis interesting paper.\n\n9\n\n\fFigure 5: Auto sales for high and low credit quality within large and small\nhouse price decline states.\nChart 22 in Feroli et al.

However, he said, “It is neither feasible nor\ndesirable to attempt to re-in ate the U.S. housing bubble of the mid-2000s.”\nConcerning the Fed’s new monetary policy tools, Bullard said that “increases in the size\nof the balance sheet entail additional in ationary risks if accommodation is not\nremoved at an appropriate pace.” He also discussed the Fed’s communications tool\nand the idea of tying a promise of near-zero policy rates to a numerical unemployment\noutcome. The communications tool may have credibility problems, he said, and “a noncredible announcement would simply be unhelpful.”\nIn ation Targeting in the U.S.\nIn a targeting context, in ation refers to headline (rather than core) in ation, Bullard\nsaid. The headline PCE price index is targeted, he explained, because “it does not make\nsense to ignore some inconveniently volatile prices, like those for gasoline and food”\n(as is the case with core in ation). He noted that while headline PCE in ation\nmeasured from one year ago is somewhat above the 2 percent target, it has been\ndeclining recently.\nWhile control over in ation is the key long-term monetary policy goal, “the actions of\nthe FOMC can also temporarily in uence the direction of the economy in the short run,”\nBullard said. The latter can help smooth macroeconomic uctuations and is called\nmonetary stabilization policy, he explained.\nThe FOMC has adopted a exible in ation targeting policy, which combines an in ation\ntarget with a sensible stabilization policy, Bullard stated. “Flexible in ation targeting\n\n\fenables a central bank to conduct stabilization policy without compromising the longerrun goal of keeping in ation low and stable,” he added. The lesson learned from the\n1970s experience, when double-digit in ation was accompanied by poor\nmacroeconomic performance, was that “allowing high in ation just causes problems\nand does nothing to address fundamental macroeconomic issues,” he said. 1\nBrighter Prospects for the U.S. in 2012\nBullard noted that last August, forecasters marked up the probability of a U.S. recession\noccurring in the second half of 2011. He attributed most of this to the July 29 gross\ndomestic product (GDP) report, which included downward revisions to GDP data. While\nthe debt ceiling debate and the European sovereign debt crisis lowered consumer and\nbusiness con dence, household and business behavior did not change enough to\nvalidate the recession predictions, he said.\nBullard explained that while U.S. households remain nervous about the European\nsituation, Europe is generally viewed as too distant to force a major change in\nhouseholds’ behavior. “So, despite drops in con dence last summer, hard data on the\nU.S. economy continued to show moderate growth,” he said, adding that household\ncon dence has increased since then.\nRegarding Europe, Bullard noted that the European Central Bank offered three-year\nre nancing at low rates on broadened collateral in December and recently offered a\nsecond tranche, worth about $713 billion. “At least for now, this has calmed European\nmarkets relative to last fall,” he stated.\nU.S. Housing Markets\nIn discussing the collapsed housing bubble, Bullard noted that most components of\nU.S. GDP – except for the components of investment related to real estate – have\nrecovered to their levels in the fourth quarter of 2007. “It is therefore not reasonable to\nclaim that the ‘output gap’ is exceptionally large,” he said.\nBullard also stated that it is not feasible or desirable to attempt to re-in ate the bubble.\nFor instance, he said, “the crisis has likely scared off a cohort of potential homeowners,\nwho now see homeownership as a much riskier proposition than renting.” The crisis\nhas also left U.S. households with more debt than they had intended, he said, adding\nthat “this is the rst U.S. recession in which deleveraging has played a key role.”\nOn the topic of too much debt, he noted that U.S. homeowners have about $9.9 trillion\nin mortgage debt outstanding against $712 billion of equity. According to Bullard,\nhouseholds would have to pay down this debt by about $3.7 trillion to return to a\nnormal loan-to-value ratio of 58.4 percent, assuming a normal ratio based on the\naverage LTV ratio from 1970-2005. The amount is roughly equal to one-quarter of one\nyear’s GDP. “This will take a long time,” he said. “It is not a matter of business cycle\nfrequency adjustment.”\nMonetary Policy Tools\nRegarding asset purchases, Bullard said that increases in the size of the Fed’s balance\nsheet entail additional in ationary risks if accommodation is not removed at an\nappropriate pace. He noted that in ation and in ation expectations rose during the\npast year and a half, despite many measures of economic performance indicating a\nrelatively weak U.S. economy.\nWhile the FOMC could use the promised date of the rst interest rate increase – the\ncommunications tool – as the primary policy tool during the upcoming period of nearzero policy rates should further monetary accommodation be necessary, Bullard said\nthis tool has some important caveats. For example, he said it is not clear how credible\nthe actual announcements would be. “If the economy is performing well at the point in\n\n\fthe future where the promise begins to bite, then the Committee may simply abandon\nthe promise and return to normal policy,” he said. “But this behavior, if understood by\nmarkets, would cancel out the initial effects of the promise, and so nothing would be\naccomplished by making the initial promise.”\nAnother policy option would be for the FOMC to tie a promise of near-zero policy rates\nto actual economic outcomes, such as a numerical unemployment outcome, Bullard\nsaid. However, he noted that most proposals for using this tool tie monetary policy to\nan actual unemployment rate and an anticipated in ation rate. “This asymmetry is hard\nto justify,” he stated.\nFurthermore, “unemployment rates have a checkered history in advanced economies\nover the last several decades,” Bullard said. He cited the example of Europe, where\nunemployment rose and has simply remained high during the past 30 years. “If such an\noutcome happened in the U.S. and monetary policy was tied to a numerical\nunemployment outcome, monetary policy could be pulled off course for a generation,”\nhe added.\nBullard noted that labor market policies (e.g., unemployment insurance, worker\nretraining) have direct effects on the unemployed. In contrast, he said, “monetary policy\nis a blunt instrument which affects the decision-making of everyone in the economy.”\nIn particular, low interest rates hurt savers, he stated. “It may be better to focus on\nlabor market policies to address unemployment instead of monetary policy.”\n###\n1\n\nFor more discussion, see Bullard’s Feb. 6, 2012, speech \"In ation Targeting in the\n\nUSA.\"\n###\n\nGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\nCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\nEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\nOn the Economy Blog\nOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\nLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\n\n\fBridges\nEconomic Synopses\nHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.

        "content": "Monetary Policy and the U.S. Economy in 2012 1\n15th Annual Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference\nHong Kong\nMarch 23, 2012\nIntroduction\nMacroeconomic prospects in the U.S. are looking somewhat brighter in 2012. This is providing\nthe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) with an opportunity to pause in its aggressive\neasing campaign, to allow the Committee the chance to assess developments in the economy\nand observe the effectiveness of recent policy actions. This opportunity to pause is quite\nimportant because the Committee is taking a substantial, but calculated, risk with the Federal\nReserve balance sheet.\nTo be sure, there have been many policy actions to ease financial conditions in recent years. In\nJanuary 2008, the Committee sharply and pre-emptively lowered the policy rate as the global\nfinancial crisis gathered steam and seemed to be hampering real economic performance. In\nDecember 2008, the Committee lowered the policy rate effectively to zero, where it remains to\nthis day. In 2009, the Committee authorized the purchase of mortgage-backed securities. In\n2010, in response to a possibly deflationary outlook, the Committee launched QE2, the outright\npurchase of about $600 billion in U.S. government debt. 2 In 2011, after the completion of QE2,\nthe Committee authorized a modern version of “Operation Twist,” in particular, selling $400\nbillion in short-term Treasuries in exchange for the same amount of longer-term bonds. The\nCommittee also began the use of explicit dates to describe the possible length of the near-zero\nrate policy. In January 2012, with Operation Twist still in motion, the Committee named an\nexplicit numerical inflation target of 2 percent for the first time, provided more information\nconcerning the individual forecasts of Committee members on key macroeconomic variables,\nand extended the period of a likely near-zero policy rate to late 2014.\nThis litany illustrates the determination of the Committee and of Chairman Bernanke to provide\nsupport to the U.S. economy in the face of one of the largest macroeconomic disturbances in\nmodern economic history. Indeed, the policy has been successful in the sense that the U.S. has\n\n1\n\nAny opinions expressed here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of others on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee. I thank my staff for helpful comments.\n2\nThese policies have more than tripled the size of the Fed’s balance sheet since September 2008.\n\n\fnot slipped into the scenario of a falling price level, which sometimes occurs after shocks of this\nmagnitude.\nBut now, with the Committee on pause, it may be a good time to take stock of whether we may\nbe at a turning point. Many of the further policy actions the Committee might consider at this\njuncture would have effects extending out for several years. As the U.S. economy continues to\nrebound and repair, those policy actions may create an overcommitment to ultra-easy\nmonetary policy. The ultra-easy policy has been appropriate until now, but it will not always be\nappropriate.\nThe FOMC has often been criticized historically for overstaying policy stances that might have\nmade sense at one juncture but are no longer appropriate as macroeconomic conditions\nchange. This occurs in part because of the lags in the effects of policy, the difficulty in\ninterpreting real-time data, much of which is subsequently revised, and the sheer uncertainty\nof macroeconomic developments. With numerous monetary policy actions still on the table,\nand others still affecting the economy with a lag, it may be especially difficult to remove policy\naccommodation at the appropriate pace and at the appropriate time. One may want to\napproach such a situation with caution.\n\nBrighter Prospects\nThe U.S. economy may achieve 3 percent growth in real GDP in 2012. This is not a high growth\nrate by historical standards in the U.S., but the outlook has improved markedly compared to\nlast summer. As many of you know well, during August 2011, the U.S. macroeconomic outlook\ndeteriorated significantly to the point where many observers were worried that the U.S.\neconomy would move into a recession state. The U.S. avoided the recession outcome, but I\nthink it is instructive to remind ourselves of this period and what has changed since then.\nThere were many cross currents at play during the recession scare. One was the ongoing\nadjustment to the tragedy in Japan, which disrupted supply lines and altered production\nschedules significantly during 2011. Another was the debate in the U.S. Congress concerning\nthe debt ceiling. The European sovereign debt crisis was entering a new, more difficult phase,\nwith Italian debt yields in particular rising sharply. And in the middle of these important\ndevelopments, on July 29, the U.S. GDP data for the previous several years was marked down\nsharply. The data revisions suggested that the U.S. recession of 2008 and 2009 was deeper\nthan previously understood, and that the recovery was weaker. When forecasters put the new\n2\n\n\fdata into their models, the result was a sharply lower profile for U.S. growth during the second\nhalf of 2011 and continuing on into 2012. This, combined with the other factors, seemed to\nsuggest that recession probabilities had increased dramatically.\nAs it turned out, the U.S. was not on the precipice of recession last summer. U.S. GDP growth\nwas stronger in the third quarter compared to the first half of 2011, and improved further\nduring the fourth quarter of the year. What changed?\nCertainly much progress occurred in restoring supply chains and production schedules in the\naftermath of the tragedy in Japan. In addition, a temporary fix for the U.S. debt ceiling problem\nwas agreed upon. However, in my view, the most important factor has been the reduction of\ntensions in global financial markets. Two important contributors to reduced stress have been\nthe introduction by the European Central Bank (ECB) of the Long-Term Refinancing Operation\n(LTRO), and the relatively successful navigation of Greek debt restructuring. In response to\nthese developments, global financial markets have, at least for now, substantially marked down\nthe probability of a significant financial crisis in Europe.\nThe ECB’s LTRO program has substantially increased the size of the ECB’s balance sheet. The\nECB’s lending program to European banks is based on an expanded set of collateral criteria.\nWhile most central bank lending is viewed as temporary, this funding program continues for\nthree years and could in principle be extended depending on macroeconomic conditions in\nEurope in the future. This seems to indicate that the ECB balance sheet will remain at a high\nlevel for a considerable period of time. One way to view this is that monetary conditions in\nEurope have become substantially easier in the wake of the LTRO program.\nWhile easier monetary conditions have helped change the climate in global financial markets,\nfundamental problems remain. Too much borrowing and spending on the part of sovereign\ngovernments cannot be repaired by such actions. Debt problems are acute, and only resolute\naction to better match national revenues with expenditures will allow nations to avoid the fate\nof Greece.\nThis applies to the U.S. as well, where most difficult decisions with respect to budgets, taxes\nand debt have been delayed until after the 2012 elections in November. I remain concerned\nthat financial market uncertainty about possible fiscal actions after the election might derail the\nU.S. economy during 2012.\n\n3\n\n\fOkun’s Guideline\nPart of the improvement in the U.S. macroeconomic outlook has occurred in labor markets.\nUnemployment has declined to 8.3 percent, and the latest figures on growth in nonfarm payroll\nemployment have been encouraging.\nThe unemployment declines have been viewed by some as a puzzle. In 2011, a year of\nlackluster economic growth, U.S. unemployment declined fairly substantially. This would seem\nto violate “Okun’s law,” which suggests that economic growth has to be reasonably robust\nbefore the unemployment rate will decline. This is, in fact, the source of some statements in\nfinancial markets and elsewhere that the pace of economic growth in the U.S. is too slow to\nmeaningfully improve labor markets.\nYet labor markets have indeed improved, so what’s going on? Probably the most important\nconsideration is that—as in the film “Pirates of the Caribbean”—Okun’s “law” is not so much a\nlaw but more like a “guideline.”\nAnother consideration is that Okun’s guideline is not as linear as it is often made out to be. A\nlook at the time series of U.S. unemployment since the mid-1980s indicates that recessions are\ndefinitely times when unemployment increases sharply, while expansions are times when\nunemployment declines slowly. In other words, the relationship between unemployment and\nGDP growth is very sharp during downturns, but more muddled during expansions. This might\nsuggest that the nation does not need rapid growth to see a reduction in unemployment—it\nonly needs to see some positive growth.\n\nTrend Output in the U.S.\nWhile unemployment has moved in surprising ways in the last year, so has another variable:\ninflation. Inflation in the U.S. has moved higher from its lows during the fall of 2010. Headline\nconsumer price index and headline personal consumption expenditures inflation, measured\nfrom one year ago, are both above the Committee’s inflation target of 2 percent. Both have\nbeen moderating in recent reports. But because inflation increased during a period in which\nreal economic performance was not stellar, it may be that the output gap is smaller than\ncommonly estimated.\nThe idea that the output gap—somehow measured—is large, is one of the defining features of\nmany arguments for continued extraordinary monetary policy in the U.S. And, to be sure, the\n4\n\n\fmacroeconomic shock that the U.S. suffered along with the rest of the world in 2008 and 2009\nwas very large, and the corresponding monetary policy actions have also been large and\naggressive, as I outlined in the introduction to this talk.\nBut the features of some output gap estimates do not seem to correspond with reality. Many\nestimates suggest that in the fourth quarter of 2007, the quarter during which the recession\nbegan in the U.S., output was only just at potential instead of above potential. And many\nestimates of potential are essentially indistinguishable from linear extrapolations of 2007:Q4\ninto the indefinite future. By that metric, the U.S. output gap indeed remains large. However, I\ndo not think that is a reasonable metric. Not even close.\nThe U.S. economy suffered through what is commonly called a housing bubble during the mid2000s. That bubble burst. Housing prices in the U.S. now appear to have been far too high\nduring the mid-2000s, driven by the widespread belief that “house prices never fall.” When\nhouse prices finally fell by 30 percent or more in many areas, the widespread belief was\nshattered. Households were left with debt levels much higher than they intended to take on,\nand other areas of the economy—including finance, construction and transportation—were\nsignificantly affected. It is neither feasible nor desirable to re-inflate such a damaging bubble.\nOur normal measures of potential output do not have any concept of such a “bubble.” In\neffect, the typical measures simply take all of the upside of the housing bubble on board, calling\nthat the normal level of output to which we should aspire. That is nothing less than a call to reinflate the housing bubble. But the housing bubble will not return unless the widespread belief\nthat “house prices never fall” returns. With house prices in the U.S. down 30 percent in the\naggregate and unlikely to rise very much, it seems quite unlikely that the U.S. housing bubble\nwill re-inflate.\nWhat should we do about this issue, since conventional metrics do not make any allowance for\nthe housing bubble? I suggest using available theory to separate trend from cycle in an\nappropriate way. Absent that, I suggest using a Hodrick-Prescott filter that removes trends and\nleaves business cycle frequency movements in the data. Such a filter suggests that the U.S.\noutput gap today is much smaller than commonly believed.\nDealing with the output gap issue is a delicate matter. The discussion today has an eerie 1970s\nfeel to it, in which many argued that the output gap was large and that monetary policy had to\nremain very aggressive to close the gap. The result was a global inflation debacle that took\nseveral decades to completely contain. Some say that if inflation increases, then we know how\n5\n\n\fto combat it. That is true, but the hard-learned lesson of the 1970s was that if the inflation\ngenie is let out of the bottle, it can be extremely difficult to get it back into the bottle.\n\nFed Communications\nAt its January meeting, the FOMC extended the date at which it currently expects to move the\npolicy rate off zero to late 2014. The FOMC also for the first time released individual\nprojections of the future policy path considered best for the economy.\nOne important lesson from these projections is that the uncertainty surrounding the future\npolicy path is profound. Some policymakers thought it might be necessary to raise interest\nrates within the next one or two years, while others thought the increase could be postponed\nfor many more years. The confidence interval surrounding the date of the first interest rate\nincrease is so wide it has to be expressed in years.\nThis very wide confidence interval may seem stunning, but I think in a way it is not surprising. If\nwe know one thing about the U.S. economy, we know that it can behave in unpredictable ways.\nThe amount of uncertainty surrounding U.S. economic performance is profound, and attempts\nto project macroeconomic outcomes more than 6 to 12 months into the future are unlikely to\nmeet with much success. The amount of uncertainty attached to a projection of U.S. economic\nperformance into 2014 reinforces the idea that much will change between now and then, and\nthat policy will have to change as well to meet new macroeconomic conditions.\nThe forecasts themselves by the individual members of the FOMC are a step forward for Fed\ntransparency. Chairman Bernanke has led the way toward more and more transparency for the\nU.S. central bank. This is a definite improvement in Fed communications.\nHowever, despite this improvement, I believe the projections will have to be done differently at\nsome point in the future. The notion of individual forecasts for Committee members is not the\nmost convenient method of conveying information to interested observers. The forecasts as\nthey stand are merely projections of a few macroeconomic variables instead of a more fulsome\ndiscussion of all aspects of the U.S. economy. The policy assessments are for the policy rate\nonly, in an environment where balance sheet policy has taken center stage.\nI think the Committee should consider publishing a Monetary Policy Report similar to those put\ntogether on a regular basis by other central banks. This would be a single report of the staff,\ncontaining a longer and more comprehensive discussion of the state of the U.S. economy and\n6\n\n\fthe likely direction going forward. The policy assumption should be the market expectation at\nthe time the report is put together. Such a report would allow commentary on aspects of\nmacroeconomic performance that are unlikely to ever be addressed through a mechanism like\nthe current Summary of Economic Projections.\nThe more fulsome discussion of macroeconomic developments that would be part of a U.S.\nMonetary Policy Report would also help with another issue, which is how the Committee might\nbetter convey how it might react in future states of the world. Since there are many such\nfuture states, it may be misleading to try to delineate how the reaction might occur through the\nuse of a few variables or simple “thresholds.” Such a simple description would likely set up an\nexpectation that the Committee would act if a threshold was crossed, when no such\nexpectation was intended or desired by the Committee. A full discussion in a report could lay\nout these nuances in a way that could be better digested by markets.\n\nConclusions\nThe FOMC is currently on pause. At the March meeting, the Committee updated its assessment\nof the economy, but otherwise left the policy statement largely unchanged.\nThe Committee has, as I discussed at the outset, pursued an aggressive easing strategy over a\nperiod of several years. This strategy seems to have been the right one so far, but it will not\nalways be the right strategy. Some of the further actions that could be undertaken at this\njuncture would have effects far into the future, in an environment of continual improvement\nand repair for the U.S. economy. The ultra-easy policy has served us well in a difficult\nenvironment, but overcommitting to the ultra-easy policy could well have detrimental\nconsequences for the U.S. and, by extension, the global economy.\n\nJames Bullard, President and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\n7\n\n\f",

Based on some existing research that analyzes open economies, Bullard said\nthere are good reasons to think the global output gap is a relevant indicator for\ndomestic in ation. “This might help explain why current U.S. in ation is higher than\nwould be predicted based on a closed economy analysis,” he concluded.\nShould the U.S. Consider Global Output Gaps?\nBullard noted that some critics of Federal Open Market Committee policy suggest the\nFed is encouraging global in ation, despite the fact that U.S. in ation is relatively low.\nThe spirit of this criticism is that the Fed may not be appropriately weighing global\nconditions. “The Fed is charged with controlling U.S. in ation,” he noted, adding, “but\npossibly global in ation will drive U.S. prices higher or cause other problems.”\nMuch monetary policy analysis focuses on the U.S. output gap, Bullard noted. He then\nposed the question of whether the U.S. should focus on a global output gap in light of\nthe criticism. According to some recent research, he said, “the global perspective on\nthe output gap might give a better indication of global conditions, and possibly a better\nindication of U.S. in ation prospects.”\nBullard said that his past criticisms of gap-based analyses of in ation dynamics still\napply. For instance, “empirical relationships between gaps and in ation are shaky,” he\nsaid. “Still, the idea of ‘global output gaps’ is one way to frame the recent criticism of\nthe Fed and promote fruitful debate.”\nGlobal Output Gaps\nU.S. in ation has increased during the past 18 months even though most measures of\nthe U.S. output gap have remained very wide, Bullard noted. “Typical estimates suggest\nin ation should have remained low or even moved lower during 2011,” he said.\n\n\fRegarding this in ation puzzle, he noted that “one explanation could be that the output\ngap is not nearly as wide as commonly supposed.”1\nOn the other hand, “an alternative explanation is that the U.S. output gap is not the\nrelevant output gap for U.S. in ation,” Bullard said, suggesting that perhaps the global\noutput gap is what really matters. “The global output gap is probably much narrower or\neven positive; this would then be interpreted as putting upward pressure on U.S.\nin ation,” he added.\nRegarding the dollar bloc, Bullard noted that in ation has been a threat especially for\ncountries that have quasi- xed exchange rates with the dollar. “Those countries are\nchoosing to import U.S. monetary policy to some extent,” he stated.\nBullard presented some possible measures of a global output gap, with the idea being\nthat the weighted average of the output gaps for advanced economies and emerging\nmarkets may be positive. “This may suggest upward, not downward, pressure on U.S.\nin ation from this source,” he said.\nSome Economic Theory and Empirical Evidence\nBullard discussed some models currently available in economic research that analyze\nthe relationship between global output gaps and domestic in ation. In these models,\nhe said, the monetary authorities in one country can ignore the output gap in other\ncountries only if in ation is de ned as “domestic (producer) price in ation” and\nexchange rates are perfectly exible. However, “these conditions are often not met in\nreality,” he said.\nBullard added that output gaps have measurement issues. For instance, he said that\nglobal output gaps are even more di cult to measure than domestic output gaps.\n“However, the idea of generally robust emerging markets suggests that one might be\nless worried that the global output gap is very large,” he said.\nWhile foreign output gaps will matter for domestic in ation dynamics in the models,\nBullard examined whether the theory can explain actual outcomes. He found mixed\nevidence regarding the impact of global output gaps on domestic in ation. He cited\none study, however, that suggests globalization might be more important going forward\nthan it was in the past. “Thus, the global output gap idea may be the ‘wave of the\nfuture’ rather than an explanation for past economic outcomes,” he said.\n###\n1\n\nSee Bullard’s March 23, 2012, speech “Monetary Policy and the U.S. Economy in 2012”\nfor additional comments on the output gap.\n\nGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\nCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\nEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\n\n\fOn the Economy Blog\nOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\nLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\nBridges\nEconomic Synopses\nHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.

        "content": "Search Site\nHome > Newsroom >\n\nSt. Louis Fed's Bullard Discusses Monetary Policy, U.S. Economy,\nOutput Gap and Housing\n4/5/2012\nST. LOUIS – Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard discussed “The\nU.S. Monetary Policy Outlook” on Thursday during the 13th Annual InvestMidwest\nVenture Capital Forum.\nBullard said that brighter prospects for the U.S. economy provide the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) with the opportunity to pause in its aggressive easing\ncampaign. “An appropriate approach at this juncture may be to continue to pause to\nassess developments in the economy,” he stated. Concerning the FOMC’s\ncommunications tool, the “late 2014” language describing the length of the near-zero\nrate policy may be counterproductive, he said. “The Committee’s practice of including\ndistant dates in the statement sends an unwarranted pessimistic signal concerning the\nfuture of the U.S. economy.”\nRegarding the output gap and housing markets, “the U.S. output gap may be smaller\nthan typical estimates suggest,” Bullard said, adding that typical estimates count the\n“housing bubble” as part of the normal level of output. However, he said, “It is neither\nfeasible nor desirable to attempt to re-in ate the U.S. housing bubble of the mid2000s.”\nMonetary Policy on Pause\nAt the March 2012 meeting, the FOMC updated its assessment of the economy, but\notherwise left the policy statement largely unchanged, Bullard noted. Given that\nincoming data have generally indicated somewhat better-than-expected\nmacroeconomic performance so far in 2012, “past behavior of the Committee suggests\na ‘wait-and-see’ strategy at this juncture,” he said.\nBullard discussed some of the policy actions that the FOMC has taken in recent years\nto ease nancial conditions. “The ultra-easy policy has been appropriate until now, but\nit will not always be appropriate,” he said. Many of the further policy actions the FOMC\nmight consider at this juncture would have effects that extend out for several years,\nBullard stated. “As the U.S. economy continues to rebound and repair, additional policy\nactions may create an over-commitment to ultra-easy monetary policy.”\nBullard noted that labor market policies (e.g., unemployment insurance, worker\nretraining) have direct effects on the unemployed. In contrast, he said, “monetary policy\nis a blunt instrument which affects the decision-making of everyone in the economy.”\nIn particular, low interest rates hurt savers, he stated. “It may be better to focus on\n\n\flabor market policies to directly address unemployment instead of taking further risks\nwith monetary policy.”\nBrighter Prospects for the U.S.\nBullard noted that last August, forecasters marked up the probability of a U.S. recession\noccurring in the second half of 2011. He attributed much of this to the July 29 gross\ndomestic product (GDP) report, which included downward revisions to GDP data. In\naddition, he noted that the European sovereign debt crisis worsened then. However, he\nsaid, “Since last fall, the outlook has improved.”\nRegarding Europe, Bullard noted that the European Central Bank (ECB) offered threeyear re nancing at low rates on broadened collateral in December and offered a second\ntranche in February. “At least for now, this has calmed European markets relative to last\nfall,” he stated, adding that the ECB policy does not address longer-term problems.\nOutput Gaps and U.S. Housing Markets\nIn discussing the collapsed housing bubble, Bullard noted that most components of\nU.S. GDP – except for the components of investment related to real estate – have\nrecovered to their levels in the fourth quarter of 2007. “It may not be reasonable to\nclaim that the ‘output gap’ is exceptionally large,” he said.\nBullard also stated that it is not feasible or desirable to attempt to re-in ate the bubble.\n“The crisis has likely scared off a cohort of potential homeowners, who now see home\nownership as a much riskier proposition than renting,” he said. The crisis has also left\nU.S. households with more debt than they had intended, he said, adding that “this is the\nrst U.S. recession in which deleveraging has played a key role.”\nOn the topic of too much debt, he noted that U.S. homeowners have about $9.9 trillion\nin mortgage debt outstanding against $712 billion of equity. According to Bullard,\nhouseholds would have to pay down this debt by about $3.7 trillion to return to a\nnormal loan-to-value ratio of 58.4 percent, assuming a normal ratio based on the\naverage LTV ratio from 1970-2005. The amount is roughly equal to one-quarter of one\nyear’s GDP. “This will take a long time,” he said. “It is not a matter of business cycle\nfrequency adjustment.”\nRecent Monetary Policy\nWhile the FOMC could use the promised date of the rst interest rate increase – the\ncommunications tool – as a policy tool should further monetary accommodation be\nnecessary, Bullard said this tool has an important downside. Although the 2014\nlanguage in effect names a date far in the future at which macroeconomic conditions\nare still expected to be exceptionally poor, “neither the Fed nor any other forecaster has\na clear idea of what macroeconomic conditions will be like at that time,” he said. “This\nis an unwarranted pessimistic signal for the FOMC to send,” he added.\n\nGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\nCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\n\n\fEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\nOn the Economy Blog\nOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\nLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\nBridges\nEconomic Synopses\nHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.

        "content": "Opening remarks by President James Bullard\nThe 2012 Homer Jones Memorial Lecture\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nApril 11, 2012\nWelcome to the 23rd annual Homer Jones Memorial Lecture. Each year we host this event to\nhonor the outstanding contributions of Homer Jones, a former Senior Vice President and\nResearch Director of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\nThe St. Louis Fed started the lecture series after Homer Jones’ death in 1986. The lecture series\nenjoys the long-lasting support and co-sponsorship of many people and organizations, including\nthe St. Louis Gateway Chapter of the National Association for Business Economics, Saint Louis\nUniversity, Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, the University of Missouri at St. Louis\nand Washington University in St. Louis.\nHomer Jones is sometimes described as “Milton Friedman’s teacher” because Jones taught\nFriedman when Friedman was an undergraduate at Rutgers University in the late 1920s-early\n1930s. Then, as now, it was a tumultuous time for macroeconomists.\nJones had come to Rutgers after studying at the University of Chicago, where he was a student\nof legendary Chicago professor Frank Knight. Also on the Rutgers faculty at the time: Arthur\nBurns, future Fed Chairman.\nAccording to Friedman, Jones was one of the primary influences in Friedman’s choice to study\neconomics, as opposed to mathematics or statistics. In Friedman’s 1976 reminiscence, he says\nJones opened his eyes “… to the broader reaches of economics and to the beauties and\nintricacies of economic theory.” 1 The rest, as they say, is history—the two remained friends\nand colleagues for years afterward.\nIn 1958, Homer Jones joined the staff here at the St. Louis Fed. He is remembered for many\nthings at the Bank, but his role in the Bank’s development as a leader in monetary research and\nstatistics stands out. Although many talented and dedicated people have greatly expanded\nupon Homer’s original efforts to make the St. Louis Fed a leader in the dissemination of\neconomic data, it is difficult to imagine that we would have been as successful as we have been\n1\n\nSee Milton Friedman, 1976, “Homer Jones: A Personal Reminiscence,” Journal of Monetary Economics 2: 433-436.\n\n\fwere it not for Homer Jones’ vision. He was, in a sense, a proponent of transparency before\ntransparency was cool.\nToday, the St. Louis Fed is internationally known as an institution that is unparalleled in data\ndissemination. Housed under the name Federal Reserve Economic Data, or FRED, these efforts\nhave their genesis in Homer’s innovative idea to publish monetary data in a form that did not\nyet exist at the time. Today, through FRED, we make more than 45,000 data series available\nand accessible to individuals and organizations worldwide—and it’s optimally priced for the\nbudding researcher: free. I think Homer would be extremely proud of what we have\naccomplished in this area.\nThe St. Louis Fed’s unwavering commitment to rigorous, independent economic research is\nanother legacy of Homer’s that we honor today. Homer had a staunch belief in the persuasive\npower of facts and—it is said—dogged patience in pressing his views.\nThose of us in the Federal Reserve System who believe that the ability to question and reexamine conventional wisdom leads to better policy outcomes owe a great debt to Homer\nJones. The Fed’s ability to absorb and be open to multiple viewpoints helps prevent groupthink\nand leads to superior monetary policy and, ultimately, to better macroeconomic performance.\nIt is only fitting for us to use the Homer Jones Memorial Lecture to spotlight others who have\nmade a significant impact in the world of academic research, central banking and global\nfinance. It is a pleasure for me to introduce this year’s distinguished speaker, Mohamed A. ElErian.\nDr. El-Erian is currently the CEO and co-CIO of PIMCO. He rejoined PIMCO at the end of 2007,\nafter serving two years as president and CEO of Harvard Management Company. Dr. El-Erian\nalso served as a member of the faculty of the Harvard Business School. Prior to joining PIMCO,\nhe worked for 15 years at the International Monetary Fund and later moved on to become a\nmanaging director at Salomon Smith Barney/Citigroup in London.\nDr. El-Erian has published widely on international economics and finance topics. His book,\nWhen Markets Collide, won the Financial Times/Goldman Sachs 2008 business book of the year\nand a “book of the year” award from The Economist magazine. In 2010, he gave one of the\nprestigious Per Jacobsson Foundation Lectures at the IMF. He was named to Foreign Policy’s\nlist of the “Top 100 Global Thinkers” in 2009, 2010 and 2011.\n\n\fDr. El-Erian serves on many boards and committees, including the National Bureau of Economic\nResearch and the Peterson Institute for International Economics. He holds a master’s degree\nand doctorate in economics from Oxford University.\nDr. El-Erian will speak to us today about the “Evolution, Impact and Limitations of Unusual\nCentral Bank Policy Activism.”\nPlease join me in welcoming Dr. Mohamed A. El-Erian.\n\nJames Bullard, President and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\n\f",

Waller\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\n30 May 2012\n\nAbstract\nWe study the interaction between population demographics, the desire for intergenerational redistribution in the economy, and the optimal in‡ation rate in a deterministic life-cycle economy with capital. Young cohorts do not initially have any assets\nand wages are the main source of income; they prefer relatively low real interest rates,\nrelatively high wages, and relatively high rates of in‡ation. Older generations work\nless and prefer higher rates of return from their savings, relatively low wages, and relatively low in‡ation. In the absence of intergenerational redistribution via lump-sum\ntaxes and transfers, the constrained e¢ cient competitive equilibrium entails optimal\ndistortions on relative prices. We allow the planner to use in‡ation to try to achieve\nthe optimal distortions. In the economy changes in the population structure are interpreted as the ability of a particular cohort to in‡uence the redistributive policy. When\nthe old have more in‡uence on the redistributive policy, the economy has a relatively\nlow steady state level of capital and a relatively low steady state rate of in‡ation. The\nopposite happens as young cohorts have more control of policy. These results suggest\nthat aging population structures like those in Japan may contribute to observed low\nrates of in‡ation or even de‡ation.\nJEL codes: E4, E5, D7\nKeywords: monetary policy, in‡ation bias, de‡ation, central bank design\nThis paper was prepared for the conference “Demographic Changes and Macroeconomic Performance,”\nsponsored by the Bank of Japan and the Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies, May 30th and 31st,\n2012. The views presented here are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the\nFederal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.1\n\nOverview\n\nCan observed low in‡ation outcomes be related to demographic factors such as an aging\npopulation? A calculation which we will label “back-of-the-envelop”(BOTE) based on some\nbasic economic theory might suggest that the answer is “no.” Suppose we think of the net\nreal interest rate r in a model with capital. We might guess that in steady state r = + n;\nwhere is the net depreciation rate and n is the net population growth rate. Suppose we also\nassume that money and capital pay either the same real rate of return or closely related real\nrates of return,1 and that the real return on money is the negative of the net in‡ation rate\n: Now suppose the rate of population growth increases to n0 ; creating a new steady state\nwith a more youthful population. By itself, this must mean that the real return to capital\nincreases to r0 and that the in‡ation rate decreases to\n\n0\n\n: This would seem to suggest that\n\ncountries with relatively young populations would have relatively low in‡ation rates, all else\nequal, and conversely that countries with relatively old populations would have relatively\nhigh in‡ation rates, all else equal.\nHowever, the BOTE calculation does not seem to square with some of the facts. Figures\n1 and 2 show two time series each for two countries, the U.S. and Japan.\n\n15\n\n42\n\n11.25\n\n40\n\n7.5\n\n38\n\n3.75\n\n36\n\n0\n\n34\n\npercentage of population 15-40\n\ny-on-y percent change, MA(6)\n\nFigure 1: In‡ation and Demographics U.S.A 1960-2010\n\nYouthful pop. share (right scale)\nCPI inflation (left scale)\n-3.75\n1960\n\n1965\n\n1970\n\n1975\n\n1980\n\n1985\n\n1990\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n32\n2010\n\nMoving average CPI in‡ation and the share of population\n1\n\n“Closely related” would apply to cases where the return on capital and the return on money were not\nexactly equal but di¤er only by a constant, so that the two rates still move in tandem.\n\n2\n\n\f10\n\n48\n\n7.5\n\n45\n\n5\n\n42\n\n2.5\n\n39\n\n0\n\n36\n\n-2.5\n\npercentage of population 15-40\n\ny-on-y percent change, MA(6)\n\nFigure 2: In‡ation and Demographics Japan 1960-2010\n\n33\nYouthful pop. share (right scale)\nCPI inflation (left scale)\n\n-5\n1960\n\n1965\n\n1970\n\n1975\n\n1980\n\n1985\n\n1990\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n30\n2010\n\nMoving average CPI in‡ation and the share of population\nThe years run from 1960 to 2011. A moving average of the consumer price in‡ation rate is\nplotted using the left scale. A measure of the youthfulness of the population, the fraction\nof the population aged 15 to 40 years, is plotted on the right scale. In each case, very\nroughly speaking, the more youthful economies are associated with higher in‡ation, while\nthe more elderly economies are associated with lower in‡ation.2 This evidence, while far\nfrom de…nitive, is at least suggestive and does run counter to the BOTE “standard theory”\ncalculation.\nIn this paper, we provide one reconciliation of the BOTE calculation with the suggestion\nfrom the data shown in Figures 1 and 2 that aging populations are associated with lower\nlevels of in‡ation. The theory we study has all the elements of the BOTE calculation but\nalso considers the desire for redistribution within society. We model this desire as a social\nplanner’s problem in which the planner only has access to in‡ation or de‡ation as a tool\nfor redistribution. We show that the solution to the social planner’s problem associates\nrelatively elderly populations with relatively low in‡ation.\n\n2\n\nThe mid-1970s moving average in‡ation rate in Japan is truncated at 10 percent in order to allow a\nbetter view of the two data series.\n\n3\n\n\f1.2\n\nRedistributional tension\n\nIn canonical macroeconomic models, the representative agent assumption is used to capture\nthe “average” behavior of key variables, including in‡ation. When using the representative\nhousehold approach, policy implicitly ignores the redistributive e¤ects of …scal and monetary\ninterventions. While it is possible to incorporate various forms of heterogeneity into canonical\nmodels, attempting to understand redistribution policies for demographic reasons forces us\nto abandon the representative agent framework and move to a general equilibrium life-cycle\nframework.\nAccordingly, in this paper we use an overlapping generations model with capital to study\nthe redistributional tensions associated with monetary and …scal policy. As in Bullard and\nWaller (2004), in‡ation dictates the real rate of return on money and thus the portfolio\nchoices of each generation. Via a standard Tobin e¤ect, higher in‡ation can induce a substitution from money to capital. But why is there a tension across generations from this? The\ntension can be understood by considering the decision-making of a given individual at time t.\nA high wage rate at time t, which we can represent as fl (kt ), increases lifetime income of the\nyoung cohort. In‡ation reduces the rate of return of money balances and individuals shift\nportfolio decisions towards capital. The increasing capital accumulation increases wages of\nyoung workers but reduces the rate of return on capital, fk (kt+1 ), for the older cohort of\nsavers. Consequently, young workers like in‡ation when they are young but dislike it when\nthey are old. Thus, if a single generation could choose the in‡ation rate at each point in\ntheir lives, they would choose relatively high in‡ation when they were young and relatively\nlow in‡ation (or de‡ation) when old. Clearly, the generations existing side-by-side with this\none generation would not appreciate such a policy and would oppose it. Consequently, how\nagents resolve this con‡ict between generations is important for understanding policy choices\nand the institutional design of the central bank. Bullard and Waller (2004) considered three\ninstitutional arrangements for resolving this con‡ict, among them a “policy committee”that\nallows older and younger cohorts to solve a Nash bargaining problem.3 Their main …nding\nis that the behavior of in‡ation hinges critically on key details of the institutional design.\nThe objective of this paper is to understand the determination of central bank objectives\nwhen population aging shifts the social preferences for redistribution and its implications\nfor in‡ation. Our starting point builds on Bullard and Waller (2004), but unfortunately,\nit is di¢ cult to follow their approach since it is not possible to specify the entire spectrum\n3\n\nBullard and Waller did not focus directly on demographic e¤ects.\n\n4\n\n\fof institutional arrangements that could be implemented. We take a di¤erent approach in\nthis paper. Rather than specifying particular political decision-making rules, we use a direct\nmechanism to decide the allocations. This means we will solve a social planner’s problem in\nwhich the weights assigned to each generation are population weights. Thus, a baby boom\ncorresponds to putting more weight on the young of a particular generation relative to past\nand future generations. This mechanism can replicate any steady state allocation arising\nfrom a political economy model with population growth or decline.\nFor every level of social redistribution there exists an optimal level of capital. When the\nyoung have more in‡uence in the planner’s optimization problem, wages are high and the\nreturn from capital is low, and when the old have more in‡uence in the planner’s optimization\nproblem, wages are low and the return from capital is high. A critical feature of the planning\nproblem we study is whether or not the planner can redistribute resources via lump-sum taxes\nor transfers. In the absence of lump-sum redistribution, we show that the planner might wish\nto use in‡ation or de‡ation to change the relative price of capital to induce young households\nto hold the right amount of capital. In general, the constrained redistributive solution is not\nfully e¢ cient. That is, the implied level of savings is either too low or too high compared\nwith the unconstrained e¢ cient solution. In this sense, in‡ation or de‡ation will turn out to\nbe an imperfect substitute for a full system of lump-sum taxes and transfers.\nWe emphasize that in contrast with Bullard and Waller (2004), the unconstrained socially\ne¢ cient level of savings is always dynamically e¢ cient. This is because in the unconstrained\ncase the social planner has access to a full system of lump-sum taxes and transfers. However,\nthe constraints on redistribution— the planner only has access to in‡ation or de‡ation as a\nredistribution tool— behave as binding participation constraints that cause the e¢ cient level\nof capital to deviate from the socially e¢ cient one. These deviations are due to the relative\nimportance of each group and the underlying distribution of resources.4\nThe mechanism presented in the paper follows the work of Garriga and Sánchez-Losada\n(2009) , who considers the implementation of constrained e¢ cient solutions in economies with\nwarm-glow or joy-of-giving preferences. The rational for intergenerational redistribution is\nalways present in life cycle model that abstracts from lump-sum taxes and transfers. Garriga\n(2001) shows depending on the relative importance of present versus future generations it\nis optimal to tax/subsidize capital. Dávila (2012) uses a similar approach in a steady state\n4\n\nJudd (1985) considers a redistributional trade-o¤ between wage earners and capital earners. In that\neconomy the optimal redistribution is independent of the relative weight of each group in the social welfare\nfunction. In terms of monetary policy, in that economy the central bank should set the nominal interest rate\nto zero.\n\n5\n\n\fanalysis to show that capital taxation can still be optimal even in the absence of government\nexpenditure. This mechanism is usually absent in economies with dynastic agents. Dávila,\nHong, Krusell, and Ríos-Rull (2012) also use a similar set up in an economy with incomplete\nmarkets and uninsurable income risk.\n\n2\n\nEconomy\n\n2.1\n\nEnvironment\n\nConsider a standard two-period overlapping generations growth model with capital. Time\nis discrete and double in…nity t = :::; 2; 1; 0; 1; 2; :::. Each period a number of identical\nhouseholds are born, and population grows at an exogenous rate Nt = (1+n)Nt\n\n1\n\nwhere N0 =\n\n1. Agents live for two periods and have perfect foresight. Young agents are endowed with one\nunit of time that can be devoted to market work. These agents consume goods every period\nand consumption bundles are compared using a standard utility function U (c1;t ; c2;t+1 ) =\nu(c1;t ) + u(c2;t+1 ) where the utility function satis…es standard properties. There is an initial\nold agent that consumes at t = 0:\nThis economy produces consumption and investment goods with a standard neoclassical\ntechnology F (Kt ; Nt ). The production function has constant returns to scale and satis…es\nstandard properties. Capital depreciates at the rate . Output per worker can be written as\nf (kt ) where kt = Kt =Nt . The economy aggregate resource constraint is given by\nNt c1;t + Nt 1 c1;t\n\n+ Kt+1 = F (Kt ; Nt ) + (1\n\n) Kt\n\n(1)\n\n+ (1 + n) kt+1 = f (kt ) + (1\n\n) kt :\n\n(2)\n\n1\n\nor, in per capita terms,\nc1;t +\n\n2.2\n\n1\nc1;t\n1+n\n\n1\n\nThe e¢ cient allocation of resources\n\nConsider the allocation of resources determined by a social planner. The objective function\nweights current and future generations according to\nV =\n\n1 u(c2;0 )\n\n+\n\n1\nX\n\nt\n\nt=0\n\n6\n\n[u(c1;t ) + u(c2;t+1 )] :\n\n(3)\n\n\fThe term\n\nt\n\ncan be interpreted as the social discount rate and represents the relative weight\n\nthat the government places between present and future cohorts. Note that it is possible for\nt\n\n> 1 for some arbitrary generation t but for exposition it is convenient to assume that\n\ndiscounting is geometric; that is,\n\nt\n\n1. The socially e¢ cient allocation of resources is\n\n=\n\nthen the solution to a standard optimization problem\nV (k0 ) = max\n\n1\nX\n\nt\n\n1\n\nu(c1;t ) +\n\nu(c2;t )\n\n(4)\n\nt=0\n\nsubject to\nc1;t +\n\nc2;t\n+ (1 + n)kt+1 = f (kt ) + (1\n1+n\n\n)kt :\n\n(5)\n\nThe objective function has been rewritten to illustrate the redistributive trade-o¤s between\nexisting old cohorts and the new young. A higher value of\n\nplaces more weight on the new-\n\nborn and future generations, and less in the current individuals. The …rst-order conditions\nof the optimization program imply\nu0 (c1;t ) = (1 + n)u0 (c2;t )\n\n(6)\n\nand\n(1 + n)u0 (c1;t ) = u0 (c1;t+1 ) [1\n\n+ f 0 (kt+1 )] :\n\n(7)\n\nBoth conditions are standard. The …rst expression equates the marginal rate of substitution\nof the young and the old at a given point in time. When\n\n= ; both individuals receive\n\nthe same amount of per capital consumption. When the weight on the young cohort is\nlarger, c1;t > c2;t : The second expression is the standard Euler equation but comparing the\nmarginal rate of substitution between a newborn in period t and t + 1 to the marginal rate of\ntransformation. Combining both expressions, the model implies the standard Euler equation\nfrom the two-period overlapping generations model:\nu0 (c1t ) = u0 (c2t+1 ) [1\n\n+ f 0 (kt+1 )] :\n\n(8)\n\nIn steady state, the allocation of resources perfectly separates the production process\n(determination of the capital stock and employment) since the steady state stock of capital\nk s is determined solely from (7),\nf 0 (k s ) = (1 + n)\n7\n\n1\n\n+\n\n1;\n\n(9)\n\n\fwhile steady state consumption cs1 and cs2 solve\nu0 (cs1 ) =\ncs1 +\nSince\n\ncs2\n1+n\n\n(1 + n)u0 (cs2 )\n\n+ ( + n)k s = f (k s ):\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\n< 1, the economy always satis…es the condition for dynamic e¢ ciency. Note that for\n\nthe extreme case of\n\n= 1; the economy satis…es the golden rule f 0 (k ) = n+ . Many analyses\n\nof this model ignore the role of social discounting, implicitly setting\n\n= 1; and maximize the\n\nsavings rate subject to the steady state resource constraint. However, this particular case of\nthe Pareto frontier is not useful for the study of intergenerational redistribution when the\nrelative importance of one group increases.\nIf one restrains the analysis to only steady state allocations, then (9)-(11) yield a unique\nsolution for any value of . It is clear from (9) that for\n\n> 1, k s > k and the economy\n\nhas more capital than prescribed by the golden rule. This is the case studied by Bullard\nand Waller (2004) who looked only at political economy allocations rather than a planner\nallocation. It is in this sense that any political economy allocation occurring in steady state\nof their model can be replicated by an appropriate choice of\n\nconfronting a social planner.\n\nHowever, since we want to study the dynamic behavior of in‡ation following a baby boom and\nbust, we cannot constrain our analysis to steady states. This forces us to study allocations\nfor which\n\n2.3\n\n1.\n\nImplementation of the e¢ cient problem: Lump sum transfers\n\nMarkets can achieve the same allocation as the social planner. However, that requires a\ntransfer resources across cohorts using lump-sum taxation. The optimization problem of the\nrepresentative newborn is given by\nmax u(c1;t ) + u(c2;t+1 )\n\n(12)\n\nc1;t + st = wt lt + T1;t ;\n\n(13)\n\nsubject to\n\nand\nc2;t+1 = (1\n\n+ rt+1 )st + T2;t+1 :\n\n8\n\n(14)\n\n\fThe optimality conditions imply\nu0 (wt lt\n\nst + T1t ) = u0 [(1\n\n+ rt+1 )st + T2;t+1 ] (1 + rt+1 ):\n\nThe optimal interest rate determined by the intergenerational discount rate can be implemented by shifting resources across cohorts at a given period t. That ensures that the young\ncohort saves the right amount, implementing the fully e¢ cient solution. The market clearing\ncondition for capital implies (1 + n)kt+1 = st : The government budget constraint implies\nT1;t +\n\nT2;t\n= 0:\n1+n\n\n(15)\n\nThis economy is not particularly useful, because neither …scal or monetary policy is used\nto implement the e¢ cient solution. In the absence of redistributional policy this is no longer\ntrue. In this case, the direct mechanism needs to respect the distributional restrictions\nimplied by the market. However, a constrained planner can internalize the impact of the\ndecisions on factor prices. This solution should be superior to the one in which the direct mechanism does not take into account the e¤ect of aggregates on factor prices. The\nconstrained e¢ cient solution implies a wedge in market decisions (for instance, in‡ation or\ncapital taxation). The optimal wedge (positive or negative) is determined by the social\ndesirability to redistribute resources across cohorts.\n\n2.4\n\nConstrained e¢ cient allocations: Ramsey\n\nIn the e¢ cient allocation, the social planner has access to lump-sum taxes and transfers.\nSince the use of lump-sum taxes and transfers are rarely used in practice, we follow the\ntraditional Ramsey approach and assume that the social planner: (1) does not have access\nto lump-sum taxes and transfers and (2) faces the same market prices as agents. This\nassumption implies that the only way to increase consumption for a given cohort is to\nmanipulate the incentives to save and the implied relative prices. By taking into account\nthe e¤ects on relative prices the planner does not need to manipulate the allocations that\nmuch. Consider\nV (k0 ) = max\n\n1\nX\n\nt\n\n1\n\nu(c1;t ) +\n\nu(c2;t )\n\n(16)\n\nt=0\n\nsubject to\nc1;t = fl\n\nst 1\n1+n\n9\n\nl\n\nst ;\n\n(17)\n\n\fand\nc2;t = 1\n\nst 1\n1+n\n\n+ fk\n\n(18)\n\nst 1 ;\n\nwhere (1 + n)kt+1 = st . This optimization problem is equivalent to the Ramsey problems\ndescribed in Garriga (2001) when the government expenditure is set equal to zero, or to the\nsteady state analysis when the planner faces no intergenerational con‡ict,\n\n= 1, as in Davila\n\n(2012).\nLet\n\n1;t\n\nand\n\n2;t\n\nrepresent the Lagrange multipliers of the distributional constraints (17)\n\nand (18) respectively. It is important to stress that each resource constraint e¤ectively\nprovides an entitlement for each individual and thus\n\n1;t\n\nand\n\n2;t\n\nare endogenous weights\n\na¤ecting the distribution of resources. The …rst-order conditions of this problem for every\nperiod t yield\n\nu0 (c1;t )\n(1 + n)\n=\n0\nu (c2;t )\n\nThe endogenous weights are the same\n\n1;t\n\n=\n\n2;t\n\n1;t\n\n(19)\n\n:\n\n2;t\n\nonly if the planner does not have redistri-\n\nbutional con‡icts. When a particular cohort controls more resources, its endogenous weight\nis lower making it easier to transfer resources from that cohort to the other. In short, intergenerational redistribution trades o¤ the relative importance of each cohort, , with the\ncohort’s ownership of resources, .\nThe intergenerational decision of savings (capital) is more complicated:\n\n1;t\n\n=\n\n1;t+1 fl;k\n\nst 1\n1+n\n\nl\n+\n1+n\n\n2;t+1\n\n1\n\n+ fk\n\nst 1\n1+n\n\n+ fk;k\n\nst 1\n1+n\n\nst\n: (20)\n1+n\n\nAn increase in savings reduces consumption of the current generation c1;t . The additional\nsavings (1) increases future consumption of the generation that saves the resources by the\nmarginal product of capital, (2) increases the wages of future newborn cohorts at t + 1, and\n(3) reduces the future rate return of all savings.

In the absence\nof intergenerational redistribution, the only way to induce additional savings is to subsidize\n10\n\n\fcapital.\nThis expression can be rewritten in wedges form\nst\nt 1\nt 1\n+ fk;k s1+n\n1\n+ fk s1+n\nu0 (c1;t )\n1+n\n=\n;\n0\n)\nst 1\nl\nu0 (c2;t+1 )\n1 + uu(c0 (c1;t+1\nf\nk;k\n)\n1+n\n1+n\n1;t\n\nwhere fk;k k =\n\n(22)\n\nfl;k l: The constrained e¢ cient solution is fully e¢ cient only when fk;k = 0.\n\nOtherwise, the e¢ cient solution implies an optimal wedge (positive or negative) in savings\ndecisions.

Several\ninstruments can manipulate the relative rate of return of savings (for example, in‡ation or\ncapital taxation). To illustrate the importance of these wedges, we compute some numerical\nexamples that show comparable …ndings to Bullard and Waller (2004).\n\n3\n3.1\n\nMoney and capital\nPricing an additional asset\n\nSince the optimal intergenerational redistribution determines the equilibrium interest rate,\nwe can also think about these parameters as the determining factors in an economy where\ncapital and money are perfect substitutes. Thus, the equilibrium return on capital pins\ndown the real rate of return on money and thus the in‡ation rate. In this economy, one can\nimagine the per capita money growth rate evolving according to Mt+1 (1 + n) = (1 + zt )Mt .\nThe real rate of return on money is given by (1 +\n\nt)\n\n1\n\nwhere\n\nt\n\nis the net in‡ation rate in\n\nperiod t. Arbitrage then implies that\nfk (kt ) =\n\n1\n1+\n12\n\n=\nt\n\n1+n\n:\n1 + zt\n\n(31)\n\n\fWe do not explicitly model the reason agents hold money in this economy. Rather we think\nof this exercise as being able to price an asset that is held in zero net supply. This is similar\nin spirit to Woodford’s (2003) “cashless”economy.\nSince the rate of return from capital is the same as money, it is possible to write the\nconsumer’s budget constraint as\nc2;t+1 =\n\nvt+1\nst+1 ;\nvt\n\n(32)\n\nwhere vt+1 =vt = 1 + n=(1 + z) = 1 + . Replacing the expression in the budget constraint\nimplies\n(1 + )c2t+1 = st+1 :\n\n(33)\n\nThe optimal wedge takes a di¤erent form, but it a¤ects the relative price of consumption.\nArbitrage between money and capital ensures that the economy implements the constrained\ne¢ cient stock of capital. This model ties the constrained e¢ cient level of capital to the\nimplied in‡ation rate that would have to prevail to equate rates of return on assets.\nIt is important to emphasize that the optimal rate of in‡ation is derived from the primitives of redistribution and not the other way around. If we impose the arbitrage condition\ninto the planner’s problem, the optimal capital stock would be determined by z. In this\ncase, the e¤ects of savings in the stock of capital become irrelevant because the exogenous\narbitrage condition would determine the e¢ cient stock of capital, and the level would not\nnecessarily be consistent with the intergenerational discount factor :\n\n3.2\n3.2.1\n\nNumerical example\nFunctional forms and optimality\n\nThe numerical example compares the solution of the unconstrained e¢ cient problem with the\nconstrained one. The objective is to illustrate the di¤erences in capital stocks achieved by\nthese economies and the implied redistributional policies. We consider individual preferences\nof the form\n\nc11;t\nU (c1;t ; c2;t+1 ) =\n1\n\nc12;t+1\n+\n;\n1\n\n(34)\n\nand the technology is Cobb-Douglas such that f (k) = Ak : For this functional form, the\nunconstrained e¢ cient problem has a closed form solution. The optimal level of capital\ndepends on the intergenerational parameter .

The reason is that as more weight is placed on the\nfuture young, the current cohort must save more and reduce its consumption. This increases\nthe endogenous component\nFor low values of\n\n2\n\nand prevents the economy from achieving the e¢ cient solution.\n\nthe model predicts the opposite e¤ect. The economy is not dynamically\n\nine¢ cient in the classical sense, r < n + , but the market solution can have too much or\ntoo little capital relative to the e¢ cient (dynamically e¢ cient) level.\nThe redistributional constraints have important implications for the cross section of consumption. Figure 4 compares the share of consumption of the young cohorts as a fraction of\n\n15\n\n\ftotal consumption.\nFigure 4: Consumption Share Young Cohort\n0.65\nEfficient\nConstrained\n\nConsumption Young(%)\n\n0.6\n\n0.55\n\n0.5\n\n0.45\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n1\n1.1\n1.2\nIntergenerational Discounting (\nλ)\n\n1.3\n\nIn the presence of lump-sum transfers, a larger value of\n\n1.4\n\n1.5\n\nimplies a greater share of\n\nconsumption for the young. However, in the constrained e¢ cient steady state, the relative\nweight of old cohorts,\n\n2;t ,\n\nincreases. As a result, the young cohorts’share of consumption\n\ndecreases. The reason is that the only way to achieve a higher capital stock is to decrease\nconsumption of the young. The absence of intergenerational transfers prevents increasing\nboth consumption and capital simultaneously.\n\n16\n\n\fFigure 5 shows the implied wedge consistent with the high savings rate\nFigure 5: Optimal Wedge\n\nWedge (<1= tax | >1= Subsidy)\n\n2\n\nEfficient\nConstrained\n\n1.8\n\n1.6\n\n1.4\n\n1.2\n\n1\n\n0.8\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n1\n1.1\n1.2\nIntergenerational Discounting (\nλ)\n\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\n1.5\n\nIn the market economy, young cohorts can only be induced to save more and reduce the\ncurrent consumption when the return from capital is higher than the marginal product of\ncapital. When the economy has too much capital relative to the e¢ cient level, the optimal\nstrategy is to reduce the return of savings of the old cohorts.\nThe notion of in‡ation or de‡ation should be viewed relative to the e¢ cient magnitude,\n. It is possible to construct examples where the constrained e¢ cient in‡ation rate is\nnegative\nof\n\n< 0 or\n\nwe have (\n\n> 0. The role of redistributional policy implies that for di¤erent ranges\n<\n\n) <\n\n( ) <\n\n(\n\n). When population growth is positive the\n\n>\n\nequilibrium interest rate is always positive r = n, and the redistribution is accomplished\nby changing the optimal rate of de‡ation z < 0. When the size of the population shrinks\n(i.e., after a baby boom), then r = n < 1 and the e¢ cient rate of in‡ation can be positive\nor negative depending on the distributional factor . Figure 6 summarizes the annualized\n\n17\n\n\fin‡ation rate implied by the model.\nFigure 6: Annualized In‡ation (n<0)\nx 10\n\n-3\n\nEfficient\nConstrained\n20\n\nInflation\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n1\n1.1\n1.2\nIntergenerational Discounting(\nλ)\n\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\n1.5\n\nIn this economy, the monetary equilibrium implies r < 1; and as a result the crossing\nline between e¢ cient and constraint implies\n\n> 0: The relevant result is not the level of\n\nin‡ation but the relative preference for di¤erent individuals in the population. This economy\nillustrates the basic trade-o¤ between the young and old. The young prefer higher in‡ation\n(or less de‡ation) and the old cohorts prefer the opposite. This trade-o¤ is clear in the\ne¢ cient economy and the constrained e¢ cient economy, but the relative di¤erence in both\neconomies is due to the absence of intergenerational transfers. When the old cohorts are\nrelatively more important, the optimal in‡ation rate is determined by the size of the capital\nstock. Ideally, it would be optimal to have more capital, but the young are the ones that\nneed to give up consumption to achieve the needed level of savings. Since this would violate\ntheir budget constraint, the resulting policy implies de‡ation (redistribution towards the\nold), but the magnitude is not as large as in the e¢ cient case because of the binding role of\nthe redistributional constraints.\nThe level of in‡ation depends on the growth rate of population. With stationary population, n = 0, the interest rate is always above one and the optimal in‡ation is always negative\nas can be seen in Figure 7.\n\n18\n\n\fFigure 7: Annualized In‡ation (n=0)\nEfficient\nConstrained\n0.01\n\n0.005\n\nInflation\n\n0\n\n-0.005\n\n-0.01\n\n-0.015\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n1\n1.1\n1.2\nIntergenerational Discounting( λ)\n\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\n1.5\n\nThe model also predicts that the young cohorts have a preference for a lower negative\ngrowth of money, whereas the old cohorts prefer a higher rate of de‡ation. The quantitative\nmagnitudes depend on the parameterization, but the qualitative tension between young and\nold cohorts is consistent with the political economy equilibrium of Bullard and Waller (2004).\nThe revenue/loss raised by the optimal wedge is rebated to the old cohort. Figure 8\ncompares the tax/transfers paid by the old generation for both economies.\nFigure 8: Taxes and Transfers\n1\n\nEfficient\nConstrained\n\n0\n-1\n\nTaxation\n\n-2\n-3\n-4\n-5\n-6\n-7\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n1\n1.1\n1.2\nIntergenerational Discounting (\nλ)\n\n19\n\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\n1.5\n\n\fFor a given value of ; the e¢ cient economy always has more redistribution than the\nconstrained e¢ cient one. When both economies achieve similar capital stock levels, the role\nof redistribution becomes less important, and the consumption shares of each cohort are\nnearly the same.\n\n4\n\nTransitional dynamics\n\nThe steady state calculations are only useful to illustrate the static trade-o¤. By de…nition,\nthe young and the old cohort have to face the same prices. The current young might earn\na high wage today, but will be an old cohort tomorrow earning a low rate of return. In the\ntransition path the stock of capital changes, therefore, the prices faces by a given generation\nat time t will be di¤erent to those face by the next generation at t + 1:\nThe intuition is clear from the Euler equation of the constrained e¢ cient problem\nc1;t =\n\nt+1\nt\n\n) Akt+11 ] + c2;t+1 1\n\nc1;t+1 [(1\n\n+\n\n2\n\nAkt+11 :\n\n(39)\n\nAn increase in savings reduces the consumption of the current young c1;t ; increases the\ncompensation of the future young cohort, c1;t+1 ; via wages and decreases the return from\nsavings of the young cohort next period, c2;t+1 : Because the current young and the future\nold are the same individuals, the relative weight\n\nt\n\ncancels.\n\nThe Euler equation of the e¢ cient solution is very di¤erent, but has the same economic\ninterpretation. The intergenerational redistribution is done directly, and as a result market\nprices are not distorted:\nc1;t =\n\nt+1\nt\n\nc1;t+1 1\n\n+ Akt+11 :\n\n(40)\n\nIt is clear from the expression that an increase of the relative weight of future cohorts,\nt+1 = t\n\n> 1; will reduce consumption of the current generation (increase in savings) relative\n\nto future generations. The increasing savings are sustained by intergenerational transfers.\nA simple way to capture the e¤ects of demographic changes is to adjust the relative\nimportance of a given cohort in the social welfare function. When current generations become\nrelatively more important than future generations, the capital stock will increase. A higher\ncapital stock reduces the return of savings and it increases workers’compensation.\nIn the experiment we adjust the initial discount rate\n\nso both economies start with the\n\nsame stock of capital. Therefore, the constrained economy is e¢ cient with an optimal wedge\n20\n\n\fequal to zero. The implied in‡ation is determined by the arbitrage condition between capital\nand money. We consider two di¤erent sequences of intergenerational weights f t g: In case\n\n1 the relative importance of young cohorts increases during a short number of periods. In\ncase 2, the high\n\nis maintained during a larger number of periods. The di¤erence sequences\n\nillustrated in Figure 9 summarize the behavior of the model in these two cases.\n\nFigure 9: Intergenerational Discount Rate\nCase 2: Persistent\n1.6\n\n1.4\n\n1.4\n\nIntergenerational Discounting\nλ) (\n\nIntergenerational Discounting\nλ) (\n\nCase 1: Transitory\n1.6\n\n1.2\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n1.2\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n0.4\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nThe interpretation we wish to use is that the young cohorts become temporarily more\nimportant in the determination of the optimal policy. The change is transitory and eventually\nreverts back the initial level. The change in the social discount rate has implications for\nsavings and consumption. The initial steady state is no longer optimal at the new discount\nrates f t g: The implicit baby boom generates a change in policy. To incentivize the savings\n\nthe rate of return of money has to decrease (this is the standard Tobin e¤ect in this model).\nThe implied policy generates a hump-shaped response from in‡ation.\n\n21\n\n80\n\n90\n\n\fFigure 10: Annualized In‡ation\nCase 1: Transitory\n\nCase 2: Persistent\n\n0.015\n\nx 10\n\n-3\n\nEfficient\nConstrained\n\n14\n12\nEfficient\nConstrained\n\nInflation (Annualized)\n\nInflation (Annualized)\n\n0.01\n\n0.005\n\n0\n\n-0.005\n\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n-6\n\n-0.01\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nFigure 10 summarizes the evolution of annualized in‡ation along the transition path. Both\neconomies increase the in‡ation rate relative to the initial steady state. The persistence\nof in‡ation is entirely determined by :5 Along the transition path the increase in savings\nincreases the compensation of working generations and reduces the return from savings\nfor the existing old. In the e¢ cient economy, the optimal in‡ation rate can be sustained\nvia intergenerational policy. The constrained economy has more limitations regarding the\ntransfer resources across generations. Market prices are the only mechanism for the young\nindividuals to save the right amount. As a result, the constrained in‡ation rate is lower\nduring the boom, but higher during the bust. The underlying income distribution between\nwage earners and the asset-holding generation places bounds on the optimal policy.\nThe increase in the savings rate reduces the return from capital and increases the workers\ncompensation. Figure 11 summarizes the evolution of real interest rates as a percentage\n\n5\n\nThe nature of the two-period problem requires an assumption of a high depreciation rate, and we used\n= 1: Given that all the capital depreciates from one period to the next one, the dynamics in terms of\nquantities per period are very fast.

As a result, the interest rate does not fall as much during the boom and\nworkers compensation cannot increase to the e¢ cient levels.\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nWe study the interaction between population demographics, the desire for redistribution in\nthe economy, and the optimal in‡ation rate in a deterministic economy with capital. In\nthe economy we study changes in the population structure are interpreted as the ability of\na particular cohort to in‡uence redistributive policy. The intergenerational redistribution\ntension is intrinsic in life-cycle models. Young cohorts have few assets, and wages are the\nmain source of income. Old generations work less and prefer a high rate of return from their\nsavings. When the government has access to lump-sum taxes and transfers, redistributive\npolicy does not have to resort to distortionary measures (such as capital taxes, or in‡ation).\nWhen lump-sum transfers are not possible but we allow the planner to use in‡ation or\nde‡ation to achieve as much of the redistribution as possible, there exists a competitive\nequilibrium with a constrained-optimal redistributive policy. The equilibrium entails optimal\ndistortions on relative prices that are necessary to achieve the constrained e¢ cient allocation.\nWhen the old have more in‡uence over this redistributive policy, the economy has a lower\n23\n\n90\n\n100\n\n\fsteady state level of capital, a higher steady state real rate of return, and a lower or negative\nrate of in‡ation. By contrast, when the young have more in‡uence the economy has more\ncapital than the e¢ cient level, wages are relatively high and the market solution requires a\nlow rate of return from money holdings, that is, a relatively high in‡ation rate.\nWhen demographics are changing, the constrained e¢ cient solution will entail an entire\ntransition path that will alter capital stocks, in‡ation, real wages, consumption, and other\nkey macroeconomic variables. In particular, a “baby boom”can generate temporarily higher\nin‡ation, and aging population dynamics will put downward pressure on in‡ation or even\nlead to de‡ation. This seems to be broadly consistent with the very rough evidence presented\nin Figures 1 and 2.\nIn this paper, we have allowed a planning problem to “stand in”for the political processes\nthat society uses to make decisions concerning redistributional policy. Some more concrete\nexamples of political processes are studied in Bullard and Waller (2004), including a “policy\ncommittee” that uses Nash bargaining to come to a social decision. In this paper, by contrast, the planner optimally chooses in‡ation or de‡ation to do as much of the desirable\nredistribution as possible given that in‡ation or de‡ation only provides a partial substitute\nfor a fully operational lump-sum tax and transfer scheme. The society could use other types\nof distortionary taxes to achieve similar goals, so we interpret the …ndings here as providing\nan assessment of the marginal contribution of in‡ation or de‡ation in this process taking the\nexisting distortionary tax system as …xed and immutable.\nTaken at face value, the results in this paper contribute to the debate concerning the\nobservation of mild de‡ation in Japan along with an aging population structure. The results\nsuggest that the aging population may be optimally associated with lower in‡ation as part of\nthe constrained e¢ cient equilibrium. We think it will be interesting to study this hypothesis\nfurther in models that can more realistically quantify these e¤ects.\n\nReferences\nBullard, J. and Waller, CJ (2004) Central bank design in general equilibrium.

He also discussed the collapse of the U.S. housing bubble and its\nimplications for the economy. “Recovery from this event is ongoing and will ultimately\ntake many years,” he said, noting that households are saddled with far too much\nmortgage debt compared with historical norms. “Monetary policy has been ultra-easy\nduring this period, but cannot reasonably encourage additional borrowing by\nhouseholds with too much debt,” he added.\nCurrent U.S. Monetary Policy\nMany analysts of the U.S. economy are pointing to a “global slowdown,” Bullard said.\nFor example, the Euro-area unemployment rate has increased over the past year, and\nChinese economic data has indicated slower growth than anticipated so far this year.\nWhile the U.S. data has been mixed in recent weeks, Bullard noted that “the outlook for\n2012 has not changed signi cantly so far,” with many expecting a stronger second\nquarter than rst quarter in terms of real GDP growth and a stronger second half of\n2012 than rst half.\nRegarding labor market conditions, Bullard said, “The recent nonfarm payrolls report\nwas disappointing, but not enough to substantially alter the contours of the U.S.\noutlook.” He added that seasonal adjustment factors may be disturbing the normal\ninterpretation of the data; when looking at non-seasonally adjusted data, employment\ngrowth from one year earlier is better in 2012 than in either 2010 or 2011.\nBullard noted that the situation in Europe has driven U.S. interest rates lower. “Both\nnominal and real interest rates have fallen substantially over the last year in the U.S.,” he\nsaid.\n“One possible FOMC strategy is to simply pocket the lower yields and continue to waitand-see on the U.S. economic outlook,” he said, adding that “current policy is already\nvery easy, as the policy rate remains near zero and the balance sheet remains large.”\nFurthermore, while the global problems are being driven by the continued turmoil in\nEurope, “a change in U.S. monetary policy at this juncture will not alter the situation in\nEurope,” Bullard stated.\n\n\fU.S. Housing Markets\nIn discussing the collapsed U.S. housing bubble, Bullard noted that most components\nof U.S. GDP – except for the components of investment related to real estate – have\nrecovered to or past their levels of the fourth quarter of 2007. “It is therefore not\nreasonable to claim that the ‘output gap’ is exceptionally large,” he said.\nThe “large output gap” view of the recent U.S. economy faces several di culties,\nBullard said. For instance, it suggests that GDP growth should be very rapid, that\nin ation should be much lower, and that the housing bubble did no lasting damage to\nthe economy.\nOn the other hand, the “lower trend growth” view provides a more natural explanation of\nevents, Bullard said. Based on this view, GDP growth is expected to be relatively slow,\nin ation can remain near the Fed’s in ation target of 2 percent, and the housing bubble\ndid lasting damage to the economy. “In short, this view suggests that most of the\nbusiness-cycle adjustment has already taken place, and that what remains is a slow\nrate of trend growth due to longer-term adjustment processes still taking place in real\nestate,” he concluded.\nBullard then spoke about the aftermath of the bubble. “It is neither feasible nor\ndesirable to attempt to re-in ate the housing bubble. The bubble did a lot of damage\nand should not be repeated,” Bullard said. “Policy should be directed to encouraging\nmarket-based adjustment as quickly as possible,” he added, noting that “allocating\nlosses to one group or another is not helpful in a macroeconomic sense.” He also said\nthat the housing bubble collapse may have shifted preferences for home ownership,\nwith the rent-versus-own decision shifting decidedly in favor of renting.\nThe crisis has also left U.S. households with more debt than they had intended, Bullard\nsaid, adding that “this is the rst U.S. recession in which deleveraging has played a key\nrole.” It will take a long time for homeowners with mortgage debt to return to the\nnormal loan-to-value ratio of roughly 60 percent, he said, noting that “it is not a matter\nof business-cycle frequency adjustment.”\nBullard also discussed some geographic aspects of the housing bubble, noting that in\nMarch 2006, mortgage conditions (as measured by the percentage of mortgages 30plus days past due or in foreclosure) were pristine. While mortgage distress peaked in\n2010, mortgage conditions remained distressed in March 2012 throughout much of the\nU.S.\n“We should expect and plan for slow adjustment in housing markets,” Bullard said.\n\nGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\nCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\nEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\nOn the Economy Blog\n\n\fOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\nLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\nBridges\nEconomic Synopses\nHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.

In particular,\nhe noted that the policy rate remains near-zero, the large Fed balance sheet remains in\nplace, “Operation Twist” is still ongoing and will alter the balance sheet composition\nthrough the end of this year, and the calendar-date guidance regarding the rst increase\nin the policy rate remains in effect.\n“In short, current monetary policy remains ultra-easy and is likely appropriately\ncalibrated to the current situation,” Bullard said.\nHe noted that “most analysis suggests Fed actions have helped produce very low\nnominal and real interest rates across the yield curve.” Based on his own calculations,\nBullard estimated that yields would normally be considerably higher given current\nmacroeconomic conditions. Part of the explanation for the low rates, he stated, is that\ncontinued turmoil in Europe has caused U.S. interest rates to fall due to a “ ight-tosafety” effect.\nIn further discussion regarding the European sovereign debt crisis, Bullard said that it\ndoes not have easy solutions and noted that the crisis is fundamentally about countries\nthat have borrowed too heavily on international debt markets. “This is not a problem\nthat monetary policy can remedy,” he emphasized, adding that “attempts to use\n\n\fmonetary policy to x scal problems have historically ended with substantial\nin ation.” Therefore, he stated, “Debt problems take a long time to work out, so we\nshould expect a drawn-out adjustment process in Europe.”\nIn discussing the effects of European turmoil on the U.S., Bullard said that recent\nspillover has come mostly in the form of lower U.S. interest rates and that, so far,\nnancial stress in the U.S. has increased only modestly. While U.S. nancial rms have\nhigher levels of capital now than they did in 2008, he said, “In the event of a severe\nnancial shock, the Fed could re-open liquidity facilities pioneered during 2008-2009.”\nRegarding U.S. labor markets, Bullard noted that they have improved over the last year,\ndespite relatively slow economic growth. In particular, the unemployment rate has\nfallen by 0.8 percentage points (from 9 percent in May 2011 to 8.2 percent in May\n2012). “This is relatively fast compared to U.S. macroeconomic history over the last 25\nyears,” he stated.\nOn U.S. in ation, Bullard noted that it is close to the FOMC’s 2 percent target by many\nmeasures and that expected in ation is near target as well. Despite some claiming that\n“price level targeting” would make a difference, Bullard pointed out that “the U.S. price\nlevel appears to be quite close to an appropriate price level path.” Furthermore, the U.S.\nprice level has not strayed from an appropriate path as it did in Japan during the 1990s\nand in the U.S. during the 1930s, he said.\nRisks to Current Fed Policy\nBullard then discussed some of the possible risks to the FOMC’s current policy. “The\nultra-easy monetary policy has been appropriate so far, but could reignite a 1970s-type\nexperience globally if pursued too aggressively,” he said, noting that the 1970s era\nincluded four recessions in 13 years, double-digit in ation and double-digit\nunemployment. “The lesson was clear,” Bullard said. “Do not let the in ation genie out\nof the bottle.”\nRegarding other potential risks, including concerns that the FOMC has done too little,\nBullard said, “If anything, the Committee may be trying to do too much with monetary\npolicy, risking monetary instability for the U.S. and the global economy.” He added that\nshould the U.S. economy encounter further negative shocks, “the Committee can\nrespond as appropriate to a signi cant deterioration relative to the current forecast.”\nBullard then explained the risks inherent in considering changes in monetary policy to\nimprove the U.S. employment outlook, noting that it is important to remember that\n“monetary policy is a blunt instrument which affects the decision making of everyone in\nthe economy.” Given that labor market policies (e.g., unemployment insurance, worker\nretraining) have direct effects on the unemployed, “It may be better to focus on labor\nmarket policies to directly address unemployment instead of taking further risks with\nmonetary policy,” he said.\nAnother potential risk is distortions in the economy, Bullard said, noting that the nearzero rate policy has been in place for more than three years now, and it is projected to\nremain in place for several more. “The near-zero rates cause other distortions in the\neconomy, including punishing savers,” he said.\nFed Communications\n“The FOMC has increased the degree of transparency surrounding monetary policy in a\nvariety of ways since the 1990s,” Bullard said. For example, in January 2012, the FOMC\nbegan releasing participants’ forecasts of the future path for the policy rate.\nAlthough the economy is described by many variables, Bullard noted that the Fed’s\ncurrent communication strategy operates with only a few variables. “The FOMC could\n\n\finstead publish a quarterly document akin to the Bank of England’s ‘In ation Report,’” he\nsaid.\n“A report of this type could potentially lay down a benchmark ‘Fed view’ on the key\nissues facing the U.S. economy,” Bullard said, adding that “FOMC participants could\npoint out where their views differ from the benchmark.” Furthermore, he said, the\nrelease of the report could be coordinated with Chairman Bernanke’s quarterly press\nbrie ngs. Such a report could provide “a broader discussion of the U.S. outlook,”\nBullard said.\n\nGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\nCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\nEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\nOn the Economy Blog\nOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\nLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\nBridges\nEconomic Synopses\nHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.

        "content": "The Global Economy and the European Sovereign Debt Crisis\nOMFIF Golden Series Lecture\nLondon\nJuly 10, 2012\nIntroduction\nRecent readings on the global economic outlook have been tepid. Europe taken as a whole is in\na recessionary state, and the uncertain effects of the ongoing sovereign debt crisis continue to\nweigh on the medium-term outlook. Global investors are dividing Europe once again into\nmember states, a sort of market-based disintegration of the continent. The U.S. is growing, but\nat a sluggish pace. Recent data from China suggest a slower pace of growth than might have\nbeen expected earlier this year. Commodity prices have fallen to lower levels during recent\nmonths in part in response to the slowing global economy. Inflation readings have generally\nbeen lower. This constellation of data is causing considerable unease in global financial\nmarkets and in policymaking circles. Much of the unease can be traced to the increasing\nrealization that the European sovereign debt crisis may be more traumatizing and more\nintractable than previously understood.\nIn this talk, I will begin with the policy situation in the U.S., and I will argue that among many\nfactors affecting the U.S. in the medium term, the ongoing European crisis is the most pressing\none from the U.S. point of view. Accordingly, I will then turn to discuss some aspects of the\npresent European debate on the crisis, including the notion of exit from the eurozone and the\npossibility of a grand bargain outcome with increased political and fiscal cooperation within\nEurope. I will also discuss increased economic growth as a helpful tonic for the crisis. I will\nstress that while growth is certainly desirable, increased government spending today followed\nby higher future taxes is not likely to produce more rapid growth. I will conclude that the most\nlikely way forward continues to be a long period of debt paydown and sluggish growth, both in\nEurope and the U.S., and that the most pressing policy issue is to accept this path and prevent\nany additional problems from developing as we press ahead.\nMy remarks here today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of others on the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\n\fThe U.S. Situation\nThe U.S. economy remains on a modest growth path. The housing bubble and the ensuing\nfinancial crisis probably did some lasting damage to the economy, suggesting that the output\ngap in the U.S. is not as large as commonly believed and that the growth rate of potential\noutput is modest. This helps explain why U.S. growth continues to be sluggish, why U.S.\ninflation has remained close to target instead of dropping precipitously and why U.S.\nunemployment has fallen over the last year—from a level of 9.1 percent in June 2011 to 8.2\npercent in June 2012. This pace of improvement in unemployment has not occurred since the\nmiddle of the 1990s. The most recent labor market data for the U.S. were somewhat weaker\nthan expected, with the unemployment rate remaining at 8.2 percent and the total private\nsector payroll jobs added coming in at 84,000. However, the hours figures were somewhat\nmore encouraging, and unemployment claims remain below the threshold value of 400,000.\nAccordingly, this report, by itself, is not sufficient to change my forecast of modestly improving\neconomic growth during the second half of 2012 along with a slow and intermittent decline in\nunemployment.\nU.S. monetary policy has been aggressively easy for more than four years, and all the policy\nactions remain in effect today. The Committee lowered the policy rate substantially in the\nbeginning of 2008. Later that year, the policy rate was lowered to near-zero, where it remains\nto this day. In addition, the Committee embarked on balance sheet policy, buying mortgagedbacked securities beginning in 2009 and buying Treasuries through the QE2 program beginning\nin the last months of 2010. The Fed’s balance sheet remains exceptionally large today due to\nthese outright purchases. The Committee took additional actions in 2011, offering forward\nguidance on the length of time the policy rate is currently anticipated to remain near-zero and\nintroducing a new Operation Twist program aimed at lowering Treasury yields at longer\nmaturities.\nThe Twist program was extended at the June 2012 meeting, in part as a reaction to incoming\ndata suggesting a slower pace of growth in the U.S. and globally. Some estimates have\nsuggested that the Twist extension is akin to a 25-50 basis point reduction in the policy rate in\nnormal times. Given the lags in the effects of monetary policy, it will now take some time to\nsee the impact of this action and to see whether or not the economy can meet the current set\nof expectations on performance during the remainder of 2012.\nThe U.S. economy is also being held back by significant uncertainties both within the U.S. and\nglobally. Uncertainty is inhibiting both household and investor behavior. The U.S. fiscal\n2\n\n\fsituation is similar to that of some countries in Europe and requires dramatic and sustained\nattention. The political compromise in the U.S. has been to delay action until after the\nNovember election, but markets tend to pull the uncertainty forward. Housing activity in the\nU.S. remains well below the levels experienced during the bubble period and seems likely to\nimprove only slowly over the coming years. The U.S. healthcare system is about to engage in a\nmajor transformation, the effects of which are opaque. But even more pressing is the situation\nin Europe. The crisis is contributing to recession, adding a dragging factor on U.S. and Asian\nperformance. There is a financial sector dimension which periodically threatens to expand into\na more generalized financial crisis. It has been difficult for many in the U.S. to envision how the\nsituation will develop going forward.\n\nThe Incentives for Exit\nDebt problems take a long time to work out. We know from individual household situations\nthat many with excessive debt enter into multiyear programs that force a routine level of debt\npaydown and force saving while curtailing consumption. Households can and do sell assets if\nthey have them, and might search for extra income if opportunities are available. Like\ncountries, they can be cut off from credit markets, and rebuilding reputations can take time.\nThere simply are no real shortcuts in this process. The general advice for households has been\nto use credit wisely, borrowing only to make key personal investments that have a clear\nprobability of paying off or to smooth consumption. When the discussion turns to\nmacroeconomics, these principles are sometimes forgotten in a blizzard of analysis, but I think\nthey basically apply.\nOne of the principal issues facing policymakers inside Europe (and worrying those outside) is\nexit from the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Exit is often portrayed as a crisisproducing event, as it would suggest the use of alternative and presumably much weaker\ncurrencies to pay back external debt. In this sense, it would be a way to partially default, as is\nalways the case with surprise inflation and devaluation. Markets are reacting by pricing in\nsome probability that such an event could occur, even though the official line is that it cannot.\nThe EMU was formed from a subset of EU countries, and so some countries famously remain\noutside the EMU—the leading example being the U.K. Since not all countries joined, it would\nseem that the experiment might have allowed exit from the EMU, but it did not. In addition,\nthere are European nations that are euroized (using the euro) even though they are not part of\n3\n\n\fthe EMU. These arrangements give me pause concerning the meaning of exit from the EMU—\nclearly some countries never joined and others have joined in a de facto sense.\nThe EMU can be viewed as a club, and members enjoy benefits that do not accrue to\nnonmembers. The value of being a member was originally to get German credibility on\nmonetary policy. Countries choosing not to join calculated that they could run an equally\neffective monetary policy to the Germans and so decided not to join. The value of club\nmembership was highest for countries with the least amount of credibility on monetary policy.\nThe initial success of the EMU was stunning, driving yields on all EMU member debt essentially\nto German levels. This created a great environment for investment and stability within the\nEMU.\nThe logic of exit suggests that if the club is valuable, member countries will not want to leave,\njust as they desired to get in initially. Survey evidence seems to indicate that these incentives\nto stay in the club remain strong today. Still, the common refrain that no country can ever be\nallowed to leave the EMU is altering the incentives for nations to take the actions necessary to\nmaintain membership. This is one of the main penalties that in principle should be enforcing\nthe equilibrium behavior among the members of the club. Russell Cooper of the European\nUniversity Institute and Penn State University has recently written extensively on this topic. 1\nThe incentive effects for club membership are critical in another way. For countries that are\nalready members, taking on country credit risk through mutualization is also damaging their\nincentives to remain in the club. They enjoy the benefits of membership, but the calculus could\nchange if they see too many disadvantages from the policies undertaken to keep the union\ntogether. Countries can, in principle, remain on the outside and also do well, as Sweden has\ndemonstrated.\nIn short, my view is that the incentive effects for a member country to remain in the EMU must\nbe considered very carefully going forward. Policies should be designed with an eye toward\nthese incentives, and can no longer assume that the political processes will back the EMU in all\ncircumstances.\n\n1\n\nSee Russell Cooper, 2012, “Exit from a Monetary Union through Euroization: Discipline without Chaos,” NBER\nWorking Paper No. 17908.\n\n4\n\n\fGrand Bargains\nFrom the beginning of the sovereign debt crisis, analysts, policymakers and financial market\nparticipants have craved a simple and sharp solution to the problem. My earlier remarks\nsuggested that debt problems are unlikely to have quick solutions and, therefore, that we\nshould expect a long and slow resolution process peppered with bouts of increased financial\nstress. Still, there is one possibility for a grand bargain that makes some sense and that has\nbeen increasingly discussed in policy circles. This is the notion that Europe has reached a\n“Hamilton moment.”\nThomas Sargent, in his Nobel prize lecture, discussed some of the parallels between the U.S.\ncolonies at the time of the ratification of the U.S. constitution and the current situation in\nEurope. 2 Alexander Hamilton was a proponent of a more powerful national government for the\nmember states, then bound together by the Articles of Confederation. The states had\nconsiderable debts. In a famous compromise, the new and stronger national government\nassumed the states’ debts under certain conditions. Could something similar happen in today’s\nEurope? Certainly there are many calling for greater fiscal and political union.\nA common refrain in U.S. policy circles is that while some EMU countries have considerable\ndebt problems, Europe as a whole has sufficient resources to contain the situation. The debtGDP ratio for the EMU as a whole is 87 percent, not that different from and arguably better\nthan the U.S., depending on how U.S. obligations are counted. A stronger “national”\ngovernment for Europe could hold and service that level of debt. Member states could transfer\ntoday’s debts to the European level, likely in exchange for balanced-budget amendments or\nsimilar binding restrictions on future borrowing and a ceding of greater power to the Europeanwide government. Powers of the European Parliament, in particular taxing authority, might be\nincreased.\nPut starkly as a grand bargain like this, what Sargent termed a “political revolution,” such a deal\nseems remote at the current juncture. But the basic building blocks of a deal are in place, as\nthey were in Hamilton’s time. Much of the current maneuvering in Europe has elements of this\ntype of bargain: In particular, the discussion of a fiscal compact and ideas concerning debt\nmutualization. This makes me put some probability on a sunnier outcome for the situation. On\nthe downside, however, I do not have the sense as an outsider to Europe that there is sufficient\n\n2\n\nThomas Sargent, 2012, “U.S. then, Europe now,” manuscript, New York University. Delivered as the Nobel\nLecture, Dec. 8, 2011.\n\n5\n\n\fpolitical support for a ceding of sovereign authority to the European level. This is making me\nkeep my baseline case as one of a slow paydown of debt in an environment of slow growth.\n\nGrowth and Fiscal Stabilization Policy\nIt is often noted that more rapid economic growth would help solve a lot of problems—and I\nhave to agree. My reading of the literature concerning economic growth is that growth\ndepends on innovation, improvements in technology, human capital and other long-run factors.\nIt is not really a matter of government spending in the abstract or of monetary policy. I am\nworried that a growth agenda interpreted as a government spending agenda instead of a focus\non the factors actually driving economic growth will not succeed and may make problems\nworse.\nI have been disappointed in the debate concerning fiscal stabilization policy in the U.S. over the\npast several years, and I have written about it extensively in recent months. 3 We have a\nleading theory of how fiscal stabilization policy could work in some circumstances, a theory that\nrespects what is known and has been learned concerning fiscal stabilization policy over the last\nseveral decades. 4 My sense is that there is a mismatch between what the theory suggests\nmight be reasonable policy in the current environment and what is generally proposed in policy\ndiscussions. Critically, the theory suggests that the stance and efficacy of monetary policy is a\nkey feature in determining the success of a fiscal expansion, a topic addressed only in the rarest\nof macroeconomic quarters. Perhaps the broadest point is to say that according to the leading\ntheory, a certain type of fiscal expansion can substitute for a missing monetary policy (missing\nbecause of the zero lower bound), and is not a complement to monetary policy. The policy\ndiscussion almost always treats the two as complements, perhaps in the spirit of “throwing\neverything at the problem.”\nOne very concrete version of this would proceed as follows. If you think, as I do, that monetary\npolicy can be effective even with the policy rate at the zero lower bound, then one should not\ntalk about fiscal supplements to that policy because, according to the theory, that would not\nmake sense. Further, if monetary policy is appropriately calibrated given the current\nmacroeconomic situation, as I believe it is in the U.S., then we have the countercyclical policy\nwe need in place. For those who think, on the other hand, that monetary policy is not effective\n3\n\nSee James Bullard, 2012, “Death of a Theory,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, 94(2): 83-101.\nSee Michael Woodford, 2011, “Simple Analytics of the Government Expenditure Multiplier,” American Economic\nJournal: Macroeconomics, 3(1): 1-35.\n4\n\n6\n\n\fonce the zero lower bound is encountered, the focus should be exclusively on fiscal stabilization\npolicy, and supplements from monetary policy would be a distraction. However, the basic fiscal\nintervention required is a tax-financed increase in expenditure, not a deficit-financed one. Even\nthis will have the intended effects only if implemented in a relatively precise way.\nIn short, while more rapid economic growth is very much a desirable outcome, I am doubtful it\ncan be achieved through traditional fiscal expansion. In the medium term, it may be possible to\nundertake structural reforms both in the U.S. and in Europe and improve growth prospects,\nsomething I would very much favor, but that should not be expected to improve the crisis\nsituation in the very near term.\n\nSummary\nThe global economy is facing a slowdown combined with an ongoing sovereign debt crisis in\nEurope. I have argued that among the many cross-currents and uncertainties facing the U.S.\neconomy, the most important one is the continued uncertainty emanating from the European\nsituation.\nI have also presented some comments on aspects of the crisis. In my view, the notion of the\nincentives of nations to leave the EMU has received too little attention up to now, perhaps on a\njudgment that the debt situations could be managed without raising such a possibility. In the\ncurrent environment, these incentives have to be calculated and taken seriously. While I have\nsome sympathy for the idea that Europe may be facing its own “Hamilton moment” and, thus,\nthat the outlines of a grand bargain solution to the sovereign debt crisis may be faintly visible,\nas of now I continue to put low probability on such an outcome. I have also stressed that I am\nvery supportive of efforts to increase the pace of economic growth both in Europe and the U.S.,\nbut that I do not think growth prospects can be meaningfully improved through traditional\nfiscal expansion. Instead, I think structural reforms which improve medium-term growth\nprospects are more likely to be successful.\n\nJames Bullard, President and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\n7\n\n\f",

In Bullard’s view what should have happened, in fact, is what actually\nhappened. Given that “price level targeting” can be the optimal policy according to\nsome leading theories, he said that one possible monetary policy response was for the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to maintain the price level on its established\npath. “The FOMC has in fact essentially behaved as if it was price level targeting. In\nthis sense, policy since 2008 looks close to optimal,” he said, calling this “a singular\nachievement of recent monetary policy.”\nBullard also discussed the aftermath of the large shock to the economy. “As the dust\nhas settled since 2008, it has become more and more apparent that U.S. real GDP is\ngrowing along a different path than the bubble-induced, pre-crisis path,” he said. He\nnoted this is consistent with key ndings of Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, who\nanalyzed nancial crises over the past 800 years and concluded that post- nancial\ncrisis economies grow more slowly.\nBullard said that the Reinhart-Rogoff effect has implications for future monetary policy.\nFor example, “Attempting to target nominal GDP without adjustment for the ReinhartRogoff effect could be a policy disaster,” he said.\nIn light of too much debt in the economy, Bullard noted that alternative theories of\noptimal policy include the idea that surprise in ation is a way to partially default on\ndebt. However, “That type of policy choice would likely impair U.S. credit markets into\nthe distant future,” he said.\nPrice Level Targeting and the Actual Price Level\nIn looking closer at price level targeting, Bullard cited a leading theory that has been\nextensively analyzed by Michael Woodford and co-authors. Bullard stated that the main\nidea in the theory is that prices are “sticky” and therefore do not adjust immediately to\nchanges in supply and demand conditions. He noted that optimal monetary policy\ncorrects for this de ciency. “When the economy is hit by a shock, the optimal policy\nreturns the price level back to its previous path.” Thus, he said that the behavior of the\naggregate price level might be viewed as a “signature” of optimal monetary policy.\n\n\fThe advice from Woodford’s model, Bullard said, is that policymakers should take care\nto keep the price level on an established path when a large shock hits the economy.\nIndeed, this basic advice seems to have been implemented in the U.S., he stated, noting\nthat the current U.S. price level is not far from the path established during the mid1990s. “This could be interpreted as ‘monetary policy has done exactly what it was\nsupposed to do in response to the large shock,’” he said. Bullard explained that the\nFOMC simply kept in ation close to 2 percent even in the face of the large shock, rather\nthan explicitly stating that maintaining the price level path was an ultimate goal.\nThe Reinhart-Rogoff Effect and Nominal GDP Targeting\nBullard said that some shocks may be so large and so unusual that they cause\nespecially severe damage to the economy. To that end, Reinhart and Rogoff showed\nthat the aftermath of major nancial crises tends to be marked by many years of\nslower-than-normal growth. Bullard noted that this seems to have happened in the U.S.\n“Before 2007, growth was likely arti cially high due to the housing bubble. After 2009,\ngrowth has likely been slowed by deleveraging,” he said.\nBullard then discussed the implications of the Reinhart-Rogoff effect for nominal GDP\ntargeting. “Nominal GDP includes both the price level and real GDP in one aggregate; it\ndoes not separate the two,” he explained. “The aggregate price level seems to be right\nabout on target. Real GDP, on the other hand, seems to have been markedly in uenced\nby the Reinhart-Rogoff effect,” he said, observing that real GDP has grown slowly in\nrecent years.\nIn fact, simply comparing nominal GDP with its 1990-2008 trend might lead one to\nconclude that U.S. monetary policy has been far off track—that is, way too tight—in\nrecent years, Bullard said. However, “The one variable the Fed can control in the\nmedium and long term, the aggregate price level, is exactly on track,” he stated. “The\nproblem is the failure to adjust nominal GDP for the Reinhart-Rogoff effect.” After\nadjusting appropriately for the Reinhart-Rogoff effect, he noted, nominal GDP is also\nabout on target.\n“Attempts to push nominal GDP higher would push the price level off its path, violating\nthe signature of optimal monetary policy,” Bullard said.\nThe Problem of Too Much Debt\nBullard noted that while monetary policy is supposed to “ x” the “sticky price” distortion\nin Woodford’s model by keeping the price level on its path in the face of disturbances,\nrelying only on that model to try to understand the current U.S. situation might not be\nwise. “The actual U.S. economy seems to have a very different problem: too much\ndebt,” he said.\nBullard said that in ation is sometimes seen as a way to partially default on existing\nnominal debts; if actual in ation is higher than anticipated, the debtor ends up paying\nless to the lender in real terms. In this scenario, he said, “The partial default would\noccur against savers, mostly older U.S. households, and against foreign creditors.”\nSuch a policy would not be without future costs, Bullard emphasized. “A partial default\ntoday through higher in ation would be paid for via higher in ation premiums in future\nborrowing,” he said. “Creditors would want to protect themselves against the\nunpredictable central bank that might surprise them with a burst of in ation. Nominal\ninterest rates would be higher than otherwise into the distant future.”\nThus, “it is unlikely that partial default through in ation is good policy,” even in models\nwhere there can be “too much debt,” Bullard said. “This type of policy would likely\nimpair U.S. credit markets for many years,” he emphasized.\n\n\fGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\nCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\nEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\nOn the Economy Blog\nOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\nLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\nBridges\nEconomic Synopses\nHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.

LOUIS – Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard gave remarks\nThursday night on “Shadow Interest Rates and the Stance of U.S. Monetary Policy,” as\npart of the Ninth Annual Corporate Finance Conference held at the Olin Business\nSchool at Washington University in St. Louis.\nPinning down the stance of monetary policy in a zero lower bound environment is very\nchallenging. During his presentation, Bullard posed the question of whether current\nU.S. monetary policy is “too easy.” He cited recent research by Leo Krippner, a nancial\nmarket economist at the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, which suggests that current\nU.S. monetary policy may be considerably easier than commonly understood. “In\nparticular, the current U.S. policy stance may be substantially easier than the policy\nstance recommended by commonly-used monetary policy feedback rules,” Bullard said.\nA Shadow Policy Rate\nThe level of nominal short-term interest rates is conventionally taken to indicate the\nstance of policy, Bullard said, noting that lower values are described as “easier” policy.\nHowever, given that the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC’s) policy rate has\nbeen near zero since December 2008, how should the monetary policy stance be\ndescribed? Bullard said that when the policy rate is near zero, a “shadow short-term\nrate” can be understood as a metric for the stance of monetary policy.\nKrippner calculates such a shadow rate, which is currently about -5 percent. It\naveraged -5.12 percent from August 2010, when Chairman Ben Bernanke indicated that\nadditional asset purchases may be needed, to the end of October 2012. Krippner’s\ncalculation is a modi ed version of the approach by the late Fischer Black, who was a\nleader in mathematical nance.\nImplications for U.S. Monetary Policy\nBullard noted that in recent years, it has become popular to describe the desired level of\nthe policy rate by using versions of Taylor-type policy rules. One such rule is often\ncalled the Taylor (1999) rule. These rules relate the current value of the policy rate to\nmacroeconomic variables (e.g., in ation and the output gap or unemployment gap).\n“Most policy rules in this class currently recommend a negative policy rate,” he said.\nSince the recommended short-term rate cannot be negative, he explained, one\ninterpretation is that unconventional policies have been needed to try to achieve the\nrecommended policy rate.\n\n\fUsing the Krippner calculation of a shadow short-term nominal interest rate as a\nmeasure of actual policy, Bullard compared this shadow rate with the recommended\npolicy rate from a standard policy rule. “According to these estimates, the shadow\npolicy rate is currently more than 300 basis points lower than the rate recommended by\nthe Taylor (1999) rule,” he said. “This suggests that actual U.S. monetary policy may\ncurrently be easier than the recommendations from that particular rule.”\nAnother implication, he said, is that policy may have been too tight relative to this\nrecommended policy rate in 2009, at which point the FOMC had not yet taken many of\nits unconventional policy actions, such as forward guidance and QE2. “The actual\npolicy stance as measured by the shadow rate has recently been more volatile than\nduring the pre-2008 era,” Bullard added. “This may be because monetary policy has\nbeen harder to interpret during the period of the zero lower bound.”\nThe Value of Unconventional Policy\nAccording to Bullard, the Krippner study provides one way to evaluate the FOMC’s\nrecent unconventional policy actions. “Signi cant unconventional policy actions at\ntimes seem to conform well with movements in the shadow policy rate,” Bullard said,\nnoting that times of less conformity may indicate an ineffective policy action.\nHe added, “The accumulation of policy actions since 2008 has generally been\nassociated with a continuing decline in the level of the shadow rate—that is, an easier\nand easier policy stance.” He also noted that Krippner’s results are consistent with\nother estimates (e.g., those of San Francisco Fed President John Williams in a 2011\nEconomic Letter).\n“Current policy may be easier than often perceived,” Bullard said. “These ndings are\ninteresting and I encourage further and more detailed analysis in this area.”\n\nGENERAL\nHome\nAbout Us\nBank Supervision\nCareers\nCommunity Development\nEconomic Education\nEvents\nInside the Economy Museum\nNewsroom\nOn the Economy Blog\nOpen Vault Blog\nOUR DISTRICT\nLittle Rock Branch\nLouisville Branch\nMemphis Branch\nAgricultural Finance Monitor\nHousing Market Conditions\nSELECTED PUBLICATIONS\n\n\fBridges\nEconomic Synopses\nHousing Market Perspectives\nIn the Balance\nPage One Economics\nThe Quarterly Debt Monitor\nReview\nRegional Economist\nST.
