        "content": "Opening remarks by President James Bullard\n38th Annual Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Fall Conference\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nOct. 10-11, 2013\nIt is my pleasure to welcome you to the St. Louis Fed 2013 Fall Conference. This is the 38th year\nfor this conference. I want to thank Alex Monge and YiLi Chien for putting this very provocative\nprogram together. I am looking forward to the stimulating discussion these papers are sure to\ninspire over the next day and a half.\nAt the St. Louis Fed, we have long tried to provide perspectives on whether the policies\nadopted in the past still serve us well today and whether recent developments at the frontier of\nresearch can be fruitfully applied to improve policy. This agenda has become especially\nimportant in the past few years, as the Fed and central banks around the world have struggled\nto devise appropriate policy responses to the current macroeconomic situation.\nIn polite economist society, there has long been a distinction between what is known as\n“frontier” research and what is sometimes called “policy” research. In my view, this has been\nand continues to be a false dichotomy. There is no such distinction: “Policy” and “frontier”\nresearch are two sides of the same coin. We need to understand both how fundamental\nmechanisms in the economy operate as well as how current data can be interpreted in terms of\nfundamental theory.\nIn short, advanced economic theory has to be made more relevant for actual policy, and actual\npolicy has to understand and embrace the difficult ideas advanced in the theoretical world. The\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis has long been a leader in supporting research at the\nintersection of economic theory and economic policy.\nWe are fortunate this year to have an outstanding group of speakers whose research expands\nour understanding of key contemporary issues in macroeconomics. This year’s conference\ncovers a wide range of topics: from the labor market to financial markets, from macroeconomic\ndynamics and monetary policy to the lifecycle behavior of households.\n\n\fConcerning current and near-term macroeconomic issues, this year’s agenda includes papers\nexamining:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nthe behavior of the federal funds market;\ninterest rate risk exposure for banks in the U.S.;\nthe distribution of firms ranked by their degree of financial soundness;\nmoney and the role of financial intermediation;\na New Keynesian macroeconomy with important labor market frictions;\nthe effects of leverage restrictions on financial intermediaries; and\nthe effects of large-scale asset purchases in an environment with endogenous collateral\nconstraints.\n\nWe also have a group of papers focusing on the lifecycle behavior of households. The topics in\nthis section include:\n•\n•\n\ninequality in health spending across income groups; and\nthe links between home production, retirement and labor supply elasticities.\n\nI know that these papers and the ideas they contain will contribute importantly to the\nmacroeconomic discussion in the coming years as the papers are eventually published and the\nresults become more widely known in the profession. The St. Louis Fed is proud to provide this\nforum for discussion and analysis of the leading issues of the day.\nLet me again welcome all of you to the St. Louis Fed Fall Conference. Thanks very much for\ncoming, and now let’s get to work!\n\nJames Bullard, President and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\n\f"

        "content": "Opening remarks by President James Bullard\nFederal Reserve/CSBS Community Banking Research Conference\nCommunity Banking in the 21st Century\nSt. Louis, Mo.\nOct. 2, 2013\n\nGood afternoon and welcome to the conference.\nOver the past 20 years, we have seen a material and sustained change in the structure of\nbanking in the United States. There were more than 10,000 community bank charters 20 years\nago. As of the end of 2012, there were approximately 6,000 community bank charters. Over\nthat same time period, the percentage of banking assets in community banks also changed\ndramatically. Twenty years ago, community banks held nearly 50 percent of all banking assets\nin the United States. Today, they hold 17 percent, while 83 percent of the assets are held by\nthe largest 84 banks with more than $10 billion in total assets.\nThe past five years have further challenged community banks, with nearly 500 bank failures\nover that time. These failures were handled in a relatively routine fashion, with little fanfare\nand little damage to banking services in affected areas. It was capitalism at work: Those banks\nwith poor business results had to admit defeat by market forces and close their doors. There\nwere no bailouts for these business owners.\nThose community banks that survived and thrived through the crisis and its aftermath retain an\nimportant role in the U.S. economy. For example, although community banks account for only\n20 percent of all loans made by commercial banks, they account for 52 percent of the small\nbusiness and farm loans. And, equally as important, community banks are a community\npartner. They have a stake in the economic health of the communities they serve.\nThe future of community banks is important—to both the economy and the communities they\nserve. At the St. Louis Fed, we support increased research on community banking and\nencourage policymakers to be cognizant of the value of these institutions.\nI know that state bank commissioners have been an important partner in encouraging quality\nresearch on the topic of community banking. We place a high value on our shared supervisory\nresponsibilities with the states—that relationship is clearly reflected in our audience today as\nwe have more than half of the state commissioners in the audience with us today.\n\n\fI would also like to express my sincere appreciation for the strong support of Chairman\nBernanke and Governor Jay Powell. Both are keenly interested in matters affecting community\nbanks.\nMy next official duty is to introduce Chairman Bernanke. Chairman Bernanke has come to the\nright city at the right time. As I understand it, Washington has shut down and is no longer\nplaying baseball, the Chairman’s favorite sport. St. Louis has not shut down and continues to\nplay baseball; so, consider St. Louis your home for baseball, Mr. Chairman.\nBen Bernanke began his second term as Fed Chairman on Feb. 1, 2010. Prior to his\nappointment, he was the Chairman of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers from June\n2005 to January 2006. The Chairman is a Fellow of the Econometric Society and of the\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences. As most of you know, the Chairman has continued to\noffer exceptional leadership for the Federal Reserve during the very trying times of recent\nyears. I really appreciate the Chairman coming to address this conference.\nPlease join me in welcoming Ben Bernanke.\n\nJames Bullard, President and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\n\f"

        "content": "Opening remarks by President James Bullard\n2013 Federal Reserve System Community Development Research Conference\nResilience and Rebuilding for Low-Income Communities: Research to Inform Policy and\nPractice\nWashington, D.C.\nApril 11, 2013\nI am delighted to be here today representing the Federal Reserve System’s Conference of\nPresidents through my chairmanship of the Conference’s Committee on Research, Public\nInformation, and Community Affairs.\nThe Conference of Presidents strongly supports the Federal Reserve System’s outreach and\nresearch efforts in the community development arena. These efforts involve the skills of\nemployees in many different divisions within the Federal Reserve and in many different\nlocations across the U.S.A. An especially important role that the Fed’s Community\nDevelopment function plays is in connecting the nation’s central bank with Main Street\nAmerica. At the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and indeed throughout the Federal Reserve\nSystem, we have heard first-hand how both longer-term changes in the economy and the\nlingering damage from the 2007-2009 recession continue to challenge many households and\nbusinesses.\nThe broad level of performance of the U.S. economy is, of course, vital to the well-being of\nindividual families and local communities. However, it is also clear that even good\nmacroeconomic performance is not a panacea because it does not ensure that all families and\ncommunities are included, or more fully included, in all aspects of the economy. Although\n“economic inclusion” or “financial inclusion” cannot be guaranteed, the Federal Reserve System\ncan be a positive force in providing opportunities and knowledge that can help families and\ncommunities find ways to more fully participate in the economic success of the nation. Better\nresults on inclusion may ultimately create an economy that makes the fullest possible use of its\nrich array of available talent.\nThe Community Development function tries to make progress on this financial inclusion\nobjective by focusing on five areas:\n•\n•\n\nHousehold financial stability;\nNeighborhood revitalization and stabilization;\n\n\f•\n•\n•\n\nSmall-business start-up, growth and sustainability;\nThought leadership to achieve scale, sustainability and impact; and\nCommunication of lessons learned.\n\nThe Fed’s Community Development function is actively engaged in each of these areas. A few\nexamples might include the Kansas City Fed’s “Grow Your Own” initiative to focus on\nopportunities for entrepreneurship in rural America. The San Francisco Fed combined\nthoughtful research and outreach through the publication of “Investing in What Works for\nAmerica’s Communities.” At the St. Louis Fed, we recently launched the Center for Household\nFinancial Stability to research family balance sheets and how those matter for strengthening\nhouseholds and the economy. Several Reserve banks and the Board of Governors have come\ntogether to produce the “Connecting Communities” audio-conference series to address cuttingedge topics among community development practitioners. And many Reserve banks, including\nmy own, have been instrumental in “Bank-On Save-Up” campaigns to offer thousands of\nunbanked Americans nationwide pathways to wealth-building financial services.\nThese examples indicate how the Fed’s Community Development function is helping to address\nthe key issues by convening stakeholders, identifying emerging ideas, and—consistent with my\nacademic bent—conducting primary and applied research.\nThe theme for this conference is “Resilience and Rebuilding.” The 2007-2009 recession\ndisrupted the economic life of the nation. Families and communities have been challenged\nwith job losses, foreclosures, reduced or limited compensation, and high debt. The pressure on\npublic and private safety nets has accordingly been high. These events have tested and\ncontinue to test the resilience of many households and communities. A primary challenge is\nhow to increase this resilience going forward so that a given shock has a lessened adverse\neffect in the future than it had in the past.\nThis conference is not restricted to resilience—it’s also about rebuilding for a brighter future.\nImproved labor market performance and better workforce preparation are central to a better\nfuture for the U.S. economy. Small-business development and sustainability will also be\ncentral; much of the expansion in the labor market comes from this group. Researchers have\nmuch to learn about small businesses and the flows of credit that affect their growth and\ndevelopment.\nAlthough the Fed’s Community Development function at its broadest level is about promoting\ninclusion in the American dream, we do so with careful awareness of policy pitfalls. Not so long\n\n\fago, the American dream was intimately associated with homeownership. In the stark light of\nrecent events, many households found that the reality of homeownership was a nightmare\nrather than something idyllic. Poor public policy undoubtedly contributed to the housing\nbubble and the resulting recession. Due in large part to his research background, my\npredecessor, Bill Poole, foresaw and warned about many of the problems that resulted from\nthe badly overleveraged government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\nResearch can play a major role not only in the design of wise policies, but also in avoiding the\ncontinuation of unwise policies. Many of the papers on the program of this conference focus\non evaluating effectiveness of public policies. Rigorous and detached assessments of policy\nthat combine theory with empirical analysis can yield important inputs for decision makers.\nOn behalf of the Conference of Presidents, let me commend the Atlanta Fed and the Board for\ntheir excellent work in pulling together this conference. Some of you may know that the Board\nof Governors, starting in 1999, has been rotating through the Reserve banks for its partners in\norganizing this important event every other year. St. Louis is up in 2015. Thankfully, our team\nwill be able to build upon the great ideas and lessons provided by others, most especially the\nexcellent example the Board and Atlanta have provided this year.\nThank you and welcome to the 2013 Community Development conference on “Resilience and\nRebuilding.”\n\nJames Bullard, President and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\n\f"

        "content": "Opening remarks by President James Bullard\nThe 2013 Homer Jones Memorial Lecture\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nApril 3, 2013\nWelcome to the 24th annual Homer Jones Memorial Lecture. Each year we host this event to\nhonor the outstanding contributions of Homer Jones, a former senior vice president and\nResearch director of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\nThe Bank began the lecture series after Homer Jones’ death in 1986. The lecture series enjoys\nthe long-lasting support and co-sponsorship of many people and organizations, including the St.\nLouis Gateway Chapter of the National Association for Business Economics, Saint Louis\nUniversity, Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, the University of Missouri at St. Louis\nand Washington University in St. Louis.\nHomer Jones is sometimes described as “Milton Friedman’s teacher” because Jones taught\nFriedman when Friedman was an undergraduate at Rutgers University in the late 1920s and\nearly 1930s.\nThen, as now, it was a tumultuous time for macroeconomists.\nJones had come to Rutgers after studying at the University of Chicago, where he was a student\nof legendary Chicago professor Frank Knight. Also on the Rutgers faculty at the time: a young\nArthur Burns, future Fed chairman.\nAccording to Friedman, Jones was one of the primary influences in Friedman’s choice to study\neconomics, as opposed to mathematics or statistics. In Friedman’s 1976 reminiscence, he says\nJones opened his eyes “to the broader reaches of economics and to the beauties and intricacies\nof economic theory.” 1 The rest, as they say, is history—the two remained friends and\ncolleagues for years afterward.\nIn 1958, Homer Jones joined the staff here at the St. Louis Fed. He is remembered for many\ncontributions at the Bank, but his role in the Bank’s development in monetary research and\nstatistics stands out. The Bank’s research function became a national and international leader\nin the then-rapidly advancing “monetarist” approach to monetary policy. The famous\n1\n\nSee Milton Friedman, 1976, “Homer Jones: A Personal Reminiscence,” Journal of Monetary Economics 2: 433-436.\n\n\fAndersen/Jordan paper published during this era became one of the most widely cited papers\nin all of macroeconomics. 2 And Homer Jones insisted on freely available data to encourage\nresearch on critical economic policy issues.\nToday, the St. Louis Fed is internationally known as an institution that is unparalleled in data\ndissemination. The Bank’s Federal Reserve Economic Data, or FRED, has its genesis in Homer\nJones’ innovative idea to publish monetary data in a form that did not yet exist at the time.\nToday, through FRED, we make more than 61,000 data series available and accessible to\nindividuals and organizations worldwide.\nThe St. Louis Fed’s unwavering commitment to rigorous, independent economic research is the\nkey legacy of Homer Jones that we honor today. Those of us in the Federal Reserve System\nwho believe that the ability to question and re-examine conventional wisdom leads to better\npolicy outcomes owe a great debt to Homer Jones. The Fed’s ability to absorb and be open to\nmultiple viewpoints helps prevent groupthink and leads to superior monetary policy and,\nultimately, to better macroeconomic performance.\nIt is only fitting for us to use the Homer Jones Memorial Lecture to spotlight others who have\nmade a significant impact in the world of academic research, central banking and global\nfinance. It is a pleasure for me to introduce this year’s distinguished speaker, R. Glenn\nHubbard.\nProfessor Hubbard was named dean of the Columbia University Business School in 2004. A\nColumbia faculty member since 1988, he is also the Russell L. Carson Professor of Finance and\nEconomics.\nProfessor Hubbard is affiliated with research programs in monetary economics, public\neconomics, corporate finance and industrial organization at the National Bureau of Economic\nResearch. Additionally, he is a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a\nmember of the International Advisory Board of the MBA Program of Ben-Gurion University.\nProfessor Hubbard’s research spans tax policy, monetary economics, corporate finance and\ninternational finance. In addition to writing more than 100 scholarly articles in economics and\nfinance, Professor Hubbard is the author of two leading textbooks on money and financial\nmarkets and the principles of economics. He is also the co-author of The Aid Trap: Hard Truths\n\n2\n\nSee Leonall C. Andersen and Jerry L. Jordan, 1968, “Monetary and Fiscal Actions: A Test of Their Relative\nImportance in Economic Stabilization,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, November: 11-24.\n\n\fAbout Ending Poverty, and Healthy, Wealthy, and Wise: Five Steps to a Better Health Care\nSystem.\nIn government, Professor Hubbard served as deputy assistant secretary of the U.S. Treasury\nDepartment for Tax Policy (from 1991 to 1993), and he was chairman of the U.S. Council of\nEconomic Advisers under President George W. Bush. While serving as CEA chairman, he also\nchaired the Economic Policy Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and\nDevelopment.\nIn the corporate sector, Professor Hubbard is currently a director of ADP, BlackRock Closed-End\nFunds, KKR Financial Corporation and MetLife. He is a life member of the Council on Foreign\nRelations, a co-chairman of the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation and the Study Group\non Corporate Boards, and a past chairman of the Economic Club of New York.\nPlease join me in welcoming R. Glenn Hubbard.\n\nJames Bullard, President and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\n\f"
