        "content": "Opening remarks by James Bullard, President and CEO\n39th Annual Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Fall Conference\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nOct. 9-10, 2014\nIt is my pleasure to welcome you to the St. Louis Fed 2014 Fall Conference. This is the 39th year\nfor this conference. I want to thank Bill Dupor and Yongseok Shin for putting this very\nprovocative program together. I am looking forward to the stimulating discussion these papers\nare sure to inspire over the next day and a half.\nAt the St. Louis Fed, we have long tried to provide perspectives on whether the policies\nadopted in the past still serve us well today and whether recent developments at the frontier of\nresearch can be fruitfully applied to improve policy. This agenda has become especially\nimportant in the past few years, as the Fed and central banks around the world have struggled\nto devise appropriate policy responses to the current macroeconomic situation.\nIn polite economist society, there has long been a distinction between what is known as\n“frontier” research and what is sometimes called “policy” research. In my view, this has been\nand continues to be a false dichotomy. There is no such distinction: “Policy” and “frontier”\nresearch are two sides of the same coin. We need to understand both how fundamental\nmechanisms in the economy operate as well as how current data can be interpreted in terms of\nfundamental theory.\nIn short, advanced economic theory has to be made more relevant for actual policy, and actual\npolicy has to understand and embrace the sometimes difficult ideas advanced in the theoretical\nworld. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis has long been a leader in supporting research at\nthe intersection of economic theory and economic policy.\nWe are fortunate this year to have an outstanding group of speakers whose research expands\nour understanding of key contemporary issues in macroeconomics.\nThis year’s agenda includes papers on a host of macroeconomic topics, including:\n•\n\nA paper on new ways to measure product market frictions and the role these distortions\nplay in explaining the so-called “labor wedge;” and\n\n\f•\n\nA paper on using disaggregated data to assess the ability of demand stimulus to increase\ninflation.\n\nWe will hear about research on labor markets and education, including:\n•\n•\n•\n•\n\nA paper concerning the Affordable Care Act’s likely effect on household incentives and\nwork-schedule decisions;\nWork on changes in U.S. job-to-job flow patterns following the Great Recession and the\nassociated implications for unemployment;\nA paper on how financial shocks have diminished the ability of labor markets to match\nidle labor with vacancies; and\nResearch on the impact of state-level higher education subsidies on the education and\nmigration decisions of young people.\n\nWe also have a set of papers concerning banking regulation issues, including:\n•\n•\n•\n\nA paper examining circumstances under which mandatory disclosure requirements on\nbanks may be beneficial;\nWork looking at banking sector regulatory reforms that can promote competition and\nlead to greater voluntary transparency; and\nResearch on whether it is ever beneficial to require banks to hold more than their\notherwise-preferred level of government bonds.\n\nI know that these papers and the ideas they contain will contribute importantly to the\nmacroeconomic discussion in the coming years as the papers are eventually published and the\nresults become more widely known in the profession. The St. Louis Fed is proud to provide this\nforum for discussion and analysis of the leading issues of the day.\nLet me again welcome all of you to the St. Louis Fed 2014 Fall Conference. Thanks very much\nfor coming, and now let’s get to work!\n\n\f",

        "content": "Welcoming remarks by James Bullard, President and CEO\nSecond Annual Community Banking in the 21st Century Conference\nThe Federal Reserve System and Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS)\nSt. Louis, Mo.\nSept. 23, 2014\nGood morning, and welcome to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for the second annual\nCommunity Banking Research and Policy Conference, hosted by the Federal Reserve System\nand the Conference of State Bank Supervisors.\nLast year, we had the privilege of hosting a very successful inaugural conference, which\nprovided a unique opportunity to hear and discuss not only cutting-edge research in the\ncommunity banking space, but also to hear the views of community bankers, policymakers and\nregulators regarding pressing issues and the future of community banking. The response of\nattendees was very positive. As a result, the Fed and CSBS unanimously decided to hold the\nconference on an annual basis here in St. Louis, the heartland of community banking.\nCommunity banks are important to the Federal Reserve’s Eighth District. There are more than\n625 community banks in the District (of which 127 are state members) and 522 holding\ncompanies. Two community bankers serve as directors on the board of our head office, and\nseveral community bankers serve on the boards of our branch offices, which are in Little Rock,\nArk., Louisville, Ky., and Memphis, Tenn. As with other Reserve banks, community bankers\nadvise us on a variety of matters through our Community Depository Institutions Advisory\nCouncil. Services flow both ways as we are very involved in providing information and training\nto community banks through a variety of programs. In fact, this fall we will pilot a revitalized\nlearning program for bank directors, based on the popular “Basics for Bank Directors”\ncurriculum written by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.\nOur supervision of community banks is a partnership with state regulators. Here in the Eighth\nDistrict, we have the opportunity to work with Candace Franks from Arkansas (who is also this\nyear’s CSBS chair), Manny Flores from Illinois, Dennis Bassett from Indiana, Charles Vice from\nKentucky, Jerry Wilson from Mississippi, Debra Hardman from Missouri and Greg Gonzales from\nTennessee. I know my colleagues across the Federal Reserve System place great value on the\ninformation and insights they gain from maintaining regular and substantive engagements with\nstate bank commissioners.\n\n\fCommunity banks are important to the economy of the Eighth District, but we all know that\ntheir business model is under pressure. The research presented at the inaugural conference\npushed our understanding of the opportunities and challenges facing community banks.\nLooking at the agenda for the next two days, I have no doubt that this year’s research and panel\ndiscussions will do the same. One important measure of success is the degree to which we\nbroaden the dialogue on community banking and promote further thinking in this sector. We\nhad a significant increase in the number of paper submissions this year, and believe we’ll see\neven more in the upcoming years.\nI’ve always believed that good research leads to good policy. Or, said another way, there cannot\nbe good policy without quality research. I would like to thank all of you who have focused your\nresearch on the community banking industry and look forward to another great conference.\n\n\f",

        "content": "Welcoming remarks by President James Bullard\nResearch Symposium: The Balance Sheets of Younger Americans\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis—The Center for Household Financial Stability\nMay 8-9, 2014\nWelcome, and thank you for joining us for the 2nd annual balance sheet research symposium\nsponsored by the Center for Household Financial Stability, which the St. Louis Fed launched in\nMay of last year.\nThe center is pleased to co-sponsor today’s event with our Research department, where I got\nmy start here at the St. Louis Fed, as well as with the center’s partner, the Center for Social\nDevelopment at Washington University. The Washington University center will offer its own\nwelcome just before the dinner reception at 5:00.\nAs most of you know, our Center for Household Financial Stability is researching family balance\nsheets with the aim of strengthening both families and the economy. Because of the financial\ncrisis and Great Recession, our framework and analysis must now not only consider what\nfamilies save and own, but what they owe as well—their entire balance sheet. Indeed, the\nGreat Recession has been called a “balance sheet recession,” so it’s critical for us to understand\nthe role that balance sheets played in bringing down families and the economy and the role\nthat these balance sheets will play in building them back up.\nToday’s symposium is focused on younger Americans, those in their 20s and 30s, because our\nresearch and the research of others have shown that, compared with middle-aged and older\nAmericans, young people lost the most wealth from the recession and have been, by far, the\nslowest to recover it. Moreover, since 1989, while middle-aged Americans have increased their\nwealth by about two-thirds and older Americans have nearly doubled their wealth, younger\nAmericans have actually lost about 10 percent of their wealth in real terms. Not surprisingly,\nstudies, including some of our own, suggest that younger Americans are not likely to surpass\nthe wealth accumulated by their parents or grandparents—a historical first.\nSo that’s why we’re here—to better understand what’s going on with the balance sheets of\nyounger Americans and to draw out the implications of the research presented here for future\nresearch, community development and public policy.\nSpeaking of public policy, we are taking our findings to Washington. As a follow-up to this\nsymposium, the center—in partnership with the New America Foundation and a group called\nYoung Invincibles—is sponsoring a policy symposium titled “Millennials After the Great\n\n\fRecession” on Oct. 16 and 17 in D.C. We’ll examine not just balance sheets but issues that\nimpact, and are impacted by, balance sheets—unemployment and under-employment,\nworkforce development, work-family balance, cradle to college education, health care and\ntechnology. The challenges are many and significant, and we hope to look at them holistically.\nStay tuned.\nLooking further ahead, to next April, the Federal Reserve System will host its biennial\ncommunity development research conference, this one around the timely theme of economic\nmobility. In partnership with the Fed’s Board of Governors, we will play a leadership role in this\nimportant conference. For further information, please see the Call for Papers in your packets.\nWe hope you’ll consider submitting an abstract or paper.\nOver the next two days, you will be exposed to a thought-provoking lineup of papers and\nspeakers. During a break, you might also want to pick up a copy of the essay from the St. Louis\nFed’s 2012 annual report, which is dedicated to this topic.\nI’m eager to listen and learn, as I’m sure you are. Let’s get started, and thank you again for\njoining us.\nJames Bullard, President and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\n\f",

        "content": "Opening remarks by President James Bullard\nThe 2014 Homer Jones Memorial Lecture\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nApril 2, 2014\nWelcome to the Homer Jones Memorial Lecture.\nThis year, we are in a festive mood—and not just because our hometown St. Louis Cardinals are\nfavorites to repeat as National League champions. We’re also in a festive mood because of\nthree other celebrations.\nFirst, we are celebrating the 250th anniversary of the city of St. Louis, founded in 1764 by Pierre\nLaclède and Auguste Chouteau. Second, the Federal Reserve System celebrates its 100th\nanniversary this year. If you have not done so, I encourage you to visit the Fed’s website at\nwww.federalreservehistory.org to learn more about the nation’s central bank and how it has\nshaped, and was shaped by, key events in our nation’s economic history. The third cause for\ncelebration is that this year is the 25th annual Homer Jones Memorial Lecture—a quarter\ncentury of lectures. The Homer Jones lecture is one of the Bank’s signature events. We hold\nthis lecture each year to honor the lasting contributions of a former Research director of the\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Homer Jones.\nThe St. Louis Fed started the lecture series after Homer Jones’ death in 1986. The lecture series\nenjoys the long-lasting support and co-sponsorship of many people and organizations, including\nthe St. Louis Gateway Chapter of the National Association for Business Economics, Saint Louis\nUniversity, Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, the University of Missouri at St. Louis\nand Washington University in St. Louis.\nHomer Jones is sometimes described as “Milton Friedman’s teacher” because Jones taught\nFriedman when Friedman was an undergraduate at Rutgers University in the early 1930s. Then,\nas now, it was tumultuous times for macroeconomics.\nJones had come to Rutgers after studying at the University of Chicago, where he was a student\nof legendary Chicago professor Frank Knight. Also on the Rutgers faculty at the time: Arthur\nBurns, future Chairman of the Federal Reserve.\nAccording to Friedman, Jones was one of the primary influences in Friedman’s choice to study\neconomics, as opposed to mathematics or statistics. In Friedman’s 1976 reminiscence, he says\nJones opened his eyes “… to the broader reaches of economics and to the beauties and\n\n\fintricacies of economic theory.” 1 The rest, as they say, is history—the two remained friends\nand colleagues for years afterwards.\nIn 1958, Homer Jones joined the staff here at the St. Louis Fed. He is remembered for many\nthings at the Bank, but his role in the Bank’s development as a leader in monetary research and\nstatistics stands out.\nAlthough many talented and dedicated people have greatly expanded upon Homer’s original\nefforts to make the St. Louis Fed a leader in the public dissemination of economic data, it is\ndifficult to imagine that we would have been as successful as we have been were it not for\nHomer Jones’ vision. Bank products like FRED, Mobile FRED, ALFRED, GeoFRED, CASSIDI,\nFRASER and IDEAS are certainly modern inventions, but they all had their genesis in Homer’s\ninnovative efforts to keep the public better informed about its central bank and the U.S.\neconomy. Homer was, in a sense, the original guru of Federal Reserve transparency.\nAnother legacy of Homer Jones is the St. Louis Fed’s unwavering commitment to rigorous,\nindependent research. Homer had a staunch belief in the persuasive power of facts and—it is\nsaid—dogged patience in pressing his views. Those of us in the Federal Reserve System who\nbelieve that the ability to question and re-examine conventional wisdom leads to better policy\noutcomes owe a great debt to Homer Jones. The Fed’s ability to absorb and be open to\nmultiple viewpoints helps prevent groupthink and leads to superior monetary policy and\nultimately to better macroeconomic performance.\nThis year’s speaker is Robert E. Lucas, Jr. He is the John Dewey Distinguished Service Professor\nin Economics at the University of Chicago.\nProfessor Lucas has made fundamental contributions in many areas of macroeconomics,\nincluding business cycle theory, asset pricing, monetary economics, the welfare cost of business\ncycles and the determinants of economic growth. He is a Fellow of the Econometric Society; a\nmember of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; and a member of the National\nAcademy of Sciences.\nIn 1995, Professor Lucas received the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences. The Nobel Committee\ncited his work “… for having developed and applied the hypothesis of rational expectations, and\nthereby having transformed macroeconomic analysis and deepened our understanding of\neconomic policy.”\n\n1\n\nSee Friedman, Milton. “Homer Jones: A Personal Reminiscence.” Journal of Monetary Economics, November\n1976, 2(4), pp. 433-6.\n\n\fIt is perhaps especially fitting that Professor Lucas has agreed to give this particular Homer\nJones lecture, on the 100th anniversary of the Federal Reserve and the 25th anniversary of the\nHomer Jones lecture. His undergraduate major, also at the University of Chicago, was in\nhistory, and he initially began graduate studies in history at the University of California at\nBerkeley. His turn toward economics instead of history was an important one for him, for us\nand for the world. But I know his love of history has not faded over the years.\nPlease join me in welcoming Bob Lucas, who will speak to us today about “Liquidity: Meaning,\nMeasurement, Management.”\nJames Bullard, President and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\n\f",

However, with\nrecent sharp declines following the nancial crisis and\nrecession of 2007-2009, it has suddenly become a salient\ntopic, and one that gets discussed even in non-economic\nsettings. For us macroeconomists, to get one of our\nvariables into kitchen table discussions is really\nexhilarating. We are right up there with Jimmy Fallon! We\nare not used to this, and I am not sure we can comfortably\ntake in all of the excitement.\n\nAt its broadest level, the debate about the labor force\nparticipation rate is a debate about the nature of the U.S.\neconomy over the 4½ years since the end of the recession\nin the summer of 2009. Should we characterize the\neconomy as substantially back to normal following the very\nsevere recession? Or, has little progress really been made,\nso that the economy remains far from its potential? There\nare clear lines of argument on both sides, sometimes\nblurring political boundaries. Some suggest that the\nextraordinary policy response since the end of the\nrecession has been largely ineffectual, perhaps citing the\nvery at employment-to-population ratio since 2009,2 and\nthat their own suggested policy responses would have\nproduced better outcomes. Others emphasize the risk\nassociated with the extraordinary policy response, perhaps\nciting the Fed's now $4.1 trillion balance sheet and the\nnation's relatively high debt-to-GDP ratio. Still others argue\nthat the economy has recovered as well as can be\nexpected in the wake of a major nancial crisis, perhaps\nciting a recovery in real consumption expenditures, an\nimproved housing market, a recovery in equity price\nvaluations, and substantially lower unemployment. This\nlast group might point to the euro area as an example of an\neconomy that has suffered through a double-dip recession\nover the past several years, eventually leading to\nunemployment rates exceeding 12 percent, while the U.S.\navoided this fate.\n\nLabor market performance is at the heart of the debate\nover how to characterize the state of the U.S. economy.\nWhile unemployment in the U.S. was at 10 percent in the\nfall of 2009, it has now declined to 6.6 percent on the latest\n\n\freading and has generally declined much faster than many\nforecasters anticipated. In tandem with this rosy\ndevelopment, however, there has been a substantial\ndecline in labor force participation. Some say that the\ndecline in labor force participation is a bad omen for U.S.\nmacroeconomic performance, with labor market dropouts\nre ecting frustration with the state of the economy. I will\ncall this the \"bad omen\" view. Under this interpretation, the\ndecline in the unemployment rate does not really re ect an\nimproving labor market, and policymakers should look\nelsewhere to measure labor market outcomes. Others,\nhowever, argue that the decline in labor force participation\nsimply re ects changing demographics in the U.S.\neconomy, and that different demographic groups have\ndifferent propensities to participate in market work. As we\nhave different numbers of people in these different\ndemographic groups, we should naturally expect the\naggregate labor force participation rate to change. I will\ncall this the \"demographics\" view. Under this interpretation,\nthe unemployment rate remains about as good an indicator\nof overall labor market health as ever, and recent sharp\ndeclines in the unemployment rate should indeed be taken\nas indicative of an improving economy and an improving\nlabor market.\n\nIn sum, the \"bad omen\" view sees the recent declines in\nlabor force participation as suggestive of a very weak labor\nmarket and discounts the signal coming from recent\nfaster-than-expected declines in unemployment. The\n\"demographics\" view sees recent declines in labor force\nparticipation as more benign and takes the signal coming\nfrom recent faster-than-expected declines in\nunemployment at face value. Since the FOMC has explicitly\ntied monetary policy choices to labor market performance,\nit is of considerable importance which view is more nearly\ncorrect.\n\nIn my talk today, I will offer three perspectives on these\nquestions. First, I will simply summarize the data on labor\nforce participation and give some background on why this\nvariable has suffered in relative obscurity until now.\nSecond, I will summarize my views on some of the\navailable literature concerning labor force participation as\nit exists today. This literature is, in my opinion, generally\nsupportive of the demographics view, although there are\ndifferent strands and many issues are not satisfactorily\nresolved. Third, I will talk about the future of research in\nthis area, which is to move to more sophisticated\napproaches to labor force participation. The more\nsophisticated class of models might be based on the socalled \"home production\" literature. I will not bore you with\nthe details of this approach, but I will point out that future\nprogress in this area has to get more serious about the\nincentives of households to supply labor to market work\n\n\fversus non-market work.\n\nThe Labor Force Participation Rate\n\nThe labor force participation rate is a ratio. In the\nnumerator is the labor force, the sum of all persons\nemployed or unemployed. We think of this group as\nparticipants in the market workplace. Many have jobs, and\nthe rest are looking for jobs. In the denominator is the\ncivilian non-institutional population 16 years of age or\nolder.\n\nThe concept is to divide the population into three groups:\nemployed, unemployed and out of the labor force. This last\ngroup could also be called \"non-participants\" because they\nare neither working nor are they searching for market work.\n\nHere are some round numbers to keep in your head. The\nemployed group is currently on the order of 145 million\npeople. The unemployed group is on the order of 10 million\npeople. And the non-participant group is on the order of 91\nmillion people. The groups are of very different size, and in\nparticular, the non-participant group is large relative to the\nunemployed group. A quirk of this way of organizing the\ndata is that people routinely report moving from nonparticipation to market work without reporting themselves\nas unemployed.3 In other words, at least o cially, they\nwere not working and were not searching for a job but\nnevertheless they ended up working at a job in the next\nreporting period. Evidently, they were not really properly\ncategorized as \"non-participants.\" I have always found this\nto be an unsatisfactory aspect of this method of data\norganization.\n\nMany discussions of contemporary unemployment\nforecasts focus on the extent to which non-participants will\nrejoin the labor market. The late 1990s, for example, was\nan era when many workers seemed to come off the\nsidelines into the workplace because of an exceptionally\nstrong economy. At the St. Louis Fed, we have constructed\nunemployment forecasts in recent years assuming that\nmovements from non-participation to employment would\nbe minimal while unemployment was at relatively high\nlevels. This has served us well, as we have more accurately\npredicted declines in unemployment in the past year than\nmany other forecasters.\n\nIf you know only one aspect of the data on labor force\nparticipation, it should be this: Labor force participation\nused to be relatively low, it rose during the 1970s, 1980s\nand 1990s, peaking in 2000, and it has generally been\n\n\fdeclining since 2000.\n\nFrom 1948 to 1966, the labor force participation rate was\nrelatively low and relatively stable, averaging 59.1 percent.\nThat's substantially lower than today's value of 63 percent.\nIt is important to note that we normally consider the U.S.\neconomy to have performed relatively well during this\nperiod, especially during the long expansion of the 1960s.\nEvidently, low labor force participation does not equate\nwith weak economic growth. Surely this is because the\nfactors driving economic growth are different from the\nfactors driving labor force participation.\n\nAfter about three decades of trending up, the labor force\nparticipation rate peaked in the rst half of 2000 at 67.3\npercent. The rate of increase was slower in the 1990s than\nit was in the 1970s or 1980s. The peak was more than 8\npercentage points higher than the average level during\n1948-1966. Many of the studies of labor force participation\nduring this period focused on the increasing participation\nrates of women. However, whatever effects came from that\nsource, or any other source, the labor force participation\nrate could not continue to increase forever. Households are\nmaking choices about how much labor to supply given\ncurrent wages and work environments, and women newly\njoining the labor force would nd the right level of\nparticipation and stop there.\n\nSince 2000, the labor force participation rate has generally\nbeen declining. The pace of decline was particularly sharp\nduring the recession of 2007-2009, but the participation\nrate also declined steadily in the early 2000s and since the\nend of the recession in mid-2009.\n\nThe general picture, then, is one of a hump shape in U.S.\naggregate labor force participation during the postwar era.\nA satisfactory theory has to account for this hump shape.\nOne way to build such a theory is to appeal to\ndemographics. The nation's workforce had a younger\npro le as the baby boom generation came of age, and will\nhave an older pro le as the baby boom generation\ncontinues to retire. Since different age groups have\ndifferent propensities to participate, this suggests a\npromising avenue to explain the labor force participation\ndata.\n\nI dare say that the demographic explanation is the gut\ninstinct of many macroeconomists. This is why labor force\nparticipation sits in the backseat of many macroeconomic\nmodels. Many, including me, might reason that a good\ndemographic model combined with more women in the\nlabor force during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s could\nexplain a very large fraction of the hump-shaped\n\n\fmovements in aggregate labor force participation over the\npostwar era. If such a model were tted to the data, only a\nsmall amount of variation in the participation rate would\nremain to be explained. That small remaining amount of\nvariation might be attributable to business cycle effects\n(\"cyclical\") or it might just be noise about the fundamental\nhump-shaped trend. Relatively minor cyclical effects on\nlabor force participation would likely be too small to have\nmajor macroeconomic implications given everything else\ngoing on in a macroeconomic model. Consequently, the\nthinking would go, maybe we do not need to worry too\nmuch about the labor force participation rate.\n\nBut this is all just in the heads of macroeconomists. Let me\nnow turn to some of the recent research on labor force\nparticipation to see the extent to which such a theory has\nactually been devised.\n\nRecent Research on Labor Force Participation\n\nLet's start with the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The BLS is,\nof course, very close to the data and it does routinely\nproject labor force participation over the medium term. In\ngeneral, its medium-term forecasts from the mid-2000s\nproved to be too high, meaning its forecast labor force\nparticipation rate was considerably higher than values\nactually observed. More recent medium-term BLS\nforecasts have a declining rate of participation over the\nnext decade or so, all the way down to 61.6 percent in\n2022.4 Recall that today's participation rate is 63 percent,\nso the projection is that the rate would continue to decline\nby around 15 basis points per year. According to BLS\nprojections,5 more than 70 percent of this decline is due to\npure demographic factors; that is, changes in population\nshares by age groups, assuming unchanged participation\nrates for each group.6\n\nTo the extent that this forecast pans out, the basic\ndirection for the labor force participation rate is down, not\nup. Those waiting for an upward swing in labor force\nparticipation as the economy continues to expand will be\ndisappointed, on average, if this forecast comes to pass. I\nread the BLS work as supportive of the demographics\nhypothesis described above.\n\nA recent contribution by Shigeru Fujita (2013) at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia provides some\nadditional insight concerning the decline in aggregate U.S.\nlabor force participation since 2000. Fujita's calculations\nsuggest that about 65 percent of the decline in the\nparticipation rate was due to retirements and disability.\nFujita points out that the empirical evidence suggests\nmembers of these groups have only a small probability of\n\n\freturning to the labor force. If we limit attention only to a\nperiod of relatively high economic stress, such as 2007:Q1\nto 2011:Q2, we do see more of the decline in participation\nattributable to discouraged workers, but even then, this is\nonly about 25 percent, according to Fujita's calculations.\nOver a less stressful period, such as 2012:Q1 to 2013:Q2,\nthe entire decline in the aggregate labor force participation\nrate is attributable to retirements, with no effect at all\ncoming from an increase in discouraged workers. I read\nFujita's contribution as also supportive of the\ndemographics hypothesis.\n\nTroy Davig and José Mustre-del-Río (2013) at the Kansas\nCity Fed provide some analysis of the \"shadow\" labor\nsupply to gain insight into whether this group is likely to\nreturn to the labor force. The shadow group is de ned as\nthose who want a job but are not actively seeking one. The\nauthors document that this group is demographically\nsimilar to the unemployed. They suggest that any impact\non aggregate labor force participation from this group is\nlikely to be small, because ows from this group to\nunemployment are small and less likely to occur as the\nrecovery continues. I read this as also supportive of the\ndemographics view.\n\nA somewhat older paper by Stephanie Aaronson, Bruce\nFallick, Andrew Figura, Jonathan Pingle and William\nWascher, published in 2006, examined the decline in labor\nforce participation following the 2001 recession and tried\nto ascertain how much of the decline at that time was\ncyclical. It is perhaps important to recall that there was an\nearlier debate on declining labor force participation, long\nbefore the deep recession of 2007-2009. The paper\ncontains as part of the analysis an empirical model of the\ntrend labor force participation rate that includes\ndemographic factors. If that trend model is projected\nforward to today from 2006, it predicts nearly exactly the\nlabor force participation rate observed in 2012 and 2013.\nWhat a great piece of out-of-sample forecasting! I read this\nas supportive of the demographics view. This model also\nprojects continued decline in the labor force participation\nrate in the years ahead.\n\nMarianna Kudlyak (2013), at the Richmond Fed, follows up\non the empirical model proposed by Aaronson, et al.\n(2006). Again, the model contains key demographic\ninformation such as age, gender and birth-year cohort\neffects. The model suggests that current aggregate labor\nforce participation rates are not far off from the model's\npredicted trend participation rate. Again, I read this as\nsupportive of the demographic view.7\n\n\fChris Erceg and Andy Levin (2013) have an interesting\nInternational Monetary Fund working paper on the\nintersection between the labor force participation rate and\nmonetary policy. Their paper is a \"thinking outside the box\"\nexercise. In what I have presented so far, there is a certain\ninevitable logic. I said that the data on labor force\nparticipation cry out for an explanation based mostly on\nincreasing labor force participation by women and slowly\nchanging demographics. The existing literature more or\nless provides such an explanation. Erceg and Levin instead\nask whether there are other ways to think about this issue.\nThey present evidence from U.S. states on prime-age\nadults and suggest that the declines in labor force\nparticipation for this particular group were mostly cyclical.\nThe authors then ask how monetary policy might be\nconducted in a world where labor force participation has\nan important cyclical component. They suggest that the\nparticipation decision should get more attention in\nmonetary policy research, a point on which I will agree\nbelow.\n\nI do not nd the evidence on cyclical versus structural\nchanges in labor force participation in Erceg and Levin as\npersuasive as the other empirical work I have reviewed.8\nLabor force participation for prime-age males, for instance,\nhas also been on a secular decline for many years.\nNevertheless, the Erceg and Levin points about how to\nconduct monetary policy in a world with important cyclical\ncomponents in labor force participation are well made.9\n\nSome papers get somewhat higher estimates of the\nfraction of the decline in labor force participation since\n2000 due to cyclical factors. For instance, Daniel Aaronson,\nJonathan Davis and Luojia Hu (2012) use still another\nempirical model with demographic factors included and\nconclude that more than half of the decline in aggregate\nlabor force participation from 2000 to 2011 is due to\ncyclical factors. Willem Van Zandweghe (2012) tries an\nalternative method of decomposing the data from 20072011 and concludes that more than half of the decline is\ncyclical. Julie Hotchkiss and Fernando Rios-Avila (2013)\nhave an approach that emphasizes non-linear factors\nfollowing the severe 2007-2009 recession, and they\nconclude that nearly all of the decline in aggregate labor\nforce participation following the recession was cyclical.\nLeila Bengali, Mary Daly and Rob Valletta (2013) look at the\ncorrelation in the changes in employment and labor force\nparticipation in state-level data to gain insight, concluding\nthat a substantial cyclical component exists in the\nobserved aggregate decline in labor force participation.\n\nI am not necessarily swayed by these alternative\napproaches or results. But it certainly does show that there\nare many ways to cut the data and interpret the ndings.\n\n\fThis leads me to my nal remarks, namely, where should\nthe literature on labor force participation go next?\n\nHome Production as the Future\n\nI have reviewed some interesting economic literature on a\ntopic that has been hot, not just among economists, but\nalso among politicians, media, nancial markets and even\nothers who are not normally close students of\nmacroeconomic developments. Much of the literature I\nhave reviewed uses the same basic idea: Certain\ndemographic groups have a certain propensity to\nparticipate in market work, and one of the main things we\nneed to do as economists is project the number of people\nin each of these groups in order to determine a reasonable\nestimate of the expected (or \"normal\" or \"trend\") labor\nforce participation rate in the U.S. economy. Much of the\nliterature concludes that demographics have contributed\nsubstantially to the observed decline in U.S. labor force\nparticipation since 2000.\n\nStill, the literature as a whole is a bit hollow. Simply saying\nthat people in certain demographic groups tend to make\nthe participation decision one way or another does not do\nenough to analyze the incentives of household labor supply\ndecisions. The more we know about the details of the\nhousehold labor supply choices, including choices to\nparticipate in market work, the better we can predict the\nimpact of policy on labor force participation. Furthermore,\nwe would like these decisions to be part of the\nmacroeconomic model, as Erceg and Levin suggest.10\n\nThere is one strand of the literature that does provide a\nmore complete picture of household incentives to supply\nlabor and participate in labor markets. It is the literature on\nso-called \"home production.\" We do not need to get into the\ndetails here, but the idea is simple. Think of a household as\nthe owner of capital and labor. The household members\ncombine their home capital—refrigerators, ovens,\ndishwashers, cars, houses—with their labor time to\nproduce home goods, such as a trip, a meal or some child\ncare.11 These goods are not acquired in the market and are\nnot counted in GDP, but they matter to the household. The\nhome labor provided does not count in the aggregate\nstatistics on labor supply. The household then has to make\ndecisions about how much time to supply to market work\nversus work at home, including how many members of the\nhousehold should participate in market work.12 If we add\nto a household production model more explicit treatment\nof household retirement decision-making as well as of\ndecisions by younger households to acquire human capital,\nwe would get to a more complete model of the labor force\n\n\fparticipation rate.\n\nThis approach is much more detailed regarding household\ndecision-making than the research I have described today.\nBut the extra complexity comes with a bene t, as the\napproach also allows macroeconomists to better\nunderstand the factors driving household labor supply\ndecisions in terms of actual options inside the home, as\nwell as with respect to the informal labor market. More\ndetailed models in this direction will likely be necessary in\nthe future if we want to move the debate on labor force\nparticipation forward.13\n\nConclusion\n\nMy topic for today has been the aggregate labor force\nparticipation rate in the U.S. While the unemployment rate\nhas declined in recent years, labor force participation has\nalso been declining, perhaps suggesting that\nunemployment is not as reliable an indicator of\nmacroeconomic performance as it may have been in the\npast. I gave three perspectives on labor force participation:\nFirst, I reviewed the data; second, I reviewed the literature;\nand third, I suggested directions for future research.\n\nThe post-WWII data on aggregate U.S. labor force\nparticipation show a hump-shaped pattern. Participation\nrose in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, before peaking in\n2000 and heading into decline up until the present day.\nCurrent BLS projections suggest that this decline will\ncontinue over the coming decade. The rise is often\nattributed in part to the maturing of the baby boom\ngeneration as well as the increase in the number of women\nworking. The decline has often been attributed to the aging\nof the U.S. labor force. A satisfactory model has to account\nfor the rise and fall over many decades. A demographicallybased model would seem to have a good chance of\nsuccess in explaining this data.\n\nI have reviewed some of the available literature on this\ntopic. My view of the literature is that carefully constructed\nempirical models of the hump-shaped trend in the U.S.\nlabor force participation rate do a good job of explaining\nthe data. These models suggest that the current\nparticipation rate is not far from the predicted trend. This\nmeans, in turn, that the cyclical component in labor force\nparticipation is likely to be relatively small. To the extent\nthese models are correct, then the observed\nunemployment rate remains as good an indicator of overall\nlabor market health as it has been historically. In particular,\nthe recent, relatively rapid declines in unemployment can\nbe understood as representing an improving labor market.\nThis is the judgment that should inform monetary policy\n\n\fgoing forward.\n\nThe literature is not completely satisfactory, however. I\nconcluded my talk with a brief discussion of how\nresearchers might do a better job of including household\ndecision-making inside the economic model. This would\nallow us to better understand what motivates or disincents\nlabor force participation. I look forward to seeing research\npushing in this direction in the future.\n\nJames Bullard, President and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\n\nEndnotes\n1\n\nThe views expressed here are my own and do not\nnecessarily re ect the views of others on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.
