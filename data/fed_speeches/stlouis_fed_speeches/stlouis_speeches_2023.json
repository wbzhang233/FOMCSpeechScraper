On July 20, 2023, the Federal Reserve launched FedNow®—a safe, ef�cient\ninstant payments infrastructure that aims to modernize the U.S. payment system. FedNow®\ngives participating �nancial institutions the opportunity to innovate by enabling their\ncustomers to send and receive payments in near real time, any day of the year. How might\nthis new service change business as usual? What are the implications for everyday\nAmerican consumers and businesses? The St. Louis Fed hosted a virtual event exploring\nFedNow® and payments innovation featuring Interim President and CEO Kathy O’Neill\nPaese and Federal Reserve Financial Services Chief Payments Executive Mark Gould.\nA transcript follows this video.\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\nTranscript\nKathy O’Neill Paese: Well, good afternoon. And thank you for joining us for today's\nDialogue with the Fed about FedNow, the new instant payment infrastructure\ndeveloped by the Federal Reserve. My name is Kathy O'Neill Paese. And I'm interim\npresident and CEO here at the St. Louis Fed. And I also serve as the Federal Reserve\nSystem's Treasury product director.\nAnd in case you haven't noticed, I have a little frog in my throat today. So, apologies,\nyou'll have to bear with my squeaky voice today. Joining me here today, from the\nFederal Reserve System, is my colleague Mark Gould. Mark is the chief payments\nexecutive for Federal Reserve Financial Services.\nBefore we begin our discussion, a few words about today's event. It's part of our\nongoing Dialogue with the Fed series, where our goal is always to connect you with\nexperts and information to better understand the economy. Mark, thanks for joining\nus today to talk about FedNow.\nMark Gould: Thanks, Kathy. It's great to be here. I wish I could remotely send you a\ncup of hot tea, because it sounds like you need it.\nO’Neill Paese: I do need it. And I have a little bit of hot tea to help me out on the side.\nSo thank you. And thanks for spending time with us today. Mark, before we get started,\nI just want to mention that any views shared by me here in this discussion are my own\nviews or not those-- they don't necessarily re�ect those of the Fed system. And I'm\ngathering you probably feel the same.\nGould: The same for me, yes, absolutely.\nO’Neill Paese: All right. Well, let's talk a little bit about FedNow. That's the topic of our\nconversation here today. And consumers are increasingly prioritizing getting\npayments 24 by 7 by 365. And so we introduced FedNow back in July of this year. And\nmy question to you is, tell me a little about FedNow and all of our listeners. And is it\ngoing to be business as usual? Or is it a game changer? How do you see FedNow and its\nimpact on the payment system?\nGould: Yeah. Kathy, thanks for the opportunity to be here. And this is one of my\nfavorite things to talk about. So this is a terri�c opportunity. So let me just say maybe a\nfew words about payments at the Fed generally, because while-- if we were to do word\nassociation with just 100 random people on the street about the central bank or the\nFederal Reserve, most people will probably come up with something related to interest\nrates.\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\nThey might come up with something related to in�ation, maybe they'd know Chair\nJerome Powell or something like that. But most people don't understand the central\nbank all that well. So there really are three fundamental functions of the central bank.\nOne, of course, is monetary policy. And that's the thing that people most associate with\nthe central bank.\nThe second is maintaining a safe and sound banking system. So having a process for\nsupervision and regulation that assures that your money in the bank is safe. And then\nthe third leg of the central banking stool is �nancial services. And that's what my role\nis. And in �nancial services, we essentially have a range of services that we offer to\nbanks and credit unions of every shape and size across the country. There are\nthousands of banks in the United States.\nAnd those services range from providing currency and coin directly to institutions to\nenable them to service their customer base, offering check clearing services because\nwhile check writing has declined in the United States, there are still lots and lots of\nchecks written every year. In fact, I think the number I recall last year-- I think in the\nFed system, we cleared about $9 trillion worth of checks.\nWe also provide electronic payment services. One of those is called the automated\nclearing house or ACH for short, because at the Fed we have acronyms for everything.\nAnd ACH is really the service that most people think of as direct deposit or bill\npayment. It's that recurring batch payment, type payment is what ACH is most often\nused for.\nAnd then we have a large dollar service called Fedwire, wire transfers for very large\npayments. Most people tend to make maybe only a handful of these in their lifetime\nrelated to maybe buying a house, making a down payment, or things like that. What\nwas missing is the ability to make a payment instantly. So across that portfolio, there's\ntime involved. And there's a certain amount of friction involved in every single one of\nthese services.\nAnd so we launched, a number of years ago now, a public consultation process to\nreally sense from the industry, from the general public, from consumer groups, a real\nbroad swath of America, is there a need for the Fed to offer an instant payment\nsolution? The answer-- and I'm shortcutting quite a long process. The answer was yes.\nAnd we made the determination to proceed. And that's what led to the work leading up\nto this launch this past July.\nO’Neill Paese: So FedNow really is new. You just described the whole portfolio of the\nFed system from checks and cash, which are not very automated all the way up to the\nlatest and greatest in automation. So what are the implications for everyday\nAmericans and businesses? What changes might they see with FedNow?\nGould: Yeah, so I think one thing that I would urge-- I always have to, when I talk about\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\nthis, I have to temper my excitement and enthusiasm about the future with the reality\nof the present. And so I'm going to try to do my best two-handed response to that,\nKathy.\nAt maturity, when instant payments are ubiquitously available in the United States and\nbroadly used across a range of use cases, I see the potential for instant payments to\ntransform how payments are made in the United States. And I see that in a lot of\ndifferent ways.\nSo for example, if you're just a regular worker, let's say, in a fast food restaurant or a\nservice sector worker. And you're getting paid by the hour. You know, instant payments\n- and this is already happening today by the way in some use cases - instant payments\ncreate the potential for workers to really choose when they want to get paid as opposed\nto waiting till the end of a two-week pay period.\nThat's really important because there's a broad swath of Americans that have worked\nfor, let's say, a week. They're a week away from payday. And they need that emergency\nliquidity. And so today, they might go to a payday lender or something like that. Having\nthe ability to have access to money as you earn it is a capability that I think instant\npayments really enable.\nI think from a business standpoint, it also has the opportunity to just, again, transform\nhow businesses think about liquidity. I think if you're a business person and you think,\nOK, what types of payments would be important for speed, immediacy, and �nality to\nbe important?\nThink about a transaction where goods have been delivered, the service has been\nprovided. And you know and you're waiting for that payment. We have the ability to\nmake that payment just immediately and in seconds. That small business is going to\nbe able to move on to the next job.\nAnd then from a consumer standpoint, again, if you think about-- if I were to open up\nmy banking app on my phone right now, it would show me a balance. But that balance\nis probably not exactly right, because there's money in �ight. There are incoming\ndeposits, there are payments scheduled to be made.\nBut in a world where all payments are instantaneous or close to instantaneous, that\nbalance is going to be an awful lot closer to reality at any moment in time when I look\nat that. I think that's going to be a real enabler for �nancial inclusion in this country as\nwell.\nBecause I think a barrier-- in our research, one of the barriers to people who don't\nhave a bank account, wanting a bank account, is just uncertainty about their ability to\nmaintain a minimum balance and worry that they might incur some fees if they fall\nshort of it. So I see the potential for money to moving instantly to just unlock all kinds\nof potential in the economy. Now, that's the-- I said I was going to do a two-handed.\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\nThat's the optimistic.\nThe present is we've just launched Fed now. And as I mentioned, there are thousands\nof banks in the United States. As of this morning, I think the number I wrote down, I\nthink we have 252 banks on the platform today. So we have a ways to go, but we're\nscaling quickly. And we want that to-- we want to get to a point where every �nancial\ninstitution in the country is connected as quickly as possible. But we recognize that's\ngoing to take us a little bit of time to get there.\nO’Neill Paese: Yeah, absolutely. And I would-- I'm reminded about the ACH. It started\nin the '60s with the Air Force. And look at how long it took us to get A to all electronic\nACH. That took 20 years. And then to get every bank in the country Connected to ACH\ntook another 20. So this is a generational thing, but I know we're ramping hard to try\nand get as many organizations and �nancial institutions onboarded.\nGould: Yeah, our goal is to not take 20 years. That's not something we want to\nreplicate. But to your point, this is the �rst new rail that we've introduced in about 50\nyears. And so that makes it really exciting. I guess, I'm curious, Kathy, from your\nstandpoint. I mean you've been along for the ride, too.\nWell, this is happening in �nancial services. You and I-- I won't say how long we've\nbeen around the Fed system. But you and I have worked together for a very long time.\nYou were part of the group that led to the launch of FedNow. How did it feel like to you\nwatching this come to life?\nO’Neill Paese: Well, really exciting. I mean, I was involved on the front end of all of\nthis, as you said, when we were doing the request for comment and trying to build the\nbusiness case about should we build a new system or not. And that was hard analysis. I\nremember a lot of dif�cult conversations. But obviously, I think we made the right\ndecision.\nGould: I think that's one of the things that I think maybe is underappreciated about\nthe path to get here is that the Fed System-- we move slowly and deliberately. And so\nwe want to make certain that before we do something that there's a real need for it.\nAnd there's support in the country for it. And that was the deliberative process that we\nwent through.\nLaunching it this year, I will tell you, I was in the room with the team that built this.\nAnd we were watching banks that night-- that �rst night we went live, we were\nwatching our big screen. And we could see banks starting to log in. And that was\nexciting. And then we saw the �rst transaction �ow.\nO’Neill Paese: Yeah.\nGould: And I just sitting here today, thinking back to that, I still kinda get goosebumps\nthinking, yeah, we watched the �rst payment �ow over a new rail. And I turned to the\nperson sitting next to me in the room. And I said, we'll never be closed again.\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\nO’Neill Paese: Yes, exactly.\nGould: Because this new system, it's 24/7/365, which is unlike any of our other\npayment platforms.\nO’Neill Paese: That's exactly right. Well, you've outlined and we've talked a little bit\nabout the unique role that the Federal Reserve plays in the payment system, but we're\nnot the only ones in the payment system. And for us to be successful, for the United\nStates really to reap the bene�t of FedNow, we need a lot of partners-- �nancial\ninstitutions, others. So can you talk a little bit about efforts to partner with others in\nindustry to get FedNow launched and to market?\nGould: Yeah, you could not be more right about that, Kathy. I mean, the way that I've\ndescribed this is we've invested in bringing FedNow to the market. And we need\neveryone else in the economy to invest in bringing it to life. And that's absolutely the\ncase.\nSo I'll highlight a few different groups, but I won't be able to possibly capture everyone.\nOne group that I want to give credit to, right off the bat, is our early adopters. We\nstarted with-- there were roughly I think 30 banks live that �rst night. And this group\nof banks, I'm just going to tell you, were so excited. I know of one �nancial institution.\nAnd we move to the next business day, basically, in the middle of the night.\nAnd there was a bank somewhere in the Midwest that invited their entire board of\ndirectors to watch their �rst payments �ow that night. I mean, that's the level of\nexcitement in the industry and among our early adopters that, honestly, we can't\nthank our customers enough for that group of early adopters that were really game to\njump on board right away and provide an innovative solution to their customers.\nThe second group that I would highlight that is absolutely key to our success are all of\nthe core processors, the technology providers that banks around the country rely\nupon. There's a relatively small number of dominant players in this space, but there's\nalso a lot of smaller players in this space. And they're really enabling banks to connect\nto FedNow and to other payment platforms.\nAnd so having their support for FedNow and enabling FedNow connectivity to their\nentire customer base is something that's really key for adoption. In fact, it's one of the\nreasons I'm very bullish about our ability to scale quickly is that many banks in this\ncountry rely on a relatively small group of core processors for that type of basic\nconnection to our payment services.\nI'd highlight a third group. And that's really all of the industry associations and other\ntrade groups that we really leverage to provide education and awareness about what\nFedNow is, how it's different, what you need to think about. We've also invested\nheavily in a lot of online resources that they've generously shared with their\nmembership base. I think that's one of the ways that we can get the word out.\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\nAnd then �nally a group that I've really recently been spending an awful lot more time\nwith is the �ntech community. I think the �ntech community, in many cases, these are\nsmaller companies targeting either speci�c use cases or speci�c opportunities to\nenable banks to connect more quickly or more easily. And I really think that that group\ncould be key, too - not to not just helping to promote connection to FedNow and instant\npayments but also coming up with ways to fully leverage the platform.\nSo, I mentioned this notion of payroll earlier. There's a company I talked with last\nweek, actually, that provides what they call earned wage access. So if you work today,\nyou get paid today platform. And those kinds of ideas, I think, the creative sector of the\neconomy is going to kick in once we reach scale. And I think instant payments, 10\nyears from now, are going to be used in ways that none of us could possibly have\nimagined today.\nAnd the reason that I say that with con�dence is I know that the ACH system, today, is\nbeing used in ways that nobody could have possibly imagined in the late '60s or early\n'70s. And I really believe that same thing will happen with instant payments.\nO’Neill Paese: Oh, I'm sure you're right, absolutely. And we're beginning to see little\nhints of that, aren't we? With some of the banks who are early adopters here.\nThe other one that I know you and I have been working on jointly with is the U.S.\nTreasury. And they were one of the early adopters of FedNow. And conversations\ncontinue with them about possible use cases for them to jump on board. But I think\nthey've expressed their desire to use FedNow going forward in the future. And I know\nyou and I are looking forward to working with them to �gure out what those use cases\nlook like.\nGould: Yeah, I think there's a lot of opportunity there. And again, it's wherever-whether you're the Treasury, a business, a consumer, a nonpro�t, an educational\ninstitution, I mean any entity, anyone who makes or receives a payment in the United\nStates, the question everyone should be asking themselves is, would immediacy\nmatter for this payment? Would having this payment be available in seconds, be\ninstantaneous, and irrevocable, would that be a good thing for our business? And how\ncould we make use of that?\nI think there are just hundreds and thousands of use cases to explore that the-- key\nthough is getting this network built. And so that's one of the reasons that we're so\nfocused right now on getting every �nancial institution in this country connected.\nKathy, it's a little bit like if I was running a shipping company. And you came in and\nyou said, well, I want to mail a package to my friend in Washington D.C. And I said,\nwell, I can get you as far as Minneapolis. That wouldn't really be helpful.\nAnd a payment system is all about scale and network. And we have to have the scale in\norder to build the network effects to really accomplish our goals. Our goal, obviously,\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\nwas to get to market, but our ultimate goal is, as I said earlier, for instant payments to\nbe ubiquitously available and broadly used for a range of use cases all around the\ncountry.\nO’Neill Paese: Yeah. And I know we'll get there in time. It just takes a little bit of time.\nBut we got a couple of questions ahead of time that I want to start lobbing your way\nbecause they're starting to come through as well on the system. So one question, and\nI've heard this a lot, is with the advent of FedNow, is it going to eliminate the need for\npaper money? Are we going to get rid of cash, �nally?\nGould: Well, yeah. So I'm going to give you a quiz, Kathy. So I'm sitting here in my\nof�ce in San Francisco. And I often hear from people, if I'm out and around town here\nor in Silicon Valley. And I talk about what we do. They say, cash? I mean, didn't\neverybody stop using cash 20 years ago, didn't they?\nAnd I'll ask them a simple question: what do you think the amount of currency in\ncirculation is-- U.S. currency in circulation is today versus 10 years ago? Do you think\nit's about the same, up a little, down a little, up a lot, down a lot? You may already know\nthe answer.\nO’Neill Paese: I do. I can't cheat. Why don't you share it?\nGould: Yeah.\nO’Neill Paese: It's up. We know it's up.\nGould: The amount of US currency in circulation is roughly double today what it was\n10 years ago. When I say that in audiences, speaking sessions, or one-on-one\nmeetings, people are universally �abbergasted. And it's one of the reasons when I talk\nabout this portfolio of payment services that we offer, we're really focused on not just\nspeed and not just resilience, but also choice.\nI think one thing that I've learned is that this is a really big and diverse country with\npeople of all backgrounds and businesses of all sizes. And they need different things\nfrom their payment services. And some people are quite reliant on cash still. And cash\nis a store of value, both in this country and in around the world. It's still quite popular.\nSo do I think-- that's a long way of saying, do I think that the FedNow system being\navailable will lead to cash no longer being used? Now, this is the part where we said\nour views. This is my personal view. That's not in our lifetime. I mean cash is-- in\nmany respects, when you think about all of the innovation that we see in the payment\nspace, it's actually trying to replicate what's good about cash.\nCash is immediate. It's �nal. It's anonymous. It works if the power is out. It works if the\npower is on. I mean, it doesn't matter. And it's universally acceptable. I've never had\nsomeone say no to cash. And so all of those qualities that have made it durable across\ntime I think we'll continue for the foreseeable future. What do you think, Kathy?\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\nO’Neill Paese: I absolutely agree. I mean, I don't use a lot of cash. I always have some\nwith me, however. But I do agree that more and more and more money is moving\nelectronically, digitally. And that's de�nitely the direction that we're going to go in.\nSo, Mark, let's go back and just level set a little bit for anybody who may have joined us\nlate about FedNow itself and how does it work. This is something banks can use. It's\nnot an app on our phone. Tell us a little bit about how you originate-- how FedNow\nworks between banks.\nGould: Sure. Yeah, so what FedNow is is basically an infrastructure that enables\nmoney to move between �nancial institutions in seconds. And so what this isn't going\nto look like-- if you're a consumer, you won't see a FedNow app or the Federal Reserve\napp on your phone or something like that. This would be a feature in your mobile\nbanking app.\nAnd I'll give you an example that one of our early adopters is using. So they enabled\nthis on their mobile banking platform. And essentially, when a customer input a\npayment, they input the data to make a payment to another person or company on the\nother side of the country.\nThey implemented a system where it can look up, is that other institution a FedNow\nparticipant? If the answer is, yes, it will ask customer, the consumer, would you like to\nmake this payment instantly or would you like to make it over a two or three day\nperiod of time? And customers universally are wanting to make the payment instantly.\nAnd they're seeing payments �ow back into their account instantly as well.\nAnd so it's going to be a choice for customers to make. And every bank will approach\nthis slightly differently, but that's essentially how it works. There's a lot of technology\nbehind the scenes. This is a cloud-based application that our team built that's\navailable 24/7/365.\nSo Kathy if you want to repay me for that dinner that we had two weeks ago at 2:00 in\nthe morning on Saturday, you could. Again, at maturity, once we have everyone signed\nup on the system and the platform fully enabled, it's a kind of payment that you'd be\nable to make around the clock 24/7/365, which is a completely different equation than\nany of our payment services today.\nO’Neill Paese: That's so true. And to me, the other really unique thing about FedNow is\nthat its credit push. So you're just you're not pulling money out of anybody's account.\nYou're pushing money. And I know that there's implications for fraud there. And\npayment fraud is something that we think about all the time. So what are your\nthoughts about FedNow, and fraud, and how are we thinking about fraud for FedNow\nand controlling it?\nYeah, well, I mean, so fraud-- I mean, fraud exists across the economy, across different\npayment platforms. So it's de�nitely something we spend an awful lot of time thinking\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\nabout. The way that we're approaching it at launch, we enabled a core set of\ncapabilities for banks to implement controls, dollar controls for example.\nAnd we also are requiring every bank on the network to report when they experience a\nfraudulent transaction, which isn't something that we've done in any of our other\nsystems. That will enable us, over time, to build essentially a database of accounts that\nare associated with fraud and that that' bank would be able to block going forward.\nSo we really see this as something that's an all-- it's a whole of industry effort. I think\nbanks need to be investing in fraud prevention and mitigation tools. They absolutely\nare. I think �ntechs are innovating in this space. We will continue evolving our\npractices and capabilities centrally as well. And it's something that we're going to have\nto really focus on.\nI mean, again, going back to cash, the original instant payment, we are innovating on\ncash today new security features to inhibit counterfeiting for the next 10 or 20 years.\nSo that's a focus that likely will never go away.\nO’Neill Paese: Yeah, I can see that. And it will be something-- I mean, we've had to\nlook at fraud in all of our payment rails that we have today and put in place\nmechanisms to control it.\nSo I want to go back and talk a little bit more about �ntechs. You mentioned them\nearlier on. And I know, in some of my conversations, I've heard things like Uber or Lyft\ndrivers being able to get their pay at the end of their shift and be able to buy gas if they\nwant to keep going with FedNow. Have you heard, in any of your discussions with\npeople, more about how the �ntechs might use FedNow?\nGould: Yeah, so we think this early access to wages earned de�nitely is a use case that\nresonated with me, that to your point of an Uber driver getting paid at the end of every\nride or shift as opposed to some other frequency. I think that �ntechs-- because of\ntheir scale and just the nature of those organizations and the talent that they're able to\nrecruit, they're going to be able to move quickly on a particular use case and innovate\naround it.\nAnd when I meet with �ntechs, often, the �rst question I get is, so can we have an\naccount directly with the Fed? And I say, no. That's not how it works in this country. We\nonly provide service directly to �nancial institutions, but that remains-- that still\nleaves a rich set of opportunities for �ntechs to provide enabling capabilities to\n�nancial institutions. And I just think that's a really target rich environment for\n�ntechs.\nAnd it's also an opportunity for banks because if you're a startup, what are you looking\nfor? You're looking for scale. Who has scale? Financial institutions have scale. So it's\nthe opportunity for innovation to meet scale in a way that moves the industry forward.\nO’Neill Paese: Yeah, I can see that. And I know we've been seeing, over time, many\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\ncompanies in �ntechs. You want to put payments embedded in the technology. People\ndon't want to think about payments. You want to get your Uber or Lyft ride, and get out,\nand not have to deal with making a payment. So I think that's weaving it into the fabric\nof what the �ntechs are doing in terms of technology will be really helpful in the\nfuture.\nGould: And I really think that is the future of payments, Kathy. I mean, I gave a talk\nrecently, a few weeks ago, where I made the comment that I think the future of\npayments is going to be both faster and more embedded. When you take an Uber ride\nor you buy something on Amazon, you don't make a purchasing decision and a\npayment decision.\nSo you're not telling the Uber driver where you want to go and then separately making\na payment decision. It's just all part of one uni�ed experience. And I think that that's\nwhere-- I think that's what the future holds for us. And I think that instant payments\ncan be a true enabler of that.\nO’Neill Paese: Totally agree. So I'm getting a couple of questions coming in here I want\nto �y over your way. The �rst one is, can banks join as send and receive or just receive\nonly? What does it take to get started and signed up with FedNow?\nGould: Yeah, so some banks-- so it is possible to join as receive only. And some banks\nare doing that, I think a little bit to get their feet wet and experiment. And I've had\nbankers ask me my opinion, should I join a send? Can I join as a receive only? And I've\nalways said, look, I mean, the key is to join. And if you join as a receive only, you're\ngoing to start gaining experience. And then eventually, you'll start sending.\nI think it's an important point when I'm asked this question. Not every technology\nprovider is fully supporting yet the whole range of processes that we have with\nFedNow. And so I think that's also a bit of a factor. But it's absolutely possible to join as\na receive only bank and then gain experience that I think will be really valuable.\nO’Neill Paese: Yeah, I agree. So another question we've got-- I know you stated this a\nlittle bit earlier, but how many banks do we have live - and I should say �nancial\ninstitution - and do you have any thoughts about what that trajectory might look like\nover the course of the next year or so?\nGould: Yeah, so I think earlier-- I don't remember the number that I said. I think it's\nabout 250. I just got an update this morning, but it's 250, 252, something like that. We\nlaunched with around 30 institutions in July. And so when I've talked with people in\nthe industry about this, what I've heard from them is surprise. They're surprised at\nactually how quickly we've ramped up that number.\nAnd what I've said to them is my goal is for us to keep surprising them. And that's\nwhat-- we're really working hard at this. And obviously, grateful to all of our customers\nwho have signed up. Honestly, that's the real key to success. We need every �nancial\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\ninstitution connected, so that use cases have more economic value, because if we were\nto stop at 250 customers out of the thousands of �nancial institutions that we have in\nthis country, then the instant payments aren't going to take off because they just can't\nreach enough people.\nOne question I get asked when we talk about this a lot is, well, why don't you just\nmandate that everybody join? And that actually is what happens in some other\ncountries. And it has happened. And usually in the countries where you've seen\ninstant payment systems really take off, it's been a government mandate.\nAnd I think in some cases, the number of banks in those countries is quite a lot\nsmaller also. Mandating participation is not something that the Fed has the legal\nauthority to do. And so we're really focused on making the case that every �nancial\ninstitution should join because of the opportunity set available.\nAnd I think over time, competitive issues will enter the game too, where if you're a\nbank that enables immediate access to incoming funds and immediate ability to\ntransfer money, say, between accounts even for yourself-- if I want to move money\nbetween �nancial institutions, be able to do it instantly-- that's going to be a\ncompetitive differentiator at some point for banks that have that capability versus\nbanks that don't offer that capability to their customers.\nThat's why I'm so bullish on our ability to eventually reach ubiquity, just recognizing\nthat's not a two-month, six-month, or 12-month effort. It's really something that will\ntake dedicated focus, and patience, and persistence to achieve.\nO’Neill Paese: Understand and agree. And so I know the Federal Reserve, we just\npublished our prices for �nancial services recently. Can you talk a little bit about the\ncost to join FedNow, what are the fees for transactions?\nGould: Yeah, so for a typical �nancial institution, the cost, there isn't speci�cally a cost\nwith us to join, but there is a cost associated with the electronic connections that we\nmaintain with every �nancial institution. But every �nancial institution already has\nthose connections for other services.\nThat's how we provide things like check clearing services, ACH, Fedwire, and even\ncash services. That's how banks order currency and coin from us. The bulk of the\nimplementation cost is really in �nancial institutions own back rooms. And that's\nbetween them and their technology providers, their core providers, and also\nunderstanding how they need to evolve to support 24/7/365 service.\nThat's a larger change for some institutions than others. And the cost for that really\nvaries. There isn't a universal number for that. And large institutions have more\nsystems that they're interfacing with, too. So there's cost for that as well.\nO’Neill Paese: So another question that we've gotten has to do with the ACH. And you\nmentioned it earlier. We've talked a little bit about will cash go away. So what are the\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\nimplications for ACH? And will the ACH continue to exist �ve or 10 years from now as\nFedNow takes off?\nGould: Well, Kathy, I see a little icon in this that says it's being recorded. And so I live\nin fear that �ve years from now, you're going to pull this out, and replay it, and explain\nto me how I was wrong. So let me just emphasize once again. This is Mark's\nperspective, what I'm about to say. And other people may disagree, including you. So\nI'm going to ask you the same question.\nACH today is really the backbone of the payment system. It is how the vast majority of\npayments are cleared. The vast majority of the dollars clear on the Fedwire system.\nThat's where very, very large systemically important payments clear every single day.\nBut the vast majority of individual payments that affect people like you and me on a\ntypical daily basis, those tend to happen via ACH, which means ACH is deeply\nembedded in the �ber of our �nancial system. So do I see ACH going away anytime\nsoon? No, I do not.\nNow, the cost for ACH is lower than the cost for a FedNow transaction. And so that's\nsomething that I think, over time, we'll need to take into consideration. We need to\nprice our services though to recover our costs. And so that's really the driver of our\npricing decisions.\nNow, having said all of that, I expect-- and in our business case, I guess Kathy as you\nknow, we expect certain payments, certain numbers of ACH payments, certain\nnumber of Fedwire payments, and a certain amount of cash transactions-- we fully\nexpect some of those to transition to FedNow.\nIn fact, that's one of the reasons, a couple of years ago-- we didn't talk about this\nearlier, but it's a couple of years ago-- we made the decision to reorganize �nancial\nservices within the Fed system to put all of our payment services under one uni�ed\numbrella with a single person in charge.\nBecause one of the things that we were a little, that we were thinking about was, we\nwant to encourage payments to �ow to the best channel to meet whatever use case the\noriginator of that payment is seeking to accomplish. In some cases, that might be ACH.\nIn some cases, that might be Fedwire. And in a lot of cases, we think it might be instant\npayments. So we expect to see payments move around between channels. But I will tell\nyou, I also expect the total number of payments to go up signi�cantly.\nNow, this is the most risky prediction that I'm making. This is why I say it's my own\npersonal view. But when payments are easy and they're immediate, easily accessible,\nand ubiquitously you can reach anyone in the country, I think we'll see more payments\nhappen. So, I think the total number of payments will rise, potentially, very\nsigni�cantly. So, we will see transition between legacy payment rails and FedNow, but I\ndo think that the total size of the pie will increase as well. So now, what do you think?\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\nO’Neill Paese: Well, I knew, I know, and I agree with you. I mean, we've often seen a\ncorrelation between GDP and the payment system. And as the economy is strong and\nthere's a lot of growth in the economy, we do see payments increase. I also believe that\nACH is the workhorse of the payment system. And it really-- it's been in place a long\ntime. It works well. And it accomplishes a lot. So I agree with you.\nGould: I remember early in my career, Kathy, you remember this too. We'd see\ncouriers show up at the loading dock unloading giant reels of tape that we would run\nto clear that night's ACH payments. It sounds like 100 years ago, but I don't think I'm\n100 years old. So it can't be that long.\nO’Neill Paese: No, it isn't, but you're right. And that just goes to show you how the ACH\nhas evolved over time. And we've gone to more settlement windows and faster\nsettlement on ACH. So how do you see FedNow evolving? I mean, I know we got to\nmarket in July with our base product. What are some of the other features or things\nthat we're focused on building and delivering in the future?\nGould: Yeah, well, so there's a couple of things that I'd highlight. And I won't share\neverything, but I will say we have a pretty robust roadmap planned for the next �ve\nyears or so. One thing we touched on already and that's fraud. We view this as a place\nwhere that's always going to be-- I would bet that's always going to be on our\ninvestment list-- building, enhancing capabilities, working with our customers to spot\nnew opportunities and to add new capabilities.\nSo that's something that we plan to continually evolve our thinking and our service\nthere. Another that we're actively thinking about is some kind of a directory service\nthat would enable alias-based payments to occur without having to know everybody's\n�nancial information, account number, routing number, and things like that.\nSo those are a couple of things that we're thinking about. But the number one thing\nthat we're focused on as I said is just building the network, building the reach of the\nsystem so that we can then really see more use cases develop and reach more people\nin the country.\nO’Neill Paese: Well, Mark when we were doing the analysis to determine the business\ncase for FedNow, one of the things we looked at was other countries. And where were\ntheir instant payment systems in other countries. So can you talk a little bit about, how\ndoes FedNow �t in the U.S. Central bank with other countries and other instant\npayment systems?\nGould: So this is something, Kathy, as you know, you and I meet with our colleagues\nfrom other central banks periodically around the world. And every country is unique.\nAnd the U.S. is de�nitely unique among countries that are unique. So our �nancial\nsystem is incredibly complex and very decentralized. Thousands and thousands of\n�nancial institutions, as opposed to some countries might have three or �ve or six\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\n�nancial institutions. And so getting to ubiquity is a completely different situation.\nSome countries offer direct access to the payment system to non-�nancial institutions.\nAnd so it's really dif�cult to compare in an apples to apples way around the world. But\nwhat we do try to do is learn from our central bank colleagues in other parts of the\nworld about what works, and what they're seeing, what they're experiencing.\nI think the other thing that I would observe is, not every country is starting from the\nsame place. And so there are a lot of countries in the world where their move to instant\npayments came from a starting point where 90% of transactions were made using\ncash. Our starting point is quite different. As you highlighted earlier, the vast majority\nof money movement in this country already happens digitally.\nSo starting points are different. The structure of the �nancial system is different. And\nas I said earlier, our country's ability to mandate participation also is different. And so\nwhere we've seen this-- where we've seen, in the world, instant payments really take\noff is where it's both mandated and it's broadly available, including to non-bank\nparticipants.\nAnd each country has their own reasons for that. But I think a couple of prominent\nexamples I can think of it was to encourage people to move away from a primarily\ncash-based economy, which is quite different, as I said, from our starting point.\nO’Neill Paese: That's so true. The questions are �ooding in now. So I hope you're\nready. We might go to the lightning round here in just a minute. But can you talk a little\nbit about the difference between other faster payment products and FedNow, we won't\nname names here. But there are person-to-person platforms that people use to settle\nup on dinner and things like that. So how do those products differ from FedNow?\nGould: So those products differ from FedNow in one important respect, in that those\ndo not involve the instantaneous, real-time movement of money from one �nancial\ninstitution to another. You can think of those in a lot of cases, and it's hard to make\ngeneralizations, as an experience where it looks like the money has moved from a user\nexperience standpoint, but the money is actually going to be moving later. And so\nthere's a little bit of intraday risk there.\nAnd obviously, people have determined that that's suf�ciently low to enable these\nthings to happen. In our view, actually moving the money instantaneously is a better\nsolution, but that remains to be seen if everyone in the industry agrees with us. I think\nthe important thing as I said earlier is this is really all about having a range of services\nthat provide choice.\nThis is an incredibly big and super diverse country. I remind myself that every day\nwhen I sit in my of�ce, if I look out the window and I form a conclusion about the world\nor the United States based exclusively on what I see out of this particular window, I will\nbe wrong about everything. And that's true about payments. It's true about really\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\nanything.\nAnd so we really need to make sure that we offer a set of services that is broadly\ninclusive, recognizing that not everyone in the country has a bank account, not\neveryone has full access to the full range of �nancial services available to many others\nin the country. Making sure that we, in our enthusiasm for instantaneous payments,\nthat we not leave anyone behind.\nI think that that's-- I get asked, are checks going away or will we get rid of them? No,\nI've said it, when the whenever the last check is processed in the United States and I\ndon't know when that will be, it'll probably be processed by the Federal Reserve\nbecause we're really trying to provide that backstop to the payment system, with a\nbroadly inclusive set of payment services that meets the needs of this really diverse\ncountry that we have.\nO’Neill Paese: Yeah, I agree. And I know that �nancial inclusion is a major area of\nfocus for us. We want to make sure that all payment rails are available to all people so\nthat we can have �nancial inclusion, people who have equal ability to access the\nsystem. And so I think one of the major enablers of people accessing FedNow are third\nparty processors. And you mentioned before that we've been working with a number\nof them. But can you talk about what they're doing to try and help �nancial institutions\nramp up and come online with FedNow?\nGould: So this group of companies in the United States I would say has been very\nenthusiastic about instant payments. And so as we've worked with them to encourage\nthem to make instant payments available to their customers. We found them to be very\nreceptive, very willing to talk with us, and really working hard.\nI think if there's-- so it's hard to generalize exactly how they make this available to\ntheir customers, but I will say that we found this group of companies to be super, super\nexcited about the potential and very happy to work with us.\nAnd ultimately, like I said, that's how we're going to get to-- that's how we're going to\nget to scale is by making sure that �nancial institutions have access through their\nsystems that they're already operating or through systems they could use to augment\ncapabilities that they have the ability to not just connect but then to fully leverage the\nplatform for innovation on behalf of their customers.\nO’Neill Paese: That's going to be really important because a lot of those smaller banks\nout there just don't have large IT shops and support. So they really rely on those third\nparty processors.\nGould: But I really see that as an opportunity for-- particularly with instant payments\nis the smallest banks in this country. And one of my coworkers reminds me of one\nthat's open twice a week. And it's a very, very, very small institution in this country.\nAnd I always have that institution in mind when I think about, how do they compete?\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\nHow do they compete against the best resourced �nancial institutions in this country\nthat in a lot of cases are probably across the street?\nAnd so that's one of the reasons why FedNow, I think, is important is to enable the\nsmall, medium sized, regional, super regional banks in this country to provide a set of\nservices that's competitive, even though they may lack the full technology back of�ce\nof perhaps some of their larger competitors.\nO’Neill Paese: And we got another question in is, is there a list of the banks that were\nearly adopters? And I believe that's on our website frbservices.org under the FedNow\ntab.\nGould: Yeah, we have a full-- we're trying to keep this-- it's changing a lot as I said, but\nthere's a current list of current �nancial institutions at that website frbservices.org\nunder the FedNow product tab. And yeah, you can click on that and see who's\nparticipating.\nO’Neill Paese: Great. So one other thing I wanted to ask about, and this is something\nwe hear about too, is international payments and how there's friction. You talked about\nfriction in the payment system earlier. So what do you think is the likelihood that at\nsome point in the future FedNow could be used to interconnect with other countries'\ninstant payment systems and have us �gure out that international payments issue\nonce and for all? What do you think?\nGould: Yeah, this is one of the number one questions I'm asked when I speak and\nattend conferences in different parts of the world. And so you said, at any point in the\nfuture, I think is how you phrased your question. Do I see that as a potential at any\npoint in the future? Absolutely, I'll say that unequivocally.\nThe question is, at what point in the future? And so I think the number one thing that\nwe need to focus on right away and immediately is getting the U.S. �nancial system\nconnected. And then we can start to think about other potential linkages. But do I see\nbene�ts to doing this? Absolutely. And particularly with our major trading partners.\nAnd so I think, exactly how we go about that, what the technology is, how we maintain\nstrict compliance and all of that, that's the complex part. I don't see technology\nstanding in the way of that. But there's a lot of other issues that we'll need to work\nthrough. But I absolutely see that potential in the future. But I would be honest that I\ndon't see that in the immediate near future because the �rst thing that we need to do is\nget this country connected up.\nO’Neill Paese: Absolutely. And so we've got sort of an operational question that's come\nover the wires. Can you recall, meaning pull back, a FedNow payment like you can an\nACH payment?\nGould: We've published our operating rules. And so there are some things that can be\ndone in terms of notifying a bank of a payment made in error. But payments are, as I\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\nsaid, they are settled, and immediate, and irrevocable in seconds. And so this is a\nsystem as if I was handing you $100 bill. You might be nice and give it back to me, but\nyou wouldn't be obligated to. And so there are some conditions under which banks can\nwork with one another to identify maybe a payment that was sent in error.\nO’Neill Paese: That's great.\nGould: I have a question for you, Kathy.\nO’Neill Paese: All right, I'm ready.\nGould: What's it like being interim president?\nO’Neill Paese: That's quite a shift from FedNow, but you were interim president in San\nFrancisco too, weren't you?\nGould: I was.\nO’Neill Paese: So you and I both have had the chance to play that role. It's an\ninteresting role and I think one that a lot of people maybe don't fully appreciate and\nunderstand. Obviously, the presidents are most well known for what we do with\nmonetary policy. But we've got banking supervision responsibilities, and operations,\nlike what we've talked here about with FedNow.\nSo it's a lot to be the CEO of the organization, and make sure we're working to support\nthe mission of the Federal Reserve more broadly, while carrying out what is probably\none of our more important jobs on monetary policy. It's been an interesting time to be\nan interim president, I'll just say that.\nGould: Yeah, one of the things that I learned in my experience, which was back in\n2018, I always heard FOMC participants talk about-- they were either a voting member,\nas the votes rotate between banks or they described their participation in the FOMC as\nfully participating in the FOMC. And I didn't really know or fully appreciate what that\nwas until I went to a meeting and actually participated in a couple of meetings.\nAnd what I recognized now is it certainly matters who has a vote, because votes\nde�nitely matter in terms of the speci�c decisions that happen on interest rates. But I\ndidn't fully appreciate how everyone at the table actually has the same level of\nin�uence in terms of what they bring to the conversation. And it's something that you\nreally have to-- I think it might be dif�cult to pick up in the transcripts if you were to\njust read every word in the transcripts for meeting after meeting.\nBut in the meeting, I de�nitely noticed how something that one person says triggers\nsomeone else to either potentially agree or maybe disagree strongly with what that\n�rst person said. And that's something that I learned to really appreciate and didn't\nfully-- probably didn't fully understand before actually having the experience.\nO’Neill Paese: Yeah. And the diversity around the table is interesting and amazing.\nAnd I think it's what helps us support the American people and our economy so well.\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\nSo Mark, we are at 2:25 Central Time. I think it's something much less than that San\nFrancisco time.\nSo we've got �ve more minutes and maybe one more question, if somebody wants to\npull one in from the audience. But I'll ask you one. So you've been through the\ndevelopment of FedNow, and the launch, and getting us ramped up. What surprised\nyou most about the process to bring FedNow to market?\nGould: I think the thing that-- I don't want to say that this surprised me because I knew\nwe could do this, but I think-- maybe the thing that I would say that I'm most pleased\nby, is that I think we surprised the industry with when we launched this. When we\ninitially expressed our intent to launch FedNow, we gave the industry a window, as\nyou'll remember. We said it would be in the 2023 to 2024 timeframe.\nAnd I think that many people, maybe not everyone, but many people in the industry,\nwhen they heard, OK, it's going to be between 2023 and 2024, many people assumed it\nwould be on New Year's Eve 2024 going into 2025. I've asked a couple of people in the\nindustry, what was your guess when you saw that range? One person told me New\nYear's Eve. One person told me 2027. I've gotten a whole bunch of different answers to\nthat question.\nBut I don't know that anybody would have guessed July of 2023. And so I could not be\nmore proud of the team that worked on this. Ken Montgomery, the �rst VP in Boston\nhad been leading a team for the past several years to get this product to market. And\nthey just did a terri�c job of getting it done on time. At a time that I think, like I said, I\nthink we surprised the industry with our ability to get it done in that timeframe.\nBut as we described that, I always have to end with this the notion that, yes, it's in the\nmarket. It's available. And it's not yet ubiquitously available in the United States. And\nthat's why we need every �nancial institution, every business, every nonpro�t, every\nconsumer, really everyone who sends or receives a payment to be thinking about use\ncases where immediacy, �nality, and certainty really matter in sending or receiving a\npayment. Those are the target rich opportunities for instant payments in the future.\nAnd I'm just really excited to see where this all goes.\nO’Neill Paese: Well, thanks, Mark. We're coming to the end of our hour together. And\nso it's time to close. And Mark, thanks so much for talking with me and our audience\nparticipants today about FedNow. And I just ask everybody in the audience to please\nstay connected with us through social media or sign up on our website to be noti�ed\nabout our blogs, newsletters, or other future events. And you'll see more information\nabout that on your screen in just a minute. With that, thanks again for joining us today.\nAnd thanks, Mark, for all of your comments.\nGould: Thanks, Kathy.\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\fFedNow: What You Need to Know\n\n3/29/2024, 10:22 AM\n\n• Open Vault blog: Five Things to Know about FedNow, Right Now\n• Regional Economist: FedNow: A Once-in-a-Generation Payments Innovation for the\nFed\n• FedNow Explorer – Use FedNow Explorer to learn more about instant payments and\nfeatures of the FedNow Service.\nRelated Topics\nFederal Reserve\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/dialogue-with-the-fed/fednow-what-you-need-to-know\n\n\f",

He spoke during a fireside chat with Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari at an\nevent hosted by the Economic Club of Minnesota.\nOn May 3, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, to\n5%-5.25%. Bullard said he thought the move “was a good next step for the committee.” He\nnoted that the FOMC has done a lot in the past year or so. “But we have a lot of inflation in the\nU.S. economy, more than we’ve had since the early 1980s,” he said. “And so I think it’s\nappropriate to put the policy rate at a higher level so we can try to get the inflation problem\nbehind us sooner and get back to the 2% inflation environment that we enjoyed earlier.”\nWhile the U.S. economy always faces risks, Bullard said that a recession is not his base case. “I\nthink the base case is slow growth, probably a somewhat softer labor market and declining\ninflation,” he said. He also noted that the May 5 jobs report was stronger than expected again\nand that the U.S. has a very tight labor market, which will take a while to cool off.\nHe also discussed the recent stresses in the banking sector, the role of Federal Reserve banks\nin supervising banks compared with the role of the Board of Governors, the composition of\nReserve bank boards of directors, and his view on central bank digital currencies.\n\nFOLLOW US\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2023/recent-policy-rate-increase-outlook-for-us-economy\n\n1/2\n\n\f8/2/23, 4:20 PM\n\nBullard Discusses Recent Policy Rate Increase, Outlook for U.S. Economy\n\nSIGN UP FOR EMAIL ALERTS\nReceive updates in your inbox as soon as new content is published on our website\nSIGN UP\nQUICK LINKS\nAbout Us\nLegal Information\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nCareers\nDoing Business with the Fed\nEvents\nFederal Reserve Services\nVisiting the St. Louis Fed\nFederal Banking Regulations\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2023/recent-policy-rate-increase-outlook-for-us-economy\n\n2/2\n\n\f",

He added that regulators are prepared to take\nadditional steps if needed.\nData on the real U.S. economy have generally been stronger than expected, and inflation\nremains too high, Bullard said. He pointed out that FOMC policy has kept market-based\nmeasures of inflation expectations relatively low, which bodes well for disinflation this year.\nContinued appropriate macroprudential policy can contain financial stress, while appropriate\nmonetary policy can continue to put downward pressure on inflation, he said.\nBullard gave the presentation during a three-day visit to El Dorado and Little Rock, Ark.

Bullard noted that the Volcker disinflation was costly but “incredible”—\ninitially, few believed that the Fed was serious about reducing inflation at that time.\nThe current situation for the U.S. seems to fall more closely under the rubric of a “credible\ndisinflation,” Bullard said. “Since modern central banks have more credibility than their\ncounterparts in the 1970s, it appears that the Fed may be able to disinflate in an orderly\nmanner and achieve a relatively soft landing,” he said. The path to the soft landing requires a\ncredible switch of monetary-fiscal policy to the policy regime that existed before the\npandemic, he added.\n\nFOLLOW US\n\nSIGN UP FOR EMAIL ALERTS\nReceive updates in your inbox as soon as new content is published on our website\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2023/credible-and-incredible-disinflations\n\n1/2\n\n\f8/2/23, 4:20 PM\n\nCredible and Incredible Disinflations | St. Louis Fed\n\nSIGN UP\nQUICK LINKS\nAbout Us\nLegal Information\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nCareers\nDoing Business with the Fed\nEvents\nFederal Reserve Services\nVisiting the St. Louis Fed\nFederal Banking Regulations\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2023/credible-and-incredible-disinflations\n\n2/2\n\n\f",

see also Cogley and\nSargent (JME, 2008) in which the large shock twists the priors of a Bayesian learner and\nleads to slow learning over subsequent decades.\n\n8\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nC ORE ARGUMENT\n\nR ELATIVELY\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nFAST CONVERGENCE IN THE\n\nC ALIBRATION\n\nU.S.\n\nL EARNING\n\nC ONCLUSIONS\n\nDATA\n\nI will calibrate the DSGE model used in this paper to U.S. data assuming U.S.\nmacroeconomic policies are in fact the optimal ones the model requires.\nI will then provide prima facie evidence that actual convergence times in U.S.\neconomic data following a “large, unanticipated shock” are an order of magnitude\nshorter than in the earlier literature.\nIn particular, these transition times are measured in quarters rather than years or\ndecades.\n\n9\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nC ORE ARGUMENT\n\nS OCIAL LEARNING\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nC ALIBRATION\n\nL EARNING\n\nC ONCLUSIONS\n\nFOR THE MASSES\n\nThis suggests that in reality, the U.S. economy—despite its complexity—does not\nseem to follow the types of slow adjustment paths emphasized in some of the earlier\nliterature.\nI will suggest that the rapid convergence observed in the U.S. data could occur if\nthere is substantial communciation across the society—social learning as\nimplemented by JA.\nIn the economy I describe, this can occur because there are many millions of agents\nthat have already learned and retained the “DNA” of optimal decision rules for\nconsumption, assets and hours worked before the shock occurred.\nOther agents that may not know these decision rules can learn relatively quickly from\nthose that do.\nI call this phenomenon “social learning for the masses.”\n\n10\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nC ORE ARGUMENT\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nC ALIBRATION\n\nL EARNING\n\nC ONCLUSIONS\n\nEnvironment\n\n11\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nC ORE ARGUMENT\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nC ALIBRATION\n\nL EARNING\n\nC ONCLUSIONS\n\nE NVIRONMENT BASICS\nAt each date t, a new continuum of households enters the economy, makes economic\ndecisions over T + 1 = 241 dates, then exits the economy. (To fix ideas, think of ≈ 1m\nagents per quarterly cohort.)\nThis corresponds to an agent entering the economy as a decision-maker at age 20 and\nexiting as a decision-maker at age 80, inclusive of end points, and making economic\ndecisions at a quarterly frequency.\nResults are perfectly general for the choice of T, with higher values corresponding to\ndecision-making at more frequent intervals.\nThis class of models has a “paper-and-pencil” equilibrium solution, and so it\nprovides a simple benchmark model for heterogeneous-agent macroeconomies with\naggregate shocks.\n\n12\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nC ORE ARGUMENT\n\nR ISKS FACED\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nC ALIBRATION\n\nL EARNING\n\nC ONCLUSIONS\n\nBY HOUSEHOLDS\n\nThere are both aggregate risk and idiosyncratic risk.\nIdiosyncratic risk is borne as a productivity-profile scaling shock as the agent enters\nthe economy, and also in the form of simple i.i.d. unemployment risk at each date.\nMonetary and fiscal policymakers provide a form of insurance against the aggregate\nrisk, and a labor market authority provides unemployment insurance.\nThe idiosyncratic risk borne as the agent enters the economy via the\nproductivity-profile scaling shock is uninsurable.\nA welfare theorem describes the sense in which the equilibrium studied here\nrepresents a first-best allocation of resources.\n\n13\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nC ORE ARGUMENT\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nC ALIBRATION\n\nL EARNING\n\nC ONCLUSIONS\n\nA SSETS\n\nThere are three nominally denominated assets: privately issued debt, publicly issued\ndebt and capital.\nWe think of these as representing U.S. data counterparts: (1) mortgage-backed\nsecurities (MBS), (2) federally issued debt and (3) physical capital, respectively.\nIn the U.S. data, MBS net out, but federally issued debt and physical capital are in\npositive net supply and we target a value of the assets-to-GDP ratio equal to\n1.23 + 3.32 = 4.55.\n\n14\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nC ORE ARGUMENT\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nC ALIBRATION\n\nL EARNING\n\nC ONCLUSIONS\n\nN OMINAL CONTRACTING\n\nThe credit market friction is non-state contingent nominal contracting (NSCNC): All\ndebt contracts are stated in nominal terms, with a stated nominal interest rate, and\nrepayment is not state-contingent.\nThe role of monetary policy is to adjust the price level each period in order to convert\nthese nominal, non-state contingent contracts into real, state-contingent contracts.\n\n15\n\n\fI NTRODUCTION\n\nC ORE ARGUMENT\n\nE NVIRONMENT\n\nC ALIBRATION\n\nL EARNING\n\nC ONCLUSIONS\n\nH OUSEHOLD TYPES\n\nHousehold types: “life cycle” (LC) and “hand-to-mouth” (HTM).\nThe life-cycle households are assigned a hump-shaped productivity profile at the\nbeginning of their life cycle.

He also discussed “bullish\nfactors” for the U.S. economy in 2023 during a Wisconsin Bankers Association virtual event.\nInflation remains well above the Fed’s inflation target but is moderating in response to frontloaded and aggressive monetary policy in 2022, Bullard said.\nThe Fed’s policy—especially the aspect of front-loading policy rate increases—has been the\nright one to get the policy rate to the right level to return inflation to the 2% target on a\nconsistent basis, Bullard said. By front-loading transparently and communicating with\nmarkets, the Fed can avoid 1970s outcomes, when inflation would seem to come down but\nthen rise again to even higher levels, he said.\n“That means that the Fed is going to have to maintain rates at high enough levels to make sure\nthat inflation is moving down and staying down on a consistent basis,” he said.\nBullard said that his preference would be to get to the level of the policy rate that would be\nconsidered sufficiently restrictive as soon as possible and get the benefit of downward\npressure on inflation from the higher policy rate.\nBullard also cited “bullish” factors for the U.S. economy going into 2023, including forecasts of\nabove-trend GDP growth for the fourth quarter of 2022, which would bring GDP for the second\nhalf of 2022 more in line with the strong labor market, he said. Bullard also cited household\nwealth and improved global economic prospects.\nBullard answered questions about the Fed’s quantitative tightening program, supply chain\nconstraints and money supply.\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2023/inflation-and-the-economic-outlook-wba\n\n1/3\n\n\f8/2/23, 4:21 PM\n\nBullard Discusses Inflation and the Economic Outlook | St. Louis Fed\n\nFOLLOW US\n\nSIGN UP FOR EMAIL ALERTS\nReceive updates in your inbox as soon as new content is published on our website\nSIGN UP\nQUICK LINKS\nAbout Us\nLegal Information\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nCareers\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2023/inflation-and-the-economic-outlook-wba\n\n2/3\n\n\f8/2/23, 4:21 PM\n\nBullard Discusses Inflation and the Economic Outlook | St. Louis Fed\n\nDoing Business with the Fed\nEvents\nFederal Reserve Services\nVisiting the St. Louis Fed\nFederal Banking Regulations\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2023/inflation-and-the-economic-outlook-wba\n\n3/3\n\n\f",

Disinflation refers to a decrease in the rate of inflation\ntoward the Fed’s 2% inflation target.\nBullard noted that GDP growth appears to have improved in the second half of 2022 and the\nlabor market performance remains strong. Inflation remains too high but has declined\nrecently, he added.\nWhile the policy rate is not yet in a zone that may be considered sufficiently restrictive, it is\ngetting closer, Bullard said. In addition, front-loaded Fed policy has helped market-based\nmeasures of inflation expectations return to relatively low levels, he continued.\nBullard said that these factors may combine to make 2023 a disinflationary year.\n\nNote: For an updated version of the figure on Slide 23 that has corrected data for the first six\nmonths of 2019, see Bullard’s June 2023 Regional Economist article, “Is Monetary Policy\nSufficiently Restrictive?”\n\nFOLLOW US\n\nSIGN UP FOR EMAIL ALERTS\nReceive updates in your inbox as soon as new content is published on our website\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2023/the-prospects-for-disinflation-in-2023\n\n1/2\n\n\f8/2/23, 4:21 PM\n\nThe Prospects for Disinflation in 2023 | St. Louis Fed\n\nSIGN UP\n\nQUICK LINKS\nAbout Us\nLegal Information\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nCareers\nDoing Business with the Fed\nEvents\nFederal Reserve Services\nVisiting the St. Louis Fed\nFederal Banking Regulations\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/speeches-and-presentations/2023/the-prospects-for-disinflation-in-2023\n\n2/2\n\n\f",
